Alluvium is typically made up of a variety of materials, including fine particles of silt and clay and larger particles of sand and gravel. When this loose alluvial material is deposited or cemented into a lithological unit, or lithified, it is called an alluvial deposit.\n\nThe term \"alluvium\" is not typically used in situations where the formation of the sediment can clearly be attributed to another geologic process that is well described. This includes (but is not limited to): lake sediments (lacustrine), river sediments (fluvial), or glacially-derived sediments (glacial till). Sediments that are formed or deposited in a perennial stream or river are typically not referred to as alluvial.\n\nMost alluvium is geologically Quaternary in age, and is often referred to as \"cover\" because these sediments obscure the underlying bedrock. Most sedimentary material that fills a basin (\"basin fill\") that is not lithified is typically lumped together as \"alluvial\". Alluvium of Pliocene age occurs, for example, in parts of Idaho. Alluvium of late Miocene age occurs, for example, in the valley of the San Joaquin River, California.\n\nAlluvium can contain valuable ores such as gold and platinum and a wide variety of gemstones. Such a concentration of valuable ores is termed a placer deposit.\n"}

Ballybofey-Stranorlar, a census town, had a population of 4,852 in the 2016.\n\nThe town grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries. Ballybofey also plays host to the Twin Towns Festival which takes place annually. The centrepiece of the festival is a parade on the Sunday. The last of these took place on 19 August 2007.\nThere are no schools or churches in the town of Ballybofey itself, with all these amenities lying either across the bridge in Stranorlar or outside the town limits. This is due to laws during plantation times when certain Catholic buildings were not allowed within a specified range of Protestant towns, in this case Stranorlar, though Stranorlar now has both a Roman Catholic and a Church of Ireland church.\nA few miles west of Ballybofey, on the main road to Fintown (the R252), is the Glenmore Estate, located at Welchtown. The estate formerly included Glenmore Lodge, a country house that stood on the opposite, southern bank of the River Finn, near Glenmore Bridge. The house was originally built in the Georgian-style in the mid-to-late-18th-century. It was re-worked for Sir William Styles in the neo-Tudor-style in the early 20th-century.

Officially, it is part of numerous boroughs of Bratislava: Dúbravka, Karlova Ves, Záhorská Bystrica, Vinohrady, Old Town, New Town and Rača. The park is administered by Mestské lesy v Bratislave (Bratislava City Forests), a specialized non-profit organization (). It covers an area of 27.3 km² (10.54 mi²), of which 96% is covered with forests; the rest consists of meadows, water and built-up areas. The Vydrica river originates in the park's territory.\n\nWith its dense network of hiking trails, roads and recreational facilities, Bratislava Forest Park includes many localities popular among visitors, such as \"Železná studienka\" (Little iron well), \"Partizánska lúka\" (Partisan meadow), Koliba and the Kamzík TV Tower. Two-thirds of visitors enter the Bratislava Forest Park through the Červený most area near Patrónka, a major transport junction in the city. The park is served by the Železná studienka Bratislava train station, the public city transport and parking is provided for up to 150 vehicles.\n\nThe area of the Bratislava Forest Park has been inhabited since the paleolithic age by hunter-gatherers. Neolithic age brought the transition to farming marking the beginning of human transformation of the local environment. Iron Age brought the usage of iron and numerous tribe movements, often conducting warfare in the areas they were moving into. Notable ethnic groups from this time include the Celts and the Quadi, the latter had to divide their power with the Roman Empire, whose northern border was the Danube river, just south of the area of today's Bratislava Forest Park. The Romans exploited the natural resources across their border, hunting larger animals and cutting down the primeval forest, transporting the wood on the Danube downstream to their military camps and provinces. The Romans also introduced viticulture into the region that would be famous for its wines later, in the Middle Ages.\n\n\nThe park flora belongs to the Western Carpathians flora (Carpaticum occidentale) and into its part Praecarpaticum slovacum. The area is densely forested, original trees are oak and beech. Other plants include field maple, and elderberry.\n\nAnimals within the park boundaries belong to the Palearctic ecozone. Notable arthropods include Lucanus cervus, Carabus variolosus, rarely also Rosalia alpina, Cerambyx cerdo and Osmoderma eremita. Dragonflies (Odonata) are abundant, notable species include Cordulegaster heros, one of the biggest dragonflies in Slovakia. Its larvae live in the river Vydrica sediments. Notable crustaceans (Crustacea) include the rare Austropotamobius torrentium, also living in the Vydrica.\n\nThere is insufficient data on fish species but they appear to be rather insignificant, bigger species have been artificially introduced for human fishing. Amphibians and reptiles include Salamandra salamandra, Rana temporaria, Bufo bufo and Rana esculenta, rarely also other species such as Hyla arborea, Rana dalmatina, etc. Reptiles include the numerous Anguis fragilis and the much rarer Lacerta agilis, Lacerta viridis, Elaphe longissima, and extremely rarely also Coronella austriaca and Natrix natrix.\n\nThere have been over 50 bird species recognized within the park, including Falco cherrug, Pernis apivorus and Strix aluco. There are 14 identified bat species, the order insectivora includes Sorex araneus, Talpa europaea and Erinaceus europaeus. Rodents include Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Sciurus vulgaris and Glis glis. Larger animals include the numerous Capreolus capreolus, Sus scrofa, Vulpes vulpes, Martes martes, Martes foina, Mustela nivalis and the rare Ovis aries, Dama dama, Cervus elaphus, Meles meles, Lepus europaeus and Lutra lutra (probably only a few individuals). There are no wolves or bears in the park.\n\nThe whole area of the Bratislava Forest Park is an official, active hunting ground. There are seven crops fields for wild animals, three Red deer feeders, 25 Roe deer feeders and 16 hunter's watch towers. There is no hunter's lodge in the park.\n\nHunting is managed by the Bratislava City Forests () using their own hunters and eight hunting dogs. The company also sells hunting tickets. Fishing is managed by the Bratislava subsidiary of the Slovak fisher's union in Žilina ().\n\nBratislava Forest Park is accessible by public transport. \"Železná studienka\" itself can be reached in five minutes by bus No. 43, starting from Patrónka (a major transport junction in Bratislava). Automobile access to the park is limited.\n\nThe last research of the visitors to the Bratislava Forest Park was conducted during June and July 2012 as part of the Urbannatur project, which is part of the Cross-border Cooperation Program Slovakia - Austria 2007-2013, financed by the European Union and the state budget of the Slovak Republic. The research concluded that the most important entrance point into the park is Červený most with 62% total visitors, other entrance points in descending order of use are Koliba and Pekná cesta – Horáreň Krasňany. Cyclists represent 13% of all visitors, most of them - 37% access the park from Potočná Street in Rača.\n\nWhile dogs are allowed entry into the park, visitors are prohibited from letting them off the leash.

{"id": "61130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61130", "title": "Brittany (administrative region)", "text": "Brittany (administrative region)\n\nBrittany (, , ) is one of the 18 regions of France. It is named after the historic and geographic region of Brittany, of which it constitutes 80%. The capital is Rennes.\nBathed by the English Channel to the north and the Bay of Biscay to the south, it is located in the West of France, bordering the Normandy and Pays de la Loire regions. Bro Gozh ma Zadoù is the anthem of Brittany. It is sung to the same tune as that of the national anthem of Wales, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, and has similar words. As a region of France, Brittany has a Regional Council, which was most recently elected in 2015.\n\nThe region of Brittany was created in 1941 on 80% of the territory of traditional Brittany. The remaining 20% is now called the department of Loire-Atlantique, which is included in the region of Pays de la Loire, whose capital, Nantes, was the historical capital of the Duchy of Brittany.\n\nPart of the reason Brittany was split between two present-day regions was to avoid the rivalry between Rennes and Nantes. Although Nantes was the principal capital of the Duchy of Brittany until the sixteenth century, Rennes had been the seat of the Duchy's supreme court of justice between 1560 and 1789. Rennes had also been the administrative capital of the Intendant of Brittany between 1689 and 1789, and Intendances were the most important administrative units of the kingdom of France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As for the provincial States of Brittany, a legislative body which had originally met every two years in a different city of Brittany, that had met in Rennes only between 1728 and 1789, although not in the years 1730, 1758, and 1760. Despite that, the \"Chambre des comptes\" had remained in Nantes until 1789. However, from 1381 until the end of the fifteenth century Vannes (\"Gwened\" in Breton) had served as the administrative capital of the Duchy, remaining the seat of its \"Chambre des comptes\" until the 1490s, and also the seat of the its \"Parlement\" until 1553 and then again between 1675 and 1689.\n\nAlthough there were previous plans to create regions out of the departments, like the Clémentel plan (1919) or the Vichy regionalisation programme (1941), these plans had no effect or else were abolished in 1945. The current French regions date from 1956 and were created by gathering departments together. In Brittany, this led to the creation of the new region of Brittany, which included only four out of the five historical Breton departments. The term \"région\" was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. The first direct elections for regional representatives took place on 16 March 1986.\n\nA majority of the population in administrative Brittany and in Nantes continue to protest against the division of the traditional territory of Brittany, hoping to see the department of Loire-Atlantique reunited with the administrative region of Brittany. However, such a reunification raises other questions: first, what to do with the remainder of the present region of Pays de la Loire, and second, which city should be chosen as the capital of such a reunified Brittany.\n\nBrittany, lying in the northwest corner of France, is one of the great historic provinces of France. The most Atlantic of France's regions, Brittany is proud of its Celtic heritage, that sets it apart from the rest of France. It enjoys a mild climate somewhat warmer though not necessarily drier than the climate of the southwest of England.\nThe name \"Brittany\" derives from the Britons who, back in the Dark Ages, came south across the English Channel to seek refuge from the Anglo Saxon invaders who were pushing them out of a large part of the island of Great Britain.\n\nIn this historic past, other Britons fled to the west and south west of their own island, to Wales and Cornwall; and so it is that today, Brittany shares a historic culture with the other Celtic regions of northwest Europe. Today, the French administrative region of Brittany covers four \"departments\", the Côtes d'Armor (22) in the north, Finistère (29) in the far west, Morbihan (56) in the south, and Ille et Vilaine (35) in the east, bordering on Normandy and the Loire valley area. Another department used to belong to the historic province of Brittany, and this was the Loire Atlantique (44), the area round the city of Nantes which used once to be the Breton capital, but is today no longer in the region. The capital city of the modern Brittany region is Rennes, located in the central eastern part of the region; most of the major lines of communication between Brittany and Paris pass through Rennes, which is a large industrial and university city. Other important cities in the region are Brest, one of the two most important French naval ports, St Malo, an imposing walled city on the north coast, and Vannes, the capital of the Morbihan, with an attractive old town centre. Quimper, the capital of the Finistère, and St. Brieuc, the capital of the Côtes d'Armor, are less important. Lorient, in the Morbihan, was once a major shipping port trading with – as its name suggests – the Orient; but its shipping and shipbuilding industries have largely declined, and like other ports on the south coast of Brittany, is better known today for its yachting and yacht-building industry. It is also the venue for Brittany's annual Interceltiques music and culture festival.\n\nDespite its limited size, Brittany is quite a diverse region; the north and west coasts, open to the force of the North Atlantic, are rugged and rocky, with beautiful sandy coves and beaches. The south coast, facing onto the Bay of Biscay, is flatter, much milder, and graced by a number of large sandy beaches. There are also a lot of inlets on the south coast, such as La Trinité sur Mer, which in the past have been ports and commercial harbours, but today are more popular with yachtsmen and a dwindling fishing industry. The sea here is warmer in summer. The backbone of Brittany is a granite ridge stretching from east to west, peaking in the Monts d'Arrée. But most of inland Brittany is gentle farming country, a region famous for its milk and butter and its early crops.\nAs a holiday region, it is of course Brittany's coasts that attract the greatest number of visitors; the inland regions are on the whole quite tranquil and for this reason have attracted a lot of second-home owners from other parts of France, and from Britain.\nIn cultural terms, Brittany is very distinctive, with its own language and Celtic cultural tradition that set it apart from the rest of France. The Breton language, though not much used in everyday life, and not understood by most of the modern population, has made a comeback in recent years, and is taught in a lot of schools. Celtic traditions are alive or recalled today in Breton folk music, its Celtic festivals, and its many prehistoric monuments.\n\nThe name of Brittany derives from settlers from Great Britain, who fled that island in the wake of the Anglo-Saxon conquest of England between the fifth and seventh centuries. Unlike the rest of France and Brittany, Lower Brittany (roughly, west of a boundary from Saint Brieuc to Vannes) has maintained a distinctly Celtic language, Breton, which is related to Cornish and Welsh. It was the dominant language in Lower, or western, Brittany until the mid-20th century. It has been granted regional language status and revival efforts are underway. In Upper, or eastern, Brittany, the traditional language is Gallo, an Oïl language, which has also received regional recognition and is in the process of being revived.\n\nThe French administration now allows for some Breton or Gallo to be used by the region and its communes, in road signs and names of towns and cities, alongside the official French version. The two regional languages are also taught in some schools, and many folklore associations and clubs are trying to revive them.\n\nBrittany has historically been a stronghold of the Roman Catholic Church, and its rates of church attendance have tended to be considerably higher than the national average. However, in recent years the influence of the church has declined.\n\nThe Region of Brittany is administered by the Regional Council of Brittany.\n\nThe region was a traditionally conservative and Christian democratic region, with the notable exception of the department of Côtes-d'Armor, a longtime stronghold of the political left. However, the whole of Brittany has recently been moving towards the left, in 2004 electing Jean-Yves Le Drian as its first Socialist regional president, and in the 2007 presidential election voting for Socialist Ségolène Royal. The centrist candidate François Bayrou also polled relatively highly in the region and Fougères elected a MoDem deputy to the National Assembly (he has since joined the pro-UMP New Centre). The French Communist Party's support is largely concentrated in the south-west of the Côtes-d'Armor and north-west of Morbihan. The Greens and other environmentalist parties have traditionally been strong in the region, especially in urban areas such as Rennes or Quimper. The region was one of the few which voted \"Yes\" to the European constitution in the 2005 referendum, and Brittany continues, along with Alsace, to be a strongly pro-European region.\n\nThe Socialist Party controls three general councils (Ille-et-Vilaine, Côtes-d'Armor, and Finistère), while the centrist MoDem controls that of Morbihan, in a coalition with the right.\n\nThere are several (Rennes, Brest, Lorient...) serving destinations in Europe. TGV train services link the region with cities such as Paris in 1h27 thanks the LGV Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Lyon, Lille and the largest French cities. TER Bretagne is the regional rail network serving Brittany in order to link the cities of Brittany to each other. OUIBUS coach services link the region with the largest cities in France at low cost. In addition there is Brittany Ferries that take passengers, vehicles and freight to the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Spain and Condor Ferries to the Channel Islands.\n\nBrittany comprises four departments : Morbihan, Finistère, Côtes-d'Armor, Ille-et-Vilaine\n\nThe following table is the list of towns in Brittany with a population over 15,000 inhabitants. Rennes is situated in the east of Brittany, being the capital of the region, the capital of the Ille-et-Vilaine department, as well as the most populous metropolitan area in Brittany with 700,000 inhabitants (2013).\n\nUnlike more easterly areas with greater continental influence, Brittany has a strictly oceanic climate due to direct contact with the Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel. The winds come from the northwest direction which softens the extreme variations of temperature. As it moves further south the weather becomes drier and drier. It is also known for the sudden change of time. The extreme northwest has 10 or less days with temperatures above 25 ° C, which makes heat waves rare, although they can happen of 50 days to the southeast.\n\nThree Breton clubs play in Ligue 1, the top flight of French football: En Avant Guingamp, Stade Rennais and FC Lorient. Another historical club, Stade Brestois, plays in Ligue 2, and Vannes OC plays in the third tier Championnat National. In rugby union, RC Vannes currently plays in the second level, Pro D2.\n\nThe Brest Albatros Hockey is a Brest ice hockey club that play in FFHG Division 1. The plays in LNH Division 1. The Brest Bretagne Handball plays in French Women's Handball Championship. The plays in . The Fortuneo–Vital Concept cycling pro team participate every year at the Tour de France, the Bretagne Classic, and the Route Adélie de Vitré.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24066938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24066938", "title": "Demographics of the European Union", "text": "Demographics of the European Union\n\nThe demographics of the European Union show a highly populated, culturally diverse union of 28 member states.\nAs of 1 January 2018, the population of the EU is about 512.6 million people.\n\nThe most populous member state is Germany, with an estimated 82.8 million people, and the least populous member state is Malta with 0.48 million. Birth rates in the EU are low with the average woman having 1.6 children. The highest birth-rates are found in Ireland with 16.876 births per thousand people per year and France with 13.013 births per thousand people per year. Germany has the lowest birth rate in Europe with 8.221 births per thousand people per year.\n\nThe European Union has a significant number of global cities. It contains 13 of the 60 cities which compose the 2008 Global Cities Index, as well as 16 of the 41 \"alpha\" global cities classified by Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Research Network (including London, Paris, Milan, Amsterdam and Brussels among others). The following is a list of the ten most populous cities, urban areas and urban zones in the European Union, with their population:\n\nThe movement of people within the Union i.e. internal migration, remains limited; it has traditionally followed two patterns:\n\n\nCitizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British migration case is of particular interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the real population of British citizens living in Spain is much higher than Spanish official figures suggest, establishing them at about 1,000,000 and about 800,000 being permanent residents.\n\nAt present, more people immigrate into the European Union than emigrate from it. Immigration is a controversial issue in many member states, including Belgium, Sweden, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, France, and the UK.\n\nIn 2010, 47.3 million people living in the EU, or 9.4% of the total population, had been born outside their resident country. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) had been born outside the EU; 16.0 million (3.2%) had been born in another member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).\n\nSpain in particular receives most of the immigrants coming illegally to Europe from Africa, probably due to its large coastal area and its proximity to and land borders with Morocco at Ceuta and Melilla; African immigrants try to enter the country by boat from Morocco or Senegal or by jumping the border fences. For example, during just the first weekend of September 2006, more than 1,300 illegal immigrants arrived on beaches in the Canary Islands and estimates are that between 50,000 and 70,000 people enter the European Union illegally through Spanish borders or beaches. Border fences have been built at both the Ceuta and Melilla borders in an attempt to stop illegal entrance to the country. Illegal immigration is an issue in Spanish politics, and also a big human rights problem, since many people die during the journey. Spain has been Europe's largest absorber of migrants for the past six years, with its immigrant population increasing fourfold as 2.8 million people have arrived, mostly from Latin America. Spectacular growth in Spain's immigrant population came as the country's economy created more than half of all the new jobs in the European Union between 2001 and 2006.\n\nThe net migration rate for the EU in 2008 was 3.1 per 1,000 inhabitants; this figure is for migration into and out of the European Union, and therefore excludes any internal movements between member states. Annual net migration has varied from 1.5 to 2.0 million people since 2003.\n\nThe EU has significant religious diversity, mirroring its diverse history and culture. The largest religious group professes \nChristianity and accounts for 72% of the EU population, predominantly Roman Catholicism, Protestantism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Several EU nations do not have a Christian majority and for example in Estonia and the Czech Republic the majority have no religious affiliation.\n\nToday, theism is losing prevalence in Europe in favour of atheism and agnosticism, and religion is losing prevalence in favour of secularism. European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance as well as a decline in the number of people professing a religious belief. The 2005 Eurobarometer Poll found that, on average, 52% of the citizens of EU Member States state that they believe there is a God, 27% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 18% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.\n\nA decrease in church membership and church attendance in Europe (especially in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden) has been noted and church attendance (percentage wise of the total population by country) in northern and western Europe is typically in the single digits.\n\nEuropean indigenous (or native) religions are still alive in small and diverse minorities, especially in Scandinavia, Baltic states, Italy and Greece.\n\nThe recent influx of immigrants to the affluent EU nations has brought in various religions of their native homelands, including Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and the Bahá'í Faith. Judaism has had a long history in Europe and has coexisted with the other religions for centuries, despite periods of persecution or genocide by European rulers. Islam too has had a long history in Europe, with Spain and Portugal at one time having a Muslim majority. Large Muslim populations also exist in the Balkans and parts of Eastern Europe, due to a legacy of centuries of Ottoman rule.\n\nThe first official language of each of the 28 Member Countries has the status of an official language of the European Union. In total there are 24, with Irish, Bulgarian and Romanian gaining official language status on 1 January 2007, when the last two countries joined the European Union, and Croatian becoming official in 2013.\n\nEnglish is the most spoken language in the EU, being spoken by around 51% of its population. This high proportion is because 38% of EU citizens speak it as a language other than their mother tongue (i.e. second or foreign language). German is the most spoken first language, spoken by more than 18% of the population.\n\nThe EU faces challenges in its demographic future. Most concerns center around several related issues: an ageing population, growing life expectancy and immigrant flow.\n\nAfter hitting a historical low of 1.47 children born per female, the total fertility rate of the EU started to increase again, to reach a level of 1.60 in 2008. The positive trend was observed in all member states with the exception of Luxembourg, Malta and Portugal. The largest increases over this period were observed in Bulgaria (from 1.23 children per woman in 2003 to 1.57 in 2009), Slovenia (from 1.20 to 1.53), the Czech Republic (from 1.18 to 1.49) and Lithuania (from 1.26 to 1.55). In 2009, the Member States with the highest fertility rates were Ireland (2.06), France (2.00), Sweden (1.94), and the United Kingdom (1.90), all approaching the replacement level of 2.1 children born per female. The lowest rates were observed in Latvia (1.31), Hungary and Portugal (both 1.32) and Germany (1.36). The increasing fertility rate has also been accompanied by an upward trend in the natural increase of the population which is due to the moderate increase of the crude birth rate that reached 10.9 births per 1000 inhabitants in 2008, an increase of 0.3 compared with 2007. The increase was observed in all member countries except Germany. The EU crude death rate remained stable at 9.7 per 1000 inhabitants. The relatively low fertility rate means retirement age workers are not entirely replaced by younger workers joining the workforce. The EU faces a potential future dominated by an ever-increasing population of retired citizens, without enough younger workers to fund (via taxes) retirement programs or other state welfare agendas.\n\nA low fertility rate, without supplement from immigration, also suggests a declining overall EU population, which further suggests economic contraction or even a possible economic crisis. Some media have noted the 'baby crisis' in the EU, some governments have noted the problem, and the UN and other multinational authorities have warned of a possible crisis. At this point however such a decrease in the population of the EU is not observed as the overall natural growth remains positive and the EU continues to attract large numbers of immigrants. In 2010, a breakdown of the population by citizenship showed that there were 20.1 million foreign citizens living in the EU representing 4% of the population.\n\nOver the last 50 years, life expectancy at birth in the EU27 has increased by around 10 years for both women and men, to reach 82.4 years for women and 76.4 years for men in 2008. The life expectancy at birth rose in all Member States, with the largest increases for both women and men recorded in Estonia and Slovenia.\n\nIn 2017, Eurostat released yearly projections up to 2080.\n\nThe table figures below are in thousands.\n\nThere is no precise or universally accepted definition of the terms \"ethnic group\" or \"nationality\". In the context of European ethnography in particular, the terms \"ethnic group\", \"people\" (without nation state), \"nationality\", \"national minority\", \"ethnic minority\", \"linguistic community\", \"linguistic group\" and \"linguistic minority\" are used as mostly synonymous, although preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual countries of Europe.\n\nThe largest groups that account for about 450 million people in the European Union are:\nThe rest are various smaller ethnic groups include Hungary (c. 9.8 million), Austrians (c. 8.8 million), Bulgarians (c. 7.1 million), Flemish, Croats, Slovaks, Silesians, Danes, Finns, Irish, Walloons, Lithuanians, Slovenes, Latvians, Estonians, Russians, Maltese, Moravians, Frisians and Basques.\n\nMore than 5 million ethnic groups \n\nOn current trends European populations will become more ethnically diverse, with the possibility that today's majority ethnic groups will no longer comprise a numerical majority in some countries.\n\nIn 2011, almost a quarter of new EU citizens were Moroccans, Turks, Ecuadorian or Indians. The new citizens in the EU27 in 2011 came mainly from Africa (26% of the total number of citizenships acquired), Asia (23%), non-EU27 Europe (19%), North and South America (17%) or another EU27 Member State (11%). In 2011, the largest groups that acquired citizenship of an EU27 Member State were citizens of Morocco (64 300 persons, of which 55% acquired citizenship of France or Spain), Turkey (48 900, 58% acquired German citizenship), Ecuador (33 700, 95% acquired Spanish citizenship) and India (31 700, 83% acquired British citizenship).\n\nIn 2012, 34.3 million foreign citizens lived in the 27 European Union member states, accounting for 6.8% of the European Union population, of whom 20.5 million were third country nationals (i.e. nationals of non-EU countries). The number of foreign-born (which includes those who have naturalised or are dual nationals) was 48.9 million or 9.7 per cent of the total population.\n\nA total of 8.0 million citizens from European countries outside of the EU-27 were residing in the EU at the beginning of 2012; among these more than half were citizens of Turkey, Albania or Ukraine. The next biggest group was from Africa (24.5%), followed by Asia (22.0%), the Americas (14.2%) and Oceania (0.8%). Romanians (living in another EU Member State) and Turkish citizens made up the biggest groups of non-nationals living in the EU-27 in 2012. There were 4.4 million Romanian citizens living outside of Romania within the EU-27 and 2.3 million Turkish citizens living in the EU-27; each of these two groups of people accounted for 7.0% of all foreigners living in the EU-27 in 2012. The third largest group was Moroccans (1.9 million people, or 5.6% of all foreigners).\n\nApproximately 20 million non-Europeans live in the EU, 4% of the overall population.\n\nAge structure: (2006 est.)\n\nBirth rate: 10.9 births/1,000 population (2008)\n\nDeath rate: 9.7 deaths/1,000 population (2008)\n\nNet migration rate: 3.1 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2008)\n\nMarriage rate: 4.9 marriages/1,000 population (2007)\n\nDivorce rate: 2.0 divorces/1,000 population (2005)\n\nSex ratio: (2006 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate: (2005)\n\nLife expectancy: (2005)\n\nTotal fertility rate: 1.59 children born/woman 2009\n\nLive Births outside marriage: 40% of total live births in 2012\n\n\nThe demographics of the member states of the European Union:\n\n"}

It lies between latitudes 35° and 48° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E.\n\nItaly borders Switzerland (), France (), Austria () and Slovenia (). San Marino () and Vatican city () are enclaves.\n\nIncluding islands, Italy has a coastline of on the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ligurian Sea, Sea of Sardinia and Strait of Sicily.\n\nAlmost 40% of the Italian territory is mountainous, with the Alps as the northern boundary and the Apennine Mountains forming the backbone of the peninsula and extending for . In between the two lies a large plain in the valley of the Po, the largest river in Italy, which flows eastward from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with , and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.\n\nThe Alpine mountain range is linked with the Apennines with the Colle di Cadibona pass in the Ligurian Alps.\n\nWorldwide-known mountains in Italy are Monte Cervino (Matterhorn), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the West Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side of the Alps. The highest peak in Italy is Mont Blanc, at above sea level.\n\nMany elements of the Italian territory are of volcanic origin. Most of the small islands and archipelagos in the south, like Capraia, Ponza, Ischia, Eolie, Ustica and Pantelleria are volcanic islands.\nThere are also active volcanoes: Etna, in Sicily, the largest active volcano in Europe; Vulcano, Stromboli, and Vesuvius, near Naples, the only active volcano on mainland Europe.\n\nMost of Italy's rivers drain either into the Adriatic Sea (like Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, Reno) or into the Tyrrhenian (like Arno, Tiber and Volturno), though the waters from some border municipalities (Livigno in Lombardy, Innichen and Sexten in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol) drain into the Black Sea through the basin of the Drava, a tributary of the Danube, and the waters from the Lago di Lei in Lombardy drain into the North Sea through the basin of the Rhine.\n\n\nIn the north of the country are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is Garda (). Other well known of these subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore (), whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como (), Orta, Lugano, Iseo, Idro.\n\nOther notable lakes in the Italian peninsula are Trasimeno, Bolsena, Bracciano, Vico, Varano and Lesina in Gargano and Omodeo in Sardinia.\n\nItaly includes several islands.

Geologists have identified rock units in the country as much as a quarter-billion years old, although most units date to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, in the past 250 million years. Tunisia has a small but active mining industry and a significant oil and natural gas sector. \n\nThe Tunisian Atlas mountains are a fold and thrust belt between the Rifo-Tellian chain, in the northwest (a part of the Alpine chain) and the Saharan platform in southern Tunisia. The Rifo-Tellian chain is separated from the Atlas Mountains in northern Tunisia by the Tunisian Trough. Sedimentary units in the Tunisian Atlas mountains are divided by three regional faults: the Kasserine Fault, Gafsa Fault and Kaala-Djerda-Sbiba Fault. \n\nThe oldest strata in Tunisia date to the Permian and are located beneath the Jeffara in Jebel Tebaga, in southeastern Tunisia. They are claystone and sandstone, interbedded with limestone containing foraminifera, corals and brachiopod fossils. \n\nThe Triassic period is well preserved and known from outcrops in southern Tunisia and oil well drilling. The lower Triassic is defined by argillite and sandy fluvial, river sequences, overlain by a carbonate unit with palynomorphs indicating a Ladinian, Middle Triassic age. The Upper Triassic is marked by the Messaoudi dolomite, evidence of marine transgression. Lower and Middle Jurassic units are mainly calcareous and marl sediments, although some from the Late Jurassic preserve a deep ocean environment with the fossils of radiolarians. \n\nSouthwest of Jebel Zaghouan, Jurassic strata are for the most part limestones, while to the north and south dolomite sequences shift into Late Cretaceous argillites. Paleosols and beds rich in plant fossils are common in Cretaceous units, which are also well preserved along with the Triassic. \n\nSeveral thousand meters of clay from the Cretaceous fill the Tunisian Trough, laden with ammonite fossils and calpionellids, an extinct species of single celled organisms, as well as sand and calcareous deposits. In central Tunisia, the Meloussi Formation is made up of marine sandstone and carbonates. The Boudinar Formation comprises fluvial sandstones with poor sorting and the Gafsa Group contains clay, sand and carbonation sequences. \n\nAs in other places in Africa, southern Tunisia's Early Cretaceous rocks are part of the Continental Intercalation—which sometimes hold dinosaur bones. Other Cretaceous units include the Zebbaq Formation, with argillite and gypsum units, the Aleg Formation, with clay, marl and limestone, the El Haria Formation and Metlaoui Formation. \n\nThe Souar Formation dates to the end of the Eocene and is made up of marine clay, marl, sand and gypsum. The Fortuna Formation in the Cap Bon area records the Oligocene with sandy limestone and marls, overlain by coarse sandstones and quartz pebbles, although it fades out in southern Tunisia. Other Cenozoic units include the Ain Grab Group and Oum Domil Formation. \n\nQuaternary stratigraphy, from the last 2.5 million years, includes quartz sands, rich in bivalves, as well as oolitic sands. \n\nMining is not a significant industry in Tunisia. The country has a modest amount of phosphate mining and fertilizer production, along with aluminum fluoride, cement and gypsum. The state-owned Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa (CPG) runs all phosphate mining and processing for Tunisia, out of eight open-pit mines near Sehib and Gafsa. Bougrine and Lahdoum in northwestern Tunisia both have mining for lead and zinc. \n\nOil and gas production is the main form of extraction in Tunisia, although proven reserves continue to decline. Most gas is sourced from the El Borma field offshore. Ezzaiua gas field is located off the coast of the tourist area of Djerba Island while the Abiod Formation contains the Maamoura oil field in the Gulf of Hammamet. \n"}

Grünewald stretches through the communes of Niederanven, Steinsel, and Walferdange; the centre of the forest is situated north-east of central Luxembourg City. As a result of its proximity to Luxembourg's capital city, it is a popular destination for tourism, leisure, and hospitality. Within the Grünewald are the sources of the Black Ernz and the White Ernz.\n\nThe Grünewald is held in great affection by the Luxembourgian people, dating as it goes back from the 1900 formation of the country in the 1840s. In 1846, the government proposed selling the 6.69 square kilometres (1650 acres) remaining of the forest to raise money for economic development. The forest was bought by Baron Ziegesar for 530,000 Guilders, and presented to Grand Duke William II. In grand ducal possession, the Grünewald's territory was expanded greatly by a series of acquisitions.\n\nIn 1890, however, the end of the personal union between the Netherlands and Luxembourg meant the owner of the Grünewald was no longer the Luxembourgian sovereign, but Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The following year, Grand Duke Adolphe. bought the forest, by now 24.43 km² (6,037 acres) in size, from the Dutch crown for 2,788,798 francs. Over the following 35 years, the territory was augmented further by a series of separate purchases; during the same period, some areas of the Grünewald was sold off.\n\nDue to financial hardship at the height of the Great Depression, in 1934, Grand Duchess Charlotte sold much of the Grünewald, together with Berg Castle, to the Luxembourgian government. Of the total price tag for the two properties of 40 M francs, 20 M was denoted for the Grünewald; this was seen to have undervalued the forest (as it did the castle), as it had been assessed by the government as being worth 25 M francs. The sale included 7.76 km² (1,920 acres) of the forest, leaving 10 km² (2,500 acres) in the hands of the Grand Duchess. Urban legend has it that Charlotte's husband, Prince Félix, lost the Grünewald at a casino, but this is false; the revenue went to pay for the upkeep of the grand-ducal household, and was not spent on personal consumption, let alone gambling losses.\n\nSince 1934, the size of the Grünewald has fallen, mostly as a result of expansion of Luxembourg City and the construction of numerous roads in and around the area.\n"}

Ranking as the fourth-longest river in the country, it stretches from the Sri Pada Mountain Range to Colombo. It flows through or bordering the Sri Lankan districts of Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Gampaha and Colombo.The kelani also river flows through the capital of Sri Lanka,Colombo and provides 80%of its drinking water.\n\nKelani River has two main tributaries in its upper reaches. These are; (1) Kehelgamu Oya and (2) Maskeli Oya. These two contribute to part of hydro-electric production in Sri Lanka, by housing several major reservoirs, ponds and power stations. Castlereigh Reservoir and Norton Reservoir are constructed across Kehelgamu Oya, while Maskeliya Reservoir, Canyon Reservoir and Laxapana Reservoir are constructed across Maskeli Oya. In its lower reaches, some more tributaries connect to Kelani River out of which the most famous are We Oya at Yatiyanthota, Gurugoda Oya at Ruwanwella and Seethawaka Ganga at Avissawella.\n\nIt supplies approximately 80% of the water used in Colombo. In addition, the river is used for transport, fisheries, sewage disposal, sand mining and for production of hydroelectricity. Through these factors, many people depend on the river for their daily routine in life. Depending on the operation of three reservoirs, the river flow varies from to in the dry seasons, and to during the monsoons. The annual sand extraction from the river is approximately to . From a barge, people dive to the river bed, from where the sand is lifted to the barge in a bucket, and when the barge is full, it is taken to the river bank and unloaded by a separate team. The sand mining causes the river bed to sink by approximately per year. At present, two main concerns in connection with the river are flooding during the monsoon and saline intrusion in the dry season.\n\nIn addition, Kelani River water levels affect the flood risk to Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, to a considerable extent. One reason is that part of the city and suburbs of Colombo lie on the lower flood plain of the river. Exposure of Colombo and upper catchments of Kelani River to the same monsoon, i.e. South West Monsoon, is another reason.\n\nThe problems are related: the saline intrusion is enhanced by the deepening of the river caused by the sand mining. Regulation in order to prevent the saline intrusion can reduce the water quality in other ways, and can increase the flood risk. Sand mining is economically important nationally and to the many involved people.\n\nThe Kelani stream flow was investigated just upstream of Ambatale at Hanwella, analyzing the river discharges from 1973 to 2004 (in million m³/month).\n\nKelani River is connected closely with the Sinhala Buddhist culture of Sri Lanka, especially with the people living on the area identified as Kelani Valley. This is primarily caused by the fact that Kelani River is associated with two of the most venerated Buddhist shrines and pilgrimages, i.e. Sri Pada Mountain and Kelani Raja Maha Viharaya. There are a number of folk poetry that mention Kelani River such as the following:<br>\n1.<br>\nමලේ මලේ ඔය නා මල නෙළා වරෙන්<br>\nඅත්ත බිඳෙයි පය බුරුලෙන් තබා වරෙන්<br>\nකැලණි ගඟේ ඔරු යනවා බලා වරෙන්<br>\nසාදුකාර දී ඔරුවක නැගී වරෙන්<br>\n2.<br>\nමහවැලි කැලණි කලු වලවේ යන ගංගා<br>\nසමනොළ කන්ද මුදුනේ සිට පැන නැංගා<br>\nබෑවුම් තැනිතලා හෙල් අතරින් රිංගා<br>\nමේවා ගලයි මිණි කැට දිය යට හංගා\n\n3. හංස සන්දේශ කරුවා කැළණි ගඟ දුටු අයුරු\nසමනොළ මුදුන සිරිපද ඔබන මගුලට\nනිකසල මහ සඟන ගෙන වඩින මුනිඳුට\nපැහැදුල සුනිල් මිණියෙන් කළ මග ලෙසට\nමනදොළ පිරෙයි ගඟ සිරිසර දුටු තොපට\n\nThe Academy Award-winning \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" was filmed on the Kelani River near Kitulgala, although nothing remains now except the concrete foundations for the bridge (and, supposedly, the submerged train cars that plunged into the river in the climactic scene).\n\nThe following table shows the major bridges over Kelani River:\n"}

However, implementing an MBI also commonly requires some form of regulation. Market based instruments can be implemented in a systematic manner, across an economy or region, across economic sectors, or by environmental medium (e.g. water). Individual MBIs are instances of environmental pricing reform.\n\nAccording to Kete (2002), \"policymaking appears to be in transition towards more market-oriented instruments, but it remains an open-ended experiment whether we shall successfully execute a long-term s\"ocial\" transition that involves the private sector and the state in new relationships implied by the pollution prevention and economic instruments rhetoric.\"\n\nFor example, although the use of new environmental policy instruments only grew significantly in Britain in the 1990s, David Lloyd George may have introduced the first market-based instrument of environmental policy in the UK when a Fuel tax was levied in 1909 during his ministry.\n\nA market-based transferable permit sets a maximum level of pollution (a 'cap'), but is likely to achieve that level at a lower cost than other means, and, importantly, may reduce below that level due to technological innovation.\n\nWhen using a transferable-permit system, it is very important to accurately measure the initial problem and also how it changes over time. This is because it can be expensive to make adjustments (either in terms of compensation or through undermining the property rights of the permits). Permits' effectiveness can also be affected by things like market liquidity, the quality of the property right, and existing market power. Another important aspect of transferable permits is whether they are auctioned or allocated via grandfathering.\n\nAn argument against permits is that formalising emission rights is effectively giving people a license to pollute, which is believed to be socially unacceptable. However, although valuing adverse environmental impacts may be controversial, the acceptable cost of preventing these impacts is implicit in all regulatory decisions.\n\nA market-based tax approach determines a maximum cost for control measures. This gives polluters an incentive to reduce pollution at a lower cost than the tax rate. There is no cap; the quantity of pollution reduced depends on the chosen tax rate.\n\nA tax approach is more flexible than permits, as the tax rate can be adjusted until it creates the most effective incentive. Taxes also have lower compliance costs than permits. However, taxes are less effective at achieving reductions in target quantities than permits. Using a tax potentially enables a double dividend, by using the revenue generated by the tax to reduce other distortionary taxes through revenue recycling. There can also be conflict between objectives with a tax: less pollution means less revenue.\n\nAn alternate approach to environmental regulation is a command and control approach. This is much more prescriptive than market-based instruments. Command and control regulatory instruments include emissions standards, process/equipment specifications, limits on input/output/discharges, requirements to disclose information, and audits. Command and control approaches have been criticised for restricting technology, as there is no incentive for firms to innovate.\n\nMarket-based instruments do not prescribe that firms use specific technologies, or that all firms reduce their emissions by the same amount, which allows firms greater flexibility in their approaches to pollution management. However, command and control approaches may be beneficial as a starting point, when regulators are faced with a significant problem yet have too little information to support a market-based instrument. Command and control approaches can also be preferred when regulators are faced with a thin market, where the limited potential trading pools mean the gains of a market-based instrument would not exceed the costs (a key requirement for a successful market-based approach).\n\nMarket-based instruments may also be inappropriate in dealing with emissions with local impacts, as trading would be restricted to within that region. They may also be inappropriate for emissions with global impacts, as international cooperation may be difficult to attain.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, environmental advocates initially opposed the use of market-based instruments except under very constrained conditions. However, after the successful use of freely traded credits in the lead phasedown in the U.S. environmental advocates recognized that trading markets has benefits for the environment as well. Thereafter, beginning with the proposal of the acid rain allowance market, environmental advocates have supported the use of trading in a variety of contexts.\n\n"}

First described by the English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh during his 1595 expedition, its summit area is bounded on all sides by cliffs rising . The mountain also serves as the tripoint of Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil.\n\nMount Roraima lies on the Guiana Shield in the southeastern corner of Venezuela's Canaima National Park forming the highest peak of Guyana's Highland Range. \n\nThe highest point in Guyana and the highest point of the Brazilian state of Roraima lie on the plateau, but Venezuela and Brazil have higher mountains elsewhere. The triple border point is at , but the mountain's highest point is Laberintos del Norte.\n\nMany of the species found on Roraima are unique to the tepui plateaus with two local endemic plants found on Roraima summit. Plants such as pitcher plants (\"Heliamphora\"), \"Campanula\" (a bellflower), and the rare \"Rapatea\" heather are commonly found on the escarpment and summit. It rains almost every day of the year. Almost the entire surface of the summit is bare sandstone, with only a few bushes (\"Bonnetia roraimœ\") and algae present. Low scanty and bristling vegetation is also found in the small, sandy marshes that intersperse the rocky summit. Most of the nutrients that are present in the soil are washed away by torrents that cascade over the edge, forming some of the highest waterfalls in the world.\nThere are multiple examples of unique fauna atop Mount Roraima. \"Oreophrynella quelchii\", commonly called the Roraima Bush Toad, is a diurnal toad usually found on open rock surfaces and shrubland. It is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae and breeds by direct development. The species is currently listed as vulnerable and there is a need for increased education among tourists to make them aware of the importance of not handling these animals in the wild. Close population monitoring is also required, particularly since this species is known only from a single location. The species is protected in Monumento Natural Los Tepuyes in Venezuela, and Parque Nacional Monte Roraima in Brazil.\n\nSince long before the arrival of European explorers, the mountain has held a special significance for the indigenous people of the region, and it is central to many of their myths and legends. The Pemon and Kapon natives of the Gran Sabana see Mount Roraima as the stump of a mighty tree that once held all the fruits and tuberous vegetables in the world. Felled by Makunaima, their mythical trickster, the tree crashed to the ground, unleashing a terrible flood. \"Roroi\" in the Pemon language means blue-green and \"ma\" means great. It is also said to have inspired Paradise Falls from the Pixar film \"Up\". \n\nAlthough the steep sides of the plateau make it difficult to access, it was the first recorded major tepui to be climbed: Sir Everard im Thurn walked up a forested ramp in December 1884 to scale the plateau. This is the same route hikers take today. A report by the noted South American researcher Robert Schomburgk inspired the Scottish author Arthur Conan Doyle to write his novel The Lost World about the discovery of a living prehistoric world full of dinosaurs and other primordial creatures.\n\nThe only non-technical route to the top is the Paraitepui route from Venezuela; any other approach will involve climbing gear. Mount Roraima has been climbed on a few occasions from the Guyana and Brazil sides, but as the mountain is entirely bordered on both these sides by enormous sheer cliffs that include high overhanging (negative-inclination) stretches, these are extremely difficult and technical rock climbing routes. Such climbs would also require difficult authorizations for entering restricted-access national parks in the respective countries.\n\nIn Brazil the Monte Roraima National Park lies within the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Territory, and is not open to the public without permission.\n\nThe 2013 Austrian documentary \"Jäger des Augenblicks - Ein Abenteuer am Mount Roraima (Moment Hunters - An Adventure on Mount Roraima)\" shows rock climbers Kurt Albert, Holger Heuber, and Stefan Glowacz climbing to the top of Mount Roraima from the Guyana side. Similarly, in 2010 Brazilian climbers Eliseu Frechou, Fernando Leal and Márcio Bruno opened a new route on the Guyanese side, climbing to the top in 12 days of a very difficult vertical wall climb. They called the new route \"Guerra de Luz e Trevas\" (Portuguese for \"War of Light and Darkness\") and classed it as 6° VIIa A3 J4. A 28-minute Vimeo video called \"Dias de Tempestade (Days of Storm)\" is available documenting their climb (English subtitles, audio in Portuguese).\n\n"}

After several trips, Keyser participated as the chief navigator and head of the steersmen for the first Dutch voyage to the East Indies (the \"Eerste Schipvaart\"), which left Texel with four ships on 2 April 1595 under Cornelis de Houtman. He had been trained by cartographer Petrus Plancius in mathematics and astronomy. Plancius, a key promoter to the Dutch East Indies expeditions, had instructed Keyser to map the skies in the southern hemisphere, which were largely uncharted at the time. When the fleet finally was able to obtain fresh supplies at Madagascar on 13 September, 71 of the 248 sailors had died, most of scurvy. The surviving crew stayed for several months on the island, to recover and make repairs, at which point Keyser probably made most of his celestial observations. He was aided in this by Frederick de Houtman and Vechter Willemsz. After leaving Madagascar, it took another four months (February to June 1596) for the ships to reach Sumatra and finally Bantam on Java. Trade negotiations went sour, perhaps caused by Portuguese instigators, perhaps by inexperience, and the crew was forced to find drinking water and other supplies on Sumatra across the Sunda Strait. Keyser apparently died during this crossing. On 14 August 1597, 81 survivors made it back to Texel, including de Houtman, who probably delivered Keyser's observations to Plancius.\n\nFrom the observations of the expedition, Plancius created a celestial globe in late 1597, published by Jodocus Hondius, showing twelve new constellations of the southern sky that have become accepted among the standard constellations codified by modern astronomers. The majority were named after various animals that 16th century explorers had encountered (e.g. Bird of Paradise, Chameleon, Toucan, Flying Fish). Willem Janszoon Blaeu copied these constellations on a 1602 globe and created a new globe in 1603 incorporating further observations made by de Houtman on a second voyage to the East Indies. Johann Bayer included these new southern constellations in his influential 1603 star atlas \"Uranometria\", crediting them to \"Petrus Theodori\" (Pieter Keyser), but not acknowledging their earlier publication. Bayer is therefore often mistakenly credited for introducing them.\n\nKeyser is commemorated by minor planet (10655) Pietkeyser.\n\n"}
{"id": "43507984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43507984", "title": "Republic of Pirates", "text": "Republic of Pirates\n\nThe Republic of Pirates is the nomenclature for the base or stronghold of a loose confederacy run by privateers-turned-pirates in Nassau on New Providence island in the Bahamas for about eleven years from 1706 until 1718. Although not a state or republic in a formal sense, it was governed by its own informal 'Code of Conduct'. The activities of the pirates caused havoc with trade and shipping in the West Indies, until governor Woodes Rogers reached Nassau in 1718 and restored the British control.\n\nThe era of piracy in the Bahamas began in 1696, when the privateer Henry Every brought his ship the \"Fancy\" loaded with loot from plundering Indian trade ships into Nassau harbour. Every bribed the governor Nicholas Trott with gold and silver, and with the \"Fancy\" itself, still loaded with 50 tons of elephant tusks and 100 barrels of gunpowder. This established Nassau as a base where pirates could operate safely, although various governors regularly made a show of suppressing piracy. Although the governors were still legally in charge, the pirates became increasingly powerful.\n\nThe era of true pirate control occurred when a combined Franco-Spanish Fleet attacked Nassau in 1703 and again in 1706; the island was effectively abandoned by many of its settlers and left without any English government presence. Nassau was then taken over by English privateers, who became completely lawless pirates over time. The pirates attacked French and Spanish ships, while the French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several more times. Pirates established themselves in Nassau, and essentially established their own republic with its own governors. By 1713 the War of the Spanish Succession was over, but many British privateers were slow to get the news, or reluctant to accept it, and so slipped into piracy. This led to large numbers of unemployed privateers making their way to New Providence to join the republic and swell its numbers. The republic was dominated by two famous pirates who were bitter rivals – Benjamin Hornigold and Henry Jennings. Hornigold was mentor to pirates such as the famous Edward Teach, known as \"Blackbeard\", along with Sam Bellamy and Stede Bonnet. Jennings was mentor to Charles Vane, 'Calico' Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny, and Mary Read. Despite their rivalries, the pirates formed themselves into the 'Flying Gang' and quickly became infamous for their exploits. The Governor of Bermuda stated that there were over 1000 pirates in Nassau at that time and that they outnumbered the mere hundred of inhabitants in the town. Blackbeard was later voted by the pirates of Nassau to be their Magistrate, to be in command of their republic and enforce law and order as he saw fit.\n\nPirate Thomas Barrow declared “that he is Governor of Providence and will make it a second Madagascar, and expects 5 or 600 men more from Jamaica sloops to join in the settling of Providence, and to make war on the French and Spaniards, but for the English, they don't intend to meddle with them, unless they are first attack'd by them.” While originally the pirates had avoided attacking British ships, this restraint disappeared over time, and at their height, the pirates could command a small fleet of ships that could take on the frigates of the Royal Navy. The amount of havoc caused by the pirates led to an outcry for their destruction, and finally George I appointed Woodes Rogers as Governor of the Bahamas to bring the piracy to an end. In 1718 Rogers arrived in Nassau with a fleet of seven ships, carrying a pardon for all those who turned themselves in and refrained from further piracy. Among those who accepted this offer was Benjamin Hornigold, and, in a shrewd move, Rogers commissioned Hornigold to hunt down and capture those pirates who refused to surrender and accept the royal pardon. As a former privateer himself, Hornigold was well placed to understand what needed to be done and he pursued his former comrades with zeal. Although pirates such as Charles Vane and Blackbeard evaded capture, Hornigold did take ten pirates prisoner and on the morning of 12 December 1718, nine of them were executed. This act re-established British control and ended the pirates' republic in the Bahamas. Those pirates who had fled successfully continued their piratical activities elsewhere in the Caribbean in what has become known as the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nThe pirates ran their affairs using what was called the pirate code, which was the basis of their claim that their rule of New Providence constituted a kind of 'republic'. According to the code, the pirates ran their ships democratically, sharing plunder equally and selecting and deposing their captains by popular vote. Many of the pirates were privateers out of work since the end of the Queen Anne's War and ex-sailors who had revolted against the conditions on merchant and naval ships, and Africans with many Irishmen could be equal members of the crew – several mulattos became pirate captains. Some of the pirates were also Jacobites, who had become pirates to help restore the recently deposed Stuart line to the throne.\n\nIn \"\", Edward Kenway helped seize control of Nassau and establish a pirate republic with other major pirates of the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\n\n"}

Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic use the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) country code, 1, followed by the area code in the same form as an internal area code in other NANP countries, such as the US and Canada.\n\nWhen in the Dominican Republic, the 3-digit area code followed by the 7-digit phone number must be dialed. When calling the Dominican Republic from the United States or Canada, this must be prefixed by the digit \"1\". From other countries the international prefix used in the originating country must be dialled before the \"1\".\n\nArea code 809 was created on January 1, 1958. Initially, the 809 area-code was used for all of the Caribbean, with the exception of Cuba, Haiti, Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, and the French West Indies. On March 1, 1996, area code 809 was split and eventually just assigned to the Dominican Republic. Following the departure of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 809 in 1999, no other countries use the legacy 809 area code. Today, area code 809 and its overlay area codes, 829 and 849, are used solely for the Dominican Republic.\n\nArea code 829 was added to local telephony as an overlay code, initially optional in July 2005 and later mandatory in November 2005. The new telephony rules were almost wholly due to the explosive growth of cellular communication in the Dominican Republic, starting in the mid-1990s with telephone prepaid-cards, and growing incredibly through the early 2000s with the launch of two new cell-phone carriers, Orange and Centennial (now Viva), in addition to the preexisting CODETEL (now Claro Dominicana) and TRICOM (now Altice Dominicana). Besides, the reason for this newly placed dual area code system is because it is estimated a standard 7-digit area code could hold around 7.8 million number combinations, and currently there are around 1.6 million land-based lines and 4.2 million cellular phones. Thus it was decided to attach another area-code to this country, because of the extensive growth and threat of number depletion.\n\nIn early 2009 a decision was made to add a second overlay code, area code 849. The triple area code system went into effect on February 15, 2010.\n\nTelephone fraud scams once revolved around the 809 area code; it was being used since calling international numbers from the United States is charged at a higher rate than domestic calls. The charge is set jointly by the originating and terminating countries; the foreign country portion of the charge could be very high, and there was no regulation by anyone. There may have been a resurgence with wireless telephones. The victim receives a message on their answering machine to call a number with an 809 area code. Since there were many new area codes being introduced in the US, the victim thinks nothing of it and dials the 809 number. The number dialed is however an international number with a share of the revenue going from the foreign telephone company to the operator of the number (the party that got the call to be placed). The victim could be put on hold indefinitely, and billed for each minute they are on hold. This is a form of fraud, though technically legal.\n\nMore recently, a similar scam has emerged due to the prevalence of wireless phones which display callback numbers automatically, known as the \"one ring scam\". The person perpetuating the scam calls the victim via a robodialer or similar means, sometimes at odd hours of the night, then hangs up when the phone is answered with the hope that they will be curious enough to call the number back. When the victim does this, an automatic $19.95 international call fee is charged to their account, as well as $9.00/min thereafter. Similar scams have been linked to Grenada (area code 473), Antigua (area code 268), Jamaica (area code 876) and the British Virgin Islands (area code 284).\n\n\n"}

Within these groupings, smaller, geographical subregions and selected economic and other groupings allow for detailed analysis.\n\nOther alternative groupings include the World Bank regional classification, CIA World Factbook regions and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers Geographic Regions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25283282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25283282", "title": "William Freudenburg", "text": "William Freudenburg\n\nWilliam Robert ('Bill') Freudenburg, (2 November 1951 – 28 December 2010) was an environmental sociologist and social theorist, best known for his work in rural sociology on the topics of risk perception, social disruption, and the causes of environmental degradation. Born in Madison, Nebraska, raised in West Point, Nebraska, he was educated at the University of Nebraska and Yale University. Freudenburg was a professor of sociology at a number of universities; his ultimate position was as Dehlsen Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He died at his home in Santa Barbara, of cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile duct).\n\nMuch of Freudenburg's research dealt with the relationship between society and the environment, often in rural communities. Although not opposed to forms of environmentalism which emphasize reducing one’s impact on the environment (such as recycling), Freudenburg focused less on the role of consumers and more on the role of regulatory structure and actions of industry, emphasizing the socially structured sources of environmental impacts. He was prominent in both rural and environmental sociology, and was elected and served as president of the Rural Sociological Society in 2004-2005, and at the time of his death was president-elect of the Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences (AESS), an organization which he helped found.\n\nFreudenburg completed his undergraduate work at the University of Nebraska and then earned three graduate degrees, including his Ph.D., from Yale University. He began his professional career at Washington State University, then moved to the University of Wisconsin, where he spent most of his professional career. During that time, a compilation by graduate students found Freudenburg to have published more articles on environment-society relationships in leading journals than anyone else. While he was still on the faculty at Wisconsin, he was nominated for an endowed professorship at the University of California, Santa Barbara, which he accepted, and he worked at UCSB until his death.\n\nFreudenburg published a number influential ideas, but his central focus in recent years was on what he called the double diversion. Although in his latter years he taught in the program established in part by Garrett Hardin, and he often stressed his high regard for Hardin's work, the predictions that derive from Freudenburg's double diversion work are contrary to those associated with Hardin's \"tragedy of the commons.\" Rather than being due mainly to the actions of individual consumers, Freudenburg argued, much or most of all environmental harm is actually due to a small number of organized producers. Contrary to the notion that environmental protection is bad for the economy and jobs, the worst sources of environmental harm are commonly due to a surprisingly small fraction of all economic activity—and to an even smaller fraction of the jobs. In the first peer-reviewed article in which this perspective was spelled out, for example, Freudenburg found that the majority of all toxic emissions in the U.S. economy came from industries that were responsible for only about 5% of the gross national product—and just 1.4% of the nation's jobs.\n\n\n\"Catastrophe\" was written with Robert Gramling, Shirley B. Laska, and Kai T. Erikson. It was published in August 2009, on the fourth anniversary of Katrina: \"Catastrophe in the Making: The Engineering of Katrina and the Disasters of Tomorrow\". (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2009). Unlike most \"Katrina\" books, which tend to focus on the hurricane's aftermath, this one discusses the ways in which public works projects—supposedly designed to bring greater prosperity to New Orleans—actually had little if any economic benefits, while potentially contributing to the storm's devastation. Particularly noteworthy in this connection was the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Canal (MRGO), which did little to serve as an \"outlet\" for commerce, but did serve as a major inlet for salt water, which killed much of the vegetation that held together the fragile but formerly healthy wetlands to the southeast of New Orleans. Providing the reader with New Orleans history, engineering data, and scholarly analysis, the authors argue that land development in the region led to the creation of several canals intended to promote economic prosperity, which ironically resulted in the intended economic capital was never realized due to the excessive maintenance costs. Instead, significant human capital was lost in 2005 as the canals and their subsequent environmental degradation exacerbated the impact of Katrina and her deadly floodwaters.\n\nFreudenburg's final published book, written with long-time collaborator Robert Gramling, was released in October 2010. \"Blowout in the Gulf: The BP Oil Spill Disaster and the Future of Energy in America\" (Cambridge MIT Press) puts the \"Deepwater Horizon\" oil spill in historical and policy perspective.\n\nBefore he died, Freudenburg was working on a book tentatively entitled \"Robbing Nature’s Bank\", which explored learning from problems of the past in order to prevent similar “unnatural disasters” in the future. The manuscript focuses less on the individual factors in harming the environment and points out that a large majority of this harm comes from organizational factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is able to transport up to of weight As of 2017, the vehicle has successfully covered more than , driven only by the wind, reaching the Geographic South Pole, the South Pole of Inaccessibility and the highest altitude in the interior of Greenland. The Inuit WindSled has been improving for the last 18 years, during which it has served as a scientific platform for projects of different Spanish and international scientific institutions. Its purpose is to develop scientific and geographic exploration projects with zero emissions in polar regions.\n\nThe Inuit WindSled is composed of four articulated modules, each of them made up with wooden rails and crossbars between in length and in width. This is the so-called 'Larramendi platform', the name of its designer. These rails and crossbars are joined by about 2,000 knots with high resistance ropes, which gives flexibility to adapt to irregularities in the terrain. In the lower part, it has Teflon platforms to facilitate sliding.\n\nThe first of the modules has a piloting tent where the kite controls are located, but it also has a work space. Next, two modules are attached for the load, and that's where all the equipment goes. The last module has another larger tent for crew rest. With this configuration, it can be divided into two vehicles when terrain and conditions require it.\n\nThe WindSled works with kites of different sizes, the largest of , depending on wind conditions. Under normal conditions, its perfect average speed is about , although it has reached over in some moments.\n\nIt is equipped with photovoltaic panels for the electrical supply of the scientific and communications equipment it carries on board and all the composing parts can be repaired without the need of external assistance.\n\nAfter traveling more than through the Arctic, during the , Ramón H. de Larramendi learned the construction and handling of Inuit sleds and observed the force of the winds in polar territories. It was the germination of the WindSled project.\n\nAt the beginning of year 2000, he designed the first models of the vehicle and after performing several tests with fiberglass and wood, he found that the latter, following the Inuit tradition, was much more effective than more modern materials. That same year, he made a first crossing in Greenland of with an incipient design that consisted of a single module with a tent on top. Despite the difficulties, it was a success.\n\nSince then the vehicle, which has been called \"polar butterfly\", \"polar catamaran\" and finally Inuit WindSled, has accomplished a total of six expeditions in Greenland and two in Antarctica, with a total distance covered of , and all of them finalizing successfully. The first crossings in Greenland, in the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, strengthened the possibilities of the mobile platform on the polar terrain. It would obtain the '2001 Trip of the Year' Award from the Spanish Geographical Society.\n\nRight after the 2005-2006 Transantarctic Expedition, the expedition decided to use the vehicle for polar scientific exploration, once possibilities of navigating with a heavy load were proven. In addition to serving for geographic exploration, scientific data could be collected on the crossings. With that objective, in 2012, after the Acciona Antarctica Expedition, a prototype of two modules was presented to the Spanish polar scientific community at the Autonomous University of Madrid. It was also presented to the scientific community in Great Britain.\n\nDuring the 2014 and 2016 expeditions in Greenland, the WindSled designer developed new technical possibilities in two Arctic expeditions, increasing its dimensions. In 2014, the vehicle made the circumnavigation of Greenland by ice, a route of with a prototype of three modules in which four people traveled. In 2016, with the Greenland Ice Summit expedition, it became a convoy of four modules, with a total length of , a maximum of six people on board in a journey to attain the level in altitude with two tons of weight. They covered . It was confirmed that, even in extreme conditions, the WindSled was a sustainable and efficient means of transport. The last expedition, 2017 Greenland Ice River, took place in the spring of that year, with five crew on board. It took 28 days to cover and different international scientific projects related to climate change were developed in collaboration with the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) scientific base at NEGIS, the Dark Snow Project and other relevant scientific institutions.\n\nIn parallel to these external improvements, the interest of polar scientists has increased. Among the most relevant, the American glaciologist Jason Box, Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), and the Spaniards, Antonio Quesada, Autonomous University of Madrid and Spanish Polar Program manager, Ignacio López Moreno, Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (CSIC) and Juan José Blanco, University of Alcalá.\n\nWith this vehicle drilling has been carried out in the interior of Greenland down to , collected data on the state of snow, air samples and data concerning cosmic rays.\n\nIn 2016, the first scientific results of samples taken on the WindSled Acciona Antarctica expedition were published. An investigation, published in November in the scientific journal \"Atmospheric Environment\", revealed the existence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), from pesticides, in the interior of Antarctica. The main researchers were Jordi Dachs and Ana Cabrerizo, Institute of Environmental Diagnosis and Water Studies (IDAEA-CSIC).\n\nIn 2017, polar researcher Ross Edwards, with the international Dark Snow Project, participated as part of the expedition crew in Greenland, collecting data for the project.\n\n\n"}
