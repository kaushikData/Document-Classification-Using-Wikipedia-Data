The Kingdom of Hungary was then part of the Austrian Empire. \nHe received a thorough education in rabbinical literature.\n\nIn 1850 he obtained a position at the Austrian consulate in Jerusalem. At this time, he published articles about the situation of the city's Jewish population, which aroused the anger of some leaders of that community, with whom he became involved in a prolonged controversy.\n\nIn 1857 he moved to Paris, where he continued his studies of Judaism and started producing scientific publications. His earliest contributions were made to the \"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums\" and the \"Journal Asiatique\" (Dec. 1861).\n\nIn 1865 he published a volume entitled \"Meleket ha-Shir\", a collection of extracts from manuscripts relating to the principles of Hebrew versification. In 1864, Neubauer was entrusted with a mission to Saint Petersburg to examine the numerous, hitherto unpublished Karaite manuscripts preserved there. As a result of this investigation he published a report in French, and subsequently \"Aus der Petersburger Bibliothek\" (1866).\n\nThe work which established his reputation, however, was \"La Géographie du Talmud\" (1868), an account of the geographical data scattered throughout the Talmud and early Jewish writings and relating to places in the Land of Israel.\nStarting in 1865 he lived in England and in 1868 his services were secured by the University of Oxford for the task of cataloging the Hebrew manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. The catalog appeared in 1886 after 18 years of preparation. The volume includes more than 2,500 entries, and is accompanied by a portfolio with forty facsimiles.\n\nWhile engaged in this work Neubauer published other works of considerable importance. He purchased a manuscript of the Samaritan \"Tolidah\" for the Bodleian and published its text in 1869. In 1875, he edited the Arabic text of the Hebrew dictionary of Abu al-Walid (the \"Book of Hebrew Roots\"), and in 1876 published \"Jewish Interpretations of the Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah\", which was edited by Neubauer and translated by Samuel Rolles Driver jointly in 1877.\n\nIn the same year, he contributed \"Les Rabbins Français du Commencement du XIVe Siècle\" to \"L'Histoire Littéraire de la France\", though, according to the rules of the French Academy, it appeared under the name of Renan.\n\nIn 1878, Neubauer edited the Aramaic text of the Book of Tobit; in 1887, the volume entitled \"Mediæval Jewish Chronicles\" (vol. ii., 1895); and in 1897, with Cowley, \"The Original Hebrew of a Portion of Ecclesiasticus\".\n\nIn 1892 together with Stern, he published a German translation of a medieval chronicle of the First Crusade: \"Hebräische Berichte über die Judenverfolgungen Während der Kreuzzüge\".\n\nHe was the first to discover fragment of the Hebrew text of Ben Sira.\n\nIn 1884, a readership in Rabbinic Hebrew was founded at Oxford, and Neubauer was appointed to the post, which he held for 16 years until failing eyesight compelled his resignation in May 1900. Neubauer's chief fame has been won as a librarian, in which capacity he enriched the Bodleian with many priceless treasures, displaying great judgment in their acquisition. Among other things he acquired manuscripts from the Cairo geniza as well as Yemenite manuscripts.\n\nHe received the M.A. degree at Oxford in 1873 and was elected an honorary fellow of Exeter College in 1890. In the latter year, he received the honorary degree of PhD from the University of Heidelberg and was made an honorary member of the Real Academia de la Historia at Madrid.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "712384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=712384", "title": "Cityscape", "text": "Cityscape\n\nIn the visual arts a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a painting, drawing, print or photograph, of the physical aspects of a city or urban area. It is the urban equivalent of a landscape. \"Townscape\" is roughly synonymous with \"cityscape,\" though it implies the same difference in urban size and density (and even modernity) implicit in the difference between the words \"city\" and \"town\". In urban design the terms refer to the configuration of built forms and interstitial space. \n\nFrom the first century A.D. dates a fresco at the Baths of Trajan in Rome depicting a bird's eye view of an ancient city. In the Middle Ages, cityscapes appeared as a background for portraits and biblical themes. From the 16th up to the 18th century numerous copperplate prints and etchings were made showing cities in bird's eye view. The function of these prints was to provide a map-like overview.\n\nHalfway the 17th century the cityscape became an independent genre in the Netherlands. In his famous 'View of Delft' in 1660-1661 Jan Vermeer painted a quite accurate portrait of the city Delft. Cities like Amsterdam, Haarlem and The Hague also became popular subjects for paintings. Painters from other European countries (i.e. Great Britain, France, Germany) followed the Dutch example. The 18th century was a flourishing period for cityscape painting in Venice (Canaletto, Guardi).\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the impressionists focused on the atmosphere and dynamics of everyday life in the city. Suburban and industrial areas, building sites and railway yards also became subjects for cityscapes. During the 20th century attention became focused on abstract and conceptual art, and thus the production of cityscapes declined. American painter Edward Hopper, who stayed loyal to figurative painting, created intriguing images of the American scene. With a revival of figurative art at the end of the 20th century comes a revaluation of the cityscape. Well-known living cityscape painters are Rackstraw Downes, Antonio López García, and Richard Estes. American artist Yvonne Jacquette has made a specialty of aerial cityscapes. Stephen Wiltshire, a London born artist with autism, is known for his panoramic cityscape renderings composed from memory, usually after taking a short overhead view of the city he is about to draw.\n\n"}

Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and subsequently served as the third president of the University of California, as the first president of Johns Hopkins University, and as founding president of the Carnegie Institution. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale's Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark \"the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.\"\n\nBorn in Norwich, Connecticut, the son of Eliza (\"née\" Coit) and mill owner William Charles Gilman, a descendant of Edward Gilman, one of the first settlers of Exeter, New Hampshire, of Thomas Dudley, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and one of the founders of Harvard College, and of Thomas Adgate, one of the founders of Norwich in 1659. Daniel Coit Gilman graduated from Yale College in 1852 with a degree in geography. At Yale he was a classmate of Andrew Dickson White, who would later serve as first president of Cornell University. The two were members of the Skull and Bones secret society, and traveled to Europe together after graduation and remained lifelong friends. Gilman was also a member of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity. Gilman would later co-found the Russell Trust Association, the foundation behind Skull and Bones. After serving as attaché of the United States legation at St. Petersburg, Russia from 1853 to 1855, he returned to Yale and was active in planning and raising funds for the founding of Sheffield Scientific School. Gilman contemplated going into the ministry, and even took out a license to preach, but later settled on a career in education.\nFrom 1856 to 1865 Gilman served as librarian of Yale College, and was also concerned with improving the New Haven public school system. When the Civil War broke out, Gilman became the recruiting sergeant for the Norton Cadets, a group of Yale graduates and faculty who drilled on the New Haven Green under the oversight of Yale professor William Augustus Norton. In 1863, Gilman was appointed professor of geography at the Sheffield Scientific School, and became secretary and librarian as well in 1866. Having been passed over for the presidency of Yale, for which post Gilman was said to have been the favorite of the younger faculty, he resigned these posts in 1872 to become the third president of the newly organized University of California. His work there was hampered by the state legislature, and in 1875 Gilman accepted the offer to establish and become first president of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBefore being formally installed as president in 1876, he spent a year studying university organization and selecting an outstanding staff of teachers and scholars. His formal inauguration, on 22 February 1876, has become Hopkins' Commemoration Day, the day on which many university presidents have chosen to be installed in office. Among the legendary educators he assembled to teach at Johns Hopkins were classicist Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, mathematician James Joseph Sylvester, historian Herbert Baxter Adams and chemist Ira Remsen.\n\nGilman's primary interest was in fostering advanced instruction and research, and as president he developed the first American graduate university in the German tradition. The aim of the modern research university, said Gilman, was to \"extend, even by minute accretions, the realm of knowledge\" At his inaugural address at Hopkins, Gilman asked: \"What are we aiming at?\" The answer, he said, was \"the encouragement of research and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell.\"\n\nIn 1884, Gilman was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.\nGilman was also active in founding Johns Hopkins Hospital (1889) and Johns Hopkins Medical School (1893). He founded and was for many years president of the Charity Organization of Baltimore, and in 1897 he served on the commission to draft a new charter for Baltimore. From 1896 to 1897, he was a member of the commission to settle the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana.\n\nGilman served as a trustee of the John F. Slater and Peabody education funds and as a member of John D. Rockefeller's General Education Board. In this capacity, he became active in the promotion of education in the southern United States. He was also president of the National Civil Service Reform League (1901-1907) and the American Oriental Society (1893-1906), vice president of the Archaeological Institute of America, and executive officer of the Maryland Geological Survey. He retired from Johns Hopkins in 1901, but accepted the presidency (1902–4) of the newly founded Carnegie Institution of Washington.\n\nHis books include biographies of James Monroe (1883) and James Dwight Dana, a collection of addresses entitled \"University Problems\" (1898), and \"The Launching of a University\" (1906).\n\nGilman married twice. His first wife was Mary Van Winker Ketcham, daughter of Tredwell Ketcham of New York. They married on December 4, 1861, and had two daughters: Alice, who married Everett Wheeler; and Elisabeth Gilman, who became a social activist and was a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, and for governor and senator of Maryland, on the Socialist Party of America ticket. Mary Ketcham Gilman died in 1869, and Daniel Coit Gilman married his second wife, Elizabeth Dwight Woolsey, daughter of John M. Woolsey of Cleveland, Ohio, and niece of Yale president Theodore Dwight Woolsey, in 1877. Daniel Gilman's brother Dr. Edward Whiting Gilman was married to Julia Silliman, daughter of Yale Professor and chemist Benjamin Silliman. Daniel Coit Gilman died in Norwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe original academic building on the Homewood campus of the Johns Hopkins University, Gilman Hall, is named in his honor. In 1897, he helped found a preparatory school called 'The Country School for Boys' on the Johns Hopkins campus. Upon relocation in 1910, it was renamed in his honor and today, the Gilman School continues to be regarded among the nation's elite private boys' schools.\n\nOn the University of California, Berkeley campus, Gilman Hall, also named in his honor, is the oldest building of the College of Chemistry and a National Historic Chemical Landmark. Named for Gilman as well is Gilman Street in Berkeley. Gilman Drive, which passes through the University of California, San Diego campus in La Jolla, CA is also named for Gilman. The Daniel Coit Gilman Summer House, in Maine, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965. Gilman High School in Northeast Harbor, Maine, was named for Daniel Coit Gilman, who was active in local educational affairs, but it was later rebuilt and christened Mount Desert High School.\n\nThe Papers of Daniel Coit Gilman were donated to Johns Hopkins University by Gilman's daughter Elisabeth, and are open on an unrestricted basis to the public at the Milton S. Eisenhower Library at Hopkins. Aside from many photographs of Gilman and his contemporaries, the papers include Gilman's correspondence with leading figures of the day, including Charles W. Eliot, Sidney Lanier, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry James, James Russell Lowell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William McKinley, Basil Gildersleeve, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, George Bancroft, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Huxley, Andrew Carnegie, Horace Greeley, Helen Keller, Louis Pasteur, Henry Ward Beecher, William Osler, W.E.B.

The major reason for the high frequency and intensity of the earthquakes is that the Indian plate is driving into Asia at a rate of approximately 47 mm/year. Geographical statistics of India show that almost 54% of the land is vulnerable to earthquakes. A World Bank and United Nations report shows estimates that around 200 million city dwellers in India will be exposed to storms and earthquakes by 2050. The latest version of seismic zoning map of India given in the earthquake resistant design code of India [IS 1893 (Part 1) 2002] assigns four levels of seismicity for India in terms of zone factors. In other words, the earthquake zoning map of India divides India into 4 seismic zones (Zone 2, 3, 4 and 5) unlike its previous version, which consisted of five or six zones for the country. According to the present zoning map, Zone 5 expects the highest level of seismicity whereas Zone 2 is associated with the lowest level of seismicity.\n\nNational Center for Seismology, Ministry of Earth Sciences is nodal agency of Government of India dealing with various activities in the field of seismology and allied disciplines. The major activities currently being pursued by the National Center for Seismology include, a) earthquake monitoring on 24X7 basis, including real time seismic monitoring for early warning of tsunamis, b) Operation and maintenance of national seismological network and local networks c) Seismological data centre and information services, d) Seismic hazard and risk related studies e) Field studies for aftershock / swarm monitoring, site response studies f) earthquake processes and modelling, etc.\nThe MSK (Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik) intensity broadly associated with the various seismic zones is VI (or less), VII, VIII and IX (and above) for Zones 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, corresponding to Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE). The IS code follows a dual design philosophy: (a) under low probability or extreme earthquake events (MCE) the structure damage should not result in total collapse, and (b) under more frequently occurring earthquake events, the structure should suffer only minor or moderate structural damage. The specifications given in the design code (IS 1893: 2002) are not based on detailed assessment of maximum ground acceleration in each zone using a deterministic or probabilistic approach. Instead, each zone factor represents the effective period peak ground accelerations that may be generated during the maximum considered earthquake ground motion in that zone.\n\nEach zone indicates the effects of an earthquake at a particular place based on the observations of the affected areas and can also be described using a descriptive scale like Modified Mercalli intensity scale or the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale.\n\nZone 5 covers the areas with the highest risks zone that suffers earthquakes of intensity MSK IX or greater. The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.36 for Zone 5. Structural designers use this factor for earthquake resistant design of structures in Zone 5. The zone factor of 0.36 is indicative of effective (zero period) level earthquake in this zone. It is referred to as the Very High Damage Risk Zone. The region of Kashmir, the Western and Central Himalayas, North and Middle Bihar, the North-East Indian region, the Rann of Kutch and the Andaman and Nicobar group of islands fall in this zone.\n\nGenerally, the areas having trap rock or basaltic rock are prone to earthquakes.\n\nThis zone is called the High Damage Risk Zone and covers areas liable to MSK VIII. The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.24 for Zone 4 Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, the parts of Indo-Gangetic plains (North Punjab, Chandigarh, Western Uttar Pradesh, Terai, North Bengal, Sundarbans) and the capital of the country Delhi fall in Zone 4.\nIn Maharashtra, the Patan area (Koynanagar) is also in zone no-4. In Bihar the northern part of the state like Raxaul, Near the border of India and Nepal, is also in zone no-4.\n\nThis zone is classified as Moderate Damage Risk Zone which is liable to MSK VII. and also 7.8 The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.16 for Zone 3.\n\nThis region is liable to MSK VI or less and is classified as the Low Damage Risk Zone. The IS code assigns zone factor of 0.10 (maximum horizontal acceleration that can be experienced by a structure in this zone is 10% of gravitational acceleration) for Zone 2.\n\nSince the current division of India into earthquake hazard zones does not use Zone 1, no area of India is classed as Zone 1.\n\nFuture changes in the classification system may or may not return this zone to use.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58910316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58910316", "title": "Geology of Kyrgyzstan", "text": "Geology of Kyrgyzstan\n\nThe geology of Kyrgyzstan began to form during the Proterozoic. The country has experienced long-running uplift events, forming the Tien Shan mountains and large, sediment filled basins. \n\nThe Precambrian tectonic evolution of the region is poorly understood. Geologists infer that the Northern Turkestan domain likely formed along the margin of the Proterozoic Baltica-Siberia continent. The Tarim Block may have belonged to Gondwanaland, based on paleontological evidence. Although paleomagnetic data for the Tien Shan mountains is lacking, some have suggested that the ocean closed to form the Turkestan domain may have been a branch of the proto-Pacific Ocean. The Paleozoic rocks in the Tien Shan mountains are the remnants of accreted island arcs, mainly from the Ordovician onward. \n\nDuring the Vendian, the Northern Turkestan domain was part of the Kipchak island arc system between the East European and Siberian continent, separated by the Terksey back-arc basin which had originated as a rift basin. The Tien Shan mountains began to form in the Ordovician out of three island arcs amalgamated by the subduction of Terksey oceanic crust beneath the Kungey Arc, Sandalash Arc and subduction of Paleotethys Ocean crust under the Yagnob Arc. The Kyrgyz Block formed in the middle Ordovician with closure of the Terksey Basin and then underwent deformation. Coarse molasse sediments lie unconformably on top of subduction-related granite intrusions and volcanic rocks. North and south of the Terksey Suture, formed during the event, late Ordovician collision-related granites. \n\nInto the Silurian, the Sandalash magmatic arc remained along the southern margin of the Kyrgyz Block. Turkestan oceanic crust was subducated beneath the Sandalash magmatic arc. By the early Devonian, magmatic activity was taking place in the northern Tien Shan mountains, likely as a result of the subducting Turkestan crust. Sedimentation occurred in shallow seas and on the passive margin of the Tarim-Alay Block.\n\nMagmatic activity resumed in the Carboniferous, with spreading in the Turkestan Ocean and renewed subduction under the Kyrgyz Block. By the late Carboniferous, collision between the Tarim-Alay microcontinent and the Kyrgyz Block was underway, emplacing large nappe features with ophiolite deposits on top of the Tarim-Alay basement rocks. Magmatism continued through the Permian in the Tien Shan mountains, accompanied by deformation and the deposition of molasse sediments in different basins. \n\nStructural geologists distinguish a number of tectonic features from the Paleozoic including the Nikolaev's Line, Talas-Fergana Fault, Turkestan Suture and Terskey Suture.\n\nAt the start of the Mesozoic, depressions began to develop in the Triassic, accumulating thick, coal-bearing sediments. The East Fergana pull-apart basin aligned along the Talas-Fergana Fault. The western edge of the basin has delta sediments while the center of the basin reflects deep water sediments. Material and fossils continued to accumulate into the Jurassic as the units were folded. \n\nA shallow water basin covered the region in the Cretaceous, leaving behind salt water fauna west of the Talas-Fergana fault. Alluvial deposits mark the edges of the saline lake and Cretaceous deposits accumulated up to 500 meters thick. The lake became a shallow intracontinental sea, lasting into the Cenozoic. Lagoon deposits accumulated through the Eocene, until the sea began to retreat in late Paleogene times. The retreat was brought on with the collision of India with Asia around 50 million years ago. Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary rocks are up to two kilometers thick in the Fergana Basin. The Oligocene, the entire region had shifted to lagoon and continental deposition. \n\nTo the east of the Fergana Range, there are no Cretaceous or Paleocene sediments. Continental sediments accumulated there beginning in the Eocene, formed clay, siltstone and sandstone, interbedded with thinner layers of gypsum, marl, conglomerate and limestone in river valleys formed in the central Tien Shan Mountains in the Oligocene and Miocene. These deposits range widely from several meters thick to several kilometers. They reach their greatest thickness of four kilometers in Fergana, Atbashi and Naryn basins. Tien Shan mountain rocks show no signs of folding from the Cretaceous through the Paleogene and lie with an angular unconformity atop basement rocks. \n\nTectonic activity rapidly resumed in the late Pliocene, leading to erosion of continental sediments into intermontane basins into the Quaternary. Folding developed into the Quaternary in the Tien Shan mountains as global changes in climate brought on the Pleistocene ice ages. Most ridges in the mountain range are asymmetric anticlines bounded by reverse and thrust faults. Folding and thrusting is often oriented toward major basins like the Fergana, Chur or Tarim basins. \n\nDue to tectonic activity since the Pliocene, Kyrgyzstan has intense seismic activity on a regular basis. There have been more than 11 earthquakes magnitude 6 or greater on the Richter scale since 1865. The most activity centers on the Kyrgyz Ranges, Kungey Ranges and East Fergana region. \n\nKyrgyzstan is notable for significant deposits of antimony and mercury, such as the Chauvay, Kadamzhai and Khaydarkan deposits. These are examples of quartz-fluorite-antimonite-cinnabar (also known as jasperoid type deposits), while others are quartz-dickite-cinnabar or magnesian-carbonate-cinnabar (or listvenite)_ types. The primary types of deposits are common at the contact between Carboniferous limestone and overlying Silurian shales and Devonian sandstone nappe formations. Listvenite deposits are typically associated with serpentine mélange. Contact metamorphism skarn deposit gold, hydrothermal gold, pegmatite hosted tin, cassiterite-quartz and iron ore in Proterozoic slates are also common together, with smaller amounts of zinc, aluminum, lead, vanadium and uranium. \n\nOil and gas are found in commercial quantities in the Fergana Basin in Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary rocks. The oil is low in sulfur and the natural gas is dry with up to 72 percent methane. The South Fergana Basin, the Uzgen Basin, Kavak Basin and Southern Issyk Kul Basin all host coal deposits from the Triassic and Jurassic formed under continental conditions, with 70 percent hard coal. \n"}

{"id": "889183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=889183", "title": "Inclinometer", "text": "Inclinometer\n\nAn inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument used for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation, or depression of an object with respect to gravity's direction. It is also known as a \"tilt indicator\", \"tilt sensor\", \"tilt meter\", \"slope alert\", \"slope gauge\", \"gradient meter\", \"gradiometer\", \"level gauge\", \"level meter\", \"declinometer\", and \"pitch & roll indicator\". Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope) for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.\n\nA \"tilt sensor\" can measure the tilting in often two axes of a reference plane in two axes.\nIn contrast, a full motion would use at least three axes and often additional sensors. One way to measure tilt angle with reference to the earth's ground plane, is to use an accelerometer. Typical applications can be found in the industry and in game controllers. In aircraft, the \"ball\" in turn coordinators or turn and bank indicators is sometimes referred to as an inclinometer.\n\nInclinometers include examples such as Well's in-clinometer, the essential parts of which are a flat side, or base, on which it stands, and a hollow disc just half filled with some heavy liquid. The glass face of the disc is surrounded by a graduated scale that marks the angle at which the surface of the liquid stands, with reference to the flat base. The zero line is parallel to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is horizontal; the 90 degree is perpendicular to the base, and when the liquid stands on that line, the flat side is perpendicular or plumb. Intervening angles are marked, and, with the aid of simple conversion tables, the instrument indicates the rate of fall per set distance of horizontal measurement, and set distance of the sloping line.\n\nThe Abney level is a handheld surveying instrument developed in the 1870s that includes a sighting tube and inclinometer, arranged so that the surveyor may align the sighting tube (and its crosshair) with the reflection of the bubble in the spirit level of the inclinometer when the line of sight is at the angle set on the inclinometer.\n\nOne of the more famous inclinometer installations was on the panel of the Ryan NYP \"The Spirit of St. Louis\"—in 1927 Charles Lindbergh chose the lightweight Rieker Inc P-1057 Degree Inclinometer to give him climb and descent angle information.\n\nHand-held clinometers are used for a variety of surveying and measurement tasks. In land surveying and mapping, a clinometer can provide a rapid measurement of the slope of a geographic feature, or used for cave survey. In prospecting for minerals, clinometers are used to measure the strike and dip of geologic formations. In forestry, tree height measurement can be done with a clinometer using standardized methods. Major artillery guns may have an associated clinometer used to facilitate aiming of shells over long distances. \n\nPermanently-installed tiltmeters are emplaced at major earthworks such as dams to monitor the long-term stability of the structure.\n\n\nCertain highly sensitive electronic inclinometer sensors can achieve an output resolution to 0.0001°; depending on the technology and angle range, it may be limited to 0.01°. An inclinometer sensor's true or absolute accuracy (which is the combined total error), however, is a combination of initial sets of sensor zero offset and sensitivity, sensor linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, and the temperature drifts of zero and sensitivity—electronic inclinometers accuracy can typically range from ±0.01–2° depending on the sensor and situation. Typically in room ambient conditions the accuracy is limited to the sensor linearity specification.\n\nTilt sensors and inclinometers generate an artificial horizon and measure angular tilt with respect to this horizon. They are used in cameras, aircraft flight controls, automobile security systems, and speciality switches and are also used for platform leveling, boom angle indication, and in other applications requiring measurement of tilt.\n\nImportant specifications to consider for tilt sensors and inclinometers are the tilt angle range and the number of axes. The axes are usually, but not always, orthogonal. The tilt angle range is the range of desired linear output. \n\nCommon implementations of tilt sensors and inclinometers are accelerometer, Liquid Capacitive, electrolytic, gas bubble in liquid, and pendulum.\n\nTilt sensor technology has also been implemented in video games. \"Yoshi's Universal Gravitation\" and \"Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble\" are both built around a tilt sensor mechanism, which is built into the cartridge. The PlayStation 3 and Wii game controllers also use tilt as a means to play video games.\n\nInclinometers are also used in civil engineering, for example, to measure the inclination of land to be built upon.\n\nSome inclinometers provide an electronic interface based on CAN (Controller Area Network). In addition, those inclinometers may support the standardized CANopen profile (CiA 410). In this case, these inclinometers are compatible and partly interchangeable.\n\nTraditional spirit levels and pendulum-based electronic leveling instruments are usually constrained by only single-axis and narrow tilt measurement range. However, most precision leveling, angle measurement, alignment and surface flatness profiling tasks essentially involve a two-dimensional surface plane angle rather than two independent orthogonal single-axis objects. Two-axis inclinometers that are built with MEMS tilt sensors provides simultaneous two-dimensional angle readings of a surface plane tangent to earth datum.\n\nTypical advantages of using two-axis MEMS inclinometers over conventional single-axis \"bubble\" or mechanical leveling instruments may include:\n\n\nAs inclinometers measure the angle of an object with respect to the force of gravity, external accelerations like rapid motions, vibrations or shocks will introduce errors in the tilt measurements. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a gyroscope in addition to an accelerometer. Any of the above mentioned accelerations have a huge impact on the accelerometer, but a limited effect on the measured rotation rates of the gyroscope. An algorithm can combine both signals to get the best value out of each sensor. This way it is possible to separate the actual tilt angle from the errors introduced by external accelerations.\n\nInclinometers are used for: \n\n\"Tilt indicators\" are disposable-grade, albeit reusable sensors attached to goods as part of packaging during shipping.\n\nNintendo used tilt sensor technology in five games for its Game Boy series of hand-held game systems. The tilt sensor allows players to control aspects of the game by twisting the game system. Games that use this feature:\n\n\nTilt sensors can also be found in game controllers such as the Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro and Sony's PlayStation 3 controller.\n\nHowever, unlike these other controllers in which the tilt sensor serves as a supplement to normal control methods, it serves as one of the central features of Nintendo's Wii Remote and the Nunchuk attachment. Along with accelerometers, the tilt sensors are a primary method of control in most Wii games.\n\nIt is now being used in many different aspects, instead of just games like motocrossing and flight simulators. It can be used for sport gaming, first-person shooter, and other odd uses such as in \"\"\n\nAnother example is a virtual version of a wooden maze with obstacles in which you have to maneuver a ball by tilting the maze. A homebrew tilt sensor interface was made for the Palm (PDA).\n\n\n"}

Despite this, he used his influence with Fonseca to secure appointment as Inspector General (\"Veedor General\") of Magellan's \"Armada de Molucca\" with authority to supervise the expedition's financial and trading operations. King Charles V of Spain also directed Cartagena to report on the expedition directly, rather than through Magellan as captain-general. This split responsibility would be a source of difficulty during the subsequent voyage.\n\nIn recognition of Cartagena's influence, and in order to please his supporters, Magellan named him captain of the largest ship of the expedition, the \"San Antonio\", subject only to Magellan's own authority as captain-general of the fleet. \n\nTensions surfaced between Cartagena and Magellan as soon as the fleet departed Spain. In councils between captains, Cartagena routinely opposed Magellan's navigation decisions and refused to salute his superior when required by custom to do so. A storm delayed the fleet south of Tenerife, and food had to be rationed; Cartagena took this opportunity to publicly criticise Magellan and suggest he was not competent to command. Magellan promptly had him arrested, relieved of his command and confined aboard the \"Victoria\" for the remainder of the voyage to South America.\n\nCartagena remained a captive until the fleet reached Patagonia. On 1 April 1520 he secretly left the \"Victoria\" and reboarded the \"San Antonio,\" where he rallied supporters among the Spanish crew and officers in opposition to the Portuguese Magellan. In company with \"Concepción\"s captain Gaspar de Quesada, pilot Juan Sebastián Elcano and thirty Spanish crew members, Cartagena seized control of \"San Antonio\" and declared the vessel independent of Magellan's command. The officers of both \"Concepción\" and \"Victoria\" joined in the mutiny, and on 2 April 1520 a letter was sent to Magellan's flagship, the \"Trinidad\" demanding that the captain-general acknowledge that the fleet was no longer under his command.\n\nMagellan brought the \"Trinidad,\" alongside \"Victoria\" and lowered a boat to carry back his reply. When the boat crew reached \"Victoria\"s deck they made a pretense of handing over a letter; when \"Victoria\"s captain sought to take it the boat crew stabbed him to death. Simultaneously, fifteen men from Magellan's ship climbed aboard and attacked the mutineers. \"Victoria\"s crew joined their cause and the ship was seized.\n\nCartagena had relocated to \"Concepción\" prior to the battle, and so remained temporarily free. However, only that vessel and \"San Antonio\" remained in the mutineer's hands. Magellan ranged his three ships across the mouth of the bay in which the fleet had anchored, and cleared the decks for engagement with Cartagena's two vessels. In strong winds overnight on April 2, \"San Antonio\" dragged its anchor and drifted helplessly toward \"Trinidad.\" Magellan ordered a broadside fired, at which the crew of \"San Antonio\" surrendered and allowed the vessel to be retaken. Realising the mutiny had failed, on April 3 Cartagena followed suit and surrendered \"Concepción\" without resistance.\n\nForty of Cartagena's mutineers were sentenced to death, though Magellan immediately commuted the sentences and permitted the men to return to their previous stations within a few days and to serve in chains for a period of a few days. Stronger action was required against the ringleader Cartagena, but Magellan was reluctant to execute a close relative of Fonseca. Instead, on August 24 1520 Cartagena and another conspirator, the priest Pedro Sánchez de la Reina, were given a small supply of ship's biscuits and drinking water and then marooned on an island off the Patagonian coast. Neither was heard from again.\n\n"}

It is currently divided among the northwestern Russian Federation (the federal subjects of the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast) and Finland (the regions of South Karelia and North Karelia).\n\nVarious subdivisions may be called Karelia. Finnish Karelia was an historical province of Finland, and is now divided between Finland and Russia, often called just \"Karjala\" in Finnish. The eastern part of this chiefly Lutheran area was ceded to Russia after the Winter War of 1939–40.\n\nThe Republic of Karelia is a Russian federal subject, including the so-called East Karelia with a chiefly Russian Orthodox population.\n\nWithin present-day Finland, \"Karjala\" refers to the regions of South and North Karelia, although parts of historical Karelia also lies within the region of Kymenlaakso (Miehikkälä and Virolahti), Northern Savonia (Kaavi, Rautavaara and ) and Southern Savonia (Mäntyharju).\n\nKarelia stretches from the White Sea coast to the Gulf of Finland. It contains the two largest lakes in Europe, Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The Karelian Isthmus is located between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga.\n\nThe border between Karelia and Ingria, the land of the closely related Ingrian people, had originally been the Neva River itself but later on it was moved northward into Karelian isthmus to follow the Sestra River (), today in the Saint Petersburg metropolitan area, but in 1812–1940 the Russo-Finnish border.\n\nOn the other side of Lake Ladoga, River Svir is usually thought of as the traditional southern border of Karelian territory, as Lake Saimaa marks the Western border while Lake Onega and the White Sea mark the Eastern border. In the North there were the nomadic Samis, but no natural border except for huge woods (taiga) and tundra.\n\nIn historical texts Karelia is sometimes divided into \"East Karelia\" and \"West Karelia,\" which are also called Russian Karelia and Finnish Karelia respectively. The area to the north of Lake Ladoga which belonged to Finland before World War II is called Ladoga Karelia, and the parishes on the old pre-war border are sometimes called Border Karelia. White Sea Karelia (sometimes the Finnish or Karelian term \"Viena Karelia\", or in some English-language sources, \"White Karelia\", is used) is the northern part of East Karelia and Olonets Karelia is the southern part.\n\nTver Karelia denotes the villages in the Tver Oblast that are inhabited by Tver Karelians.\n\n\nKarelia was bitterly fought over by Sweden and the Novgorod Republic for a period starting in the 13th-century Swedish-Novgorodian Wars. The Treaty of Nöteborg (Finnish: Pähkinäsaaren rauha) in 1323 divided Karelia between the two. Viborg (Finnish: Viipuri) became the capital of the new Swedish province. In the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617 large parts of Russian Karelia were ceded to Sweden. Conflicts between the new Swedish rulers and the indigenous population of these areas led to an exodus: thousands of Karelians, including the ancestors of the Tver Karelians, emigrated to Russia.\nThe Treaty of Nystad (Finnish: Uudenkaupungin rauha) in 1721 between Imperial Russia and Sweden ceded most of Karelia to Russia. The Treaty of Åbo in 1743 between Sweden and Russia then ceded South Karelia to Russia. After Finland had been occupied by Russia in the Finnish War, parts of the ceded provinces (Old Finland) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1917, Finland became independent and the border was confirmed by the Treaty of Tartu in 1920.\n\nFinnish partisans were involved in attempts to overthrow the Bolshevists in Russian Karelia (East Karelia) in 1918–20, such as in the failed Aunus expedition. They also wanted to incorporate the rest of Karelia into Finland, and cooperated with the short-lived Republic of Uhtua. These mainly private expeditions ended after the peace treaty of Tartu. After the end of the Russian Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian part of Karelia became the Karelian Autonomous republic of the Soviet Union (ASSR) in 1923.\n\nIn 1939, The Soviet Union attacked Finland, thus starting the Winter War. The Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940 handed most of Finnish Karelia to the Soviet Union. About 400,000 people, virtually the whole population, had to be relocated within Finland. In 1941, Karelia was liberated for three years during the Continuation War of 1941 to 1944 when East Karelia was occupied by the Finns. The Winter War and the resulting Soviet expansion caused considerable bitterness in Finland, which lost its second biggest city, Viipuri, its industrial heartland along the river Vuoksi, the Saimaa canal that connected central Finland to the Gulf of Finland, access to the fishing waters of Lake Ladoga (Finnish: Laatokka), and made an eighth of her citizens refugees without chance of return. (From the areas ceded to the Soviet Union, the whole population was evacuated and resettled in other parts of Finland. The present inhabitants of the former Finnish Karelian parts of Russia, such as the city of Vyborg/Viipuri and the Karelian Isthmus, are post-war immigrants and their descendants.)\n\nAs a consequence of the peace treaty, the Karelian ASSR was incorporated with the Karelo-Finnish SSR 1941–1956, after which it became an ASSR again. Karelia was the only Soviet republic that was \"demoted\" from an SSR to an ASSR within the Russian SFSR. Unlike administrative republics, Soviet republics (in theory) had the constitutional right to secede. The possible fear of secession, as well as the Russian ethnic minority in Karelia may have resulted in its \"demotion.\" In 1991 the Republic of Karelia was created out of the ASSR.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union brought an economic collapse. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the area has experienced massive urban decay. The hastily and poorly constructed buildings from the Soviet era, as well as older houses remaining from the Finnish era, are being abandoned.\n\nKarelia is politically divided between Finland and Russia. The Republic of Karelia is a federal subject of Russia, which was formed in 1991 from the Karelian ASSR. The Karelian Isthmus belongs to the Leningrad Oblast. The Finnish side consists of parts of the regions (\"maakunta\") of South Karelia, North Karelia and Kymenlaakso.\n\nThere are some small but enthusiastic groups of Finns campaigning for closer ties between Finland and Karelia. The political expression of these irredentist hopes is called the Karelian question and is about Finland's re-acquisition of the ceded Finnish Karelia. These hopes live on, for instance, in the \"Karjalan Liitto\" and ProKarelia. However, ambitions for closer ties with East Karelia do not include territorial demands.\n\nThe Karelian language is spoken in the Republic of Karelia and in the Karelian villages of the Tver Region of Northwest Russia. The Veps language is spoken on both sides of the River Svir. The so-called Karelian dialects of Finnish language which are spoken mainly in Finnish South Karelia form the southeastern dialect group of Finnish. Similar dialects are also spoken in Ingria, which is an area between the Estonian border and Lake Ladoga. They appeared there in the 17th century after the Swedish conquest of the area. The older inhabitants of the Ingria, the Ingrians, have their own language which is related to the Karelian language and the south-eastern dialects of Finnish.\nThe dialects in Finnish North Karelia belong to the large group of Savonian dialects in Eastern and Central Finland. \nKarelians who evacuated from Finnish Karelia resettled all over Finland and today there are approximately one million people in Finland having their roots in the area ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. In Finland, about 5,000 people speak Karelian.\n\nKarelia is one of the most famous Russian territories in international tourism for its unique architectural, cultural and historical sites such as Kizhi and Valaam.\n\nThe region is worth a trip in both summer and winter, when possible activities include riding in a sled behind a dog team and running from the banya to an ice hole and back. Summer hikers can visit the Kivach waterfall or the Demon's Chair plateau.\n\n\n\n"}

It covers an area of about and has an average depth of about . The lake is fed by arroyos and springs, some of which are hot springs. Its waters are very rich in arsenic and otherwise salty and slightly alkaline; these properties and the regionally high UV radiation give Laguna Socompa extreme environmental conditions.\n\nThe lake features the highest known stromatoliths known on Earth, these are structures formed by microorganisms; stromatoliths were the dominant lifeforms on Earth recorded between 3.5 and 1.5 billion years ago and may give insight on early life on Earth. These stromatoliths are found on the southern shore of the lake and led to Laguna Socompa being declared a protected area.\n\nLaguna Socompa is located at an elevation of in the Los Andes Department of the Salta Province in Argentina, close to the border with Chile. A railway to the border with Chile passes east of Laguna Socompa; the Socompa railway station lies north-northwest of the lake and the Quebrada del Agua station northeast of the lake is even closer. The area is far away from any city or town but sodium sulfate was produced in the area of Laguna Socompa. The lake was defined a protected area in 2011 but is also in the area of the Socompa geothermal power prospect.\n\nThe lake covers a surface of about and has the form of an \"L\" upside down and backwards. Its depth fluctuates between with lower water levels during December to May. The northwestern and eastern shores feature well developed wetland vegetation and are about long, while dry beaches are found elsewhere along the shore. Sandy-stony ground with bush vegetation characterizes the surrounding landscape which is in general mountainous. Reportedly, the area of the lake smells of sulfur.\n\nSome arroyos enter into Laguna Socompa, and on the eastern side water flows from the Quebrada del Agua spring towards the lake; part of its water is piped to an old mill at the railway. Additional springs occur around and within the lake. On the western-southwestern margins of the lake, hot springs with temperatures of up to - are found; volcanic activity represented by the Socompa volcano is responsible for heating the waters of the hot springs. The activity of the hot springs has resulted in the deposition of diatomite and sodium sulfate along the shores.\n\nThe waters of the lake are somewhat alkaline, turbid, brackish to hypersaline and have a high arsenic content. The lakefloor is covered by material with a composition resembling brine, clay and silt. Oncolites have also been reported from Laguna Socompa.\n\nThe lake is situated at the foot of the active volcano Socompa within a depression at its foot; the depression was formerly a north-northwest trendig valley before the volcano grew in the valley. The volcano features steaming ground and fumaroles at its summit.\n\nThe lake is part of the cold, dry Puna where temperatures vary strongly between day and night and precipitation only occurs in summer. In summer temperatures range between and in winter they can drop to . The region has the highest quantities of incoming solar radiation in the world, including the largest amount of UV radiation.\n\nThe small lakes in the Puna desert are influenced by extreme environmental conditions such as large amounts of toxic elements such as arsenic, high salinity and strong ultraviolet radiation as the ozone column is less dense at high elevations; these lakes in general receive more insolation than any other place on Earth. Because of the dry climate, most of the lakes lose water mainly through evaporation and thus tend to accumulate salt and arsenic.\n\nSmall lakes in the Puna are places where birds concentrate in comparison to the surrounding environments. About 27 bird species have been observed at Laguna Socompa, including both waterbirds and terrestrial birds, the most common are \"Anas flavirostris\" (Yellow-billed teal), \"Hirundo rustica\" (Barn swallow), \"Larus seranus\", \"Lessonia rufa\" (Austral negrito) and \"Lophonetta specularioides\" (Crested duck). Among mammals, vicuñas have been reported from Laguna Socompa. \n\nThe vegetation in the wetlands around the lake is characterized by cyperaceae and graminaceae. Underwater vegetation does not occur in Laguna Socompa owing to the brackish water. There is little phytoplankton in the lake waters, mainly cyanobacteria and diatoms.\n\nMicroorganisms who live in the lakes and wetlands of the dry Andes have to resist harmful environmental traits and thus become extremely hardy with e.g high UV radiation tolerance. They often also produce secondary metabolites that are of interest to the industry, such as medicine, UV blocking and bioremediation, which has spurned research in these extreme environments. Furthermore, they are considered to be potential counterparts to extraterrestrial life in light of the environmental conditions.\n\nSeveral microorganisms in the lake have been isolated and researched, with their genomes sequenced. Among these is \"Exiguobacterium sp.\" strain 17 which was first isolated in Laguna Socompa; its sequenced genome contains a number of genes involved in metabolizing arsenic and other toxic compounds and protecting and repairing the genome. Other strains from Laguna Socompa whose genome has been sequenced are \"Salinivibrio sp.\" strain 34 and 35.\n\nIn 2009, researchers discovered the presence of stromatoliths at Laguna Socompa; stromatoliths are layered structures formed by microorganisms when their metabolism causes the accumulation of minerals. These are the first stromatoliths found in Argentina and the highest site where stromatoliths have been recorded; their existence was the reason why the lake was made a protected area.\nThe discovery of stromatoliths at Laguna Socompa and the extreme conditions that exist there offers insights into the development of early life on Earth as microbe-formed structures like stromatoliths were the main traces of life from between 3.5 and 1.5 billion years ago before stromatoliths declined between 1 and 0.7 billion years ago due to the increased presence of burrowing and grazing lifeforms at that time. Previously stromatoliths were known mainly from marine and carbonatic environments such as in the Bahamas, the Coorong Lagoon and Shark Bay in Australia, the Lagoa Salgada in Brazil and the Laguna Bacalar in Mexico. The Laguna Socompa stromatoliths are the first to be discovered at elevations exceeding ; the presence of active hot springs may be responsible for their formation at Laguna Socompa.\n\nThese stromatoliths have a layered structure and cone-like shapes that sometimes overlap and then form large domes, unlike the bushy or crustose stromatoliths found elsewhere, and are found underwater on the southern shores of the lake, protected from the strong UV radiation. They have a layered structure, with very different environments between the surfaces and the interiors of the individual stromatoliths. The UV protective carotenoid pigment deinoxanthin gives them a pink colour. Unusually, some stromatoliths are formed out of halite rather than the more common aragonite/carbonate although aragonite and silica are their most important building materials.\n\nThe dominant bacteria in the stromatoliths are \"Microcoleus\" cyanobacteria and deinococci in the surface; there are also eukaryotic algae, diatoms. Other taxa include desulfobacterales, rhodobacteraceae and spirochaetes and are mostly novel lineages of bacteria; the diversity of the lifeforms increases away from the surface and towards the interior of the stromatolith. Some of the Laguna Socompa stromatoliths are classified as \"Conophyton\" stromatoliths, which are otherwise only known as Precambrian (over 541 ± 1 million years old) fossils.\n\n"}

These measures, usually comprising earthworks or dykes as well as ditches and impenetrable lines of hedging, for protecting towns and villages date mainly to the High and Late Middle Ages and consist, in some cases, of systems over a hundred kilometres long. Comparable earthworks have been recorded since Antiquity. The Roman \"limes\" are the best known examples of earlier \"landwehrs\". The Danewerk is another example of this type of barrier.\n\nMany of these \"landwehrs\" have survived, especially in woods and forests, and are often protected as heritage sites.\n\nThe construction of a \"landwehr\" was an effective way of protecting the population of a settlement or territory against attacks by neighbours or enemies in feuds or war, and also to mark out the legal limits of an area. The \"landwehrs\" were a means of limiting the likelihood, success, effectiveness, and consequences of medieval warfare, and thus preventing them. They also hindered bands of robbers entering the area and hampered their retreat after a raid. The combination of fencing and thorn bushes was also useful in enclosing cattle pasture and as a guideline in wolf hunting. Wolf pits are often found along the line of a \"landwehr\".\n\n\"Landwehrs\" were also used to on a large-scale to enclose woods and agricultural areas for the protection of the local population, where they were settled in dispersed dwellings and farmsteads within the protected area. The \"landwehr\" offered protection for the peasantry, in a way analogous to the population of fortified towns who were guarded by a town wall. Often too, the fields and outlying areas surrounding many towns had a ring-shaped enclosure, a so-called \"Stadtlandwehr\" (\"town Landwehr\"), \"Stadthagen\" or \"Stadthege\" (\"town enclosure\"). An example of this is the Westphalian city of Dortmund, which, in addition to the city wall, also had a large \"landwehr\" surrounding it. As a map of 1748 portrays, Dortmund's Stone Tower was part of this \"landwehr\" ring.\n\nThe only gaps in \"landwehr\" defences were on roads entering the area where, like the gates in a town wall, people and goods were checked as they passed through. For example, \"landwehrs\" often acted as effective customs posts, usually imposing a road toll.\n\nTrade routes, particularly in the area of check points, were accompanied on both sides by \"landwehrs\". In addition to protecting travellers from ambushes, these \"landwehrs\" on either side of the route were mainly used to channel the flow of traffic and effectively prevent people bypassing or avoiding check points and customs posts.\n\nHedges are one of the most natural forms of boundary defence and enclosure. Their simplest and, even today, most common use is as a garden hedge. Even in prehistoric and early historic times, people built defensive enclosures using branches and brambles for the protection of storage places (including caves), fortified residences, houses, estates and settlements from attack by predators or enemies. This is common even today amongst nomadic tribes. Julius Caesar tells e.g. of thick \"Hagen\" which were laid out by the Nervii, one of the most powerful Belgic tribes:\n\nA more complicated form of defence was the classic ditch and rampart system. In A.D. 16, Tacitus reported a border fortification built by the Angrivarii, the Angrivarian Wall, which was erected to defend them against the Cherusci. A great battle was fought there in 16 AD. The most important border fortifications were said to have been at Rehburg-Loccum.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" speaks of a Bebbanburg around A.D. 547, which was \"first fortified by a hedge\". The capitularies of Charlemagne also mention \"ramparts planted with hedges\".\n\nIn England, similar fortifications are called \"dykes\" or ditches. For example, Bokerley Dyke was built around A.D. 360, transitioning into Grim's Ditch which dates to 300 B.C., or the 270-kilometre-long Offa's Dyke.\n\nIn the case of the Normans, too, the existence of \"Hagediken\" - embankments planted with hedges - is recorded.\n\nAs a rule, mediaeval \"landwehrs\" consist of one or more impenetrable lines of hedging made of pleached hornbeam – (the \"Gebück\") - underplanted with thorny bushes suchs as blackthorn, hawthorn, dog rose, brambles or holly – (the \"Gedörn\").\n\nIn addition there was also usually a combination of one or more of the following elements:\n\n\nFrom the time after the Frankish colonisation of Central Europe until the late Late Middle Ages, the creation of fixed sovereign territories ruled by lords and princes led to the establishment of territorial \"landwehrs\" which enclosed the land which was legally held by states and settlements. The territories of \"Gaue\", counties (\"Zenten\"), regional magistracies (often coterminous with church parishes), \"Ämter\" and even entire states were enclosed by \"landwehrs\" in the form of defensive hedges.\n\nThere were also \"Landhagen\" and \"Stadthagen\", which were arranged in a circular shape around smaller settlements. The \"Landhegen\" bordered and protected entire regions as well as the areas surrounding towns and cities, for example the almost 70-kilometre-long Aachen Landgraben the former Aachener Reich, similar to the ones in Frankfurt, Rothenburg, Lübeck or Mühlhausen. The traces of the Rothenburg Landhege are still about 60 km long today, the Mühlhäusen Landgraben, still some 26 km long, recalls the border between Mühlhausen and Eichsfeld.\n\nThese earthworks served several functions. They marked, protected and helped to bring peace to territories that were under their reeve (\"Greve\"), count (\"Graf\") or \"Amtmann\". This grouping of tasks for the protection of defended territories (\"Landwehr\") resonated with the term \"Hege\" (a range of measures concerning hunting and wildlife) in terms such as \"Hege, Heege, Hag, Haag\" or \"Hecke\", but also with the term \"Schutzhecke\" or \"protective hedge\". Numerous toponyms such as \"Zarge, Gebück, Wehrholz\" or \"Gehag\" recall different variants of these defensive structures as e.g. hedges, excavation works or staggered constructions.\n\nThe main objective of these barriers was to protect the population and their land from the hostile claims, raids, predations and warlike assaults of other princes. \"Landwehrs\" were a clear border marking and, at the same time, when they defined the external border to another territory, also a customs border. Even within a territory, there were sometimes \"landwehrs\" which separated the individual districts (\"Ämter\") from one another by the inclusion of streams and other natural obstacles. These 'internal' or 'intermediate' \"landwehrs\" (\"Zwischenlandwehren\"), were generally not as elaborate as those on the external borders.\nOne particular variant was the so-called \"letzi\" in Switzerland, where it was often sufficient just to secure the access routes to a valley. Many of the battles of the Old Confederation with the Hapsburgs took place at such \"letzis\", such as Battle of Morgarten, Battle of Näfels and Battle of Stoss.\n\nSome \"landwehrs\" also functioned as a form of outwork for fortresses. They were built with the character of fieldworks as a first line of defence against enemy attack. Used until the Modern Era, they were designed militarily, in the form of chevaux de frise, to force the attacker of a fortress into having to conduct a siege even before reaching the fortress. Their modern successors include the barbed wire used in both world wars.\n\nThe route of many simple \"landwehrs\" shows, according to new research, that they were completely unsuitable for defence purposes in many places. From this it can be concluded that some of these installations were mainly used for border marking and collecting customs duties. They nevertheless restricted the free mobility of enemy troops, so that they were certainly of some military utility. For example, the \"Stadthagen\" around Warendorf in the Thirty Years' War succeeded in protecting the town. Although the enemy did in fact break into the municipal territory, they did not risk a major attack simply because of the danger, in a counter-attack, of not being able to beat a retreat quickly enough through the narrow breach in the \"landwehr\".\n\nAs a border fortification around areas that had been given specific rights, \"landwehrs\" had gaps in some places for roads, for counter-attack routes or for trade. These gaps (called \"Schlags\") were guarded by simple tollgates, by side roads (so-called \"Schlingen\")), or - by means of towers (watchtowers, \"Wighäuser\" or gate towers). At the border crossing points there were usually also customs posts. The lucrative right to charge tolls (\"Zollrecht\"), often in connection with the right to sell alcohol (\"Krugrecht\") could be given to local farmers.\n\nMost \"landwehrs\" consisted of a simple ditch as an obstacle - on the plains this was also a water channel or moat - behind which was an earthen bank made of the spoil from excavating the ditch. Behind the bank was the main barrier itself, a 20 to 50 metre-wide, dense, impenetrable thicket. In upland areas, the route of the \"landwehr\" conformed to natural features such as rocks, steep slopes and watercourses. Often a second ditch was dug at a distance of 10 to 30 metres.\n\nThe strips of vegetation and the embankments were covered with a hedge of hornbeam cut back to the height of a man, whose branches were bent, intertwined with the other branches and stuck into the ground as a further obstacle. This resulted in the so-called \"Gebück\", a plaited hedge. Understorey bushes, such as dog rose, whitethorn, blackthorn or brambles , were used to make the hedge impenetrable. Hence the local name, \"Gedörn\" (\"thorn hedge\") used in some places. The site was kept clear of higher vegetation. The ground in front was largely cleared.\n\nThe construction of a defensive hedge was described by a priest at Eberbach Abbey in 1790:\n\nWith regular maintenance and care (\"hege\"), a nigh impenetrable woodland strip was created in the course of a decade. More elaborate \"landwehrs\" with a defensive function consisted of several parallel ditches and banks, planted with hedging. In particular, double ditches were designed to prevent them from being jumped by horsemen. Another design was the so-called \"Wehrhecke\" (\"Wallhecke\" or \"Knick\"), a hedge-planted bank, for the maintenance of which a tax called \"Knickgeld\" was raised.\n\nIn Hesse, at the end of the 17th century, many villages on important roads or by borders, had fortifications, excluding any fortified churches, as a Hessian chronicler described in 1697:\n\nThe fortification could be made of fences (known as \"Etter\" or \"Dorfetter\"), hedges, bank and ditch (dry as well as wet) and gates.\n\nAnother temporary artificial obstacle which could be built relatively quickly in the event of an attack, or to close gaps in a \"landwehr\", was the abatis. This was also used as the first obstacle on the approach of castles, town and city walls, and \"schanzen\", and was made of felled trees and cut logs, shrubs and thorns. Abatis were also used during the building of a \"landwehr\", if necessary, until it was ready. Since the obstacle was made of dead wood, it was relatively easy to remove by burning once it had dried out.\n\nImportant roads passing through the \"landwehr\" at entry points were guarded with so-called barriers (\"Schlägen\") and other reinforcements such as watchtowers. Road tolls were collected at the barriers which were paid to the territorial lord. From the beginning there were inns at these points. The innkeepers provided food and drink for the passers-by. They also exercised sovereign functions by observing the ground in front of the town and by closing the barriers at night.\n\nIn many cases, the roads were flanked by ditch-bank-ditch systems on both sides, so that no one could enter the villages outside the intended route. Wooden bridges often led across the ditches, so that in the event of a war, the road could be closed by removing the bridge.\n\nNews of approaching enemy troops or visitors, was relayed along the \"landwehrs\" to the Hinterland, using watchtowers (for example, in Münsterland). In upland regions this was also achieved by observation posts (\"Warten\") at high lookouts from which one could see far into the surrounding countryside. Warning of approaching enemies was given by optical signals in the form of smoke signals, flags, mirrors and torches, or by signal horns and church bells. The entire population of the village and its neighbouring villages were required to \"immediately\" respond to these emergency signals or the sounding the storm bell, but also in other emergencies, such as fire or flood, no matter what other work or activity was in progress. The striking of the bell was called \"Gerüfte\", for example, in the Münsterland.\n\nTo construct the \"landwehr\", the local territorial lord would use all his subjects in a service known as socage. Likewise the whole population were required to maintain it. Many \"landwehrs\" were built and maintained jointly by neighbouring princes, for example, in Central Hesse, the \"landheege\" on the \"Hörre\" between the county of Nassau on one side and the Landgraviate of Hesse and county of Solms on the other.\n\nThe construction and maintenance of \"landwehrs\" had to be carried out with a long-term perspective. Even with constant and time-consuming care (\"Hegen und Pflegen\") it would be ten years before an impenetrable hedge was created. In addition, the ditches and \"Hählweg\", a patrolled road along the \"landwehr\" had to be kept free of vegetation and maintained in working order. For this reason, many \"landwehrs\" were abandoned or left unfinished for long periods of time for reasons of cost.\n\nIntentional damage of a \"landwehr\" was punished with severe penalties. In the case of the over 100-kilometre-long Westphalian Landwehr in the Teutoburg Forest, punishments ranged from cutting off the right hand to the death penalty. Even crossing a \"landwehr\" in authorised places was often punished. On the Rhön Landwehr, cutting through the hedging or using the patrol road was punishable by a fine of up to five guilders.\n\nThese border installations were constantly renewed and maintained until the 18th century and, in times of extreme danger, even reinforced and turned into fortifications.\n\nIn 1813 in Prussia, the obligation to defend the earthworks, which were slighted under Napoleon but nevertheless remained functional, became part of the general service duties of the military formations of the Prussian Landwehr (a territorial force not to be confused with the subject of this article). In many cases the field fortifications of the Landwehr troops were abandoned after the end of an armed conflict or after the abolition of an official district, and the hedges and woods burned to make charcoal.\n\n\n\nZur Sonderbedeutung Häger in Niedersachsen, siehe: Adelung\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18784719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18784719", "title": "Lašva Valley", "text": "Lašva Valley\n\nThe Lašva Valley (/Лашванска долина) is a 17 kilometers long valley in central Bosnia, defined geographically by the Lašva River's route. It is a tributary of the Bosna River. The Lašva River basin covers the territory of four municipalities: Travnik, Novi Travnik, Vitez and Busovača.\n\nThe favorable geographical position of the Lašva Valley enabled the beginning of civilization along the Lašva River. However, due to the unprotected and open area numerous occupiers chose the mountainous regions to protect themselves. The earliest known remnants of civilized people were the Romans. Romans were adapt to the terrain and surrounding because of military might, which was of the utmost importance for survival.\n\nDue to the presence of the Lašva River many settlers began to exploit it for economic benefits. They began trading goods which traveled from Travnik to Vitez. In addition to the river, the mountainous regions offered mineral deposits which in turn attracted even more settlers. Remnants have been found belonging to the Romans in Turbe and Mosunj, where a settlement named Bistue is thought to have existed.\n\nThe name \"Lašva\" was first used as a regional term in the 13th century. Béla IV of Hungary first mentioned the area in his charter on 20 April 1244, which he issued to gain political favor from Pope Innocent IV by launching and winning the war against the \"Bosnian heretics\", as he called them. In the charter there is a mention of three Roman Catholic churches existing in the Lašva Valley, although only one can be confirmed by the gifting of the Bosnian Ban Matthew Ninoslaus in 1250. \n\nThe Lašva Valley is thought of having its own seat of power before the arrival of the Franciscans in the 13th century. Their subsequent establishing of Vukarija in 1340 was the first officially known seat of power in the valley. The Bosnian Vukarija had, according to the friar Bartolomej Polanski (1385/1390), monasteries in Kraljeva Sutjeska, Visoko, Lašva and Olovo. Therefore, the Lašva Valley was an occupied and developed region not unlike other parts of Bosnia.\n\n\"Lašva\" is only mentioned once in the 15th century by King Sigismund of Hungary on 5 September 1425. On that date the king rewarded his son the Paku estate in the county of Vuku for his loyalty to the king which he earned through battles against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the book \"Roots and Life,\" translated from \"Korijeni i Život,\" the advent of Ottoman expansion is mentioned. \"The coming of the Ottomans and their military victories at Jajce in 1463 saw the putting out of fire in chimneys at age old houses and churches. With the arrival of the new oppressive and bloodthirsty masters from the East, people began to flee over the borders to the south and north, while others sought refuge in mountains led by the Franciscans.\"\n\nThe last battle against Ottoman expansion in the Lašva Valley was lost on May 1463, when Mehmed the Conqueror on his return from Jajce defeated the last Bosnian king Stephen Tomašević at Milodraž in today's Brestovsko; located between Kiseljak and Busovača.\n\nUpon the Ottoman conquest, the plaintiff of the Franciscans Anđeo Zvizdović advised the Sultan to stop forcing the people of Bosnia to flee because of religious persecution. Which, if continued, would lead to the eventual downfall of properties and infrastructures. The Sultan agreed and issued the Ahdname of Milodraž in 1463 decreeing freedom of religion for the Roman Catholic population. \n\nDue to the sheer size of the Ottoman Empire jurisdictional and government overseeing was not a possibility, since the capitol Istanbul was long ways away. Bosnia was used as a launching state for other wars, which consequently transformed the land into a military occupying region. Most of the peoples along with the Franciscans sought to distance themselves from the Ottoman settlements, many times living in impoverished conditions. New monasteries were not allowed to be built on the foundation of old ones and consequently only three remained at; Fojnica, Kreševo and Kraljeva Sutjeska.\n\nAt the dawn of Ottoman rule, the Lašva Valley began to be called \"nahija Lašva,\" which was centered at Travnik. As a result, Travnik began to grow and emerge as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire's jurisdiction over the Lašva Valley and Bosnia.\n\nThe Lašva Valley, as well as Bosnia, was emancipated from Ottoman control in 1878 and entered a new phase in its history under Austro-Hungarian rule. The area saw a reemerging of Catholic populations with overall improvements in infrastructures. The modernization of the Austro-Hungarian rule transformed the Lašva Valley into a capable area worthy of competing against larger and more established regions. The 19th century also saw the materialization of South Slavic nationalism along with the idea of a united South Slavic state.\n\nThe region saw fierce fighting between the Croatian Defence Council and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Croat-Bosniak War. Today the region is recovering from the war and has emerged as an economic powerhouse in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with cities such as Vitez leading the way.\n\n"}

At 522m West Lomond is the highest point in the county of Fife.\n\nThe Lomond Hills contain two prominent peaks, West Lomond and East Lomond (or Falkland Hill) (448 m), which lie at either end of an escarpment roughly 6.5 km in length. The escarpment, made from beds of sandstone, limestone and quartz-dolerite, rises gradually from the south to a plateau of around 350 m in height between the peaks of East and West Lomond. To the north and west, this plateau terminates in steep and, in places, cliffy scarp slopes. From its western end, the escarpment continues southwards beyond the deep valley of the Glen Burn (Glen Vale) to Bishop Hill (461 m). The steep-sided peaks of East and West Lomond themselves are volcanic in origin. Along the edges of the sandstone bed at the foot of the scarp slopes are several strangely eroded outcrops, the most famous of which are the Bunnet Stane and John Knox's Pulpit, so named because it is believed to be a spot where covenanters held conventicles in the 17th century. There are also strange outcrops in the columnar jointing at the edge of the dolerite sill on Bishop Hill, most notably Carlin Maggie.\n\nThe River Eden, one of the two primary rivers in Fife, has its source on the slopes of West Lomond. On the northern slopes of the Lomond hills, two burns run down from the plateau in impressive gorges. These are the Maspie Burn and the Arraty Burn. Maspie Den has a path running along its length to an undercut waterfall at the top, which can be accessed just beyond Falkland House (approaching from the Falkland direction). Glen Vale with the Glen Burn, to the south of West Lomond, is equally impressive.\n\nThe Lomond Hills have a rich and varied history. From the Iron Age are the remains of several hill forts, which can be found around the summits of both East and West Lomond as well as at Maiden Castle, a grassy knoll that lies between the two.\n\nIn more recent history, the Lomond Hills were mined for limestone, ore and lead, although there are no longer any working quarries there today. On the southwest slopes of East Lomond are the well preserved remains of a limekiln and quarry (in which the fossilised remains of prehistoric sea creatures can be found).\n\nBoth East and West Lomond can easily be climbed from Craigmead Car Park, which lies between the two at a height of around 300m. Alternative routes exist from the Bunnet Stane, the village of Falkland and the car park at the masts, high on East Lomond. The views from both summits, due to their prominence, are magnificent, stretching from the Highlands to the Borders, with the sea in the east.\n\nBeneath the northern slopes of the escarpment lies Falkland Estate, an area of forest (now commercial plantation), where the kings of Scotland would have hunted whilst staying at nearby Falkland Palace. The present custodian of the palace is Ninian Crichton-Stuart, brother of the Marquess of Bute.\n\nDue to the steep gradients and poor soil, the primary land uses on the Lomond Hills are sheep grazing and commercial forestry (predominantly on the steep north slopes) and water catchment. There are six reservoirs in the Lomond Hills that were originally constructed to supply water to the rapidly growing mining towns of west Fife.\n\nThe Lomond Hills lie within the boundaries of Fife Regional Park, renamed the Lomond Hills Regional Park in 2003, and have their own ranger service who work principally with the landowners, estate managers and farmers on issues such as public access to help minimise the impact of recreational activities on their day-to-day business. The park covers approximately 65 square kilometres and is divided as follows: 1,120 hectares of land is in public ownership: 500 hectares belong to Fife Council and 620 are owned by Scottish Water. The balance of 5,355 hectares is privately owned.\n\nAs a result of their accessibility and proximity to several major population centres, the hills are very popular with walkers. This has resulted in a considerable amount of footpath erosion, particularly on the steeper sections, that the ranger service and volunteer workers are taking measures to counteract.\n\nAs well as walking, there are a number of more unusual recreational activities that take place in the Lomonds. East Lomond, due to the easy access from the high car park, is often used by paragliders on windy days. The Falkland Hill Race is held annually and begins at the fountain in the centre of Falkland village. The competitors must run (or in many cases walk) to the summit of East Lomond before returning to the fountain. The wooded northern slopes of East Lomond also boast a series of downhill mountainbike tracks.\n\nGliders from the Scottish Gliding Centre at Portmoak between Bishop Hill and Loch Leven may be seen riding the thermals above the hills.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "153742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153742", "title": "Mam Tor", "text": "Mam Tor\n\nMam Tor is a hill near Castleton in the High Peak of Derbyshire, England. Its name means \"mother hill\", so called because frequent landslips on its eastern face have resulted in a multitude of \"mini-hills\" beneath it. These landslips, which are caused by unstable lower layers of shale, also give the hill its alternative name of Shivering Mountain. In 1979, the continual battle to maintain the A625 road (Sheffield to Chapel en le Frith) on the crumbling eastern side of the hill was lost when the road officially closed as a through-route.\n\nThe hill is crowned by a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age univallate hill fort, and two Bronze Age bowl barrows. At the base of the Tor and nearby are four show caves: Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern, Peak Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern where lead, Blue John, fluorspar and other minerals were once mined.\n\nSimon Jenkins rates the panorama from Kinder Scout to Stanage Edge as one of the top ten in England.\n\nMam Tor is on the southern edge of the Dark Peak (sandstones) and overlooks the White Peak (limestones), including the notable dry gorge of Winnats Pass. It is a dominating link between the eastern end of Rushup Edge and the western end of the Great Ridge, which together separate the Hope Valley to the south from Edale to the north, and is a popular ridgewalk.\n\nMam Tor is made of rocks of Carboniferous age, approximately 320 million years old. The base of Mam Tor is composed of black shales of the Bowland Shale Formation of Serpukhovian age overlain by turbiditic sandstone of the Mam Tor Sandstone Formation of Bashkirian age.\n\nThe most notable feature of Mam Tor is the active landslide which invades its southeast side almost to the summit, and interrupts the ramparts of the hillfort, unless its builders used it as part of the defences. This rotational landslide began roughly 4,000 years ago. The toe is a debris flow. The landslide is due to weak shales underlying sandstones, a common phenomenon all around the Dark Peak, notably at Alport Castles, Longdendale, Glossop and Canyards Hills, Sheffield. Indeed, three larger landslides occur on the north side of Mam Tor, one of them cutting the main ridge at Mam Nick which allows a minor road over into Edale; another creates the striking crag of Back Tor well seen from Mam Tor.\n\nEvidence for the continued movement of the slide mass is demonstrated graphically by the severe damage to the old Mam Tor road that traversed this flow. The road was built at the beginning of the 1800s and was subsequently relaid until local authorities closed it in 1979. Layers of tarmac and gravel are up to thick in places, demonstrating the numerous efforts to keep the road open. A short tunnel could readily have been made avoiding the landslip zone, but the opportunity to exclude heavy business and lorry traffic from the middle of the National Park was preferred. A local diversion for light vehicles follows the limestone gorge of Winnats Pass. This is one of the most extreme cases of geological problems affecting main transport systems in Britain, comparable with the railway at Dawlish.\n\nCurrent mean annual movement is \"up to 0.25 m; this increases greatly when winter rainfalls exceed thresholds of both 210 mm/month and 750 mm in the preceding six months\". The debris flow poses no threat to any inhabited buildings; however, small farm buildings lying in the flow's path may soon be overwhelmed assuming a flow rate similar to that of the present. The 2000 study suggests that deep drainage may be the most effective means of stabilising the flow, though this may not completely stop movement.\n\nThe summit of Mam Tor is encircled by a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age univallate hill fort. Radiocarbon analysis suggests occupation from around 1200 BC. The earliest remaining features are two Bronze Age burial mounds, one just below the summit and the other on the summit itself, though now buried under the paving. At a later stage over a hundred small platforms were levelled into the hill near the summit, allowing inhabited timber huts to be constructed. The hill fort and burial mounds are a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nThere is also a prehistoric ridgeway track leading from the summit of the hill heading south, and can be traced to the suburbs of Nottingham. It passes by Burr Tor and Fin Cop, two other significant late Bronze Age/early Iron Age hill forts in the area, and also passes through the villages of Wardlow, Ashford-in-the-Water and Wirksworth. Much of it can still be walked today as for much of its length it is followed various modern roads.\n\n\n"}

By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin.\n\nThe Belgian administrators of the Congo Free State were concerned by this development, and, in 1889, enacted the Monopoly Act, which declared that all products in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone. \nThe Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers, traders and the Manyema from the region, the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at Basankusu, in May 1890. \nThe entire basin was under Free State control by 1898.\nThe Free State started to levy taxes, payable in ivory, but which soon switched to wild rubber.\nBy September 1892, the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys in order to expand its tax base.\n\nThe concession to farm rubber was granted to the Abir Congo Company, which established its headquarters at Basankusu, in 1893.\nIts position at the confluence of the Maringa and Lopori, allowed ABIR to expand along these rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way.\nThe company established posts throughout the region, staffed by agents who were mainly paid on commission and used brutal methods to force the villagers to pay their rubber taxes. \nThe effort of rubber collection did not leave enough time for farming, and the villagers began to suffer from malnutrition and starvation. Fatal diseases, such as Smallpox and Sleeping Sickness, also spread in the region. To save time, harvesters resorted to cutting down the rubber plants to obtain their sap.\nReports of abuses led the Free State to conduct investigations into Abir's conduct, and, in 1905, to take back the concession.\nSoon after, with no remaining plants, the rubber tax was abolished.\n\nThe MLW Landscape is in one of the least developed and most remote parts of the Congo Basin. \nThe inhabitants are among the poorest in Africa, depending on natural resources to meet their basic needs.\nMost of the people live by slash-and-burn agriculture, and rely on bushmeat such as porcupine, sitatunga, and forest hog for protein.\nCash crops include maize, cassave and groundnuts. \nThe growing population is placing more stress on the environment, and there is risk of a revival of logging that could harm the ability of the land to sustain the people and could jeopardize biodiversity.\n\nLocal and international institutions headed by the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) have recently started developing a sustainable land use plan for the MLW. The plan aims to ensure that the economic and cultural needs of the inhabitants are met while conserving the environment.\nThe approach combines AWF's Heartland Conservation Process and the Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) Program Monitoring Plan.\nA variety of tools are used including surveys, interviews with local people and satellite image interpretation.\n\n"}

The final report suggested four causes of the disaster, all due to poor design and maintenance of the ship. The loss of the ship was the subject of lengthy litigation between the owner and families of the missing men.\n\nDespite the clear cause of the disaster, an inaccurate and incomplete version of the ship's disappearance is often used to justify Bermuda Triangle conspiracies.\n\nThe vessel, originally named SS \"Esso New Haven\", was built by Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, in March 1944, one of many T2 tankers built to carry and transport oil. In 1960, she was placed in dry dock by Bethlehem Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland, converted to carrying a cargo of molten sulphur, and given a name change to \"Marine Sulphur Queen\". In order to carry out the planned function of carrying molten sulphur, a continuous, independent tank 306 feet long, 30 feet 6 inches wide and 33 feet high was constructed out of the original holds, necessitating the removal of all transverse bulkheads in the original centerline tanks and modifying the internal structure; this tank in turn was divided into four smaller tanks internally. A void surrounded the tank on all sides, leaving a 2-foot clearance on the sides and bottom, with three feet left between the top and the ship's weather deck. A steam system was installed throughout to maintain the molten sulphur at roughly .\n\nThe ship's last voyage began on 2 February 1963 out of Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of sulphur weighing 15,260 tons. On 4 February, near Florida, an ordinary radio message was sent by a crewman, giving the position of the ship at . \"Marine Sulphur Queen\" was listed as missing on 6 February. A search of the Straits of Florida where the ship was believed to have gone down was called off after 19 days, after yielding life preservers and some debris, but no trace of the ship or the 39 men aboard her. At the time of her 4 February position, she was in rough, nearly-following seas of 16 feet, with northerly winds of 25–46 knots.\n\nA Coast Guard investigation concluded several facts about the \"Marine Sulphur Queen\" which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and along the sides of the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once shorting out a major electrical generator. Caked sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure.\n\nThe Coast Guard also noted that the T2 tanker class had a characteristic that it has a \"weak back\", meaning the keel would split at a point weakened by corrosion, usually around midships. Such a splitting had happened on several T2 tankers, and many were discovered during inspections to have hairline or larger fractures within the keel and on major frames. Companies who owned T2 tankers were ordered to pay attention to the keel when inspecting. Former crewmen also testified that corrosion was everywhere, mentioning inoperable temperature gauges, a ruptured steam coil, and worn packing around the screws. It was recorded that \"Marine Sulphur Queen\" was scheduled for a drydock inspection in January 1963, but it was postponed by the owners, who had complained that cargo deliveries were behind and they needed their ships to catch up. One new crewman, on reporting to the ship just before it sailed for the last time, turned to his wife and pronounced it \"a floating garbage can.\"\n\nIn the closing of the inquiry the Coast Guard had this to say:\n\nThe Coast Guard also recommended that no remaining T2 tanker be converted into a sulphur carrier without taking into consideration the structure of the ship as originally built. \"First, the acceptability of any conversion must be considered on its individual merits, having regard for the existing condition of the vessel and the proposed cargo, route, and service. Secondly, the objection to the conversion of an existing T2 or another tanker of comparable age is associated with the probable condition of the vessel, particularly the cargo portion, due to age, as much as it is due to design considerations.\"\n\nThe loss of the ship was subject of a lawsuit filed within weeks of the sinking by relatives of the crew members seeking 2.5 million dollars in damages under two specific federal acts (the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. § 688; and the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. § 761), based upon maritime laws regarding the unseaworthiness of a vessel. Marine Sulphur Transport Corporation (the owners of the ship), and Marine Transport Lines, Inc. (demise charterer) petitioned for exoneration or at least a limitation of liability. The amount of damages sought would grow to $20 million by 1969.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals (2nd Circuit) concluded that:\n\nIn its 25 April 1972 ruling the court denied the exoneration of the owners and found them liable in regard to the unseaworthiness of the ship. It awarded damages to the crew relatives, but denied them punitive damages; the reason for it, as stated in the Coast Guard report, was that no one knew how the ship was lost, and in the absence of the remains of the vessel, they could go no further:\n\n\"The wrongful death claimants therefore sustained their burden of proving unseaworthiness and there remained only the issue of whether or not one or more of the conditions of unseaworthiness or some other agency caused the disaster. The court found in explicit terms that 'no one knows how the ship was lost.' The resolution of the question of liability will, under the circumstances, be determined by the allocation of the burden of proof on the causation issue, the existence of a rebuttable presumption and whether or not that presumption has been met.\" \n\nNearly 20 years prior to the loss of the \"Marine Sulphur Queen\", the United States General Accounting Office published a report titled \"TO INQUIRE INTO THE DESIGN METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION OF WELDED STEEL MERCHANT VESSELS, 15 July 1946\", which was essentially a report of concern over civilian merchant ships, specifically T2 tankers, fracturing amidships at the keel. Even during World War II, the federal government was concerned over the large number of merchant ship casualties not resulting from combat, and investigation centered on possible shoddy construction.\n\nA sister ship, SS \"Sylvia L. Ossa\", went down in heavy seas east of Bermuda on 15 October 1976; all that was recovered was debris and a lifeboat in which the quick-release mechanism was still intact.\n\nThe loss of the ship and crew with no trace other than bits of debris placed it on the list of incidents in the Bermuda Triangle. Writers of the subject have placed this ship in every work, sometimes agreeing with the Coast Guard report, other times coming up with their own theories. Vincent Gaddis was the first writer to coin the name \"Bermuda Triangle\" in his article for \"Argosy\" Magazine in the February 1964 issue, and \"Marine Sulphur Queen\" was the first Triangle \"victim\" he mentioned, barely a year after the ship sank:\n\n\"With a crew of thirty-nine, the tanker Marine Sulphur Queen began its final voyage on 2 February 1963, from Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of molten sulphur. Its destination was Norfolk, Virginia, but it actually sailed into the unknown...\"\n\nGaddis himself gave no theory as to the sinking, and ignored the many physical and personnel discrepancies cited by the Coast Guard. What he did was to reduce the loss of the ship to sailing \"into the unknown\", as did many writers after him. The effect was to leave an aura of mystery, and as such, many theories, some very outlandish, have been postulated to explain the disappearance of the ship.\n\nThe Sci-Fi Channel posted a summary of its program \"The Bermuda Triangle: Startling New Secrets\" on its website, in which it said that all that was recovered was a lifeboat. The Coast Guard had listed all that was recovered and identified for its report, as well as assembling the items for public display during the inquiry, which was photographed. A lifeboat was not among the debris, nor was one recovered.\n\nA 1977 episode of \"In Search Of\" discussed the \"Marine Sulphur Queen\" incident.\n\nThe following works on the Bermuda Triangle mention the \"Marine Sulphur Queen\":\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "977502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=977502", "title": "Underground City, Montreal", "text": "Underground City, Montreal\n\nRÉSO, commonly referred to as The Underground City (), is the name applied to a series of interconnected office towers, hotels, shopping centres, residential and commercial complexes, convention halls, universities and performing arts venues that form the heart of Montreal's central business district, colloquially referred to as Downtown Montreal. The name refers to the underground connections between the buildings that compose the network, in addition to the network's complete integration with the city's entirely underground rapid transit system, the Montreal Metro. Moreover, the first iteration of the Underground City was developed out of the open pit at the southern entrance to the Mount Royal Tunnel, where Place Ville Marie and Central Station stand today.\nThough most of the connecting tunnels pass underground, many of the key passageways and principal access points are located at ground level, and there is also one skybridge (between Lucien-L'Allier Metro station and Gare Lucien L'Allier). In this regard, the Underground City is more of an indoor city (ville intérieure) than a truly subterranean city, although there are vast commercial sectors located entirely underground.\n\nThe network is particularly useful during Montreal's long winters, during which time well over half a million people are estimated to use it every day. The network is largely climate controlled and well-lit, and is arranged in a U-shape with two principal north–south axes connected by an east–west axis. Combined, there are 32 kilometres' worth of tunnels over twelve square kilometres of the most densely populated part of Montreal. In total, there are more than 120 exterior access points to the network, not including the sixty or so Metro stations located outside the official limits of the RÉSO, some of which have their own smaller tunnel networks. Some of the city's larger institutions, namely McGill University, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Concordia University and the Université de Montréal, also have campus tunnel networks separate from the Underground City.\n\nIn 2004, the downtown network of the underground city was re-branded and given the name RÉSO, which is a homophone of the French word \"réseau\", or network. The \"O\" at the end of the word is the logo of the Montreal Metro. Schematic maps bearing the RÉSO logo are found throughout the network. The largest and best-known segment is located in the centre of downtown, delimited by the Peel and Place-des-Arts Metro stations on the Green Line and the Lucien-L'Allier and Place-d'Armes stations on the Orange Line.\n\nThe underground city is promoted as an important tourist attraction by most Montreal travel guidebooks, and as an urban planning achievement it is impressive. For most Montrealers, however, it tends to be considered more as a large mall complex linking Metro stations — they may not even know they are in it. Many Canadian cities have some kind of tunnel or skywalk system downtown to help people avoid the weather. Most parts of the Montreal underground city are open while the Metro is in operation (5:30 AM to 1:00 AM), though some are closed outside of business hours. Maps of the underground city and the Metro can be obtained free of charge from all Metro stations, and the network of buildings is indicated on most maps of the downtown core.\n\nNearly 500,000 people use it per day. It is also the largest underground complex in the world. It stretches for 32 kilometers (20 miles) and covers 4 million square meters. According to official statistics, its corridors link up with 10 metro stations, 2 bus terminals, 1,200 offices, about 2,000 stores including 2 major department stores, approximately 1,600 housing units, 200 restaurants, 40 banks, 40 movie theatres and other entertainment venues, 7 major hotels, 4 universities, Place des Arts, a cathedral, the Bell Centre (home of the Montreal Canadiens), and 3 exhibition halls: the Place Bonaventure, the Convention Centre (Palais des Congrès de Montréal) and the Olympic Centre.\n\nThe vision for the underground city was originally that of urbanist Vincent Ponte, for whom a commemorative plaque was unveiled in November 2006 at Place Ville-Marie. The first link of the underground city arose with the construction of the Place Ville-Marie office tower and underground shopping mall, built in 1962 to cover an unsightly pit of railway tracks north of the Central Station. A tunnel linked it to Central Station and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.\n\nThe advent of the Montreal Metro in 1966, in time for Expo 67, brought tunnels joining Bonaventure station to the Château Champlain hotel, the Place du Canada office tower, Place Bonaventure, Central Station, and Windsor Station, forming the core of the Underground City. Square-Victoria-OACI station connected to the Tour de la Bourse, Montreal's stock exchange building.\n\nAdding to the development of the underground city was the Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission's policy of offering the aerial rights above Metro station entrances for construction through emphyteutic leases, an advantageous way to acquire prime real estate. When the Metro began running in 1966, ten buildings were already connected directly to Metro stations; development would continue until only three free-standing station entrances (Square-Victoria-OACI, St-Laurent and Place-des-Arts) remained in the central segment.\n\nIn 1974, the Complexe Desjardins office tower complex was constructed, spurring the construction of a \"second downtown\" underground city segment between Place-des-Arts and Place-d'Armes station, via Place des Arts, Complexe Desjardins, the Complexe Guy Favreau federal government building, and the Palais des Congrès (convention centre).\n\nBetween 1984 and 1992, the underground city expanded, with the construction of three major linked shopping centres in the Peel and McGill Metro station areas: Cours Mont-Royal, Place Montréal-Trust, and the Promenades Cathédrale (built underneath Christ Church Cathedral). McGill station was already linked with The Bay, Eaton's (now the Complexe Les Ailes), Centre Eaton, and two other office/mall complexes. Between 1984 and 1989, the underground city grew from of passages to almost .\n\nMega-projects added to the size throughout the 1990s, including Le 1000 De La Gauchetière (the tallest building in Montreal), Le 1250 René-Lévesque, and the Montreal World Trade Centre. Although these buildings have only a secondary commercial sector, they use their connection to the underground city as a selling point for their office space. Also, the construction of a tunnel between Eaton Centre and Place Ville-Marie consolidated the two central halves of the underground city. The construction of the Bell (originally Molson) Centre connected Lucien-L'Allier Metro station to the underground city, as well as replacing Windsor Station with the new Gare Lucien-L'Allier commuter train station.\n\nFinally, in 2003, the complete redevelopment of the Quartier international de Montréal consolidated several segments of the central underground city with continuous pedestrian corridors. The construction of the ICAO headquarters joined Place Bonaventure to Square-Victoria-OACI station, which in turn was joined to the Palais des Congrès and Place-d'Armes station via the new Caisse de dépôt et de placement building and a tunnel under Place Jean-Paul Riopelle. Uniquely, the new tunnel sections in the Quartier International contain educational and artistic displays sponsored by major Montreal museums. As a result of this construction, one can now walk all the way across the centre of downtown, from the UQAM Sherbrooke Pavilion at the corner of Sainte Famille Street and Sherbrooke Street to the Lucien-L'Allier Metro station just south-west of the Bell Centre, without going outside — a span of as the crow flies, or approximately walking distance.\n\nOn Friday, August 24, 2007, construction crews discovered a seven-meter-long fissure in the ceiling of an underground corridor linking the McGill station to The Bay store located under de Maisonneuve Boulevard, between Aylmer Street and Union Avenue. The station, the Underground City shops, and above ground streets and buildings were closed to assess whether there was any risk of collapse of the structure. Service on the Métro Green Line was halted between Berri-UQAM and Lionel-Groulx stations until Sunday evening. According to a spokesperson for the Hudson's Bay Company, city workers may have caused the damage by hitting a nearby pillar.\n\nDuring the weekend, city workcrews worked non-stop to shore up the sagging slab of concrete, installing more than one thousand temporary metal supports.\n\nOn Monday, August 27, 2007, service was restored to the Green Line, and all streets but the block of de Maisonneuve boulevard between Union and Aylmer were reopened to traffic. The one block that was not open to traffic was open to pedestrians. All buildings reopened, including The Bay. Officials said that it would take months to fix the problem. While inspecting the site, it was discovered that 2021 Union, the Parkade Montreal building, was in danger of having concrete side panels fall off. City engineers performed emergency repairs. A report later blamed the construction of a bike path for the damage. Street traffic on De Maisonneuve resumed in March 2008.\n\nThe central segment interconnects the following seven Metro stations via indoor walkway. As the Berri-UQAM station, which allows transfers between the Green, Orange and Yellow lines, is two Metro stops from the closest station in this segment, in many cases it is quicker to walk than to take the Metro. The lists of connected facilities which follow are grouped by segment and nearest Metro station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hub of the Metro network located two Metro stations east of Place-des-Arts at the eastern edge of downtown is the transfer point for changing between the Green, Orange and Yellow lines.\n\nLocated one Metro station west of Peel, this station is at the center of the Sir George Williams campus of Concordia University.\n\nOne Metro station west of Guy-Concordia, this station is at the western edge of downtown and just inside the territory of Westmount.\n\nSituated two Metro stations south of Berri-UQAM, this station is a major hub for bus transportation on the south shore.\n\n\nThis station is the eastern transfer point between the Orange and Blue lines.\n\n\n\nEvery February, Art Souterrain presents a journey through the central segment of the Underground City during the Montreal Highlights Festival, showing contemporary artistic projects.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5322293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5322293", "title": "Western Australia border", "text": "Western Australia border\n\nThe Western Australian border was originally designated as 129th meridian east longitude (129° east). However, the border marked on the ground is some distance from this line. Kununurra is the closest town to the Western Australian border, being about 25 km west of the border. The closest settlement is Border Village, 1,734 km to the south on the South Australian side of the border, on Eyre Highway.\n\nThe Western Australian (WA) border marked on the ground, is not as straight as it looks on a map. The Northern Territory border with Western Australia and the South Australian border with Western Australia are displaced east–west by approximately 127 metres, due to errors within the limits of surveying technology available in the 1920s.\n\nWhere Western Australia meets the Northern Territory (NT) and South Australia (SA) borders is a 127-metre segment running east–west along the 26th parallel south latitude (26° south).\n\nIn June 1968, two monuments were erected to mark each end of this 127-metre segment, At the easternmost of these concrete border markers all three borders meet, at Surveyor Generals Corner.\n\nIn 1788 Governor Phillip claimed the continent of Australia only as far west as the 135th meridian east (135° east) in accordance with his commission. (26 January 1788 – MAP)\n\nIt has been suggested that the 1788 claim by the British of 135° east was in reference to Spain's claims under the Treaty of Tordesillas. Spain was seen as no longer having an interest in the area. On the other hand, the other signatories to the treaty, the Portuguese still had a presence in Macau and East Timor. Adoption of 135° east as a boundary would minimise provocation of the Portuguese. By 1825, however, Britain was powerful enough and found it convenient to adopt the original line of the Portuguese under the treaty, 129° east.\n\nThe line of 129° east first became a border in Australia as the western border of New South Wales (NSW) in 1825 (16 July 1825 – MAP).\n\nOn 16 July 1825, the western boundary of New South Wales was relocated at 129° east to take in the new settlement at Melville Island.\n\nFrom 1825 to 1829 129° east was the NSW border, except that the settlement of King George's Sound, now Albany, was part of New South Wales from its establishment on 26 December 1826, until 7 March 1831 when it was made part of the Swan River Colony.\n\nFollowing the settlement of the Swan River Colony (SRC) in 1829 (2 May 1829 – MAP), the eastern boundary was declared to be 129° east, that is coinciding with the western boundary of New South Wales at the time.\n\nThe Swan River Colony, started in 1829, was commissioned as the colony of Western Australia in March 1831.\n\nFrom 1829 to 1832 129° east was the SRC/NSW border.\n\nThe name of the Swan River Colony changed to Western Australia in 1832 (6 February 1832 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1832 to 1846 129° east was the WA/NSW border.\n\nIn 1846 the colony of North Australia (NA) was proclaimed by Letters Patent, which was all of New South Wales north of 26° south. (17 February 1846 – Map).\n\nFrom 1846 to 1847 129° east was the WA/NA border north of 26° south and the WA/NSW border south of the 26th parallel.\n\nIn 1847 the colony of North Australia was revoked and reincorporated into New South Wales. (15 April 1847 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1847 to 1860 129° east was once again the WA/NSW border.\n\nIn 1860 South Australia, which had been proclaimed a colony in 1836 (28 December 1836 – MAP), west to the 132° east, changed their western border from 132° east to 129° east (1860 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1860 to 1863 129° east was the WA/NSW border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.\n\nIn 1863 that part of New South Wales to the north of South Australia was annexed to South Australia by Letters Patent and became known as the Northern Territory of South Australia (NToSA). (6 July 1863 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1863 to 1911 129° east was the WA/NToSA border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel\n\nIn 1911 the Northern Territory (NT) was split off from South Australia to be administered by the Commonwealth. (1 January 1911 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1911 to 1927 129° east was the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.\n\nIn 1927 the Northern Territory was split into two territories, North Australia (NA) and Central Australia (CA). (1 March 1927 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1927 to 1931 129° east was once again the WA/NA border and WA/CA border, both north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.\n\nIn 1931 North Australia and Central Australia were reunited as the Northern Territory.\n(12 June 1931 – MAP).\n\nFrom 1931 to the present 129° east has been the WA/NT border north of 26° south and the WA/SA border south of the 26th parallel.\n\nFixing the position of the border of Western Australia on the ground has a rich history. In March 1920 the Western Australian Government Astronomer, H. B. Curlewis gave a talk at the WA Museum about the history of the determination of longitude, in relation to using what was at that time a new technology, by using wireless time signals to determine the position of the border between South Australia and Western Australia, as close to the 129th east meridian as possible.\n\nPreliminary work on the border determinations began in November 1920 when the Government Astronomer for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis met at Deakin, Western Australia on the East-West Trans-Australian Railway.\n\nThe other members of the party were Messrs. Clive Melville Hambidge and J. Crabb, of the Survey Department; Warrant Officer V. D. Bowen, in charge of wireless apparatus lent by the Defence Department; and Mr. C. A. Maddern, of the Adelaide Observatory, all from Adelaide.\n\nConcrete piers for the astronomical observing instruments were erected in readiness for the final determinations that were to be held in 1921. Observations were made for the purpose of testing under field conditions the instruments and methods to be used in 1921.\n\nThis expedition, to determine 129° east on the ground, created worldwide scientific interest and involved the cooperation of the Astronomer Royal and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with wireless time signals sent by the French wireless Service, that were transmitted from the at Saint-Genis-Laval, near Lyons, France, between 17 and 24 November 1920. Wireless time signals were also sent from the Adelaide Observatory, transmitted by the Adelaide Radio Station, to enable the beats of the Adelaide sidereal clock to be used as a control on the rate of the chronometer used for the boundary observation.\n\nAfter these initial tests a comprehensive program was then arranged for the second stage of the border determinations, which were to take place during the following year and dates were then set for that to happen, from 20 April to 10 May 1921.\n\nOne of the concrete piers mentioned, which were cubic concrete blocks slightly smaller than a cubic metre, would later be named as the Deakin Pillar (1921), being from where the larger border marker, the Deakin Obelisk (1926), would be set out from.\n\nThe Deakin Pillar is approximately 2.82 km west of the Deakin Obelisk. The Deakin Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of 1926 to 129° east.\n\nThe Deakin Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisk, which determines, on the ground, the South Australian border with Western Australia by a line drawn south to the coastline of the Great Australian Bight and north through this point to 26° south.\n\nShortly after the 1921 determinations of the border of South Australia and Western Australia, the Government Astronomer for South Australia, G.F. Dodwell and the Government Astronomer of Western Australia, H.B. Curlewis and party travelled by the State Ship Bambra to the port of Wyndham, Western Australia.\nFrom Wyndham they were guided by Michael Patrick (\"M.P.\") Durack to a point he perceived as the northern boundary between his Argyle Downs Station and Jack Kilfoyle's Rosewood Station, which was also Western Australia's border with the Northern Territory or 129° east. Most of Rosewood station is in the Northern Territory but some distance further south Rosewood also extends into the East Kimberley Region of Western Australia.\n\nFrom the chosen position, two concrete pillars were erected similar to those described above and portable radio masts set up, before the determinations were carried out by the scientists using the same methods of wireless time signals as were used at Deakin.\n\nOne of the concrete pillars erected, which was the one used as the point of the determinations, was marked by the expedition party to show how far east of Greenwich they were in hours, minutes and seconds, and became known as the Austral Pillar.\n\nThe Austral Pillar, the point selected for the scientific determinations of 1921 would later be found to be about 2 km east from the border of 129° east on that part of Rosewood Station, therefore inside the Northern Territory.\n\nThe Kimberley Obelisk was erected as closely as was possible with the technology of 1927 to 129° east. Over several weeks during 1927, a Western Australian survey crew from the WA Department of Lands and Surveys travelled to Wyndham, then to the Austral Pillar site to set out from that point to the border, where they then erected the much more substantial Kimberley Obelisk.\n\nThe Kimberley Obelisk has a copper plug embedded into the top of the concrete obelisk, which officially determines the WA/NT border on the ground, near 129° east, by a line drawn north to the northern coastline near the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and south through this point at the Kimberley Obelisk to the 26th parallel.\n\n"}
