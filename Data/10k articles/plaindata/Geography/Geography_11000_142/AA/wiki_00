Each district has a district council, formerly district boards, for which the districts were established in 1982, when Hong Kong was under British rule. However, the districts have limited relevance to the population, as few public services operate according to district boundaries. The police, fire services, health services and hospital authority, and postal service each define their own idiosyncratic geographic divisions. However major departments, such as the Education Bureau, do provide information based on district.\n\nIn the 1860s, residents speaking the same dialects were often grouped together, and social structure was more important than district structure. Merchants often travelled together as guilds and sold common goods across different areas. Organizations such as Nam Pak Hong, Tung Wah Hospital Committee and \"District Watch Committee\" often cut across any native district lines. The concept of boundary separation only became important around 1870, when cultural conflicts increased between coolies, Chinese and the British. One of the first legal attempt to control districts came in 1888 under the \"European District Reservation Ordinance\", which reserved areas exclusively to Europeans. The first \"Town Planning Ordinance\" did not appear until 1939.\n\nThe District Administration Scheme was implemented in 1982 with the establishment of a district board and a district management committee in each of the districts in Hong Kong. The aim of the scheme is to achieve a more effective co-ordination of government activities in the provision of services and facilities at the district level, ensure that the Government is responsive to district needs and problems and promote public participation in district affairs. From 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999, the former district boards were replaced by provisional district boards. The provisional district boards were in turn replaced on 1 January 2000, with 18 district councils.\n\nThere have been two major changes on district divisions since their implementation in 1982:\n\nThe population density per district varies from 783 (Islands) to 52,123 (Kwun Tong) per km. Before the combination of Mong Kok and Yau Tsim districts in 1995, Mong Kok District had the highest density (~120,000 /km²). The following figures come from the 2006 Population By-census. Note that the median monthly per capita income is deduced from the median monthly domestic household income, the average domestic household size and the labour force.\n\nThe Home Affairs Department is responsible for the District Administration Scheme, community building and community involvement activities, minor environmental improvement projects and minor local public works, and the licensing of hotels and guesthouses, bedspace apartments and clubs. It promotes the concept of effective building management and works closely with other government departments to consistently improve the standard of building management in Hong Kong. It monitors the provision of new arrival services and identifies measures to meet the needs of new arrivals. It also disseminates information relating to and, where necessary, promotes the public's understanding of major government policies, strategies and development plans; and collects and assesses public opinion on relevant issues affecting the community. These responsibilities are discharged primarily through the 18 district offices covering the whole of Hong Kong.\n\nAs head of each district office, the district officer is the representative of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government at the district level. He has the responsibility of overseeing directly the operation of the District Administration Scheme in the district. He is charged with implementing and co-ordinating the execution of district programmes, ensuring that the advice of the district council is properly followed up, and promoting residents' participation in district affairs. In addition, he is required to maintain close liaison with different sectors of the community and reflect their concerns and problems to the Government. It is his duty to ensure that district problems are resolved promptly through inter-departmental consultation and co-operation. Also, he acts as a link between the district council and departments and serves as a mediator between them when problems arise. The district officer is also involved with the community at every level. He has a role to mediate in the resolution of disputes between corporate bodies and residents. He performs an advisory and liaison role in providing assistance to building management bodies. He operates a public enquiry service to enable the community to have easy access to services and information provided by government. In emergency situations, the district officer is responsible for co-ordinating various departments' efforts on the ground for ensuring the effective provision of relief services.\n\nDistrict councils play an essential advisory role on district matters and issues affecting the whole of Hong Kong as appropriate. The functions of a district council are:\n\nThe district councils also advise on the management of community centres, which should be in the best interest of the local residents. The district councils initiate, organise and sponsor community involvement projects and activities aimed at enhancing community spirit and social cohesion and promoting the well-being of people in the districts. These range from large-scale district festivals to the formation of local youth choirs and dance troupes. They have also achieved notable success in improving the local environment by undertaking minor environmental improvement projects such as the provision of rest gardens, rain shelters and amenity planting.\n\nIn the 2003/04 financial year, $205.6 million has been allocated for the district councils.\n\nDepartments send representatives to district council meetings, to consult them and, where appropriate, act on their advice and keep them informed of government policies and programmes in general and, more specifically, of the work of departments in the district and local matters that are likely to affect the livelihood, living environment or well-being of the residents within a district.\n\nThe second-term district councils, comprising 529 members (400 elected, 102 appointed by the chief executive and 27 ex-officio who are chairmen of the rural committees in the New Territories), commenced on 1 January 2004.\n\nThe district management committee in each district is chaired by the district officer. It is a government committee consisting of representatives of the core departments in the district, and provides a forum for departments to discuss and resolve district problems. It responds positively to the advice and requests of the district council and submits a comprehensive written report on its work to each meeting of the district council. To enhance communication between the district management committee and the district council, the district council chairman, vice-chairman and chairmen of district council committees are invited to join district management committee as members.\n\n\n"}

In many ways, ecological urbanism is an evolution of, and a critique of, Landscape Urbanism arguing for a more holistic approach to the design and management of cities. The term appeared first in 1998 as \"EcoUrbanism\" in a book by Architect and Planner Miguel Ruano, who defined it as \"the development of multi-dimensional sustainable human communities within harmonious and balanced built environments\". The term was used later in April 2003 at a conference at the University of Oregon, and again in 2006 in a paper by Jeffrey Hou. The phrase was used by Mohsen Mostafavi in 2007 in \"Intervention Architecture\" and in a lecture at the Canadian Centre for Architecture, ecological urbanism as a project was largely started at Harvard University Graduate School of Design, with a conference, and exhibition, and book.\n\nArguing for a \"new ethics and aesthetics of the urban,\" the 656-page \"Ecological Urbanism\" book, edited by Mohsen Mostafavi with Gareth Doherty, was published in May 2010 by Lars Müller Publishers (). The book follows the conference, and exhibition, held at the GSD in 2009. The book has a long list of contributors, including Rem Koolhaas, Homi K. Bhabha, Mitchell Joachim, Andrea Branzi, and about 130 others. A blog during the conference is part of the book. According to \"Architecture Today\", the book is \"one of the few books that recognises and articulates how, if this systems-based approach is to be successful, it needs to design, integrate and express complex systems and social processes in ways that are fundamentally humane.\" The book has been reviewed and cited in many publications, including [\"Metropolis Magazine\"], \"The Journal of Landscape Architecture\", and Cities magazine. Events and discussions on the book have been held at the 2010 Venice Biennale, the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York, and at the Van Alen Institute in New York.\n\nIn his introduction to the \"Ecological Urbanism\", \"Why Ecological Urbanism? Why Now?\", extracted in \"Topos: The International Review of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design\", Mostafavi asks: \"Increased numbers of people and cities go hand in hand with a greater exploitation of the world’s limited resources. Every year, more cities are feeling the devastating impacts of this situation. What are we to do? What means do we have as designers to address this challenging reality?\n\nJeb Brugmann in his book \"Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities Are Changing the World\" (Bloomsbury Press, 2009) says we need to become \"masters of a stable, just, and ecological urbanism.\" For Brugmann, \"The first step towards ecological urbanism is increasing the energy and nutrient productivity within the city, but the only way to move sufficiently from extractive mode to a sustainable productive mode is to think, design, and develop at the scale of the City.\"\n\nThere have been a number of recent conferences and lectures on the project of ecological urbanism, including: The New Aesthetics and Ecological Urbanism at Peking University in October 2010, New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism: A Prospectus for the Super City, in October 2010. The University of Washington’s urban initiative included a seminar on Now Urbanism and talks \"on Ecological Urbanism, Ecological Design for Healthy Cities, Networked Urbanism, and America’s War on Immigrants.” Eco-Urbanism: towards sustainable city living, was hosted by Nottingham University at the Shanghai Expo in August 2010.\n\nIn addition to courses at the GSD in 2008 and 2011, there have been courses on ecological urbanism at the Bergen School of Architecture, Oslo School of Architecture and Design, and Yale University. It is on numerous course syllabi, including Advanced Design Theories 2010 at Florida International University. Arizona State University expanded on the subject with a lecture by Charles Anderson, ASLA. Anderson stated that \"ecology is concerned with the relationships between all organisms and the environment. Together and coupled with aesthetic and expressionist design principles, they form the foundation for urban design.\"\n\nEcological urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis. Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.\n\nEcological Urbanism is explained as a successor to Landscape Urbanism without the difference between the two approaches, and the terms used in the new approach, being defined. Jason King sees it as an inadequately explained addition to a list of 61 other 'Fill-in-the-blank Urbanisms'. Tom Turner welcomes landscape and ecological urbanism as 'the most significant contributions to landscape design theory since the landscape architecture profession was launched in the mid-nineteenth century' but is 'unpersuaded by the change of name' \n"}

{"id": "9386460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9386460", "title": "Etymology of Assam", "text": "Etymology of Assam\n\nThe origin of the name of Assam, a state in India is unclear—among the competing theories, two attribute it to the terrain, whereas the others relate it to the Ahom people. Whatever the source of the English name, \"Assam\" is itself an anglicization.\n\nJohn Peter Wade (1805) called the Ahom kingdom, that commenced on the Konder Chokey, \"Kingdom of Assam\". Some have speculated that the Bodo word \"Ha-com\" meaning low land was Sanskritised to 'Asama', dating its origin to at least first millennium common era.. While some believe the name Asama is a Sanskrit originated word which means unparalleled because of its unequal terrain with hills interspersed with valleys\n\nBanikanta Kakati quotes Grierson in Linguistic Survey of India that \"While the Shan invaders called themselves Tai, they came to be referred to as \"Āsām\", \"Āsam\" and sometimes as \"Acam\" by the indigenous people of the country. The modern Assamese word \"Āhom\" by which the Tai people are known is derived from \"Āsām\" or \"Āsam\". The epithet applied to the Shan conquerors was subsequently transferred to the country over which they ruled and thus the name Kāmarūpa was replaced by Āsām, which ultimately took the Sanskritized form \"Asama\", meaning \"unequalled, peerless or uneven\" Satyendranath Sarma repeats this derivation while quoting Kakati. Colin Masica too endorses this view.\n\nSatyendra Nath Sarma writes \"Assamese is the easternmost Indo-Aryan language of India, spoken by nearly eight millions of people inhabiting mostly the Brahmaputra valley of Assam. The word Assamese is an English formation built on the same principle as Simhalese or Canarese etc. It is based on the English word Assam by which the British rulers referred to the tract covered by the Brahmaputra valley and its adjoining areas. But the people call their country Asama and their language Asamiya\".\"\nThe land referred to as Pragjyotisha in the Mahabharata is now accepted as present-day Assam and North Bengal. In the \"Bhismaparvan\", the Pragjyotisha king Bhagadatta is said to have joined the Kurukshetra war with an army of \"kirata\" and \"cinas\". Since the name China is derived from the Qin Dynasty (221 BCE - 206 BCE), the reference cannot be dated to earlier than the third century BCE. In the Ramayana, Pragjyotisha is situated on the Varaha mountain and not in present-day Assam; According to Shastri (2002), the author \"had no idea at all of its location and was just eager to refer to it as it had already become a celebrated town\". believes the center of the Pragjyotisha state was in upper Punjab that moved to Assam in the post epic period.\n\nThe Kamarupa kings called themselves the \"Maharajadhiraja\" of Pragjyotisha. One of the kings Vaidyadeva, referred to Pragjyotisha as a \"bhukti\" and Kamarupa as a \"mandala\" (a smaller division, possibly within Pragjyotisha).\n\nThe earliest epigraphic mention of the Assam region comes from the Samudragupta's Allahabad stone pillar from fourth century CE, where it is called \"Kamarupa\". The pillar lists the frontier kingdoms (\"pratyanta nripati\") and lists Kamarupa (Western Assam) along with Davaka, a region in the central Assam (undivided Nagaon district). Therefore, during the fourth century, the eastern boundary of the Kamarupa did not extend beyond west Assam. The Kalika Purana and the Yogini Tantra refer to Kamarupa as a kingdom from Karatoya in the west to Dikkaravasini in the east. Dikkaravasini is identified with present-day Sadiya. The copper-plate inscription from Vaidyadeva calls Kamarupa a \"mandala\" within his own kingdom. Later epigraphic sources from Assam call the kingdom \"Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa\". In the early twelfth century, epigraphic sources from the Pala dynasty mention Kamarupa as a \"mandala\" of the kingdom they ruled. The invasion of western Assam by Allauddin Hussein of Gaur up to Barnadi river in 1498 is recorded in coins from the early sixteenth century, declaring Hussein as the conqueror of \"Kamru\" (Kamrup) (and not \"Assam\").\n\nAssam, Asam and other variations started appearing in relatively recent times, and their uses cannot be attributed to any period earlier than the sixteenth century, and is associated with the Shan invaders. The names appeared primarily in three different scripts: the Assamese, Persian and the Roman scripts. The sixteenth century is the period when Srimanta Sankardeva established his Ekasarana Dharma. This was accompanied by a profusive production in literature. At the same time, Vishwa Singha established the Koch kingdom in the west and the Ahom kingdom saw both a rapid expansion in territory and an increasing Hindu and Assamese influence in its court under Suhungmung. This increased prominence of the Ahom kingdom brought it to the attention of those outside the Brahmaputra valley.\n\nLocally, Vaishnavite writers and biographers used different forms of the name indiscriminately (e.g. Āsām, Āsam, Asam) to refer to the Ahom community. The earliest mention of \"Asama\" is found in the Assamese Bhagavat of Sankardeva, which was composed in early sixteenth century. The relevant stanza is (in iTrans):\n<poem>\n</poem>\nThe Ahoms were called \"Asam\" in the eighteenth century \"Darrangraj Vamshavali\" of Suryya Khari Daibajna; variously as \"Āsām\", \"Āsam\", and \"Asam\" in the seventeenth century \"Shankar-carit\" of Daityari Thakur; and \"Acam\" in \"Kamrupar Buranji\". According to a count provided by , the \"Kamrupar Buranji\" names the country some thirty times, of which \"Āsām\" was used three times, \"Ācam\" was used three times, and \"Ācām\" was used for the rest, though in other Buranjis other spellings are also seen. Furthermore, Bhuyan mentions that though both \"\" (\"s\") and \"\" (\"c\") have been used in the name, it is likely that it was pronounced mostly with .\n\nThe name \"asama\" (as well as \"acam\", \"asam\", \"asam\", \"asam\") was used in the form \"asamakshara\" to denote the Ahom script in Sanskrit-Ahom bilingual copper plate grants of the Ahom kings.\n\nAs opposed to the local uses, where \"Asam\" and similar formations were used to denote the Ahom community, external sources used variations of \"Asam\" to denote the kingdom ruled by the Ahoms. The Ain-I-Akbari of the sixteenth century uses the form \"Asham\" (آشام) to denote the Ahom kingdom. The official chronicler of Mir Jumla also calls the place \"Asam\".\n\nThe earliest Europeans who came in contact with Assam (and who had the opportunity to write the name in the Latin script), were travelers who went to Bengal and adventurers who accompanied military expeditions against the Ahom kingdom; these groups used variations of the name \"Asam\" to denote the kingdom.\nIn a map of \"Kingdom of Bengale\", drawn by Joh. van Leenen around 1661 and published around 1662, Assam was clearly named and correctly identified. One of the first unambiguous references comes from Thomas Bowrey in 1663 about Mir Jumla's death: \"They lost the best of Nabobs, the Kingdome of Acham, and, by consequence, many large privileges\". Though Bowrey wrote his manuscript in the 17th century, the manuscript itself was published for the first time in the 20th century. On the other hand, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's \"Travels in India\", published in 1676 uses the spelling \"Assem\" for Assam in the French original (\"Aſem\" in the English translation, published in 1678). Thus the earliest English use of the name was \"Aſem\", with a Long s.\n\nColonialists then followed these travelers and adventurers. Both Grierson and Gait agree that the British used \"Asam\" before finally settling on \"Assam\". In various documents of the British East India Company relating to the last few Ahom kings, the name of country was mentioned as \"Assam\". The 1826 Treaty of Yandabo, marking the conquest of the Ahom kingdom at the hands of the British, uses \"Assam\" to denote the area under the erstwhile Ahoms and its protectorates (Darrang Koch, Jaintias, Kacharis and some hill areas in the present Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland).\n\nAfter the British took control of the region, the name \"Assam\" was extended to the province that was then much larger than the Ahom kingdom. It then included, Garo Hills and Lushai Hills (Mizoram). Since that time, the boundaries of Assam have been repeatedly redrawn, though the name \"Assam\" remained. Today, the political boundary of Assam contains roughly the historical Ahom Kingdom and its protectorates, the Kachari kingdom, Koch Hajo and a part of the Jaintia Kingdom.\n\nAccording to , the English word \"Assamese\" parallels other demonyms (\"Chinese\", \"Sinhalese\", \"Nepalese\", etc.), building on \"Assam\", an Anglicization of the Bengali word \"Asam\" that itself refers to the Brahmaputra Valley. Other writers (most notably Banikanta Kakati and S N Sarma) have repeated this claim. has mentioned that the British used \"Asam\" before finally settling on \"Assam\"; though Grierson claims that the form \"Assam\" is English, \"The Assam Tribune\" has reported the finding of a Dutch map drawn around 1661 with a label \"Assam\".\n\nThe precise etymology of the name \"Assam\" or \"Asam\" () is not known, though many explanations have been put forward. Among the different theories, two attribute the name to the terrain of the region while three attribute it to the Shan invaders of the 13th century.\n\nOne of the earliest theories published was provided by Baden-Powell in 1896, when he proposed that the name could possibly derive from the Bodo \"Ha-com\", meaning \"low or level country\". He rejected the possibility that the name \"Assam\" (\"Asam\") could be derived from \"Aham\" (Ahom). Subsequent writers like P. C. Choudhury and R N Mosahary lend credence to this theory. So, if Ha-Com is the source of Sanskrit Asama, then it traces its origin from very early times, long before any Ahom invasion.\n\nTwo different meanings of the Sanskrit word \"Asama\" have been used to explain the name: one meaning \"uneven\" (terrain) and the other \"unequaled\".\n\nThe second theory Gait reported is that \"Asama\", meaning \"unequal\" or \"peerless\", was a name the local people gave the undefeated Ahoms, according to a tradition that the Ahoms themselves believed in. Gait rejects this notion as well, noting that the local tribal people would not have given a Sanskrit name to the invaders.\n\nThough Gait rejects both these explanations, he nevertheless asserts that the name is somehow associated with the Ahoms. George Grierson, Banikanta Kakati, and Dimbeswar Neog, also reject the Sanskrit origin of the name. Satyendra Nath Sharma accepts Banikanta Kakati's view \"in toto\".\n\nThough both explanations have been rejected in the academic literature, the notion that the name \"Assam\" has a Sanskrit origin continues to hold sway in popular perceptions, due mainly to two standard dictionaries of Assamese: \"Hemkox\" and \"Chandrakanta Abhidhan\". The \"Hemkox\" forwards the second theory, associating the name to the meaning \"unequaled\".\n\nGait reports that some associated the name with the Shan who are called \"Syam\" by the Assamese, an explanation which he found not convincing. nevertheless Grierson has accepted that the 13th century natives of Assam called the Shan (Sham) invaders by this name. Dimbeswar Neog notes that the Indic prefix \"a\"- does not necessarily mean an antonym in Assamese and it could just be a synonym (e.g. \"kumari\"/\"akumari\", \"bihane\"/\"abihane\"), a feature that is also seen in Sanskrit (\"sur\"/\"asur\"); therefore, \"Asham\" could mean the same as \"Sham\", and the name could be derived as \"Sham\" () > \"Āshām\" () > \"Āsam\" () > \"Asam\" (). Amalendu Guha, too derives it from \"Sham\"; but instead of using an Indo-Aryan rule, derives it from the Bodo form, \"Ha-Sham\", meaning the land of the \"Sham\" people. Masica too believes that \"Assam\" derives from an earlier attested form of \"asam\", \"acam\" which in turn is from a Burmese corruption of the name \"Shan/Shyam\".\n\n derives the name from a Tai root, \"cham\" (defeated), with an Indic prefix for negation, \"a-\", so that \"a-cham\" would mean undefeated.\n\n"}
{"id": "850705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=850705", "title": "Feminist geography", "text": "Feminist geography\n\nFeminist geography is an approach in human geography which applies the theories, methods and critiques of feminism to the study of the human environment, society and geographical space. The field of feminist geography, which uses a multidisciplinary approach, emerged in the 1970s out of the women’s movement's call on the academy to better incorporate women into academia both as producers and subjects. Feminist geography is a process of situating geographical research on an intersectional foundation thereby examining axes beyond gender to incorporate positions of race, class, ability, sexuality, etc. Through this practice, feminist geography prioritizes praxis within the field as established in feminist epistemology. The discipline has been subject to several controversies. \n\nThe geography of women focuses upon description of the effects on gender inequality. Its theoretical influences focus on welfare geography and liberal feminism. Geographically, feminist geographers emphasize on constraints of distance and spatial separation. As Seager et al. argues, gender is only the narrow-minded approach when understanding the oppression of women throughout the decades of colonial history. In such, understanding the geography of women would mean taking a critical approach in questioning the dimensions of age, class, ethnicity, orientation and other socio-economic factors (2004). An early reproach of geography of women approach was that gender roles were mainly explained as gender inequality, such as housewives and mothers, in combination with the some concept of spatial constraint. However, Foord and Gregson (1986) argued that the concept of gender roles narrows the focus to women, emerges from a static social theory, and presents women as victims. Furthermore, it gives a narrow reading of distance even though the geography of women displays how spatial constraint and separation enter into the construction of women’s position. Theorist Edward Said critiques the idea of geographical spaces in such a context where our actions on gendered practices of representation are fabricated through dominant ideological beliefs (2004). In relation to the misrepresentation of gender roles and taken-for-granted movements on feminine rights, we see that the challenges of the colonial present lies within the confinement of women in limited spatial opportunities. Hence, feminist geographies should consider and trace the inter-connections in all aspects of daily life; in other words, gender should be applied and developed in terms of space.\n\nSocialist feminist geography seeks to explain inequality and the relationship between capitalism and patriarchy. It uses Marxism and Socialist feminism to explain the interdependence of geography, gender relations and economic development under capitalism. Socialist feminist geography revolved around the questions of how to reduce gender inequality based on patriarchy and capitalism. It has theoretical influences on Marxism, socialist feminism. The geographical focus is on spatial separation, gender place, and localities. One of the key theoretical debates within socialist feminist geography revolved around the question of how best to articulate gender and class analysis. For instance, drawing on of married mainland Chinese immigrant women living in New York City. While women remain the primary object of analysis, and gender remains the primary social relation, Zhou is intensely aware that many other factors, such as class, also affect women’s post-migration experiences and circumstances.\n\nThere are two scales that socialist feminist geographers first worked primarily. First, at the urban scale, Anglo-American feminist geographers focused on the social and spatial separation of suburban homes from paid employment; this was seen as vital to the day-to-day and generational reproduction of workers and the development and maintenance of traditional gender relations in capitalist societies.\n\nSocialist feminist geographers widely attending to the ways that gender relations differ from place to place not only reflect, but also partly determine local economic changes. Judith Butler’s idea of citationality expands on the concept of the lack of agency to facilitate the presence of women within the discipline of geography. In such, we come to the awareness that whenever performative measures are taken to diminish women’s rights in geographical space, the conventions around it adapt around this context to make it seem as the norm. Likewise, feminist geographers are also drawing on a broader range of social, and particularly cultural theory, including psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, in order to develop a fuller understanding of how gender relations and identities are shaped and assumed. This has led to fundamental rethinking of the category gender, and the contradictions and possibilities presented by the seeming instability and insistent repetitions of gender norms in practice. The focus on multiple identifications and the influence of post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories has brought feminist geographers into dialogue with other strands of critical geography. But another consequence is that theoretical differences among feminist geographers are more obvious than in the past, but according to Monk 1994 the national differences between America and British geographers may be diminishing as both parties pursue new directions.\n\nFeminist geographies of difference concentrate upon the construction of gendered identities, differences among women, gender and constructions of nature by using cultural, post-structural, postcolonial and psychoanalytic theories, which writings of women of color, lesbian women, gay men and women from third world countries. In terms of geography, feminist geographers emphasize on micro-geographies of body, mobile identities, distance, separation and place, imagined geographies, colonialism and post-colonialism, and environment or nature.\n\nSince the late 1980s, many feminist geographers have moved on to three new research areas:\n\nFirst, feminist geographers contest and expand the category of genders between men and women. The difference in the construction of gender relations across race, ethnicity, age, religion, sexuality and nationality, becomes interesting for feminist geographers. Additionally, feminist geographers are also increasingly attentive to women who are positioned in various ways along the multiple axis of difference.\n\nSecond, in order to get better understanding of how gender relations and identities are formed and assumed, a broader extent of social theory, particular culture, are drawn by feminist geographers. Feminist geographers are more able to discuss and debate after the focus on multiple identifications and the influence of post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories.\n\nThird, a key area of discussion is about the difference between relativism and situated knowledge, and ways to reconcile partial perspectives with commitment to political action and social change.\n\nCritical human geography is defined as “a diverse and rapidly changing set of ideas and practices within human geography linked by a share commitment to emancipatory politics within and beyond the discipline, to the promotion of progressive social change and to the development of a broad range of critical theories and their application in geographical research and political practice.” (Johnston 2000).\n\nCritical human geography comes from Anglophonic geography in the mid-1990s. It presents a broad alliance of progressive approaches to the discipline. Critical human geographers draw on theoretical approaches such as anarchism, anti-colonialism, critical race theory, environmentalism, feminism, Marxism, nonrepresentational theory, post-Marxism, post-colonialism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, queer theory, situationism, and socialism. Much of the focus is on some of the key publications marking different eras in critical geography.\n\nCritical human geography must be understood as multiple, dynamic, and contested.\n\nRather than a specific sub-discipline of geography, feminist geography is often considered part of a broader postmodern, critical theory approach, often drawing from the theories of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler among others. More recent influences include critiques of feminism from post-colonial theorists. Feminist geographers often focus on the lived experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their own communities, rather than theoretical development without empirical work.\n\nMany feminist geographers study the same subjects as other geographers, but often with a focus on gender divisions. This concern has developed into a concern with wider issues of gender, family, sexuality, race, and class. Examples of areas of focus include:\n\nFeminist geographers are also deeply impacted and responding to contemporary globalization and neoliberal discourses that are manifested as being both transnational and translocal. \n\nIn addition to societal studies, Feminist Geography also critiques Human Geography and other academic disciplines, arguing that academic structures have been traditionally characterized by a patriarchal perspective, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the masculine bias of academic study. The British Geographer Gillian Rose's \"Feminism and Geography\" is one such sustained criticism, focused on Human Geography in Britain as being historically masculinist in its approach. This includes the writing of landscape as feminine (and thus as subordinate to male geographers), assuming a separation between mind and body. The following is referenced from Johnston & Sidaway (2004), and further describes such a separation and its influence on geography:\n\nOther feminist geographers have interrogated the ways in which the discipline of geography itself represents and reproduces the heterosexual male gaze. Feminist geographers such as Katherine McKittrick have asserted pointed critiques of the ways in which we see and understand space are fundamentally bound up in how we understand the hegemonic presence of the white male subject in history, geography and in the materiality of everyday space. Building off of Sylvia Wynter's theories of the racialized production of public and private space, McKittrick challenges “social landscapes that presume subaltern populations have no relationship to the production of space” and writes to document black female geographies in order to \"allow us to engage with a narrative that locates and draws on black histories and black subjects in order to make visible social lives which are often displaced, rendered ungeographic.” McKittrick stakes claim in the co-articulation of race and gender as they articulate space and she writes, “I am emphasizing here that racism and sexism are not simply bodily or identity based; racism and sexism are also spatial acts and illustrate black women’s geographic experiences and knowledges as they are made possible through domination.” Moreover, many feminist geographers have critiqued human geography for its centering of masculine knowledge and its emphasis on “objective” knowledge arguing instead for a use of situated knowledge which understands both observation and analysis as being rooted in partial objectivity.\n\nLinda McDowell and Joanne P. Sharp, both foundational feminist geographers and scholars, describe the struggle of gaining recognition in academia, “[It has been] ‘a long struggle to gain recognition within geography as a discipline that gender relations are a central organizing feature both of the material and symbolic worlds and of the theoretical basis of the discipline.’’  Feminist geographers struggle in academia in a variety of ways. Firstly, ideas that originate from feminist discourse are often seen as common sense once the wider field accepts them thereby invisibilizing geography that is explicitly feminist. Furthermore, feminist geography is understood to be the only subfield of geography where gender is explicitly addressed permitting the wider disciple to disengage from feminist challenges. Finally, within the field, some geographers believe that feminist practice has been fully integrated into the academy making feminist geography obsolete.\n\nChallenges of feminist geography are also embedded in the subfield itself. The epistemology of feminist geography argues that the positionality and lived experience of the geographers are as central to scholarship as what is being researched. In this way, feminist geographers must maintain diverse identities to fully engage with the disciple. Linda Peake and Gill Valentine point out that while feminist geography has addressed gender issues in more than twenty-five countries across the world, this scholarship is conducted by white female scholars from institutions in the Global North. In this way, feminist geography faces not only barriers rooted in the academy but a lack of diversity in its own field. \n\nIn 2018, a leading journal in feminist geography, Gender, Place and Culture, was subject to a scholarly publishing hoax. Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and Peter Boghossian submitted a paper titled \"Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity in Urban Dog Parks in Portland, Oregon\". The paper proposed that dog parks are “rape-condoning spaces”, and a place of rampant canine rape culture and systemic oppression against “the oppressed dog” through which human attitudes to both problems can be measured and analyzed by applying black feminist criminology. The paper suggested that this could provide insight into training men out of the sexual violence and bigotry. The paper has since been retracted. The hoax has been criticized as unethical and mean-spirited, and critics of the hoax have suggested that the hoaxers do not understand the process of peer review. \n\n\n\n"}

The team named the area \"Field of Streams\" because of so many crisscrossing trails of stars.\n\nThe Sagittarius Stream of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG) dominates the \"Field\". It has a split trail within the area of the Field of Streams, because SagDEG has wrapped around the Milky Way Galaxy multiple times, which has resulted in overlapping trails. The forking of the trail has made inferences of the organization of dark matter in the inner halo of the Milky Way Galaxy possible, resulting in the determination that it is distributed in a round spherical manner, as opposed to the expected flattened spheroid. The shape of the streams also implies that the dark matter is very cold cold dark matter, due to the thin trails, and persisting existence.\n\nAlso appearing in the Field is the Monoceros Ring, which was not discovered by the team which discovered the Field.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "307628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307628", "title": "Gazetteer", "text": "Gazetteer\n\nA gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or directory used in conjunction with a map or atlas. It typically contains information concerning the geographical makeup, social statistics and physical features of a country, region, or continent. Content of a gazetteer can include a subject's location, dimensions of peaks and waterways, population, gross domestic product and literacy rate. This information is generally divided into topics with entries listed in alphabetical order.\n\nAncient Greek gazetteers are known to have existed since the Hellenistic era. The first known Chinese gazetteer was released by the first century, and with the age of print media in China by the ninth century, the Chinese gentry became invested in producing gazetteers for their local areas as a source of information as well as local pride. The geographer Stephanus of Byzantium wrote a geographical dictionary (which currently has missing parts) in the sixth century which influenced later European compilers. Modern gazetteers can be found in reference sections of most libraries as well as on the internet.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines a \"gazetteer\" as a \"geographical index or dictionary\". It includes as an example a work by the British historian Laurence Echard (d. 1730) in 1693 that bore the title \"The Gazetteer's: or Newsman's Interpreter: Being a Geographical Index\". Echard wrote that the title \"Gazetteer's\" was suggested to him by a \"very eminent person\" whose name he chose not to disclose. For Part II of this work published in 1704, Echard referred to the book simply as \"the Gazeteer\". This marked the introduction of the word \"gazetteer\" into the English language. Historian Robert C. White suggests that the \"very eminent person\" written of by Echard was his colleague Edmund Bohun, and chose not to mention Bohun because he became associated with the Jacobite movement.\n\nSince the 18th century, the word \"gazetteer\" has been used interchangeably to define either its traditional meaning (i.e., a geographical dictionary or directory) or a daily newspaper, such as the \"London Gazetteer\".\n\nGazetteers are often categorized by the type, and scope, of the information presented. \"World gazetteers\" usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. \"Short-form gazetteers\", often used in conjunction with computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g., British National Grid reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. \"Descriptive gazetteers\" may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. \"Thematic gazetteers\" list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.\n\nGazetteer editors gather facts and other information from official government reports, the census, chambers of commerce, together with numerous other sources, and organise these in digest form.\n\nIn his journal article \"Alexander and the Ganges\" (1923), the 20th-century historian W.W. Tarn calls a list and description of satrapies of Alexander's Empire written between 324 and 323 BC as an ancient gazetteer. Tarn notes that the document is dated no later than June 323 BC, since it features Babylon as not yet partitioned by Alexander's generals. It was revised by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC. In the 1st century BC, Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentioned the chronicle-type format of the writing of the logographers in the age before the founder of the Greek historiographic tradition, Herodotus (i.e., before the 480s BC), saying \"they did not write connected accounts but instead broke them up according to peoples and cities, treating each separately\". Historian Truesdell S. Brown asserts that what Dionysius describes in this quote about the logographers should be categorized not as a true \"history\" but rather as a gazetteer. While discussing the Greek conception of the river delta in ancient Greek literature, Francis Celoria notes that both Ptolemy and Pausanias of the 2nd century AD provided gazetteer information on geographical terms.\n\nPerhaps predating Greek gazetteers were those made in ancient Egypt. Although she does not specifically label the document as a gazetteer, Penelope Wilson (Department of Archaeology, Durham University) describes an ancient Egyptian papyrus found at the site of Tanis, Egypt (a city founded during the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt) which provides the following for each administrative area of Egypt at the time:\n\n...the name of a nome capital, its sacred barque, its sacred tree, its cemetery, the date of its festival, the names of forbidden objects, the local god, land, and lake of the city. This interesting codification of data, probably made by a priest, is paralleled by very similar editions of data on the temple walls at Edfu, for example.\n\nThe \"Domesday Book\" initiated by William I of England in 1086 was a government survey on all the administrative counties of England; it was used to assess the properties of farmsteads and landholders in order to tax them sufficiently. In the survey, numerous English castles were listed; scholars debate on exactly how many were actually referenced in the book. However, the \"Domesday Book\" does detail the fact that out of 3,558 registered houses destroyed in 112 different boroughs listed, 410 of these destroyed houses were the direct result of castle construction and expansion. In 1316 the Nomina Villarum survey was initiated by Edward II of England; it was essentially a list of all the administrative subdivisions throughout England which could be utilized by the state in order to assess how much military troops could be conscripted and summoned from each region. The \"Speculum Britanniae\" (1596) of the Tudor era English cartographer and topographer John Norden (1548–1625) had an alphabetical list of places throughout England with headings showing their administrative hundreds and referenced to attached maps. Englishman John Speed's \"Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine\" published in 1611 provided gazetteers for counties throughout England, which included illustrative maps, short local histories, a list of administrative hundreds, an index of parishes, and the coordinates of longitude and latitude for county towns. Starting in 1662, the Hearth Tax Returns with attached maps of local areas were compiled by individual parishes throughout England while a duplicate of their records were sent to the central government offices of the Exchequer. To supplement his \"new large Map of England\" from 1677, the English cartographer John Adams compiled the extensive gazetteer \"Index Villaris\" in 1680 that had some 24,000 places listed with geographical coordinates coinciding with the map. The \"Geographical Dictionary\" of Edmund Bohun was published in London in 1688, comprising 806 pages with some 8,500 entries. In his work, Edmund Bohun attributed the first known Western geographical dictionary to geographer Stephanus of Byzantium (fl. 6th century) while also noting influence in his work from the \"Thesaurus Geographicus\" (1587) by the Belgian cartographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598), but stated that Ortelius' work dealt largely with ancient geography and not up-to-date information. Only fragments of Stephanus' geographical work \"Ethnica\" (Εθνικά) have survived and were first examined by the Italian printer Aldus Manutius in his work of 1502.\n\nThe Italian monk Phillippus Ferrarius (d. 1626) published his geographical dictionary \"Epitome Geographicus in Quattuor Libros Divisum\" in the Swiss city of Zurich in 1605. He divided this work into overhead topics of cities, rivers, mountains, and lakes and swamps. All placenames, given in Latin, were arranged in alphabetical order for each overhead division by geographic type;. A year after his death, his \"Lexicon Geographicum\" was published, which contained more than 9,000 different entries for geographic places. This was an improvement over Ortelius' work, since it included modern placenames and places discovered since the time of Ortelius.\n\nPierre Duval (1618–1683), a nephew of the French cartographer Nicolas Sanson, wrote various geographical dictionaries. These include a dictionary on the abbeys of France, a dictionary on ancient sites of the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans with their modern equivalent names, and a work published in Paris in 1651 that was both the first universal and vernacular geographical dictionary of Europe. With the gradual expansion of Laurence Echard's (d. 1730) gazetteer of 1693, it too became a universal geographical dictionary that was translated into Spanish in 1750, into French in 1809, and into Italian in 1810.\n\nFollowing the American Revolutionary War, United States clergyman and historian Jeremy Belknap and Postmaster General Ebenezer Hazard intended to create the first post-revolutionary geographical works and gazetteers, but they were anticipated by the clergyman and geographer Jedidiah Morse with his \"Geography Made Easy\" in 1784. However, Morse was unable to finish the gazetteer in time for his 1784 geography and postponed it. Yet his delay to publish it lasted too long, as it was Joseph Scott in 1795 who published the first post-revolutionary American gazetteer, his \"Gazetteer of the United States\". With the aid of Noah Webster and Rev. Samuel Austin, Morse finally published his gazetteer \"The American Universal Geography\" in 1797. However, Morse's gazetteer did not receive distinction by literary critics, as gazetteers were deemed as belonging to a lower literary class. The reviewer of Joseph Scott's 1795 gazetteer commented that it was \"little more than medleys of politics, history and miscellaneous remarks on the manners, languages and arts of different nations, arranged in the order in which the territories stand on the map\". Nevertheless, in 1802 Morse followed up his original work by co-publishing \"A New Gazetteer of the Eastern Continent\" with Rev. Elijah Parish, the latter of whom Ralph H. Brown asserts did the \"lion's share of the work in compiling it\".\n\nGazetteers became widely popular in Britain in the 19th century, with publishers such as Fullarton, Mackenzie, Chambers and W & A. K. Johnston, many of whom were Scottish, meeting public demand for information on an expanding Empire. This British tradition continues in the electronic age with innovations such as the National Land and Property Gazetteer, the text-based Gazetteer for Scotland, and the new (2008) National Gazetteer (for Scotland), formerly known as the Definitive National Address – Scotland National Gazetteer. In addition to local or regional gazetteers, there have also been comprehensive world gazetteers published; an early example would be the 1912 world gazetteer published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. There are also interregional gazetteers with a specific focus, such as the gazetteer of the Swedish atlas \"Das Bästas Bilbok\" (1969), a road atlas and guide for Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.\n\nIn Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) China, the \"Yuejue Shu\" (越絕書) written in 52 AD is considered by modern sinologists and historians to be the prototype of the gazetteer (Chinese: \"difangzhi\"), as it contained essays on a wide variety of subjects including changes in territorial division, the founding of cities, local products, and customs. However, the first gazetteer proper is considered to be the Chronicles of Huayang by Chang Qu 常璩. There are over 8,000 gazetteers of pre-modern China that have survived. Gazetteers became more common in the Song dynasty (960–1279), yet the bulk of surviving gazetteers were written during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Modern scholar Liu Weiyi notes that just under 400 gazetteers were compiled in the era between the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 and the Tang dynasty (618–907). Gazetteers from this era focused on boundaries and territory, place names, mountains and rivers, ancient sites, local products, local myths and legends, customs, botany, topography, and locations of palaces, streets, temples, etc. By the Tang dynasty the gazetteer became much more geographically specific, with a broad amount of content arranged topically; for example, there would be individual sections devoted to local astronomy, schools, dikes, canals, post stations, altars, local deities, temples, tombs, etc. By the Song dynasty it became more common for gazetteers to provide biographies of local celebrities, accounts of elite local families, bibliographies, and literary anthologies of poems and essays dedicated to famous local spots. Song gazetteers also made lists and descriptions of city walls, gate names, wards and markets, districts, population size, and residences of former prefects.\n\nIn 610 after the Sui dynasty (581–618) united a politically divided China, Emperor Yang of Sui had all the empire's commanderies prepare gazetteers called 'maps and treatises' (Chinese: \"tujing\") so that a vast amount of updated textual and visual information on local roads, rivers, canals, and landmarks could be utilized by the central government to maintain control and provide better security. Although the earliest extant Chinese maps date to the 4th century BC, and \"tujing\" since the Qin (221–206 BC) or Han dynasties, this was the first known instance in China when the textual information of \"tujing\" became the primary element over the drawn illustrations. This Sui dynasty process of providing maps and visual aids in written gazetteers—as well as the submitting of gazetteers with illustrative maps by local administrations to the central government—was continued in every subsequent Chinese dynasty.\n\nHistorian James M. Hargett states that by the time of the Song dynasty, gazetteers became far more geared towards serving the current political, administrative, and military concerns than in gazetteers of previous eras, while there were many more gazetteers compiled on the local and national levels than in previous eras. Emperor Taizu of Song ordered Lu Duosun and a team of cartographers and scholars in 971 to initiate the compilation of a huge atlas and nationwide gazetteer that covered the whole of China proper, which comprised approximately 1,200 counties and 300 prefectures. This project was completed in 1010 by a team of scholars under Song Zhun, who presented it in 1,566 chapters to the throne of Emperor Zhenzong. This Sui dynasty process of infrequently collecting \"tujing\" or \"map guides\" continued, but it would be enhanced by the matured literary genre of \"fangzhi\" or \"treatise on a place\" of the Song dynasty. Although Zheng Qiao of the 12th century did not notice the \"fangzhi\" while writing his encyclopedic \"Tongzhi\" including monographs to geography and cities, others such as the bibliographer Chen Zhensun of the 13th century were listing gazetteers instead of the map guides in their works. The main differences between the \"fangzhi\" and the \"tujing\" was that the former was a product of \"local initiative, not a central command\" according to Peter K. Bol, and were usually ten, twenty, or even fifty chapters in length compared to the average four chapters for map guides. Furthermore, the \"fangzhi\" were almost always printed because they were intended for a large reading audience, whereas \"tujing\" were exclusive records read by the local officials who drafted them and the central government officials who collected them. Although most Song gazetteers credited local officials as the authors, already in the Song there were bibliographers who noted that non-official literati were asked to compose these works or did so on their own behalf. By the 16th century—during the Ming dynasty—local gazetteers were commonly composed due to local decision-making rather than a central government mandate. Historian Peter K. Bol states that local gazetteers composed in this manner were the result of increased domestic and international trade that facilitated greater local wealth throughout China. Historian R. H. Britnell writes of gazetteers in Ming China, \"by the sixteenth century, for a county or monastery not to have a gazetteer was regarded as evidence that the place was inconsequential\".\n\nWhile working in the Department of Arms, the Tang dynasty cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) and his colleagues would acquire information from foreign envoys about their respective homelands, and from these interrogations would produce maps supplemented by textual information. Even within China, ethnographic information on ethnic minorities of non-Han peoples were often described in the local histories and gazetteers of provinces such as Guizhou during the Ming and Qing dynasties. As the Qing dynasty pushed further with its troops and government authorities into areas of Guizhou that were uninhabited and not administered by the Qing government, the official gazetteers of the region would be revised to include the newly drawn-up districts and non-Han ethnic groups (mostly Miao peoples) therein. While the late Ming dynasty officials who compiled the information on the ethnic groups of Guizhou offered scanty details about them in their gazetteers (perhaps due to their lack of contact with these peoples), the later Qing dynasty gazetteers often provided a much more comprehensive analysis. By 1673 the Guizhou gazetteers featured different written entries for the various Miao peoples of the region. Historian Laura Holsteter writes on the woodblock print illustrations of Miao peoples in the Guizhou gazeteer, stating \"the 1692 version of the Kangxi era gazetteer show a refinement in the quality of the illustrations by comparison to 1673\".\n\nHistorian Timothy Brook states that Ming dynasty gazetteers demonstrate a shift in the attitudes of Chinese gentry towards the traditionally lower merchant class. As time went on, the gentry solicited funds from merchants to build and repair schools, print scholarly books, build Chinese pagodas on auspicious sites, and other things that were needed by the gentry and scholar-officials in order to succeed. Hence, the gentry figures composing the gazetteers in the latter half of the Ming period spoke favorably of merchants, whereas before they were rarely mentioned. Brook and other modern sinologist historians also examine and consult the local Ming gazetteers to compare population info with the contemporary central government records, which often provided dubious population figures that did not reflect the actually larger population size of China during the time.\n\nAlthough better known for his work on the \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" encyclopedia, the early-to-mid Qing scholar Jiang Tingxi aided other scholars in the compilation of the \"Daqing Yitongzhi\" ('Gazetteer of the Qing Empire'). This was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang's death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849.\n\nThe Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci created the first comprehensive world map in the Chinese language in the early 17th century, while comprehensive world gazetteers were later translated into Chinese by Europeans. The Christian missionary William Muirhead (1822–1900), who lived in Shanghai during the late Qing period, published the gazetteer \"Dili quanzhi\", which was reprinted in Japan in 1859. Divided into fifteen volumes, this work covered Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Ocean Archipelagos, and was sub-divided further into sections on geography, topography, water masses, atmosphere, biology, anthropology, and historical geography. Chinese maritime trade gazetteers mentioned a slew of different countries that came to trade in China, such as United States vessels docking at Canton in the \"Yuehaiguanzhi\" ('Gazetteer of the Maritime Customs of Guangdong') published in 1839 (reprinted in 1935). The Chinese language gazetteer \"Haiguo Tuzhi\" ('Illustrated Gazetteer of the Sea Kingdoms') by Wei Yuan in 1844 (with material influenced by the \"Sizhou zhi\" of Lin Zexu) was printed in Japan two decades later 1854. This work was popular in Japan not for its geographical knowledge, but for its analysis of potential defensive military strategy in the face of European imperialism and the Qing's recent defeat in the First Opium War due to European artillery and gunboats.\n\nContinuing an old tradition of \"fangzhi\", the Republic of China had gazetteers composed and created national standards for them in 1929, updating these in 1946. The printing of gazetteers was revived in 1956 under Mao Zedong and again in the 1980s, after the reforms of the Deng era to replace the people's communes with traditional townships. The \"difangzhi\" effort under Mao yielded little results (only 10 of the 250 designated counties ended up publishing a gazetteer), while the writing of \"difangzhi\" was interrupted during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), trumped by the village and family histories which were more appropriate for the theme of class struggle. A Li Baiyu of Shanxi forwarded a letter to the CCP Propaganda Department on May 1, 1979, which urged for the revival of \"difangzhi\". This proposal was sponsored by Hu Yaobang in June 1979 while Hu Qiaomu of the CCP Politburo lent his support for the idea in April 1980. The first issue of a modern national journal of \"difangzhi\" was issued by January 1981.\n\nIn Korea, scholars based their gazetteers largely on the Chinese model. Like Chinese gazetteers, there were national, provincial, and local prefecture Korean gazetteers which featured geographic information, demographic data, locations of bridges, schools, temples, tombs, fortresses, pavilions, and other landmarks, cultural customs, local products, resident clan names, and short biographies on well-known people. In an example of the latter, the 1530 edition of \"Sinjŭng tongguk yŏji sŭngnam\" ('New Edition of the Korean National Gazetteer') gave a brief statement about Pak Yŏn (1378–1458), noting his successful career in the civil service, his exceptional filiality, his brilliance in music theory, and his praisable efforts in systematizing ritual music for Sejong's court. King Sejong established the Joseon dynasty's first national gazetteer in 1432, called the \"Sinch'an p'aldo\" ('Newly Compiled Geographic Treatise on the Eight Circuits'). With additional material and correction of mistakes, the title of this gazetteer was revised in 1454 as the \"Sejong Sillok chiriji\" ('King Sejong's Treatise on Geography'), updated in 1531 under the title \"Sinjŭng tongguk yŏji sŭngnam\" ('Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea'), and enlarged in 1612. The Joseon Koreans also created international gazetteers. The \"Yojisongnam\" gazetteer compiled from 1451 to 1500 provides a small description for 369 different foreign countries known to Joseon Korea in the 15th century.\n\nIn Japan, there were also local gazetteers in pre-modern times, called \"fudoki\". Japanese gazetteers preserved historical and legendary accounts of various regions. For example, the Nara-period (710–794) provincial gazetteer \"Harima no kuni fūdoki\" of Harima Province provides a story of an alleged visit by Emperor Ōjin in the 3rd century while on an imperial hunting expedition. Local Japanese gazetteers could also be found in later periods such as the Edo period. Gazetteers were often composed by the request of wealthy patrons; for example, six scholars in the service of the \"daimyō\" of the Ikeda household published the \"Biyō kokushi\" gazetteer for several counties in 1737. World gazetteers were written by the Japanese in the 19th century, such as the \"Kon'yo zushiki\" (\"Annotated Maps of the World\") published by Mitsukuri Shōgo in 1845, the \"Hakkō tsūshi\" (\"Comprehensive Gazetteer of the Entire World\") by Mitsukuri Genpo in 1856, and the \"Bankoku zushi\" (\"Illustrated Gazetteer of the Nations of the World\"), which was written by an Englishman named Colton, translated by Sawa Ginjirō, and printed by Tezuka Ritsu in 1862. Despite the ambitious title, the work by Genpo only covered \"Yōroppa bu\" (\"Section on Europe\") while the planned section for Asia was not published.\n\nIn pre-modern India, local gazetteers were written. For example, Muhnot Nainsi wrote a gazetteer for the Marwar region in the 17th century. B. S. Baliga writes that the history of the gazetteer in Tamil Nadu can be traced back to the classical corpus of Sangam literature, dated 200 BC to 300 AD. Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the vizier to Akbar the Great of the Mughal Empire, wrote the \"Ain-e-Akbari\", which included a gazetteer with valuable information on India's population in the 16th century.\n\nThe pre-modern Islamic world produced gazetteers. Cartographers of the Safavid dynasty of Iran made gazetteers of local areas.\n\nExamples of electronic world gazetteers can be found at:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27462051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27462051", "title": "Geology of Bolivia", "text": "Geology of Bolivia\n\nThe geology of Bolivia comprises a variety of different lithologies as well as tectonic and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale, geological units coincide with topographical units. The country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the subduction processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable platforms and shields. The Bolivian Andes is divided into three main ranges; these are from west to east: the Cordillera Occidental that makes up the border to Chile and host several active volcanoes and geothermal areas, Cordillera Central (in some contexts also called Cordillera Oriental) once extensively mined for silver and tin and the relatively low Cordillera Oriental that rather than being a range by its own is the eastern continuation of the Central Cordillera as a fold and thrust belt. Between the Occidental and Central Cordillera the approximately 3,750-meter-high Altiplano high plateau extends. This basin hosts several freshwater lakes, including Lake Titicaca as well as salt-covered dry lakes that bring testimony of past climate changes and lake cycles. The eastern lowlands and sub-Andean zone in Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, and Tarija Departments was once an old Paleozoic sedimentary basin that hosts valuable hydrocarbon reserves. Further east close to the border with Brazil lies the Guaporé Shield, made up of stable Precambrian crystalline rock.\n\nThe Andes of Bolivia began to rise about 200 million years ago (mya) during the Jurassic. The western margin of what is now South America had been the place of several other orogenies before the Andes rose. It has been hypothesized that the central Andes gained its great height 26 to 14 mya as result of a compressive failure of the lithosphere beneath Bolivia and neighboring areas. The great heights of the Altiplano, Codillera Occidental and Cordillera Oriental are isostatically compensated by an up to 70 km deep crust. Climate has responded to the formation of this important topographic barrier. It is not clear, however, if the rise of the Andes simply caused the extreme aridity of Atacama Desert and adjacent parts of Bolivia or if a preexisting desert climate and associated low erosion rates allowed the mountains to build up to their current heights. A hypothesis holds that scarce sediment supply to the Atacama Trench caused by arid climate induced high shear stresses in the subduction process that enhanced the Andean mountain building.\n\nThe Western Cordillera is made up by a series of active and extinct volcanoes rising from the western edge of the Altiplano plateau. This range divides the Chilean watersheds of Salar de Atacama and the Pacific from the endorheic Altiplano basin. The western volcanoes of Bolivia are part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, a major upper Cenozoic volcanic province. Volcanic eruptions in Bolivia are scarce, the latest one occurred in Irruputuncu in 1995. Volcanic hazards do not represent any threat to the major populated centres which are all in the eastern Altiplano or further east, far away from the volcanic centers. Although the Western Cordillera concentrates most active volcanoes (volcanoes active in the last 10000 years) many old large stratovolcanoes rises up to 100 km away from the main line of the Western Cordillera.\n\nThe Altiplano plateau or Meseta del Collasuyu to differentiate it from other Andean high plateaux is a wide and long-lived intermontane sedimentary basin with no outlet; it is endorheic. The Altiplano is an infill of sedimentary material from both Cordillera Occidental and Cordillera Oriental. The origin of the Altiplano and its great height has long been major question among geologists. Today the Altiplano is believed to have been an early foreland basin of the \"proto-Andes\" that got uplifted by crustal shortening in the Late Miocene.\n\nThe Bolivian Altiplano hosts the world's largest reserves of lithium. These reserves are in the salt-saturated waters of Salar de Uyuni and Salar de Coipasa, neither of which are currently being commercially exploited for lithium. Salt is extracted from the saltars in minor amounts to be sold as table salt after being added iodine from Chile.\n\nCordillera Oriental is made up of a bended arc of plutons. The bend occurs at the latitude of Cochabamba and corresponds to eastward projection of the Arica elbow, the bend of south Amicas coastline at the Peru-Chile border. North of the bend Cordillera Centrals batholiths are northwest-southeast oriented while south of it they are north-south oriented. These bodies of granitic to granodioritic composition were formed in two episodes: the Early Mesozoic (199–180 Ma) and the Neogene (19–8 Ma). The emplacement of these igneous bodies have been interpreted as an effect of two temporary decreases in subduction angles of the ancient Farallon Plate. This arc of magmatic material hosts Bolivia's widely known tin belt as well as the famous silver mine of Potosí. These mineralizations are of the porphyry mineralization type that are typical for convergent plate margins. The Cordillera Real form the northern, highly uplifted and eroded, part of the Central Cordillera.\n\nThe Sub-Andean Zone and the Northern and Eastern Lowlands share a common ancient history but has since the Andean orogeny developed to two distinct zones. While both zones share essentially the same old sedimentary platform strata the strata at the Sub-Andean Zone have been folded and thrusted into a fold and thrust belt with structural traps where hydrocarbon fluids have accumulated. The limit between the fold and thrust belt and the Eastern Lowlands is drawn by the Serranía del Aguaragüe a north-south range representing the Andean thrust front.\n\nThe relatively low Cordillera Oriental, located east of Cordillera Central, are part of a fold and thrust belt and exposes Silurian and Ordovician age strata some of which are fossil-bearing. The fold and thrust makes up the framework of the hydrographic network of Pilcomayo and other rivers. Currently one of Bolivia's most seismic zones is the Cochabamba Fault Zone located just below the city of Cochabamba and its fertile valley. This fault zone is related to the Arica elbow and the bend in the Andes at this latitude.\n\nThe geology of the eastern lowlands is dominated by the ancient Paleozoic sedimentary Chaco–Tarija Basin that has considerable hydrocarbon reserves. During the Carboniferous, the Chaco-Tarija Basin was covered by thick sequences that included sandstone filled channels. In the 1970s these sandstone were interpreted as tillite from the late Paleozoic glaciations, but new interpretations consider them to be of marine origin but still glacially influenced. The depositional environment for these channel systems has been likened to that on the floor of the present day Labrador Sea, which was influenced by repeated Pleistocene glaciations. The late Cenozoic deformation associated with the Andean orogeny forced hydrocarbons sourced in Devonian shales to migrate to shallower stratigraphical levels.\n\nThe Northern Lowlands are and have long been a depositional milleau are mostly covered by Tertiary and Quaternary deposits. The bulk of these deposits are now laterites. River erosion and sediment transport have created a large number of oxbow lakes and added copious meanders to the rivers.\n\nIn the north and east of Santa Cruz Department the crystalline and Precambrian Guaporé Shield (also called Central Brazil Shield) makes up most of the bedrock but is mostly covered by Tertiary laterites and Quaternary alluvial basins. The shield expresses itself topographically as a large elevated hinterland located north of Serranías Chiquitanas towards the Brazilian border. High-grade metamorphic rocks occur in the Bolivian part of the Guaporé Shield partly due to the 2000 millions years old \"Trans-Amazonian tectonothermal event\" that affected parts of South America. Low-grade metamorphic rocks occur as well. The Guaporé Shield is believed to extend beneath the Phanerozoic Tarija-Chaco and Beni Basin sediments into the Andes. It has been suggested that weaknesses in the shield were responsible for the formation of the Arica Elbow. The East-West Río Mercedes Line in the Guaporé Shield hosts several Proterozoic diabase intrusions. As of 1985 the rocks of Guaporé Shield were considered to be poorly known. Near the Brazilian border the iron deposit of El Mutún stands out as the world's largest iron ore deposit. It is located in the Serranía de El Mutún, also called Cerro Mutún or Serranía de Jacadigo in Brazil. The shield also underlies Serrania Caparuch or Huanchaca which is the inspiration for the \"Lost World\" of Conan Doyle.\n\nProyecto Precámbrico, an Anglo-Bolivian technical cooperation project, explored the area between 1976 and 1986. There are a series of published 1:250,000 scale maps of the area with accompanying bilingual reports, along with more detailed 1:100,000 maps of regions of economic interest. There is a published geochemical atlas. Most of this data is summarised in an \"Overseas Memoir\" of the British Geological Survey.\n\n"}

The largest of the lakes are Lake Wellington (Gunai language: Murla), Lake King and Lake Victoria. The lakes are collectively fed by the Avon, Thomson, Latrobe, Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo rivers.\n\nThe Gippsland Lakes were formed by two principal processes. The first is river delta alluvial deposition of sediment brought in by the rivers which flow into the lakes. Silt deposited by this process forms into long jetties which can run many kilometres into a lake, as exemplified by the Mitchell River silt jetties that run into Lake King. The second process is the action of sea current in Bass Strait which created the Ninety Mile Beach and cut off the river deltas from the sea.\n\nOnce the lakes were closed off a new cycle started, whereby the water level of the lakes would gradually rise until the waters broke through the barrier beach and the level would drop down until it equalised with sea-level. Eventually the beach would close-off the lakes and the cycle would begin anew. Sometimes it would take many years before a new channel to the sea was formed and not necessarily in the same place as the last one.\n\nIn 1889, a wall was built to fix the position of a naturally occurring channel between the lakes and the ocean at Lakes Entrance, to stabilise the water level, create a harbour for fishing boats and open up the lakes to shipping. This entrance needs to be dredged regularly, or the same process that created the Gippsland Lakes would render the entrance too shallow for seagoing vessels to pass through.\n\nDue to flooding in 2011, Gippsland Lakes experienced blooms of bioluminescent Noctiluca scintillans.\n\nThe Gippsland Lakes provide a major hub for tourism, particularly for recreational boating and fishing enthusiasts. The lakes network can be explored by cruise, water taxi, or boat and kayak hire. On the fringes of the lakes are several tourist towns that swell to support the tourist trade, particularly in the summer months.\n\nLakes Entrance is the largest of the towns on the lakes with a population of 4,500. The town is well serviced with resorts, hotels and facilities. It is located with easy access to both the lakes network and the surf beach on Ninety Mile Beach, which is patrolled each summer.\n\nMetung is a small village located on the tip of a peninsula sitting in the Gippsland Lakes, surrounded almost completely by water. It is an upmarket tourist destination with many dining options and artisan galleries.\n\nMuch of Paynesville’s accommodation and infrastructure are located on the network of canals. One of the key attractions is Raymond Island, known for its koala population.\n\nThe diversity of the brine waters of the lakes, surf beaches along Ninety Mile Beach and fresh water streams that feed the lakes, make the Gippsland Lakes a popular fishing destination. Local fish varieties include bream, mullet, flathead, luderick and trevally. Paynesville, Lakes Entrance and Metung all offer a number of jetties, boat ramps and berthing facilities.\n\nThe lakes support numerous species of wildlife and there exist two protected areas within: The Lakes National Park and Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. The Gippsland Lakes wetlands are protected by the international Ramsar Convention on wetlands. There are also approximately 400 indigenous flora species and 300 native fauna species. Three plants, two of them being orchid species, are listed as endangered. The numbers of southern right whales and humpback whales using the Lake Entrance area show increases in recent years, as the populations have started to recover from illegal hunts by the Soviet Union with help from Japan in 1960s-1970s.\n\nThe lakes are home to about 50 of the recently described species of bottlenose dolphin, the Burrunan dolphin (\"Tursiops australis\"). The other 150 or so of this rare species are to be found in Port Phillip.\n\nThe wetlands provide habitat for about 20,000 waterbirds – including birds from as far afield as Siberia and Alaska. The lakes have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the global populations of black swans, chestnut teals and musk ducks, as well as many fairy terns.\n\nThe Gippsland Lakes are, in order of size:\n\n\n"}

He was largely self-educated. At 16 he became an apprentice wheelwright at Collace near Wolfhill, and then because of health problems a tea merchant in Elgin, Moray. \nIn 1848 he married Isabella Macdonald, daughter of John Macdonald and Annabella Sime, of Forres. \n\nIn the 1850s he managed a temperance hotel in Blairgowrie, and was then an insurance agent in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Leicester. \nIn 1859, he became a janitor at the museum of the Andersonian University in Glasgow. He was able to use the university library to get access to books, and taught himself physics and astronomy to develop his ideas.\n\nFrom 1864, Croll corresponded with Sir Charles Lyell, on links between ice ages and variations in the Earth's orbit. \nHe theorized that changes in the earth's orbit could cause the Gulf stream to be diverted, bringing less heat to the Arctic. More ice would then lead to more sunlight being reflected, causing a feedback loop. His ideas were published in the Philosophical Magazine in 1864, attributed to \"James Croll, Anderson's University\".\nThis led to a position in the Edinburgh office of the Geological Survey of Scotland, as keeper of maps and correspondence, where the director, Sir Archibald Geikie, encouraged his research. \nHe published a number of books and papers which \"were at the forefront of contemporary science\", including \"Climate and Time, in Their Geological Relations\" in 1875. He corresponded with Charles Darwin on erosion by rivers.\n\nIn 1876, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and awarded an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews. He retired in 1880 because of ill health, and died on 15 December 1890 at 5 Pitcullen Crescent, Perth, Scotland. He was buried in a family grave in Cargill, Perthshire.\n\nCroll was the leading proponent of an astronomical-based theory of climate change in the nineteenth century. Using formulae for orbital variations developed by Urbain Le Verrier (which had led to the discovery of Neptune), Croll developed a theory of the effects of variations of the Earth's orbit on climate cycles. His idea was that decreases in winter sunlight would favour snow accumulation, and for the first time coupled this to the idea of a positive ice-albedo feedback to amplify the solar variations. Croll further argued that the accumulation of snow would change the pattern of trade winds, leading to the deflection of warming currents like the Gulf Stream, and finally a self-sustaining ice age. He suggested that when orbital eccentricity is high winters will tend to be colder when the Earth is farther from the sun in that season and hence, that during periods of high orbital eccentricity, ice ages occur on 22,000-year cycles in each hemisphere, and alternate between southern and northern hemispheres, lasting approximately 10,000 years each.\n\nCroll's theory predicted multiple ice ages, asynchronous in northern and southern hemispheres, and that the last ice ages should have ended about 80,000 years ago. Evidence was just then emerging of multiple ice ages, and geologists were interested in a theory to explain this. Geologists were not then able to date sediments accurately enough to determine if glaciation was synchronous between the hemispheres, though the limited evidence more pointed towards synchronicity than not. More crucially, estimates of the recession rate of the Niagara Falls indicated that the last ice age ended 6,000 to 35,000 years ago – a large range, but enough to rule out Croll's theory, to those who accepted the measurements.\n\nCroll's work was widely discussed, but by the end of the 19th century, his theory was generally discredited. However, the basic idea of orbitally-forced insolation variations influencing terrestrial temperatures – now known generally as Milankovitch cycles – was further developed by Milutin Milankovitch and eventually, in modified form, triumphed in 1976.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Kebnekaise massif, which is part of the Scandinavian Mountains, has two main peaks, of which the southern, glaciated one is highest at above sea level as of August 2014. The northern peak is and free of ice. Kebnekaise lies in Sapmi, about north of the Arctic Circle and west of Kiruna near the Kungsleden hiking trail between Abisko and Hemavan.\n\nDue to the shrinkage of the glacier surrounding the southern peak, it is possible the northern peak will assume the title of the highest point in Sweden; as of Summer 2016 the difference in altitude was just . By August of 2018, because of record heat, enough of the glacier on the southern peak had melted so that the northern peak is now the highest. However it is likely the height of the southern peak will increase in the winter so that it may regain its title as the highest peak.\n\nThe Kebnekaise massif lies within a range of the Scandinavian mountains that is bordered by the glacial valleys Ladtjovagge (Sami spelling Láddjuvággi), Tjäktjavagge (Čeakčavággi) and Vistasvagge (Visttasvággi). The highest points of the massif lie along the ridge (called \"vargryggen\" in Swedish) that runs from the southern and northern summits to Kebnepakte (Giebmebákti) at . Other subsidiary peaks are Kebnetjåkka (Giebmečohkka), Vierranvárri, Tolpagorni , Guobircohkka , and Siŋŋibákti .\n\nOf the two highest points, the southern peak lies on a glacier situated on a rocky plateau. The glacier has shrunk in recent years, and therefore the summit is not as high as earlier. The top is traditionally said to be , and higher in the oldest measurement, i.e. . If the melting continues at the same rate, the south peak will sink below the north peak (which is the highest \"fixed\" point in Sweden) within a few years' time. However, as of July 2015, Tarfala Research Station reports that the glacier has grown by — from its lowest measurement of the previous year.\n\nThe massif is heavily glaciated, with Kebnepakteglaciären, Isfallsglaciären, and Storglaciären towards Tarfala valley to the east, Björlings glacier to the southeast, and Rabots glaciär to the west, plus several smaller glaciers throughout the area.\n\nIn Europe there are no higher mountains further north. During clear weather, a vast area can be seen from the summit, according to some sources as much as 10% of Sweden.\n\nKebnekaise mountain lodge (\"Kebnekaise fjällstation\") is located to the southeast at the foot of Kebnekaise, about , 6–7 hours hike from the trailhead at Nikkaluokta. It is the starting point for an ascent to the south summit via the western route (\"västra leden\", about , 5-7 hours to the summit) or the eastern route (\"östra leden\", about , 3–5 hours to the summit). The western route leads over steep scree slopes and the intermediate peak Vierranvárri. Most of this route to the top is pure hiking, but there is a short exposed part that could possibly count as scrambling (YDS grade 2). The eastern route leads over glaciers and rocks and offers exposure (YDS grade 4). The steepest section is equipped with fixed steel cables for protection, similar to a via ferrata. There is also a third, less known route only marked with cairns — \"Durlings led\", which branches off Kungsleden a few kilometers north of Singi, goes about two kilometers into Singivagge, and then turns north into the valley between Kuopertjåkka and Siŋŋibákti. \"Durlings led\" eventually merges with the western route at \"Kaffedalen\", the pass between Vierranvárri and Kebnekaise. Advantages with this route are lack of exposure and a shorter ascent if Singivagge is used for an overnight camp.\n\nJust below the top plateau one encounters an old smaller cabin at altitude. A cabin up on the plateau was opened in 2016. A large cabin used to stand below the plateau, near the smaller one, until September 2018, when it was demolished by the county administration due to being too worn. The new cabin up on the plateau is intended as a replacement.\n\nThe peak glacier is a small top, merely tens of meters high, on a rocky plateau. To approach the actual mountain top on the glacier, crampons or other means of enhancing traction may be required, depending on snow conditions. The glacier should be walked upon with great caution; fatal accidents have occurred with people sliding off into the huge void on the eastern side. This danger might not always be apparent, especially not in times of bad weather and visibility.\n\nRoutes to the northern summit, including one via the narrow, icy arête from the southern summit, require mountaineering equipment and skills.\n\nDue to the harsh subarctic climate at the location, Kebnekaise sees the vast majority of climbers during the summer months (late June to early September). However, Kebnekaise is also an established destination for winter alpinism and guided skiing tours are organised by the STF lodge's guides.\n\nOn 15 March 2012 a Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules military aircraft crashed into the western snowy mountain side a short distance below the ridge that runs between the mountain's two highest peaks. Five Norwegian officers were killed.\n\n\n"}

In most countries, public holidays are paid and usually not considered part of the annual leave. Also, in most countries there are additional paid leave benefits such as parental leave and sick leave that are not listed here.\n\nFor the purpose of comparison, the paid vacation column has been normalised to a five-day workweek. For instance, a calendar day is divided by seven and multiplied by five, while a six-day workweek day is divided by six and multiplied by five. The paid vacation column gives the minimum mandatory vacation days for an employee who has one year of service with the same employer.\n\nIn some countries, the public holidays are strictly bound to the calendar dates, so if they happen on Saturday or Sunday, they are \"lost\" for the particular year. As a result, the average number of paid extra free days can be lower than the table specifies. For example, in the Czech Republic, where the official number of paid public holidays is 13, the average number of public holidays during working days in the years 2000–2016 was only 8.9 days. In other countries, the public holidays which happen on Saturday or Sunday are moved to the nearest Monday or Friday such as in the United Kingdom or the United States.\n\n\n"}

She grew up in Stornoway, Strathpeffer, and Kilmarnock, and attended Cranley School for Girls. Dunbar studied geography at St Anne's College of the University of Oxford, completing her Bachelor of Arts in 1939. During World War II, she travelled around the United Kingdom with a theatre troupe as an actor and stage manager.\n\nDunbar emigrated to Canada in 1947 and found work with the Joint Intelligence Bureau, where she studied Arctic ice movement. In 1952 she joined the Defence Research Board in the position of Scientific Staff Officer in the Arctic Research Section. She specialised in sea ice and navigation through frozen Arctic waters. In 1954, she applied to join the crew of scientists on a Royal Canadian Navy icebreaker travelling to the Arctic, but her request was denied as women could not be posted on naval vessels. She continued making requests until she was given permission to join an icebreaker with the Department of Transport in 1955. She thus became the first woman to conduct scientific research from Canadian icebreakers. She served on numerous icebreakers and spent 560 hours on Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft, studying ice formations in the High Arctic. She was among the first women to fly over the North Pole.\n\nDunbar published numerous papers on Arctic sea ice, and in 1956 she co-authored \"Arctic Canada from the Air\" with Keith Greenaway, a navigator with the Royal Canadian Air Force. Dunbar and Greenway's book was an early work in the field of observing sea ice through airborne photography. In her other papers, Dunbar studied the use of radar remote sensing in sea-ice research, promoted the standardisation of sea-ice terminology, and wrote historical accounts of Arctic exploration. She investigated icebreaking methods in the Soviet Union and Finland in 1964, and was an adviser to Arctic hovercraft trials in 1966–1969.\n\nIn 1971, Dunbar won the Meteorological Service of Canada's Centennial Award. In 1972 she was awarded the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's Massey Medal for \"her excellent work in arctic geography and sea ice\"; she is the only woman to have won the medal. She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1977. She also served as governor of the Arctic Institute of North America and director of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.\n\nDunbar retired in 1978 and died on 22 November 1999, at the age of 81.\n\n"}
{"id": "26488988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26488988", "title": "Norman toponymy", "text": "Norman toponymy\n\nPlace-names in Normandy have a variety of origins. Some belong to the common heritage of the Langue d'oïl extension zone in northern France and Belgium; this is called \"Pre-Normanic\". Others contain Old Norse and Old English male names and toponymic appellatives. These intermingle with Romance male names and place-name elements to create a very specific superstratum, typical of Normandy within the extension zone of the Langue d'oïl. These are sometimes called \"Normanic\".\n\nThere are still a significant number of Celtic (Gaulish) names, as there are throughout France and western Europe. These names, partly mixed with Latin elements, follow the Late Latin phonetic changes that led to Langue d'oïl.\n\nAlmost all the main cities kept a Romanized Celtic name, that produced the modern toponym.\n\n\nIn the following examples, a Gaulish toponym was replaced by the name of the local tribe, according to a process well known in the later Roman Empire:\n\n\nThere were exceptions to this practice, such as:\n\n\nSome of these would disappear later, replaced by Normanic names; thus \"Coriovallum\" became Cherbourg and \"Caracotinum\" became Harfleur. Such changes indicate that the older inhabitants who used the earlier name were displaced by newcomers, either leaving completely or becoming a small minority.\n\nSome cities' Pre-Normanic names are not known, such as Honfleur or Dieppe.\n\nThe most common suffix in northern France is \"\" (written \"-acum\", \"-acus\" or \"-aco\" in early Medieval Latin documents, but pronounced in vulgar Latin \"-acu\"), that means \"place of\" or \"property\". Its origin is the Celtic \"-āko(n)\". Originally, it was used to as the location of either a god or a people. Examples include Anualonacu, meaning \"sanctuary of Anualō [a god]\" and nautae Parisiaci, meaning \"sailors of the Parisii [tribe]\".\n\nIn northern France and southern Belgium, \"–(i)acum\" became \"-ay, -ai, -ey, -é\" or \"-y\". All of these variations are found in Normandy. Places with this suffix include Gournay, Bernay, Cernay, and Andilly.\n\nAnother, generally later, variation is composed of masculine names that can be either Gaulish or Latin, for example: Massy from Gaulish \"Mascius\"; Marcilly from Roman \"Marcellus\"; Fleury from Roman \"Florius\"; and Montigny from Roman \"Montanius\".\n\nHowever, the latest \"-acum\" formations are combined with a Christian or a Germanic masculine name, such as Repentigny, from the Christian name \"Repentin(i)us\". The most common \"-acum\" place-name in Normandy is Glatigny, of which more than 40 exist.\n\nThese come from the Vulgar Latin, but began only about 100 years after the fall of the Roman Empire, in the 6th century AD. In this province, it is sometimes difficult to know if these formations (\"-ville, -val, -mont, -mesnil\", etc.) are Pre-Normanic or Normanic, due to similarities between the two.\n\nThe main romance appellatives are the following:\n\n\nIn France, including Normandy, the extension of \"-court\", \"-ville\", and \"-mesnil\" (including its variant spellings \"-maisnil\" and \"-ménil\") corresponds generally to Frankish and other Germanic settlements. This is the most likely reason why the common word order is also from the Germanic: determinative (adjective, appellative or owner's name) plus determined (romance element). Examples include: Neuville, meaning \"new village\"; Bourville (\"Bodardi villa\", 8th century) meaning \"Bodard's farm\"; Harcourt (\"Herolcurt\", 11th century) meaning \"Herulf's farm\"; and Attemesnil (\"Ademesnil\", 13th century) meaning \"Adda's property\". Less than one-third of France, the north, makes use of the Germanic ordering.\n\nIn Vulgar Latin, as in Celtic, the opposite word order prevailed: determined (Romance appellative) plus determinative (adjective). This order dominates in Occitan toponymy, as well as in western France. Instead of Neuville, in the south we find Villeneuve, derived either from Occitan, \"Vielanova\", or from a more modern name.\n\nSimilarly, northern Neuchâtel, Neufchâtel, or Neufchâteau, meaning \"new castle\", corresponding to southern Châteauneuf or Châtelneuf, a translation of Castelnau in Occitan.\n\nIn the Norman toponymy, the most widespread appellative is \"-ville\" or \"Ville-\", with an estimated 20% of the French communes of Normandy containing this appellative. The oldest recorded instance is Bourville, as \"Bodardi villa\" in 715. This is in contrast to the much less frequently used \"-court\", which was not used anymore in the Viking Age.\n\nThe most widely used \"-ville\" toponyms are combined with either an Old Scandinavian or Anglo-Scandinavian male name or a Romance adjective: Amfreville (Ásfríðr′s farm), Auzouville (Osulf / Osolf′s farm), Beuzeville (Bosi′s farm), Colleville (Kolli′s farm), Épreville (*Sproti′s farm, cf. Faroese Sproti), Sotteville (Sóti′s farm), Tocqueville (Tóki′s farm), Touffreville (Þórfríðr′s farm), Tourville (Þórr's farm), Trouville (Thorold's farm), Grainville (Grímr / GrímR's farm), Bretteville (Briton's farm) and Englesqueville or Anglesqueville (English farm). These toponyms do not exist in France outside of Normandy, because their first element is an Old Scandinavian or an Old Anglo-Scandinavian personal name and sometimes a romance adjective marking they came from Great-Britain, but were mainly Anglo-Scandinavian farmers. In addition some typical Gaelic male′s names can be found in Doncanville (Donnchadh> Duncan′s farm), Quinéville or Quenneville (Cináed > Kenneth′s farm), Néville (Niall > Njáll′s farm).\n\nThe \"-court\" appellative is usually combined with either a Germanic masculine name, as in Hébécourt, from \"Herbert\" > Norman-French \"Hebert\" (today the surname Hébert), as in Sébécourt, from \"Sigebert\" > \"Sebert\" (today the surname \"Sébert\"). It almost never appears as a suffix in the western part of Normandy, but as a prefix (\"Cour-\", \"Gour-\", \"Col-\", \"Coul-\"): Gourfaleur from \"falor\", the name of a people; Coulvain, meaning \"Laipwin's court\"; and Coulimer, meaning \"Lietmar's court\". François de Beaurepaire observed that \"-court\" and \"Cour-\" were never used with an Anglo-Scandinavian male's name or element.\n\nAnother common appellative is \"-mesnil\" or \"Mesnil-\" (written as \"ménil\" in the Orne département). They are mainly combined with masculine anthroponyms as in Aubermesnil or Avremesnil, much like the \"-ville\" place-names, and were later built according to the Romance order, for example Mesnil-Hermant and Mesnil-Esnard.\n\nThe appellative \"-bosc\" or \"Bosc-\" (pronounced [bo:] or [bɔk]), meaning \"wood\", corresponds to the French word \"bois\", and is specific to this Province. In Normandy, it is usually combined with a masculine name: Auberbosc and Colbosc, when following the Germanic order; while the later Romance order gives numerous examples, such as Bosc-Roger, Bosc-Renoult, and Bosc-Robert.\n\n\"-vast\" is the only one that never appears as \"*Vast-\", but autonomous as le Vast. The first element must be a personal name, like Gallo-Romance Martin in Martinvast, Old Norse Sóti in Sottevast (\"Sotewast\", 12th century), and Old Norse Tóli in Tollevast (\"Toberwast\" and \"Tolewast\", 12th century). Véraval, now often misspelled as Ver-à-Val, became a \"-val\" (\"valley\") place-name by popular etymology. First recorded as \"Warelwast\" in 1024 (see William de Warelwast), utilizing the former appellative, \"-wast\" (meaning \"bad land\", or \"unfertile or uncultivated land\"), which is now spelled \"-vast\" in the north and \"ga(s)t(te)\" in the south. Its etymology is ultimately Latin \"vastus\" \"bad land\" mixed up with Old Low Franconian \"*wost\" \"desert\" (Old High German \"wuosti\", Old English \"wēste\").\n\nOld Norse settlement names began with the Norse settlement at the end of the ninth century, expanding in the tenth century with the creation of the Duchy of Normandy by Rollo in 911. Since the speakers of Old Norse were linguistically assimilated into Francophone society within a few generations, these settlement names most likely date prior to the 11th century. Most of these settlers were most likely Danish and/or Norwegian. These languages were quite similar to each other, making it difficult to distinguish the origin of the appellatives and accompanying adjective or male name.\n\n\nA similar use can be found in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany : Haddeby (\"Hadæboth\" 1285).\n\n\n\nThe names in parentheses are the earlier forms of the place-names, with the century in which they appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located underground in the Eastern end of the Sahara Desert and spans the political boundaries of four countries in north-eastern Africa. NSAS covers a land area spanning just over two million km, including north-western Sudan, north-eastern Chad, south-eastern Libya, and most of Egypt. Containing an estimated 150,000 km of groundwater, the significance of the NSAS as a potential water resource for future development programs in these countries is extraordinary. Recently the Great Man-made River Project (GMMR) in Libya began extracting substantial amounts of water from this aquifer, removing an estimated 2.4 km per year. This system is primarily used to supply water in the Kufra oasis.\n\nSince 2001, the Nubian Sandstone aquifer situated between the Toshka and Abu Simbel areas of Egypt underwent intensive drilling and development as part of a land reclamation project. Drilling information was used to conduct a variety of studies regarding the hydrogeological setting of the area's aquifer. Results indicated that lithological characteristics and tectonic settings are having a substantial effect on groundwater flow patterns and the area's overall aquifer potentiality, which is considered relatively low when compared to neighboring areas in eastern Oweinat or Dakhla.\n\nThe aquifer is largely composed of hard ferruginous sandstone with great shale and clay intercalation, having a thickness that ranges between 140–230 meters. Groundwater type varies from fresh to slightly brackish (salinity ranges from 240-1300 ppm). The ion dominance ordering shows that sodium cation is most commonly predominating over calcium and magnesium - whereas chloride is predominant over sulfate and bicarbonate. The groundwater is of meteoric origin (the term meteoric water refers to water that originated as precipitation; most groundwater is meteoric in origin). High concentrations of sodium, chloride, and sulfates reflect the leaching and dissolution processes of gypsiferous shales and clay, in addition to a lengthy duration of water residence.\n\nSince 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency has been working in cooperation with the four NSAS countries to help increase understanding of the aquifer's complexities through the IAEA-UNDP-GEF Nubian Project. Project partners include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/Global Environment Facility (GEF), IAEA, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and government representatives from the NSAS countries. The project's long-term goal is establishing rational and equitable management of the NSAS as a productive way of advancing socio-economic development in the region and protecting biodiversity and land resources.\n\n\n"}

Portugal is the westernmost country of continental Europe and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south and by Spain to the north and east. The Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira (including the Savage Islands) are also part of Portugal.\n\nThe land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continuously settled since prehistoric times. Some of the earliest civilizations include Lusitanians and Celtic societies. Incorporation into the Roman Republic dominions took place in the 2nd century BC. The region was ruled and colonized by Germanic peoples, such as the Suebi and the Visigoths, from the 5th to the 8th century. From this era, some vestiges of the Alans were also found. The Muslim Moors arrived in the early 8th century and conquered the Christian Germanic kingdoms, eventually occupying most of the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 12th century, during the Christian \"Reconquista\", Portugal appeared as a kingdom independent of its neighbour, the Kingdom of León and Galicia. In a little over a century, in 1249, Portugal would establish almost its entire modern-day borders.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, with a global empire that included possessions in Africa, Asia and South America, Portugal was one of the world's major economic, political, and cultural powers. In the 17th century, the Portuguese Restoration War between Portugal and Spain ended the sixty-year period of the Iberian Union (1580–1640). In the 19th century, armed conflict with French and Spanish invading forces and the loss of its largest territorial possession abroad, Brazil, disrupted political stability and potential economic growth. In 1910, the last Portuguese king was overthrown and a republic was proclaimed. In 1926, a coup d'état established a military dictatorship that would be replaced by a fascist regime called Estado Novo in 1933. After the Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974) and the Carnation Revolution coup d'état in 1974, the ruling regime was deposed in Lisbon, a democracy was established and the country handed over its last overseas provinces in Africa. Portugal was accepted as a member of the European Economic Community in 1986.

It is essentially the vertical equivalent of a \"water level\".\n\nThe instrument has been used since at least the time of ancient Egypt to ensure that constructions are \"plumb\", or vertical. It is also used in surveying, to establish the nadir with respect to gravity of a point in space. It is used with a variety of instruments (including levels, theodolites, and steel tapes) to set the instrument exactly over a fixed survey marker or to transcribe positions onto the ground for placing a marker.\n\nThe \"plumb\" in \"plumb-bob\" comes from the fact that such tools were originally made of lead (Latin: \"plumbum\", French: \"plomb\"). The adjective \"plumb\" developed by extension, as did the noun \"aplomb,\" from the notion of \"standing upright.\"\n\nUntil the modern age, plumb-bobs were used on most tall structures to provide vertical datum lines for the building measurements. A section of the scaffolding would hold a plumb line, which was centered over a datum mark on the floor. As the building proceeded upward, the plumb line would also be taken higher, still centered on the datum. Many cathedral spires, domes and towers still have brass datum marks inlaid into their floors, which signify the center of the structure above.\nAlthough a plumb-bob and line alone can determine only a vertical if they are mounted on a suitable scale, the instrument may also be used as an inclinometer to measure angles to the vertical.\n\nThe early skyscrapers used heavy plumb-bobs, hung on wire in their elevator shafts.\n\nA plumb bob may be in a container of water (when conditions are above freezing temperatures), molasses, very viscous oils or other liquids to dampen any swinging movement, functioning as a shock absorber.\n\nStudents of figure drawing will also make use of a plumb line to find the vertical axis through the center of gravity of their subject and lay it down on paper as a point of reference. The device used may be purpose-made plumb lines, or simply makeshift devices made from a piece of string and a weighted object, such as a metal washer. This plumb line is important for lining up anatomical geometries and visualizing the subject's center of balance.\n\n\n"}

The population was 926 at the 2010 census. Texhoma is a divided city with the Texas–Oklahoma state border separating the town from Texhoma, Texas. The name of the town is a portmanteau of Texas and Oklahoma. Founded around the Rock Island Railroad laying tracks through the area, much of the town's local economy is from ranching and livestock.\n\nBefore No Man's Land was opened for settlers in 1890, the area now known as the Oklahoma Panhandle was sparsely settled ranchland. After the opening some of the land was filed on near the ranch headquarters, mostly by the cowboys, and sold to the ranch as soon as proved up. Expansion of the Rock Island Railroad tracks from Liberal, Kansas to Santa Rosa, New Mexico spurred the settlement's formation.\n\nA post office named Loretta was established May 7, 1898, but the name and location was changed to Texhoma on November 12, 1901, as there was another Loretta, Oklahoma. Very few claims were filed on until the railroad was assured. The town grew quickly to a population near 1,000, serving as the closest railroad town to the people who lived as far north and west as present Boise City, and south into the Texas Panhandle to the present town of Gruver.\n\nThe land was quickly homesteaded and proved to be a rich agricultural area.\n\nTexhoma is located at (36.504421, -101.786517). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.\n\nTexhoma is most known for the fact that it is paired with another Texhoma across the border in Texas. Tourists come for the border sign that separates Oklahoma and Texas, and the sign is very iconic.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 935 people, 352 households, and 254 families residing in the town. The population density was 1,495.0 people per square mile (573.0/km²). There were 408 housing units at an average density of 652.3 per square mile (250.0/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 81.60% White, 0.96% Native American, 0.21% Asian, 14.76% from other races, and 2.46% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.76% of the population.\n\nThere were 352 households out of which 39.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.5% were married couples living together, 5.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.8% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.15.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 31.2% under the age of 18, 9.1% from 18 to 24, 27.6% from 25 to 44, 18.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 113.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.5 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $27,500, and the median income for a family was $36,667. Males had a median income of $23,229 versus $18,250 for females. The per capita income for the town was $12,938. About 11.7% of families and 15.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.9% of those under age 18 and 17.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\nTexhoma students in both Texas and Oklahoma are served jointly by an unusual bi-state arrangement. Kindergarten through fourth grade students are served by the Texhoma Independent School District in Texas, while fifth through twelfth grade students by Texhoma Public Schools in Oklahoma. It is the only city in Oklahoma where graduating students can attend either Oklahoma or Texas public universities at the in-state tuition rates for either.\n\n\nTexhoma High School is housed in a pair of monolithic dome structures.\n\nRegistered Historic Places in the Texhoma area: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "48476253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48476253", "title": "The Park (video game)", "text": "The Park (video game)\n\nThe Park is a first-person psychological horror adventure game developed and published by Funcom. The game was released via Steam on October 27, 2015 and is a spin-off of an earlier Funcom game, \"The Secret World\". It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on May 3, 2016.\n\n\"The Park\" is experienced from a first-person perspective as the player interacts with and experiences the decrepit environment of Atlantic Island Park. There is no combat or defense and the player has no health HUD as Lorraine can only interact with limited objects in-game and there are no enemies to battle. These objects mostly consist of pages that reveal the backstory of the park and later, Lorraine. Lorraine can call out to Callum at any time during gameplay, and this may have a small affect as it allows Lorraine to follow Callum's voice and thus continue the narrative of the story or to reach necessary areas or objectives within the park such as the rides. The rides act as both exposition and scares. To enter the House of Horrors, Lorraine must find a flashlight. Throughout the game, Lorraine narrates her feelings and memories to the player.\n\nThe game follows Lorraine, a struggling single mother and widow with a troubled past, as she searches for her young son, Callum, who goes missing in Atlantic Island Park. Lorraine enters the park after her son just as the park prepares to close for the afternoon, only to find that nighttime comes unnaturally fast as she ascends the escalator and discovers the park to be abandoned, vandalized and rundown as if several years have passed. Despite abandonment, the rides and lights mysteriously still function. Lorraine calls for Callum and his voice calls to her, leading her through the decrepit park.\n\nLorraine boards several rides which reveal the themes and backstory of the game: the Tunnel of Tales tells the story of Hansel and Gretel, this time with a new ending - in which after cooking the witch in the oven, Hansel and Gretel devour her. On the Ferris Wheel, Lorraine remembers Callum's father Don, a construction worker at the park who died in a fall from the Ferris Wheel when Lorraine was still pregnant with Callum. Between rides, Lorraine expresses her frustration with Callum, her belief that she is a failure as a mother, her history of mental health problems, and her fear that Callum is becoming changed by some mysterious threat. However, while aboard the roller coaster, a monstrous top-hatted ringmaster (identified in the credits as The Boogeyman) accosts Lorraine and claims 'the Witch' has her son.\n\nAccording to notes found throughout the area, the park's grounds are hinted to have a sinister history that tainted them, as a consequence of previous owner Archibald Henderson's actions, which the new owner Mr. Winter tried to take advantage of: several notes indicate that he had found a way to unlock the power hidden beneath the grounds by harvesting the positive emotions of guests, and believed that the energy he unlocked would be enough to grant him immortality. However, workers and employees alike experienced feelings of anxiety as a result of the process, and a number of fatal incidents occurred. One noticeable case involved 'Chad the Chipmunk', the park's mascot: Steve, the employee wearing the chipmunk suit, became disturbed and reluctant to remove the suit as time went on - and ultimately murdered a teenager with an icepick. Following Steve's arrest and the disappearance of over a dozen children inside the House of Horrors, the Park was forced to close permanently, drawing Lorraine's perceptions during the introduction into question.\n\nAt last, Lorraine enters the witch-faced House of Horrors, still following Callum, and remarking on the similarity between this and the Hansel and Gretel story. Inside, messages from Mr. Winter reveal that he retreated into the House with his machines when the Park closed, hoping to achieve immortality by other means. However, the interior of the House changes to a loop of Lorraine and Callum's own home through time, where it is revealed that Lorraine's father abused and abducted her as a child, her estranged mother refuses to help her in the belief that she ran away from home, and she suffered from depression when Callum was born and given electroshock therapy. As Lorraine passes through each version of her house, it becomes more decrepit and disturbing. At the end, she finds a message by Mr. Winter revealing that he needs children for his harvesting machines, and has already kidnapped and killed at least one in order to fuel his immortality; notes such as these, combined with popular depictions of Winter in a similar ringmaster's garb and top hat, suggest that he is actually the Boogeyman haunting the grounds.\n\nLorraine reveals that in the oldest versions of the Hansel and Gretel story, the cruel mother and the Witch were the same person, and that she believes she is the real Witch - apparently accepting that her neglect of Callum was the indirect cause of Callum's disappearance. Finally, she reaches Callum, lying unconscious on a slab. Chad the Chipmunk appears behind her, then is replaced by the Boogeyman, who forces a bloody icepick into Lorraine's hands, then guides her hands so she holds the point above Callum's chest; however, he then releases her hands and vanishes, allowing Lorraine to stab Callum in the heart.\n\nAfterwards, Lorraine is sitting in a police station interrogation room, clearly grief-stricken. A detective identical to the Park gatekeeper enters, carrying a jar with a bee in it, and tells her not to worry about losing things and to think of the last place she saw her son. Lorraine narrates that, in her heart and mind, she will always return to Atlantic Island Park. Ultimately, though the supernatural elements of the game are eventually confirmed to be true by the game's ties with \"The Secret World\" and Lorraine's appearance in later issues of the game, it's left ambiguous as to how much of \"The Park\" was real and how much was simply imaginary.\n\n\"The Park\" was announced by Funcom on August 26, 2015. According to Funcom's Rui Casais, the games' development began as an experiment by a small team. The team hoped to utilize the worlds from their previous massively multiplayer online games, and reshape them into some smaller single-player games. According to Casasis, it was \"creatively energising\" for the team to work on a new single-player game as their last game with a single-player focus was \"\" in 2006. The game's universe is based on 2012's \"The Secret World\".\n\nThe game was announced for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2015. Funcom later announced that the console versions will be released on May 3, 2016, making it the first Funcom game developed for consoles since \"Dreamfall\" in 2006.\n\nThe game currently holds a rating of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n"}
{"id": "3231426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3231426", "title": "The bush", "text": "The bush\n\n\"The bush\" is a rural, undeveloped country area in certain areas.\n\nThe concept of \"the bush\" has become iconic in Australia. In reference to the landscape, \"bush\" refers to any sparsely-inhabited region, regardless of vegetation. \"The bush\" in this sense was something that was uniquely Australian and very different from the green European landscapes familiar to many new immigrants. The term \"Outback\" is also used, but usually in association with the more arid inland areas of Australia. \"The Bush\" also refers to any populated region outside of the major metropolitan areas, including mining and agricultural areas. Consequently, it is not unusual to have a mining town in the desert such as Port Hedland (Pop. 14,000) referred to as \"the bush\" within the media.\n\nBush poets such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson revered the bush as a source of national ideals, as did contemporaneous painters in the Heidelberg School like Tom Roberts (1856-1931), Arthur Streeton (1867-1943) and Frederick McCubbin (1855-1917). Romanticising the bush in this way was a big step forward for Australians in their steps towards self-identity. The legacy is a folklore rich in the spirit of the bush.\n\nAustralians affix the term \"bush\" to any number of other entities or activities to describe their rural, country or folk nature, e.g. \"Bush Cricket\", \"Bush Music\", \"Bush Doof\", etc.\n\nIn New Zealand, \"Bush\" primarily refers to areas of native trees rather than exotic forests, however, the word is also used in the Australian sense of anywhere outside urban areas, encompassing grasslands as well as forests.\n\nThe New Zealand usage of \"bush\" probably comes from the word \"bosch\", used by Dutch settlers in South Africa, where it meant uncultivated country.\n\nAreas with bush (i.e. native forest) are found predominantly in the South Island, especially in the West Coast region stretching from Fiordland to Nelson, with the east coast having been deforested except for parts of Kaikoura and the Catlins. Much of Stewart Island/Rakiura is bush-covered. In the North Island, the largest areas of bush cover the main ranges stretching north-northeast from Wellington towards East Cape, notably including the Urewera Ranges, and the catchment of the Whanganui River. Significant stands remain in Northland and the ranges running south from the Coromandel Peninsula towards Ruapehu, and isolated remnants cap various volcanoes in Taranaki, the Waikato, the Bay of Plenty and the Hauraki Gulf.\n\nFrom the word comes many phrases including:\n\nIn South Africa, the term has specific connotations of rural areas which are not open veldt. Generally, it refers to areas in the north of the country that would be called savanna. \"Going to The Bush\" often refers to going to a game park or game reserve. Areas most commonly referred to as The Bush are the Mpumalanga and Limpopo Lowveld, The Limpopo River Valley, northern KwaZulu-Natal or any other similar area of wilderness.\n\nThe Bush in Alaska is generally described as any community not \"on the road system\", making it accessible only by more elaborate transportation. Usage is similar in Canada; it is called \"la brousse,\" if you are French or colloquially \"Le Bois,\" in Canadian French. In northern Ontario, “the bush” refers to the massive expanse of primarily coniferous trees that sprawl undeveloped towards the northern eastern and western borders of the province. The term is not generally used in the southern parts of the province.\n\nThe term \"to go bush\" has several similar meanings all connected with the supposed wildness of the bush. It can mean to revert to a feral nature (or to \"go native\"), and it can also mean to deliberately leave normal surroundings and live rough, with connotations of cutting off communication with the outside world – often as a means of evading capture or questioning by the police. The term \"bushwhacker\" is used in Australia and New Zealand to mean someone who spends his or her time in the bush. \n\nAnother related term used in Australia is \"Sydney or the bush\", which equates with such terms as \"Hollywood or bust\" to mean staking total success or failure on one high-risk event. This usage appears in several \"Peanuts\" cartoons, causing Charlie Brown much confusion.\n\nIn addition, many Vietnam War Veterans refer to the wilderness, jungle or border areas of the theatre of operations as \"the bush\", as opposed to towns, cities and military bases.\n\nIn New Zealand, \"The Bush\" is a nickname for the Wairarapa Bush provincial rugby team. The team was formed by an amalgamation of two earlier teams (Wairarapa and Bush), the latter of which represented an area on the boundaries of the Wairarapa and Hawke's Bay which was in former times known as Bush, due to its dense vegetation cover.\n\nThe Bushwhackers were also a New Zealand professional wrestling tag team that was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015.\n\nTo \"bushwhack\" has two meanings, one is to cut through heavy brush and other vegetation to pass through the tangled country: \"We had to do quite a bit of bushwhacking today to clear the new trail.\" The other meaning is to hide in such areas and then attack unsuspecting passers-by: \"We were bushwhacked by the bandits as we passed through their territory and they took all of our money and supplies.\"\n\nIn the United States, the term has a similar meaning, for example in minor league baseball, typically played in smaller cities, and sometimes derisively called \"bush league\" baseball.\n"}

{"id": "14263974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14263974", "title": "Triangle (The X-Files)", "text": "Triangle (The X-Files)\n\n\"Triangle\" is the third episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series \"The X-Files\". It premiered on the Fox network on November 22, 1998. Written and directed by series creator Chris Carter, \"Triangle\" is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the overarching mythology of \"The X-Files\". \"Triangle\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.8, being watched by 18.20 million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode generally received positive reviews with many critics commenting on the episode's directing style.\n\nThe show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work and the two have developed a close friendship. In this episode, Mulder races to a luxury passenger liner which has mysteriously appeared in the Bermuda Triangle. Once there, he realizes he has traveled back in time to September 3, 1939—the outbreak of World War II. German soldiers have boarded the ship in search of \"Thor's Hammer\", something that could ensure victory in the coming conflict. Scully, after being informed of Mulder's disappearance by The Lone Gunmen, rushes through the J. Edgar Hoover Building, looking for someone who can help find her missing partner.\n\n\"Triangle\" is filmed in a style inspired by the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock film \"Rope\", with many scenes edited to appear as single takes. In addition, \"Triangle\" features the main and recurring cast members such as Anderson, William B. Davis, Chris Owens, James Pickens Jr. and Mitch Pileggi, who played their contemporary characters as well as distinctly different characters from 1939 on board the luxury liner. Several of the episode's themes have been critically examined, such as the concept of \"dream-nazis\", the appearance of modern characters portraying those from the past, and the ramification that the entire episode was a dream.\n\nFox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies unconscious in the sea after wrecking his raft. He is taken aboard a passenger ship, the \"Queen Anne\", by its British crew members. When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to explain that the \"Queen Anne\" vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998. The crew dismisses Mulder's story and suspect he is a Nazi spy. At that moment, the \"Queen Anne\" is boarded by SS troops under the control of an \"Oberführer\" resembling The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who sets the ship's course for Nazi Germany. The crew of the \"Queen Anne\" lock Mulder in the captain's quarters, where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of World War II. Mulder realizes that the \"Queen Anne\" did not travel to 1998: he has traveled back to 1939.\n\nIn the present, The Lone Gunmen inform Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) that they have lost contact with Mulder, who had set out in search of the \"Queen Anne\". Scully first turns to Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), unsuccessfully, then attempts to confront Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) who is seen with the Smoking Man. She finally threatens Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) before Skinner shows up and provides her with the information from the Pentagon. Scully leaves with the Gunmen to find Mulder. On the \"Queen Anne\", a British sailor tells Mulder that the Germans are looking for what they believe is a weapon called \"Thor's Hammer\". Mulder tells him that Thor's Hammer is not a weapon, but a scientist that will build a weapon. The sailor turns out to be a German spy and locks Mulder in the engine room with the ship's crew. One of the sailors, who strongly resembles Kersh, decides to steer the boat to Jamaica, but Mulder tells them to sail back where they came from, in order to pass through the time warp and re-appear in 1998.\n\nEventually, Mulder is taken to the ballroom by the Nazis. Once there, he is ordered to identify the scientist, or the Nazis will begin shooting passengers. After they have killed two men, a woman who looks strikingly like Scully tells the Nazis that they are killing innocent people for nothing, and that Mulder knows nothing. Mulder tells the Nazis that one of the men they shot was the scientist, but the true scientist steps forward. The Nazis prepare to execute Mulder and \"Scully\", but before they are able, the engine is shut down. British sailors descend upon the ballroom and begin fighting the Nazis. In the midst of the chaos, Mulder and \"Scully\" escape. Scully and the Lone Gunmen find the \"Queen Anne\" and board it, only to find that it is an empty ghost ship.\n\nBack in 1939, as the British sailors fight the Nazis in the ballroom, Mulder tells \"Scully\" that she has to turn the ship around and return to the Bermuda Triangle in order to get the ship out of the rift in space. Mulder grabs \"Scully\" and kisses her, \"in case we never meet again\". \"Scully\" punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, surrounded by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they all think he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully thinks his declaration is an effect of the drugs he has been given, rolls her eyes and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where \"Scully\" punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing smile.\n\n\"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter developed the idea for \"Triangle\" while working on the fifth-season episode \"The Red and the Black\". While filming the episode, Carter used so much film that the crew made him a mock trophy. This, in turn, inspired him to write an episode that featured continuous action, thereby using as little film as possible. Carter designed \"Triangle\" in a style similar to Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film \"Rope\". Initially, Fox executives were hesitant to green-light production for \"Triangle\" because it was expected to exceed the $2.5 million episode budget. To persuade them, Carter told the executives that the episode would feature elements of Hitchcock's directing style, a move he later called \"an easy hook\". Carter also cited the 1964 \"Twilight Zone\" adaptation of \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" as inspiration.\n\nThe scenes taking place on the \"Queen Anne\" were filmed aboard the retired British ocean liner RMS \"Queen Mary\", which is moored at Long Beach, California and currently serves as a hotel. Filming on board the ship took place over eleven days. To block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, \"The X-Files\" crew erected wrap-around scaffolding on the ship's bridge. To give the effect of rain during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems that provided a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had whole portions of the ship redesigned so that the finished episode would have a late-1930s feel.\n\nFor authenticity, several British and German actors portrayed the British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose dialogue was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language which he did not speak. He later explained, \"I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'.\" To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method \"seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair.\" Tom Braidwood, who played Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike and was an assistant director on the show, called Davis' role \"brutal\" and noted that \"It was really tough for William because he had to learn all this German.\" Davis later joked that \"Maybe we shouldn't try to do two clever things at once. I think it worked fine, but it was a struggle to do it.\" The only main cast member of \"The X-Files\" who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense in the context of the scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, \"The Truth is Out There\", was translated into German: \"Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen\".\n\nFilmed in real time, the episode is designed to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, \"I said [to the cast and crew] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone looked at me like I was nuts.\" To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. The steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, \"You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it.\" The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the \"Queen Anne\", the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory. Both the cast and crew admitted that filming an episode of \"The X-Files\" in real time was physically and mentally exhausting. Duchovny later joked that, after filming concluded, he \"could win an Emmy for most bruises.\" Gillian Anderson described the real time directing style as \"challenging.\" She said, \"I'm realizing how comfortable and connected I am to the rhythm we're used to.\"\n\nIn an interview before the episode was finished, Gillian Anderson said she was most looking forward to the scene in which Scully takes an elevator through FBI headquarters in her quest to locate Mulder. She later compared the episode to live theater, which she had worked in previously. During the filming of this scene, when the actors entered the stage elevator, the set that they would next move onto had to be constructed behind the closed doors. Many times during filming, these doors would open before the set behind had been completed, which ruined the shot. The final two acts of the episode feature a sophisticated split-screen mise en scène: Rather than displaying two different events, each side of the screen features the same setting, but with each side set during a different time period. When Scully runs around the corner in the present day, she does so at the same time as Mulder and the 1939 version of Scully. This was filmed in such a way that as the actors pass each other in the hallway, they also pass into the opposite frame of the split screen. This effect was inspired by the music video for Semisonic's hit 1998 single \"Closing Time.\"\n\nEditor Louise Innes, who was working on her first \"X-Files\" episode, said the post-production editing process was \"not as easy as it sounds.\" Innes was tasked with connecting roughly forty shots and creating the illusion of one, uniform scene. After the reels of film were combined, several pending issues had to be tweaked in post-production. For instance, during the scene in which Scully runs into an elevator, two shots were spliced together, but the color did not completely match. The images and their colors were later corrected by the series' \"postproduction troubleshooters\" using digital manipulation. When the episode was filmed, it was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen. When the episode aired, it was shown letterboxed to fit in a 1.33:1 television screen; this was the first \"X-Files\" episode to receive this treatment. Carter reasoned that this method would allow for more action to be viewable in each frame.\n\nTo get a feel for the era, \"X-Files\" composer Mark Snow listened to the big band music of Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, Gene Krupa, and Glenn Miller. The \"bouncy instrumental\" that plays during the ballroom fight scene was inspired by a similar swing tune, written by John Williams, from the 1979 Steven Spielberg film \"1941\". Snow later joked that his composition was \"the third generation of the same inspiration.\" Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, \"I got a chance to use some of my favorite '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes.\" Producer Paul Rabwin also supervised \"a special arrangement\" of the 1938 jazz standard \"Jeepers Creepers\", which was also included in the ballroom scene.\n\nThe episode contains many intentional references to the 1939 musical film \"The Wizard of Oz\". The ship's captain is named after the film's lyricist Yip Harburg, and the ballroom singer, Almira Gulch, after \"The Wizard of Oz\" character who is the analog for the Wicked Witch of the West. Her band is The Lollipop Guild, a reference to a section of the song \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\", while Mulder's wrecked ship is called the \"Lady Garland\", after Judy Garland. The final scene of \"Triangle\", which features Mulder in bed telling his friends and co-workers that he saw them in his reverie, bears a striking resemblance to the closing scene of \"Oz\". Because of this, the scene was called \"obviously derivative\" by one reviewer. Further, when Mulder mentions that Skinner was with him in 1939, which is the year \"The Wizard of Oz\" was released, Skinner replies \"with my dog Toto\", and Scully tells him \"there's no place like home\".\n\nThe episode features several historical errors. Anderson's 1939 character is said to work for the Office of Strategic Services, which was not established until 1942. The code name \"Thor's Hammer\" is an invention of the writers. Lee Smith, the official researcher for the show, was tasked with finding the name for the secret pre-World War II atomic research project. Unfortunately for the show, the actual code name, Development of Substitute Materials, was considered \"uninspiring,\" so the name \"Thor's Hammer\" was created instead.\n\nRobert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book \"Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen\", examined the characterization of the villains in the episode and the meta-references to the series. Shearman and Pearson note that the episode makes a distinct difference when portraying the Nazis on-screen. Instead of showing them as \"real Nazis\"—like those featured in the third-season episode \"Paper Clip\", among others—this episode portrays them as deliberately exaggerated \"dream-nazis\". The two argue that the villains are played as \"comic book nasties\" and are similar in style to the villains from the \"Indiana Jones\" movie franchise.\n\nShearman and Pearson analyzed the portrayals of several of the series' regular characters as 1930s villains, noting several meta-references to the wider series. The two noted that, in his portrayal of a Nazi, Jeffrey Spender was allowed to \"cut loose and rant like a proper villain rather than a sulky boy hiding in the basement.\" In contrast, Walter Skinner's 1939 character behaved more like his character in the wider series, his role \"charmingly parodying the ambiguity he's been playing all these years and turning out to be an American-loving ally who tells our heroes to get their 'asses out of here'.\"\n\nTom Kessenich, in his book \"Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Season 6–9 of The X-Files\", critically examined the ideas that the entire episode was either a dream or existed in some sort of \"parallel universe\". Kessenich reasons that, because the episode contains several overt references to \"The Wizard of Oz\" and the fact that Chris Carter noted that the episode was based on the idea of Mulder's subconscious mind at work, much of \"Triangle\" was simply a dream. Furthermore, Kessenich backs up his argument by pointing out that many of the characters on the ship were played by familiar faces—The Smoking Man as the Nazi leader, Spender as a Nazi \"lap dog\", Skinner as a double agent, Kersh as an \"unfamiliar friend or foe\", and Scully as Mulder's ultimate ally. This would suggest, according to Kessenich, that the entire episode was acted out in Mulder's mind while he was unconscious in the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nPromoted with the tagline \"Tonight, they get carried away... On a doomed voyage, the passion between Mulder and Scully is finally unstoppable\", \"Triangle\" premiered on the Fox network in the United States on November 22, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped households and 16 percent of households watching television were tuned in. It was viewed by 18.2 million viewers. \"Triangle\" was the 18th most watched television program for the week ending November 22. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on March 21, 1999, and received 0.74 million viewers, making it the fourth most watched program that week.\n\nWhen the finished program was shown to the cast and crew, their response was very positive. Gillian Anderson said, \"I never quite understood whether it was going to work or not. When we finally saw 'Triangle' after this new way of filming everything, a style that we'd never attempted before, as well as trying new scenes ... trying this, trying that ...  that was terrific.\" Chris Owens, who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike, said, \"One thing I really like about \"The X-Files\" was that they were always challenging themselves. Chris [Carter] would write an episode in which we're going to do \"Rope\" without any cuts, seemingly. A great challenge for a cast and crew.\"\n\nThe episode received generally positive critical reviews from the press. Matt Zoller Seitz from \"The Star-Ledger\" gave an overwhelmingly positive review of \"Triangle\". Applauding Carter's risky and audacious direction, he noted that \"there has never been an hour of TV that looks or moves like 'Triangle'\". He argued that the 1939 scene where Mulder and \"Scully\" cross paths with present-Scully was \"the greatest minute of TV this year\". Seitz also compared the episode to three-dimensional video games, like \"Doom\", \"Quake\", and \"Castle Wolfenstein\", citing the episode's \"gloomy corridors\" and \"nightmarish cartoon Nazis\". Michael Liedtke and George Avalos from \"The Charlotte Observer\" predicted that \"'Triangle' seems destined to take its rightful place in the pantheon of greatest 'X-Files' episodes\". Enjoying the plethora of \"Wizard of Oz\" references, the two parodied a portion of \"Over the Rainbow\" in their column. Not all reviewers were so positive; for Alan Sepinwall, \"Triangle\" was the episode \"that turned out to be a dream\", making it \"technically impressive but dramatically murky\".\n\nSeveral years after its initial broadcast, \"Triangle\" has continued to receive positive reviews, with many critics calling it one of the show's best episodes. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A–. Earl Cressey from \"DVD Talk\" called it one of the highlights of season six. Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five and called it a \"shining gem of an episode.\"\n\nCarter's helmsmanship of \"Triangle\" received mostly favorable critical attention. Shearman and Pearson praised his directing, pointing to the scene where Scully dashes through the FBI building as \"the best scene of all\". Todd VanDerWerff of \"The A.V. Club\", in an \"A\" grade review, appreciated the style of filming, and wrote that the long scenes give \"the whole thing a sense of urgency that propels scenes that shouldn't work\". In addition, he called the split-screen shot \"darn near perfect\"; VanDerWerff later labeled it \"one of my favorite moments in the whole show\". Andrew Payne from \"Starpulse\" applauded the acting and directing, saying, \"Chris Carter rarely directed his creation, leaving that mostly to Kim Manners, but when he did he showed a brilliant eye not usually seen on broadcast TV. This is the best example—a breathlessly-paced episode in which each act appears as one continuous shot. ... This episode is a lot of fun, particularly in the act that finds Scully blitzing through the FBI building in order to get some information on Mulder's whereabouts. The acting is superb and nothing can beat those no-cut acts.\" Payne ultimately named it the fourth best \"X-Files\" episode. David Boston from \"Made Man\" wrote that \"we know whenever [Chris Carter] directs an episode it is always among the best.\" Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! Voices praised the split-screen scene and the scene featuring Scully running through the FBI building, comparing it favorably to Orson Welles' 1958 film \"Touch of Evil\". Jonathan Dunn, writing for What Culture, described \"Triangle\" as \"great\" and included it in the \"5 Episodes [of \"The X-Files\"] That Could Be Made Into Movies\" list. In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, \"Triangle\" was presented as the \"Best Chris Carter-Directed Episode\". Not all reviews were as glowing; Paula Vitaris from \"Cinefantastique\" wrote that \"everyone certainly deserves an A for effort\", she was unimpressed by the \"vertiginous camerawork\" and \"endless, monotonous tracking shots up and down hallways\". She ultimately awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.\n\nIn addition, many reviewers were pleased with the style and concept of \"Triangle\". Tom Kessenich lauded the atmosphere of the entry, calling it \"60 minutes of \"The X-Files\" at its finest\". Kessenich noted that, despite the \"gloom and doom\" talk that the series was heading in the wrong direction, stylistically, the episode proved \"just how exciting this show can be\". He ultimately concluded that it was \"a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality\" that allowed the viewer \"to try and ascertain what is real and what is not.\" He later named \"Triangle\" one of the \"Top 25 Episode of All Time\" of \"The X-Files\", and ranked it in second place. VanDerWerff noted that he thoroughly enjoyed the concept, pointing out that the \"sheer level of crazy stuff that goes on in this episode makes it fun to watch\". He wrote that \"[n]othing else had ever been this skillfully done on television before\", which resulted in a \"terrific episode of television\". Furthermore, he opined that \"[e]verything comes together in the episode's fantastically entertaining final act\", due to the presence of the dramatic fight scene, among others.\n\n\"Triangle\" features the first kiss between Mulder and Scully. Kessenich opined that the kiss built off \"the seeds that were planted in the movie ... Scully clearly believes this is a man lost in delirium, but Mulder ... is finally beginning to deal with some pretty powerful feelings he has for his partner.\" Paula Vitaris, on the other hand, was frustrated; she complained \"[w]hen are these kisses that are not kisses going to end?\"\n\nThe episode received a 1999 Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2654349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2654349", "title": "Washington Park (Dubuque, Iowa)", "text": "Washington Park (Dubuque, Iowa)\n\nWashington Park (also known as Washington Square) is a small public, urban park (1 acre) located in Downtown Dubuque, Iowa, United States. The park encompasses an entire city block, bordered on the north by West 7th Street, on the west by Bluff Street, on the south by West 6th Street, and on the east by Locust Street. The park is located between the city's post office and the Dubuque Museum of Art.\n\nIt was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and it was included as a contributing property in the Cathedral Historic District in 1985.\n\nThe block where Washington Park is located today was one of the original 35 blocks plotted out by surveyor G.W. Harrison in 1833 when the city was founded. From the beginning, the land was set aside for public use. The first church and first jail in Iowa were located on this land. In 1857, the area was designated as Washington Park.\n\nIn 1877, the Dubuque City Council had all the buildings on the block torn down. Shrubs and flowers were planted, walkways were established, and a -high Oriental gazebo was built on the grounds for $200. This gazebo, which was built by local architects Fridolin Heer and Edward Eaescher, was widely viewed as one of the finest pavilions in the area. On August 24, 1877, approximately 2,000 people attended the formal dedication of the park.\n\nIn 1878, a public drinking fountain was erected in the park. The city paid for half the cost, with the remaining half covered by private donations. A statue of Dr. Henry Cogswell was placed on top of this drinking fountain. Cogswell had promised the city that he would donate a statue for the fountain (which was supposed to be of a local heroine who had walked some distance to stop a train before it could come to a washed out bridge and derail). When the statue was uncovered for the first time, it turned out to be a statue of Cogswell. The statue remained in place until 1900, when a group of vandals pulled the statue down and buried it under what would be a new sidewalk. The following day, the new sidewalk was poured which entombed the object. The water fountain was gone by 1912, however, the statue is rumoured to still be buried under a sidewalk at the park.\n\nPublic events at the square over the years included Buffalo Bill Cody's \"Authentic Wild West Show\" performing in 1896 and President William McKinley giving a speech in 1899.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the gazebo was gone. Later, during the 1970s, the park underwent a $60,000 restoration. New trees, flowers, and shrubs were planted. New lights crafted to look like antique gas lamps were placed in the park. A new steel 3/4 size replica of the original gazebo built by Bradley Iron Works was placed on the site. This restoration was made possible by the Dubuque Jaycees who made a large financial contribution to the City of Dubuque. Also the Dubuque Jaycees had put together a time capsule using a donated grave vault. Boxes were handed out to the public who were asked to place items in the boxes and return to the Park when they would be placed in the time capsule. Once the boxes filled the vault it was sealed and buried right next to the southern side of the gazebo under the rock with the plaque that explains it is not to be opened for 100 years. That opening is set for the year 2076.\n\nDuring the summer of 2005, Washington Park underwent further improvements. The streets surrounding the park have been rebuilt, and the walkways in and around the park have been replaced. Lampposts designed to look like late 19th and early 20th century models have also been placed in and around the park. Again without the Dubuque Jaycees large financial contribution this progject would have been delayed. The Dubuque Jaycees has a special interest in Washington Park. Numerous times the group has been called upon and responded financially for the betterment of the park. The Group also decorates the park with a holiday theme each and every year.\n\n"}
