These marks were usually indicated with a chiseled arrow below the horizontal line.\n\nThe term is generally applied to any item used to mark a point as an elevation reference. Frequently, bronze or aluminum disks are set in stone or concrete, or on rods driven deeply into the earth to provide a stable elevation point. If an elevation is marked on a map, but there is no physical mark on the ground, it is a spot height.\n\nThe height of a benchmark is calculated relative to the heights of nearby benchmarks in a network extending from a \"fundamental benchmark\". A fundamental benchmark is a point with a precisely known relationship to the level datum of the area, typically mean sea level. The position and height of each benchmark is shown on large-scale maps.\n\nThe terms \"height\" and \"elevation\" are often used interchangeably, but in many jurisdictions they have specific meanings; \"height\" commonly refers to a local or relative difference in the vertical (such as the height of a building), whereas \"elevation\" refers to the difference from a nominated reference surface (such as sea-level, or a mathematical/geodetic model that approximates the sea level known as the geoid). Elevation may be specified as normal height (above a reference ellipsoid), orthometric height, or dynamic height which have slightly different definitions.\n\nTriangulation points, also known as trig points, are marks with a precisely established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as the tip of a church spire or a chimney stack are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the United Kingdom triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as \"fixed in three dimensions\".\n\nBenchmarks are typically placed (\"monumented\") by a government agency or private survey firm, and many governments maintain a register of these marks so that the records are available to all.

Over the long-term, the flux of sediment from a drainage basin oscillates around a mean value, producing a dynamic steady state, unless there are significant changes in boundary conditions such as climate, vegetation cover, or uplift rate.\n\nThe concept of balance, or equilibrium, between landforms and geomorphological processes provides a useful conceptual framework to study the evolution of landscapes, as well as understanding nonequilibrium landforms and landscapes. Often it is useful or convenient to assume that an equilibrium landscape does not change over time – a condition referred to as steady state. Equilibrium however is not static, but rather is a dynamic steady state with landscape characteristics that vary over time around a central tendency. This information suggests that steady state is strongly scale dependent.\n\nSystems can be defined as dynamic or non-dynamic in an equilibrium state. Besides the usual transient condition, where at least one quantity changes with time, stable dynamic systems may be in a steady state condition or equilibrium state where the system is at rest. This special condition is possible after sometime, when all input and output quantities are and remain constant. The relation between input and output quantities for a system in a steady state condition is called “Static Transfer Response of the Dynamic System”. Dynamic systems can be defined as static and transient, while this is seemingly contradictory, this indicates that the system is always a dynamic system, even if it remains momentarily in a steady state condition. The opposite of dynamic is not static but non-dynamic.\n\nWhen boundary conditions change significantly, geomorphic systems adjust. These adjustments aren't instantaneous, but rather, there is a lag in change, this is the response time. Many geomorphic systems are in steady state with their central tendencies oscillating in equilibrium around a mean value, however, when external factors such as climate or base level change, the system can cross a threshold, and after a certain response time, change to a new and different state in which the system will oscillate around a different mean value.\n\nAn example of this condition is deforestation combined with agricultural land conversion, this increases the fluvial sediment flux to a new and higher dynamic steady state because soils are now disturbed by plowing and thus more vulnerable to erosion. In this process, a threshold is crossed and the system will enter a different state which means that the system now oscillates around a different mean value.\n\nThe average slope of a mountain range remains constant if erosion and rock uplift rates are equal over time, even if individual erosional events greatly change local slopes in short-term. The timescales over which topography equilibrates to changes in landscape-forming processes range from seasonal resurfacing of gravel stream-beds following winter storms to the tens of millions of years it can take to erode mountain ranges.\n\nOver the past 600 million years, Phanerozoic time, the earth has supported a complex population of organisms. The earth has waxed and waned but has remained within the ranges of composition necessary for life to evolve. Because all of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is used for photosynthesis by living organisms, it enters and leaves surface ocean waters every few years, and because it is all used in the weathering processes on land every few thousand years, efficient feedback mechanisms must have operated to hold atmospheric carbon dioxide within relatively narrow limits during all environmental changes of the Phanerozoic time. If at any point over this time span the concentration of carbon dioxide had dropped to less than 1/3 of its present value, almost all photosynthesis would have stopped, but the records show that this has not happened. The conclusion that the long-term circulation of materials of the earths surface environment can be regarded as a dynamic system, protected from severe perturbations by effective feedback mechanisms and without major secular trends, seems reasonable..\n\n"}

{"id": "53489192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53489192", "title": "Euxinia", "text": "Euxinia\n\nEuxinia or euxinic conditions occur when water is both anoxic and sulfidic. This means that there is no oxygen (O) and a raised level of free hydrogen sulfide (HS). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water. The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (\"Euxeinos Pontos)\"- which translates to \"hospitable sea\". Euxinic deep water is a key component of the Canfield ocean, a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the Boring Billion proposed by Donald Canfield, an American geologist, in 1998. There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans. Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.\n\nEuxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate. The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years. Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small black shale deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.\n\nBefore the Great Oxygenation Event happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean. It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic. This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of banded iron formations from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean. This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in iron sulfide (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic oxidant instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic. This has become what is known as the Canfield ocean, a model backed by the increase in presence of δS in sedimentary pyrite and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate evaporites.\n\nAnoxia and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions. The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or \"toxic\" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic.\n\nEuxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in meromictic lakes and silled basins such as the Black Sea and some fjords. It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.\n\nThe basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of oxygen (O), and the presence of sulfate ions (SO), organic matter (CHO), and bacteria capable of reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide (HS). The bacteria utilize the redox potential of sulfate as an oxidant and organic matter as a reductant to generate chemical energy through cellular respiration. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction:\n\n2CHO + SO → HS + 2HCO\n\nIn the reaction above the sulfur has been reduced to form the byproduct hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to photosynthetic production of oxygen and gas exchange between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in seabed sediments that have a strong redox gradient and become anoxic at some depth below the sediment-water interface. In the ocean the rate of these reactions is not limited by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years. The Great Oxygenation Event increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative weathering of sulfides became a major source of sulfate to the ocean. Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or nitrate, so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate-reducing bacteria to out-compete aerobic and denitrifying bacteria. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters.\n\nConditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include anoxic waters, high nutrient levels, and a stratified water column. These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the Canfield ocean, are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the geologic record at relevant locations. The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.\n\nIn order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must exist that perpetuates organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the photic zone, supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate (), comes from weathering of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers. In a nutrient trap, increased input of phosphate from rivers, high rates of recycling of phosphate from sediments, and slow vertical mixing in the water column allow for euxinic conditions to persist.\n\nThe arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to plate tectonics, resulting in the bathymetry of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. Numerical models simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions. On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical estuarine circulation. Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.\n\nStratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions. Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, thermohaline circulation and upwelling prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased productivity in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to biological pumping. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation.\n\nA warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the solubility of oxygen decreases, allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily. Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more marine snow and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.\n\nVolcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The carbon dioxide (CO) released during volcanic outgassing causes global warming which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.\n\nBlack shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of bioturbation, meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration. There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but it should be noted that their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.\n\nSome researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in sedimentary rock created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.\n\nStable isotope ratios can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using stoichiometry and knowledge of redox pathways, paleogeologists can use isotopes ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.\n\nSulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δS in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean. The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe to form FeS which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS) become equal.\n\nMolybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia. Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the Black Sea, molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoOS ). The isotope ratio for Molybdenum (δ Mo) in euxinic sediments appears to be higher than in oxic conditions. Additionally, the concentration of molybdenum is frequently correlated with the concentration of organic matter in euxinic sediments. The use of Mo to indicate euxinia is still under debate.\n\nUnder euxinic conditions, some trace elements such as Mo, U, V, Cd, Cu, Tl, Ni, Sb, and Zn, become insoluble. This means that euxinic sediments would contain more of the solid form of these elements than the background seawater. For example, Molybdenum and other trace metals become insoluble in anoxic and sulfidic conditions, so over time the seawater becomes depleted of trace metals under conditions of persistent euxinia, and preserved sediments are relatively enriched with molybdenum and other trace elements.\n\nBacteria such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) and purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments. These pigments can be used to identify past euxinic conditions. The pigments used to identify past presesnce of GSB are chlorobactane and isorenieratene. The pigments used to identify past presence of PSB is okenane.\n\nPyrite (FeS) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (HS) and bioreactive iron (Fe). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where HS is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of HS. Threfore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions. Similarly, if >45% of the bioreactive iron in sediments is pyrite-bound, then anoxic or euxinic conditions can be inferred. While useful, these methods do not provide definitive proof of euxinia because not all euxinic waters have the same concentrations of bioreactive iron available. These relationships have been found to be present in the modern euxinic Black Sea.\n\nThe Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the Banded iron formations (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the Great Oxygenation Event. Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide. Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin. In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena. This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the Boring Billion.\n\nFurther evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the δS were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate. A different study found biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.\n\nMolybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions. Further work has suggested that from 700 million years ago (late Proterozoic) and onward, the deep oceans may have actually been anoxic and iron rich with conditions similar to those during the formation of BIFs.\n\nThere is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the Late Devonian and Permian–Triassic.\n\nThe periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period. Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.\n\nGeological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δS, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than sulfate. Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia.\n\nThere is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods. Isorenieratene, a pigment known as a proxy for an anoxic photic zone, has been found in the geological record in Illinois and Michigan. Although present, these events were probably ephemeral and did not last for longer periods of time. Similar periodic evidence of euxinia can also be found in the Sunbury shales of Kentucky.\n\nEvidence for euxinia has also been tied to the Kellwasser events of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event.\n\nThere was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the Carboniferous, most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans.\n\nThe Permian–Triassic extinction event may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species. Presence of a biomarker for anaerobic photosynthesis by green sulfur bacteria has been found spanning from the Permian to early Triassic in sedimentary rock in both Australia and China, meaning that euxinic conditions extended up quite shallow in the water column, contributing to the extinctions and perhaps even slowed the recovery. It is uncertain, however, just how widespread photic zone euxinia was during this period. Modelers have hypothesized that due to environmental conditions anoxia and sulfide may have been brought up from a deep, vast euxinic reservoir in upwelling areas, but stable, gyre-like areas remained oxic.\n\nThe Mesozoic is well known for its distinct Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation. Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.\n\nFew episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic. Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.\n\nEuxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics. For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water. Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind-driven overturning and thermohaline circulation. Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling. Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight.\n\nThe Black Sea is a commonly used modern model for understanding biogeochemical processes that occur under euxinic conditions. It is thought to represent the conditions of Earth's proto-oceans and thus assists in the interpretation of oceanic proxies. Black Sea sediment contains redox reactions to depths of tens of meters, compared to single centimeters in the open ocean. This unique feature is important for understanding the behavior of the redox cascade under euxinic conditions.\n\nThe only connection between the open ocean and the Black Sea is the Bosphorus Strait, through which dense Mediterranean waters are imported. Subsequently, numerous rivers, such as the Danube, Don, Dnieper, and Dniester, drain fresh water into the Black Sea, which floats on top of the more dense Mediterranean water, causing a strong, stratified water column. This stratification is maintained by a strong pycnocline which restricts ventilation of deep waters and results in an intermediate layer called the chemocline, a sharp boundary separating oxic surface waters from anoxic bottom waters usually between 50m and 100m depth, with interannual variation attributed to large scale changes in temperature. Well-mixed, oxic conditions exist above the chemocline and sulfidic conditions are dominant below. Surface oxygen and deep water sulfide do not overlap via vertical mixing, but horizontal entrainment of oxygenated waters and vertical mixing of oxidized manganese into sulfidic waters may occur near the Bosphorus Strait inlet. Manganese and iron oxides likely oxidize hydrogen sulfide near the chemocline, resulting in the decrease in HS concentrations as one approaches the chemocline from below.\n\nMeromictic lakes are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification. While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for limnic eruptions. These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes. This can result in the release of immense concentrations of stored toxic gasses from the anoxic bottom waters, such as CO and HS, especially from euxinic meromictic lakes. In high enough concentration, these limnic explosions can be deadly to humans and animals, such as the Lake Nyos disaster in 1986.\nSome fjords develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord. Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water. Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.\n\nThis fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound. A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea. A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world. Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of HS approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of HS, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord. These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea.\n\nTwo strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942). Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords. These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which HS is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes HS to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction. This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs. The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface. This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.\n\nThis fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects. Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least 5 times in the last century. Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a harmful algal bloom.\n\nThe Cariaco Basin in Venezuela has been used to study the cycle of organic material in euxinic marine environments. An increase in productivity coincident with post glacial nutrient loading probably caused a transition from oxic to anoxic and subsequently euxinic conditions around 14.5 thousand years ago. High productivity at the surface produces a rain of particulate organic matter to the sub surface where anoxic, sulfidic conditions persist. The organic matter in this region is oxidized with sulfate, producing reduced sulfur (HS) as a waste product. Free sulfur exists deep in the water column and up to 6m in depth in the sediment.\n\n"}

The formulae in this article calculate distances between points which are defined by geographical coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. This distance is an element in solving the second (inverse) geodetic problem.\n\nCalculating the distance between geographical coordinates is based on some level of abstraction; it does not provide an \"exact\" distance, which is unattainable if one attempted to account for every irregularity in the surface of the earth. Common abstractions for the surface between two geographic points are:\n\n\nAll abstractions above ignore changes in elevation. Calculation of distances which account for changes in elevation relative to the idealized surface are not discussed in this article.\n\nDistance, formula_1 is calculated between two points, formula_2 and formula_3. The geographical coordinates of the two points, as (latitude, longitude) pairs, are formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. Which of the two points is designated as formula_2 is not important for the calculation of distance.\n\nLatitude and longitude coordinates on maps are usually expressed in degrees. In the given forms of the formulae below, one or more values \"must\" be expressed in the specified units to obtain the correct result. Where geographic coordinates are used as the argument of a trigonometric function, the values may be expressed in any angular units compatible with the method used to determine the value of the trigonometric function. Many electronic calculators allow calculations of trigonometric functions in either degrees or radians. The calculator mode must be compatible with the units used for geometric coordinates.\n\nDifferences in latitude and longitude are labeled and calculated as follows:\n\nIt is not important whether the result is positive or negative when used in the formulae below.\n\n\"Mean latitude\" is labeled and calculated as follows:\n\nColatitude is labeled and calculated as follows:\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the radius of the earth for the calculations below is:\n\nformula_12 = Distance between the two points, as measured along the surface of the earth and in the same units as the value used for radius unless specified otherwise.\n\nLongitude has singularities at the Poles (longitude is undefined) and a discontinuity at the ±180° meridian. Also, planar projections of the circles of constant latitude are highly curved near the Poles. Hence, the above equations for delta latitude/longitude (formula_13, formula_14) and mean latitude (formula_15) may not give the expected answer for positions near the Poles or the ±180° meridian. Consider e.g. the value of formula_14 (“east displacement”) when formula_17 and formula_18 are on either side of the ±180° meridian, or the value of formula_15 (“mean latitude”) for the two positions (formula_20=89°, formula_17=45°) and (formula_22=89°, formula_18=−135°).\n\nIf a calculation based on latitude/longitude should be valid for all Earth positions, it should be verified that the discontinuity and the Poles are handled correctly. Another solution is to use \"n\"-vector instead of latitude/longitude, since this representation does not have discontinuities or singularities.\n\nA planar approximation for the surface of the earth may be useful over small distances. The accuracy of distance calculations using this approximation become increasingly inaccurate as:\n\n\nThe shortest distance between two points in plane is a straight line. The Pythagorean theorem is used to calculate the distance between points in a plane.\n\nEven over short distances, the accuracy of geographic distance calculations which assume a flat Earth depend on the method by which the latitude and longitude coordinates have been projected onto the plane. The projection of latitude and longitude coordinates onto a plane is the realm of cartography.\n\nThe formulae presented in this section provide varying degrees of accuracy.\n\nThis formula takes into account the variation in distance between meridians with latitude:\n\nThis approximation is very fast and produces fairly accurate result for small distances . Also, when ordering locations by distance, such as in a database query, it is much faster to order by squared distance, eliminating the need for computing the square root.\n\nThe FCC prescribes the following formulae for distances not exceeding :\n\nIf we are willing to accept a possible error of 0.5%, we can use formulas of spherical trigonometry on the sphere that best approximates the surface of the earth.\n\nThe shortest distance along the surface of a sphere between two points on the surface is along the great-circle which contains the two points.\n\nThe great-circle distance article gives the formula for calculating the distance along a great-circle on a sphere about the size of the Earth. That article includes an example of the calculation.\n\nA tunnel between points on Earth is defined by a line through three-dimensional space between the points of interest.\nThe great circle chord length may be calculated as follows for the corresponding unit sphere:\n\nThe tunnel distance between points on the surface of a spherical Earth is\nformula_48. For short distances (formula_49), this underestimates the great circle distance by formula_50.\n\nAn ellipsoid approximates the surface of the earth much better than a\nsphere or a flat surface does. The shortest distance along the surface\nof an ellipsoid between two points on the surface is along the\ngeodesic. Geodesics follow more complicated paths than great\ncircles and in particular, they usually don't return to their starting\npositions after one circuit of the earth. This is illustrated in the\nfigure on the right where \"f\" is taken to be 1/50 to accentuate the\neffect. Finding the geodesic between two points on the earth, the\nso-called inverse geodetic problem, was the focus of many\nmathematicians and geodesists over the course of the 18th and 19th\ncenturies with major contributions by\nClairaut,\nLegendre,\nBessel,\nand Helmert.\nRapp\nprovides a good summary of this work.\n\nMethods for computing the geodesic distance are widely available in\ngeographical information systems, software libraries, standalone\nutilities, and online tools. The most widely used algorithm is by\nVincenty,\nwho uses a series which is accurate to third order in the flattening of\nthe ellipsoid, i.e., about 0.5 mm; however, the algorithm fails to\nconverge for points that are nearly antipodal. (For\ndetails, see Vincenty's formulae.) This defect is cured in the\nalgorithm given by\nKarney,\nwho employs series which are accurate to sixth order in the flattening.\nThis results in an algorithm which is accurate to full double precision\nand which converges for arbitrary pairs of points on the earth. This\nalgorithm is implemented in GeographicLib.\n\nThe exact methods above are feasible when carrying out calculations on a\ncomputer. They are intended to give millimeter accuracy on lines of any\nlength; we can use simpler formulas if we don't need millimeter\naccuracy, or if we do need millimeter accuracy but the line is short.\nRapp, Chap. 6, describes the Puissant method,\nthe Gauss mid-latitude method, and the Bowring method.\n\nLambert's formulae\ngive accuracy on the order of 10 meters over thousands of kilometers. First convert the latitudes formula_51, formula_52 of the two points to reduced latitudes formula_53, formula_54\n\nformula_55\n\nwhere formula_56 is the flattening.\nThen calculate the central angle formula_57 in radians between two points formula_58 and formula_59 on a sphere using the Great-circle distance method (law of cosines or haversine formula), with longitudes formula_60 and formula_61 being the same on the sphere as on the spheroid.\n\nformula_62\n\nformula_63\n\nformula_64\n\nwhere formula_65 is the equatorial radius of the chosen spheroid.\n\nOn the GRS 80 spheroid Lambert's formula is off by\n\nBowring maps the points to a sphere of radius \"R′\", with latitude and longitude represented as φ′ and λ′.

Georgetown’s geographic coordinates are 19.300° north, 81.383° west.\n\nThe Cayman Islands have a land area of approximately 1.5 times the size of Washington, D.C. and just larger than Saint Kitts and Nevis. The Cayman Islands have a coastline of . The Cayman Islands make a maritime claim of a exclusive fishing zone and a territorial sea of .\n\nThe islands are located on the Cayman Rise which forms the northern margin of the Cayman Trough. The trough is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The Cayman Rise extends from southeastern Cuba along the northern margin of the Cayman Trough toward Costa Rica and resulted from Paleocene to Eocene island arc formation with associated volcanism along an extinct subduction zone. The islands are formed of marine limestone and dolostone that was uplifted during the late Miocene epoch. Due to the Islands' location, the Cayman Islands do get earthquakes.\n\nThe Cayman Islands have a tropical wet and dry climate, with a wet season from May to October, and a dry season that runs from November to April. Terrain is mostly a low-lying limestone base surrounded by coral reefs.\n\nBesides earthquakes another major natural hazard is the tropical cyclones that form during the Atlantic hurricane season from July to November.\n\nAn important environmental issue is the lack of fresh water resources. Drinking water supplies must be met by rainwater catchment and desalination. In addition there is also a problem with trash washing up on the beaches or being deposited by there by residents. The Cayman Islands have no recycling or waste treatment facilities.\n\nNatural resources include fish and a climate and beaches that foster tourism, which is the islands' major industry. A 2012 estimate of land use determined that the Cayman Islands' had 0.83 percent arable land and 2.08 percent permanent crops.\n\nThe territory is subdivided into six districts that are governed by district managers and that have a role as electoral districts and as regional units for statistics. Five of the districts are located on the main island, Grand Cayman. The sixth, Sister Islands, comprises the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.\nThe population is concentrated in the three (south-)western districts George Town (capital), West Bay, and Bodden Town. Those have a population density many times higher than all remaining districts.\n\n"}
{"id": "17572847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17572847", "title": "Hachure map", "text": "Hachure map\n\nHachures are an older mode of representing relief. They show orientation of slope, and by their thickness and overall density they provide a general sense of steepness. Being non-numeric, they are less useful to a scientific survey than contours, but can successfully communicate quite specific shapes of terrain. They are a form of shading, although different from the one used in shaded maps.\n\nHachure representation of relief was standardized by the Austrian topographer Johann Georg Lehmann in 1799. Hachures may be combined with other ways of representing relief, like shades, the result being a shaded hachure map; an example of such a map is the \"Dufour Map\" of Switzerland. Emil von Sydow designed maps with coloured hachures: green for lowlands and brown for highlands.\n\nHachures are strokes (short line segments or curves) drawn in the direction of the steepest slope (the aspect direction). Steeper slopes are represented by thicker, shorter strokes, while gentler slopes are represented by thinner, longer and farther apart strokes. A very gentle slope or a flat area, like the top of a hill, are usually left blank.\n\nThe hachures are traditionally monocolour, usually black, gray or brown. Using two complementary colours for the hachures on a neutral background colour (e.g. black and white lines on gray map colour) would give a shading effect as if the relief were illuminated.\n\nIn representing relief with hachures on a map, six rules are to be followed, according to G.R.P. Lawrence (1979):\n\n\nThe Swiss cartographer Eduard Imhof set 5 similar rules:\n\n\nIf the illumination is vertical, rule 5 is kept; in the case of oblique illumination, it is dropped. The rules above are to be obeyed for large-scale maps. If the map being drawn is a small-scale map (less than 1:500 000 according to Imhof), rules may be relaxed in order to obtain a more suggestive representation.\n\nHachures are still used today on Large Scale maps to show slopes and on British Ordnance Survey Maps and also in various countries toposheets to show Road and Railway Cutting and Embankments. On British OS Maps they have become long triangles with the short base at the top, and always pointing downwards. Embankments are further identified by having a line around them.\n\n"}

No direct extracts from the document have been discovered, but its influence on the Western idea of the geography of the Arctic region persisted for several centuries.\n\nThe book is said to be a travelogue written by a 14th-century Franciscan (Minorite) friar from Oxford who travelled the North Atlantic region in the early 1360s, making some half-a-dozen journeys conducting business on behalf of the King of England (Edward III). He described what he found on his first journey to the islands beyond 54 degrees north in a book, \"Inventio Fortunata\", which he presented to the King.\n\nUnfortunately, by the time Atlantic explorers were seeking information in the 1490s, the \"Inventio\" had gone missing, and was only known through a summary in a second text, the \"Itinerarium,\" written by a Brabantian traveller from 's-Hertogenbosch named Jacobus Cnoyen (also known as James Cnoyen or Jakob van Knoyen; modern Knox). As will be discussed below, Cnoyen's summary was the basis for the depiction of the Arctic region on many maps, one of the earliest being Martin Behaim's 1492 globe. By the late 16th century, even Cnoyen's text was missing, so most of what we know of the contents of the \"Inventio Fortunata\", other than its use on maps, is found in a letter from the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator to the English astronomer John Dee dated April 20, 1577, now located in the British Museum.\n\nCnoyen's information came in a very round-about way. In 1364, a priest from one of the Atlantic islands had returned to Norway, bringing with him an astrolabe which he had received from the visiting Franciscan friar, in exchange for a religious book. He made a detailed report to the King of Norway. Copies still survive of a social and geographical description of Greenland by a local church official named Ivar Bardarson, who turns up in Norwegian records in 1364, so this much of Cnoyen's story tallies well with reality (although this report does not contain the sort of personal information relayed by Cnoyen). Cnoyen seems to have obtained his information from Norwegian sources some time later, neither he nor the priest having actually seen the \"Inventio\".\n\nCnoyen's account (originally in his own language; translations here based on Eva Taylor's version) mixes probable fact with what may have been his own attempts to research the background, stating that Greenland was first settled at the orders of King Arthur, whose army supposedly conquered the North Atlantic islands. He also refers to the \"indrawing seas\"- currents which drew ships northward, so that:\n\nOf the visiting Franciscan, Cnoyen (or Mercator) summarised the priest's report thus:\n\nIn reality, the \"book\" may have been a detailed report, intended mainly to highlight the commercial possibilities offered by the North Atlantic following the decline of Norwegian interest in its colonies.\n\nMercator's contemporary, the 16th-century English historian Richard Hakluyt, identifies the author of the \"Inventio\" as Nicholas of Lynn. Hakluyt apparently arrived at this conclusion because of Geoffrey Chaucer's mention of Nicholas in his \"Treatise on the Astrolabe.\" Hakluyt did not himself, of course, have a copy of the \"Inventio.\"\n\nNicholas was alive at the right time (very roughly -- he is quite likely to have been a child in 1360), and had the right skills, but he was a Carmelite friar, not a Franciscan, and no earlier biographer indicates that he spent years travelling back and forth across the Atlantic on government business. There is another possible candidate, about whom, unfortunately, almost nothing is known. According to early 16th century literary historian John Bale, an Irishman named Hugh, who was a Franciscan, travelled widely in the 14th century, and wrote \"a certain journey in one volume\" -- but again, whether or not this was the \"Inventio\", no copy of it is known.\n\nThe concept of the pole as a magnetic mountain goes back at least to Roman times, but the author of \"Inventio Fortunata\" added other features to the picture as well as measurements. Whether or not the \"Inventio\" is the source of the medieval concept of the North Pole as a magnetic mountain surrounded by a circular continent divided by four powerful rivers, maps as early as Martin Behaim's 1492 globe depict the region in this way. \n\nJohannes Ruysch's \"Universalior cogniti orbis tabula\" from 1508, features a marginal note mentioning the \"Inventio Fortunata:\"\nGerardus Mercator's world map of 1569 reflects his reading of Cnoyen's \"Itinerarium.\" It also features a marginal note alluding to the Franciscan's \"discovery\", but not to the book itself, which he never saw: \n\nThe Arctic map inset on Mercator's 1569 world map was the prototype for the influential and widely circulated \"Septentrionalium Terrarum\" of 1595, posthumously published by his son, and the maps in Ortelius's \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" of 1570. Both show the same configuration of the arctic regions as the 1569 map.\n\nIn his letter to Dee, Mercator further quotes Cnoyen's description of the Northern regions: \n\nThe persistence of this idea of the geography of the far north persisted throughout the 16th and 17th century. This is probably due to the influence of Ruysch, Mercator, and Ortelius. Maps were only revised when the region was explored and mapmakers obtained knowledge of the true geography of the Arctic.\n\nMore interesting to modern researchers are the people the friar encountered, \"pygmies\" who may well be identical with the Skraelings referred to in old Norse texts about Greenland, predecessors of the modern Inuit.\n\nIn 1956 a letter referring to the existence of the book was found in the \"Archivo General de Simancas\" (Spain) from the English merchant John Day to \"The Most Magnificent And Most Worthy Lord - The Lord Grand Admiral\" (presumably Christopher Columbus).\n\nIn the letter, written in either December 1497 or January 1498, John Day says, \n\n"}

He was hydrographer of France's hydrographic office, member of the \"Académie de Marine\" and of the Royal Society of London. Over a 50-year career, he produced a large number of maps of particular interest to the \"Ministère de la Marine\". His maps of Canada and of French territories in North America (New France, Acadia, Louisiana) are particularly valuable. He died at Versailles.\n\nIn 1721, at age 18, he was appointed hydrographer (chief cartographer) to the French Navy. In August 1741, he became the first \"Ingénieur de la Marine of the Depot des cartes et plans de la Marine\" (the French Hydrographical Office) and was named Official Hydrographer of the French King.\n\nDuring his reign the Depot published a prodigious number of charts and maps, among which were large folio-format sea-charts of France, the \"Neptune Francois\". He also produced a number of sea-atlases of the world, e.g., the \"Atlas Maritime\" and the \"Hydrographie Francaise\". These gained fame, distinction and respect all over Europe and were republished throughout the 18th and even in the succeeding century.\n\nBellin also created smaller format maps such as the \"1764 Petit Atlas Maritime\" (5 vols.) containing 580 finely detailed charts.\n\nBellin set a very high standard of workmanship and accuracy thus gaining for France a leading role in European cartography and geography. Many of his maps were copied by other mapmakers of Europe.\n\nHe was one of the Encyclopédistes, a group of 18th century intellectuals in France who compiled the 35-volume Encyclopédie which was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Bellin contributed 994 articles.\n\nThe Encyclopédistes, were part of the group called \"philosophes\" among whose members were the great minds of the Age of Enlightenment, e.g., Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Baron d'Holbach.\n\nBellin contributed a number of maps to 15-vol. \"Histoire Generale des Voyages\" of Antoine François Prévost or simply known l'Abbe Prevost. One of these maps led to a geographical blunder whose impact reverberates to this day. This was the map of the Philippines which Bellin copied from a world-famous chart produced in 1734 by the Spanish missionary to the Philippines, Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde.\n\nUnlike many other European mapmakers of the time who outright appropriated Murillo's map, Bellin had the intellectual integrity to fully credit Murillo as his source, an open acknowledgement shown in the title cartouche of Bellin's map which came out the same year as the original work by Murillo.\n\nShown in Bellin's map was an island named \"Limasava\", a word invented in 1667 by Spanish friar, Fr. Francisco Combés, S.J., to refer to the way station of the Armada de Molucca under the command of the Portuguese captain-general Fernao de Magalhaes during its navigation in Philippine waters. Combés, who had not read a single eyewitness account of the Magellan expedition relied on two sources, the hopelessly garbled Italian translation of the Antonio Pigafetta account by Giovanni Battista Ramusio and the secondhand account by Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas. Ramusio wrote the fleet anchored in March–April 1521 in Butuan in Mindanao, and from there sailed for Cebu with a brief stopover at \"Messana\". In the authentic Pigafetta account, the port was an isle named Mazzaua while the stopover isle was named Gatighan. Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas gave a faithful narration of the Mazzaua anchorage.\n\nCombés disregarded de Herrera's version and adopted Ramusio's. He wrote that Magellan's fleet had anchored at Butuan and from there sailed for Cebu making a stop at a way station he named Limasaua.\n\nFive years earlier than Combés, Fr. Francisco Colín wrote the Armada moored at Butuan from March–April 1521 where Magellan and his men together with the natives celebrated an Easter Sunday mass on 31 March 1521. From Butuan the fleet sailed for Cebu making a brief stop at a way station he called \"Dimasaua\", an invented word meaning \"this is not the Mazagua of Antonio de Herrera where supposedly an Easter Sunday mass was held which I already said happened in Butuan.\"\n\nThis episode was projected in the 1734 map made by Murillo who used Combés name, \"Limassava\" not \"Dimasaua\" which map Bellin copied.\n\nIn 1789, Augustinian Carlo Amoretti, Italian Encyclopedist and librarian of Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, discovered the authentic Italian manuscript of Antonio Pigafetta among the scattered holdings of the library. Here it came out that the port of March–April 1521 was not Butuan but Mazaua. Amoretti, who himself had not read any of five eyewitness reports of the incident including two French versions of Pigafetta's account, asserted in a footnote that Mazaua was probably the isle named Limasava in Bellin's map, thus interchanging the real port of Mazaua with the way station Gatighan.\n\nLargely with the appearance of the eyewitness account of Ginés de Mafra, the only seaman in Magellan's fleet to return to Mazaua, whose testimony reveals a concrete, measurable description of Mazaua, the skein starting from the garbled version of Pigafetta by Ramusio to the mishandling by Combés to Bellin and finally to Amoretti has been unraveled: Pigafetta's Gatighan is Bellin's Limasava.\n\nPublished during his lifetime were:\n\n\n"}

A political geographer, most of Prescott's work focused on international boundary issues, particularly maritime boundaries.\n\nPrescott earned his BSc (1952). Dip. Ed. and MA degrees at the University of Durham in the United Kingdom. The University of London awarded his doctorate degree.\n\nPrescott started his career as a schoolteacher in Durham after undergraduate study, and was then appointed lecturer in the Department of Geography, University of Ibadan, Nigeria in 1956. He gained a Masters and his PhD (on Nigerian border issues) while in post.\n\nHe was appointed lecturer in geography at the University of Melbourne in 1961. He was made Professor in 1986 at the age of 55, and retired in 1996.\n\nHe was a commentator on political matters and geography for Australian ABC radio, also commenting on and predicting Australian election outcomes, until 1987.\n\nPrescott's interests remained in political geography, always with a focus on borders and frontiers, and their material and political characteristics. Studies included Australian Aboriginal conceptions of territory and frontiers, border disputes in South East Asia and the South China Sea, and the effects of the colonial period on African borders. van Houtum summarized Prescott and Julian Minghi's two major contributions to border geography as showing \"Where is the border located, how did it came about, evolve, change over time, become the topic of (military) disputes and what are the political consequences of its (changes in) location.\" Prescott's last book explored the legal and geographical problems of borders, and was coauthored with the renowned human rights lawyer and academic Gillian Triggs.\n\nPrescott was particularly active in examining the problems generated by maritime boundaries and borders, and resolution of disputes through negotiation and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. He said in his 1985 book with Schofield that \"The marked increase in maritime space coming under the jurisdiction of coastal states in the post-war period, coupled with similarly significant changes in the diversity and intensity of offshore activities, radically transformed the nature of maritime boundary negotiations, enhancing both their complexity and importance. Clearly, the extension of coastal states' sovereignty seawards has generated the potential for many new maritime boundaries and a host of overlapping jurisdictional claims and offshore boundary disputes.\"\n\nPrescott published widely on boundary issues and political geography. A full list of his works was compiled by his wife Dorothy, available here. Much of it is in/with conventional academic journals and publishers, and is therefore inaccessible online. In addition, his early work incorporated quotes in French and German, inaccessible to many. These books have, however, been re-released in the mid 2010s. Major works were:\n\n\n"}

Vale Windmill is a five-storey tower mill that was built in 1850. Photographs show it to have had four patent sails mounted in a canister, and an ogee cap similar in shape to those found in Suffolk, winded by a fantail. The mill had a stage at first floor level. It was converted into an artillery observation post by the Germans during the Second World War. This work entailed a three-storey extension being built on the mill tower, making it high overall.

In the early 19th century the mill was burned by Sark tenants protesting against the seigneurial system there, but it was later refitted with new machinery and heightened. It was working by wind until 1917 although the sails were removed during World War I. It was used as an observation tower during the German occupation. The mill had four double patent sails, and was winded by a fantail. The mill featured on the 1971 and 1977 2p coins issued by Guernsey.\n\n\n\"Little Sark Windmill\" was a tower mill.

It is affiliated with various regional or state level social studies associations, including: the Middle States Council for the Social Studies, the Washington State Council for the Social Studies, the New York City UFT Association for the Teaching of Social Studies, the Michigan Council for the Social Studies, Massachusetts Council for the Social Studies., and Virginia Council for the Social Studies. They publish several journals; their flagship publication being a peer-reviewed journal titled Social Education which, according to their website, aims to strike \"a balance of theoretical content and practical teaching ideas.\"\n\nFounded in 1921, NCSS engages and supports educators in strengthening and advocating social studies. With members in all the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 69 foreign countries, NCSS serves as an umbrella organization for elementary, secondary, and college teachers of history, geography, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, anthropology, and law-related education. Organized into a network of more than 110 affiliated state, local, and regional councils and associated groups, the NCSS membership represents K–12 classroom teachers, college and university faculty members, curriculum designers and specialists, social studies supervisors, and leaders in the various disciplines that constitute the social studies.\n\nNCSS defines social studies as \"the integrated study of the social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence.\" Within the school program, social studies provides coordinated, systematic study drawing upon such disciplines as anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, law, philosophy, political science, psychology, religion, and sociology, as well as appropriate content from the humanities, mathematics, and natural sciences. In essence, social studies promotes knowledge of and involvement in civic affairs. And because civic issues—such as health care, crime, and foreign policy—are multidisciplinary in nature, understanding these issues and developing resolutions to them requires multidisciplinary education. These characteristics are the key defining aspects of social studies.\n\nIn 2010, the council published National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies: A Framework for Teaching, Learning and Assessment. This publication is an update and revision of Expectations of Excellence: Curriculum Standards for Social Studies originally published in 1994. The National Curriculum Standards provides an articulated K–12 social studies program that serves as a framework for the integration of other national standards in social studies, including U.S. and world history, civics and government, geography, global education, and economics. NCSS standards ensure that an integrated social science, behavioral science, and humanities approach for achieving academic and civic competence is available to guide social studies decision makers in K–12 schools.\n\nThe NCSS framework consists of ten themes incorporating fields of study that correspond with one or more relevant disciplines. The organization believes that effective social studies programs include experiences that provide for the study of: Culture; Time, Continuity, and Change; People, Places, and Environments; Individual Development and Identity; Individuals, Groups, and Institutions; Power, Authority, and Governance; Production, Distribution, and Consumption; Science, Technology, and Society; Global Connections; and Civic Ideals and Practices.\n\nThe NCSS gives a number of awards including:\n\n\n"}

It seems that naming the said name in account of the past prosperity of land.\n\nTripura by which said state is known is another Sanskrit word which means \"lands of three cities\".\n\nArunachal Pradesh is a Sanskrit word which means land of rising sun as state is located in the easternmost part of the country and gets first sunrise in the country.\n\nThe state of Meghalaya has reputation of having highest rainfall as compared to other states of country. The wettest place in the world Mawsynram, is located in Meghalaya. Said feature of land is reflected in its name in Sanskrit which means Abode of clouds.\n\nThe states of Nagaland and Mizoram are exceptions where Sanskrit words are not used in the state name. Mizoram was named after the Mizo tribal dialect and refers to their land.\n\nTha name Nagaland consists of two words: the 'Naga', a native term for umbrella of tribes and English word 'land', collectively meaning land of Naga tribes. Until recent times term 'Naga' was foreign to Naga tribes themselves, there was no generic term for entire group of tribes, who rather identify themselves as Konyak, Tangkhul, Angami, Sema, Lotha, Ao, Pangmei, Zeliangrong, Mao and Khiumniungan etc.\n\nThe word 'Naga' is attributed to two origins. One theory states that in Myanmar, Naga tribes are called Na-Ka, which in Burmese language means 'people with pierced ear lobes'. The British explorers which comes into contact with Myanma in 1795 and with Nagas since 1832, heard about Na-Ka group and anglicised it as Naga, as found in British anthropological and official records.\n\nAnother theory points to the usage by people of Assam where Naga meaning 'naked', is used for 'primitive man living in natural surroundings in uncorrupted form'.\n"}
{"id": "168008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168008", "title": "Orchard", "text": "Orchard\n\nAn orchard is an intentional planting of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens, where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose. A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy. \n\nMost orchards are planted for a single variety of fruit. While the importance of introducing biodiversity is recognized in forest plantations, it would seem to be beneficial to introduce some genetic diversity in orchard plantations as well by interspersing other trees through the orchard. Genetic diversity in an orchard would provide resilience to pests and diseases just as in forests .\n\nOrchards are sometimes concentrated near bodies of water where climatic extremes are moderated and blossom time is retarded until frost danger is past.\n\nAn orchard's layout is the technique of planting the crops in a proper system.\nThere are different methods of planting and thus different layouts. Some of these layout types include:\nFor different varieties, these systems may vary to some extent.\n\nThe most extensive orchards in the United States are apple and orange orchards, although citrus orchards are more commonly called groves. The most extensive apple orchard area is in eastern Washington state, with a lesser but significant apple orchard area in most of Upstate New York. Extensive orange orchards are found in Florida and southern California, where they are more widely known as 'groves'. In eastern North America, many orchards are along the shores of Lake Michigan (such as the Fruit Ridge Region), Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.\n\nIn Canada, apple and other fruit orchards are widespread on the Niagara Peninsula, south of Lake Ontario. This region is known as \"Canada Fruitbelt\" and, in addition to large-scale commercial fruit marketing, it encourages \"pick-your-own\" activities in the harvest season.\n\nMurcia is a major orchard area (or la huerta) in Europe, with citrus crops. New Zealand, China, Argentina and Chile also have extensive apple orchards.\n\nTenbury Wells in Worcestershire has been called \"The Town in the Orchard\", since the 19th century, because it was surrounded by extensive orchards. Today, this heritage is celebrated through an annual Applefest.\n\n (pl. \"Streuobstwiesen\") is a German word that means a meadow with scattered fruit trees or fruit trees that are planted in a field. Streuobstwiese, or a meadow orchard, is a traditional landscape in the temperate, maritime climate of continental Western Europe. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Streuobstwiesen were a kind of a rural community orchard that were intended for productive cultivation of stone fruit. In recent years, ecologists have successfully lobbied for state subsidies to valuable habitats, biodiversity and natural landscapes, which are also used to preserve old meadow orchards. Both conventional and meadow orchards provide a suitable habitat for many animal species that live in a cultured landscape. A notable example is the hoopoe that nests in tree hollows of old fruit trees and, in the absence of alternative nesting sites, is threatened in many parts of Europe because of the destruction of old orchards.\n\n\nHistorical orchards have large, mature trees spaced for heavy equipment. Modern commercial apple orchards, by contrast and as one example, are often \"high-density\" (above 150 trees per acre) and in extreme cases have up to 9000 trees per acre. These plants are no longer trees in the traditional sense, but instead resemble vines on dwarf stock and require trellises to support them.\n\n\n"}

Basically in 1900 it contained the entire Minsk Governorate and Mogilev Governorate, the majority of Grodno Governorate, parts of Vitebsk Governorate and the parts of Vilna Governorate (the latter is now in Lithuania). World War I, the independence of Poland, as well as the 1920-1921 Polish–Soviet War affected the boundaries. In 1921, Belarus had what is now all of Minsk Governorate except for the western fringe, the western part of Gomel Region, a western slice of Mahilyow, and a small part of Vitebsk Region. In 1926 the eastern part of Gomel region was added. \nIn Soviet Belarus, new administrative units, called \"voblast\" (cognate of Russian word \"oblast\" with prothetic v-) were introduced in 1938. And again, during World War II, the boundaries fluctuated. In 1939 they were reset with Belarus gaining territory to the west, Baranavichy, Belastok (Bialystok), Brest, Pinsk, and Vileyka oblasts. In 1944 Belastok was eliminated and the new oblasts of Babruysk, Grodno, and Polotsk were created. At that same time, Vileika Voblast was renamed Molodechno Voblast.\n\nAt different times between 1938 and 1960, the following \"voblasts\" existed:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1112702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1112702", "title": "Royal forest", "text": "Royal forest\n\nA royal forest, occasionally \"Kingswood\", is an area of land with different definitions in England, Wales, and Scotland. The term \"forest\" in the ordinary modern understanding refers to an area of wooded land; however, the original medieval sense was closer to the modern idea of a \"preserve\" – i.e. land legally set aside for specific purposes such as royal hunting – with less emphasis on its composition. There are also differing and contextual interpretations in Continental Europe derived from the Carolingian and Merovingian legal systems.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, though the kings were great huntsmen they never set aside areas declared to be \"outside\" (Latin \"foris\") the law of the land. Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c. 500 to 1066) creating forests. However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), by royal prerogative forest law was widely applied. The law was designed to protect the \"venison\" and the \"vert\", the \"noble\" animals of the chase – notably red and fallow deer, the roe deer, and the wild boar – and the greenery that sustained them. Forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the aristocracy (see medieval hunting). The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century, and at the height of this practice in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, fully one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest; at one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex was afforested, and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire forest.\n\nAfforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in the folk history of the \"Norman yoke\", which magnified what was already a grave social ill: \"the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted, houses burned, peasants evicted, all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant, is a familiar element in the English national story ... The extent and intensity of hardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated\", H. R. Loyn observed. Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any of a range of offences within the forests; by the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law had died out, but many of England's woodlands still bore the title \"Royal Forest\". During the Middle Ages, the practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe.\n\nRoyal forests usually included large areas of heath, grassland and wetland – anywhere that supported deer and other game. In addition, when an area was initially designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. This could foster resentment as the local inhabitants were then restricted in the use of land they had previously relied upon for their livelihoods; however, common rights were not extinguished, but merely curtailed.\n\nThe areas that became Royal Forests were already relatively wild and sparsely populated, and can be related to specific geographic features that made them harder to work as farmland. Prosperous, well-farmed areas were not generally chosen to be afforested; if they were, they tended to lose the status fairly rapidly.\n\nIn the South West, forests extended across the Upper Jurassic Clay Vale. In the Midlands, the clay plain surrounding the River Severn was heavily wooded. Clay soils in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire formed another belt of woodlands.\n\nIn Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey, woodlands were established on sandy, gravelly acid soils. Marshlands in Lincolnshire were afforested.\n\nUpland moors too were chosen, such as Dartmoor and Exmoor in the South West, and the Peak Forest of Derbyshire. The North Yorkshire moors, a sandstone plateau, had a number of Royal forests.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror, a great lover of hunting, established the system of forest law. This operated outside the common law, and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from destruction. In the year of his death, 1087, a poem, \"The Rime of King William\", inserted in the Peterborough Chronicle, expresses English indignation at the forest laws.\n\nOffences in forest law were divided into two categories: trespass against the vert (the vegetation of the forest) and the venison (the game). The five animals of the forest protected by law were given by Manwood as the hart and hind (red deer), boar, hare and wolf. (In England, the boar became extinct in the wild by the 13th century, and the wolf by the late 15th century.) Protection was also said to be extended to the beasts of chase, the buck and doe (fallow deer), fox, marten, and roe deer, and the beasts and fowls of warren: the hare, coney, pheasant, and partridge. The rights of chase and of warren (i.e. to hunt such beasts) were often granted to local nobility for a fee, but were a quite separate concept.\n\nTrespasses against the vert were rather extensive: they included \"purpresture\", the inclosure of a pasture or erection of a building on forest lands, \"assarting\", clearing forest land for agriculture, and felling trees or clearing shrubs, among others. These laws applied to any land within the boundary of the forest, even if it were freely owned; although the Charter of the Forest in 1217 established that all freemen owning land within the forest enjoyed the rights of \"agistment\" and \"pannage\" (see below).\n\nIn addition, inhabitants of the forest were forbidden to bear hunting weapons, and dogs were banned from the forest; mastiffs were permitted as watchdogs, but they had to have their front claws removed to prevent them from hunting game.\n\nDisafforested lands on the edge of the forest were known as purlieus; agriculture was permitted here and deer escaping from the forest into them was permitted to be killed if causing damage.\n\nThe kings rapidly discovered that abridging their rights in the royal forests could provide a useful source of income. Local nobles could be granted a royal licence to take a certain amount of game. The common inhabitants of the forest might, depending on their location, possess a variety of rights: \"estover\", the right of taking firewood, \"pannage\", the right to pasture swine in the forest, \"turbary\", the right to cut turf (as fuel), and various other rights of pasturage (\"agistment\") and harvesting the products of the forest. Land might be disafforested entirely, or permission given for assart and purpresture.\n\nThe justices of the forest were the Justice in Eyre and the verderers.\n\nThe chief royal official was the Warden. As he was often an eminent and preoccupied magnate, his powers were frequently exercised by a deputy. He supervised the foresters and under-foresters, who personally went about preserving the forest and game and apprehending offenders against the law. The agisters supervised pannage and agistment and collected any fees thereto appertaining. The nomenclature of the officers can be somewhat confusing: the rank immediately below the constable were referred to as foresters-in-fee, or, later, \"woodwards\", who held land in the forest in exchange for a rent, and advised the warden. They exercised various privileges within their bailiwicks. Their subordinates were the under-foresters, later referred to as rangers. The rangers are sometimes said to be patrollers of the purlieu.\n\nAnother group, called serjeants-in-fee, and later, foresters-in-fee (not to be confused with the above), held small estates in return for their service in patrolling the forest and apprehending offenders.\n\nThe forests also had surveyors, who determined the boundaries of the forest, and \"regarders\". These last reported to the court of justice-seat and investigated encroachments on the forest and invasion of royal rights, such as assarting. While their visits were infrequent, due to the interval of time between courts, they provided a check against collusion between the foresters and local offenders.\n\nBlackstone gives the following outline of the forest courts, as theoretically constructed:\n\nIn practice, these fine distinctions were not always observed. In the Forest of Dean, swainmote and the court of attachment seem to have been one and the same throughout most of its history. As the courts of justice-seat were held less frequently, the lower courts assumed the power to fine offenders against the forest laws, according to a fixed schedule. The courts of justice-seat crept into disuse, and in 1817, the office of Justice in Eyre was abolished and its powers transferred to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests. Courts of swainmote and attachment went out of existence at various dates in the different forests. A Court of Swainmote was re-established in the New Forest in 1877.\n\nWilliam I, original enactor of the Forest Law in England, did not harshly penalise offenders. The accusation that he \"laid a law upon it, that whoever slew hart or hind should be blinded,\" according to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" is little more than propaganda. William Rufus, also a keen hunter, increased the severity of the penalties for various offences to include death and mutilation. The laws were in part codified under the Assize of the Forest (1184) of Henry II.\n\nMagna Carta, the charter forced upon King John of England by the English barons in 1215, contained five clauses relating to royal forests. They aimed to limit, and even reduce, the King's sole rights as enshrined in forest law. The clauses were as follows (taken from translation of the great charter (Magna Carta)):\n\n\nAfter the death of John, Henry III was compelled to grant the Charter of the Forest (1217), which further reformed the forest law and established the rights of agistment and pannage on private land within the forests. It also checked certain of the extortions of the foresters. An \"Ordinance of the Forest\" under Edward I again checked the oppression of the officers, and introduced sworn juries in the forest courts.\n\nIn 1300 many (if not all) forests were perambulated and reduced greatly in their extent, in theory to their extent in the time of Henry II. However, this depended on the determination of local juries, whose decisions often excluded from the Forest lands described in Domesday Book as within the forest. Successive kings tried to recover the \"purlieus\" excluded from a forest by the Great Perambulation of 1300. Forest officers periodically fined the inhabitants of the purlieus for failing to attend Forest Court or for forest offences. This led to complaints in Parliament. The king promised to remedy the grievances, but usually did nothing.\n\nSeveral forests were alienated by Richard II and his successors, but generally the system decayed. Henry VII revived \"Swainmotes\" (forest courts) for several forests and held Forest Eyres in some of them. Henry VIII in 1547 placed the forests under the Court of Augmentations with two Masters and two Surveyors-General. On the abolition of that court, the two surveyors-general became responsible to the Exchequer. Their respective divisions were North and South of the river Trent.\n\nThe last serious exercise of forest law by a court of justice-seat (Forest Eyre) seems to have been in about 1635, in an attempt to raise money.\n\nBy the Tudor period and after, forest law had largely become anachronistic, and served primarily to protect timber in the royal forests. James I and his ministers Robert Cecil and Lionel Cranfield pursued a policy of increasing revenues from the forests and starting the process of disafforestation.\n\nCecil made the first steps towards abolition of the forests, as part of James I's policy of increasing his income independently of Parliament. Cecil investigated forests that were unused for royal hunting and provided little revenue from timber sales. Knaresborough Forest in Yorkshire was abolished. Revenues in the Forest of Dean were increased through sales of wood for iron smelting. Enclosures were made in Chippenham and Blackmore for herbage and pannage.\n\nCranfield commissioned surveys into assart lands of various forests, including Feckenham, Sedgemoor and Selwood, laying the foundations of the wide scale abolition of forests under Charles I. The commissioners appointed raised over £25000 by compounding with occupiers, whose ownership was confirmed, subject to a fixed rent. Cranfield's work led directly to the disafforestation of Gillingham Forest in Dorset and Chippenham and Blackmore in Wiltshire. Additionally, he created the model for abolition of the forests followed throughout the 1630s.\n\nEach disafforestation would start with a commission from the Exchequer, which would survey the forest, determine the lands belonging to the crown, and negotiate compensation for landowners and tenants whose now-traditional rights to use of the land as commons would be revoked. A legal action by the Attorney General would then proceed in the Court of Exchequer against the forest residents for intrusion, which would confirm the settlement negotiated by the Commission. Crown lands would then be granted (leased), usually to prominent courtiers, and often the same figures that had undertaken the commission surveys. Legal complaints about the imposed settlements and compensation were frequent.\n\nThe disafforestations caused riots and Skimmington processions resulting in the destruction of enclosures and reoccupation of grazing lands in a number of West Country forests, including Gillingham, Braydon and Dean, known as the Western Rising. Riots also took place in Feckenham, Leicester and Malvern. The riots followed the physical enclosure of lands previously used as commons, and frequently led to the destruction of fencing and hedges. Some were said to have had a \"warlike\" character, with armed mobs numbering hundreds, for instance in Feckenham. The rioters in Dean fully destroyed the enclosures surrounding 3,000 acres in groups that numbered thousands of participants.\n\nThe disturbances tended to involve artisans and cottagers who were not entitled to compensation. The riots were hard to enforce against, due to the lack of efficient militia, and the low born nature of the participants. Ultimately, however, enclosure succeeded, with the exceptions of Dean and Malvern Chase.\n\nThe Forest of Dean was legally re-established in 1668. A Forest Eyre was held for the New Forest in 1670, and a few for other forests in the 1660s and 1670s, but these were the last. From 1715, both surveyor's posts were held by the same person. The remaining royal forests continued to be managed (in theory, at least) on behalf of the crown. However, the commoners' rights of grazing often seem to have been more important than the rights of the crown.\n\nIn the late 1780s a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the condition of Crown woods and those surviving. North of the Trent it found Sherwood Forest survived, south of it: the New Forest, three others in Hampshire, Windsor Forest in Berkshire, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, Waltham or Epping Forest in Essex, three forests in Northamptonshire, and Wychwood in Oxfordshire. Some of these no longer had swainmote courts thus no official supervision. They divided the remaining forests into two classes, those with and without the Crown as major landowner. In certain Hampshire forests and the Forest of Dean, most of the soil belonged to the Crown and these should be reserved to grow timber, to meet the need for oak for shipbuilding. The others would be inclosed, the Crown receiving an \"allotment\" (compensation) in lieu of its rights.\n\nIn 1810, responsibility for woods was moved from Surveyors-General (who accounted to the Auditors of Land Revenue) to a new Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues. From 1832 to 1851 \"Works and Buildings\" were added to their responsibilities. In 1851, the commissioners again became a Commissioner of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues. In 1924, the Royal Forests were transferred to the new Forestry Commission.\n\nThe Forest of Dean was used as a source of charcoal for ironmaking within the Forest from 1612 until about 1670. It was the subject of a Reafforestation Act in 1667. Courts continued to be held at the Speech House, for example to regulate the activities of the Freeminers. The sale of cordwood for charcoal continued until at least the late 18th century. Deer were removed in 1850. The forest is today heavily wooded, as is a substantial formerly privately owned area to the west, now treated as part of the forest. It is managed by the Forestry Commission.\n\nThe extent of Epping Forest was greatly reduced by inclosure by landowners. The Corporation of London wished to see it preserved as an open space and obtained an injunction to throw open some that had been inclosed in the preceding 20 years. In 1875 and 1876, it bought of open waste land. Under the Epping Forest Act 1878, the forest was disafforested and forest law abolished in respect of it. Instead the corporation was appointed as Conservators of the Forest. The forest is managed through the Epping Forest Committee.\n\nAn Act was passed to remove the deer in 1851, but abandoned when it was realised that the deer were needed to keep open the unwooded \"lawns\" of the forest. An attempt was made to develop the forest for growing wood by a rolling programme of inclosures. In 1875, a Select Committee of the House of Commons recommended against this, leading to the passage of the New Forest Act 1877, which limited the Crown's right to inclose, regulated common rights, and reconstituted the Court of Verderers. A further Act was passed in 1964. This forest is also managed by the Forestry Commission.\n\nA forest since the end of the Ice Age (as attested by pollen sampling cores), Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve today encompasses 423.2 hectares, (1,045 acres) surrounding the village of Edwinstowe, the site of Thoresby Hall.\n\nThe forest that most people associate with Sherwood Forest is actually named Birklands and Bilhaugh. It is a remnant of an older, much larger, royal hunting forest, which derived its name from its status as the \"shire (or sher) wood\" of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered on the west along the River Erewash and the Forest of East Derbyshire. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, the forest covered perhaps a quarter of Nottinghamshire in woodland and heath subject to the forest laws.\n\n\n\n"}

It had been in use as the domain name for the institute's homepage, swisstopo.ch, since 1997.\n\nThe main class of products produced by Swisstopo are topographical maps on seven different scales. Swiss maps have been praised for their accuracy and quality.\n\n\nThe numbering system of Swiss regular maps (apart from composites) is directly based on the geographical situation. A map number is always one higher than the map number of the adjacent map to the west, and one lower than the adjacent map to the east. From north to south, the numbers differ by 20 for the scale 1:25.000, 10 for the scale 1:50.000 and 5 for the scale 1:100.000. However, as can be seen on the \"Seite nicht gefunden\", there are some exceptions to this rule: Switzerland is a little bit too large to be only 20 1:25.000 maps wide. Instead of choosing another system, the map to the east of \"1199 Scuol\" is called \"1199bis Piz Lad\". The same is true for some maps at scale 1:50.000.\n\n\n\nIn 1809, the first topographical surveys of Switzerland took place on a confederate, military level. They took place in the north-eastern area and were led by Hans Conrad Finsler. Measurements in the alpine region started in 1825 with triangulations by Antoine-Joseph Buchwalder. This work would be finished in 1837 by Johannes Eschmann. At New Year 1838, the Topographical Bureau (\"Eidgenössisches Topographisches Bureau\") was founded in Carouge, Geneve by Guillaume Henri Dufour. This bureau published its first map the same year, the \"Carte topographique du Canton de Genève\". Topographic surveys also started in the alpine regions of Switzerland. These had their first results in 1845, a year later than planned, when a map scaled 1:100.000 was published. This was the start of what are termed \"Dufourkarten\" (\"Dufour's Maps\"). The topographic survey finished in 1862. To honour Dufour, the Swiss government decided to rename the highest peak on the \"Dufourkarten\" from \"Höchste Spitze\" to Dufourspitze: it still carries that name today. In 1863, the SAC published a 1:50.000 map of the region Tödi, based on unpublished survey material. A year later, the last map of the \"Dufourkarten\" was published, and the following year, Dufour retired and Hermann Siegfried became Chief of the Topographical Bureau.\n\nIn 1865, Herman Siegfried becomes the Chief of the Topographical Bureau, and the bureau moves from Geneva to Bern. Over the next few years, a composite map is published of Ticino, soundings start to measure the depth of the major Swiss lakes, and a first map is published scaled 1:250.000. In 1868, a Federal Act is passed to enforce the continuation of the initial topographic surveys, as well as the publication of the results. This results in new topographical surveys in 1869 and the publication of the first 13 \"Siegfriedkarten\" (1:25.000 and 1:50.000) in 1870. In 1878, a 1:1.000.000 map is published, and the next year, the height of the Pierre du Niton is measured to be 376.86 metre. In 1880, Herman Siegfried is succeeded by Jules Dumur.\n\nIn 1895, the Topographical surveys for the \"Siegfriedkarten\" are finished. As of 1901, 581 sheets of the \"Siegfriedkarten\" have been published, with only a few individual more maps to come (there would be 604 maps in 1926). On old maps of the modern series, a reference to those maps can still be found: until the seventies of the 20th century, the \"Siegfriedkarte\" was the best scale available for some areas of Switzerland, and therefore used by climbers and other alpinists. The printing of the \"Siegfriedkarten\" would continue until 1952.\n\nIn 1887, the first maps with relief shading are published. In 1889, a photographic studio is appended to the bureau. In the years after 1894, a wall-map for schools is published, in response to a request from the parliament to do so. In 1898, the soundings of the major Swiss lakes are finished. In 1901, the bureau is moved into an independent division within the military, and the name \"Eidgenössische Landestopographie\" becomes customary, a name still used by some people until today, and a name which can be found on some older maps. Hermann Kümmerly publishes a relief wall-map for schools in the same year. In 1908, map trials are started to serve as a replacement for the \"Dufourkarten\". Two years later, trials start to replace the \"Siegfriedkarten\". Much of this military work would remain secret for many years. In 1913, 1922 and 1924, trials are done with aerial photogrammetry, first with balloons and later with aircraft, but only as of 1930 this is used for production of maps, and in 1940 terrestrial photogrammetry is abandoned.\n\nOn 21 June 1935, a Federal Act was passed on the production of the new National Map series, ranging in scale from 1:25.000 to 1:1.000.000. Because of the political situation in Europe, work was started on the 1:50.000 maps. For this purpose, a 'M18d' Messerschmidt was bought for aerial photography, the first aircraft owned by the \"Eidgenössischie Landestopographie\". In 1938, the first 1:50.000 map was published: \"263 Wildstrubel\". From 1939 to 1945, all sales were suspended because of World War II. In 1939, the \"Eidgenössische Landestopographie\" also procured its first vehicle.\n\nThe first 1:25:000 map, \"1145 Bielersee\", was published in 1952. The last 1:25.000 map, \"1292 Maggia\", was published in 1979. This marked the finish of the lowest-scale mapping of Switzerland. The first composite in this scale, \"2501 St. Gallen\", was published in 1956.\n\nThe 1:50.000 series was completed in 1963 with \"285 Domodossola\". With the publication of this map, the \"Siegfriedkarten\" have been entirely replaced. The first composite on this scale, \"5001 Gotthard\", was published in 1954.\n\nThe 1:100.000 series started with \"41 Col du Pillon\" (1954), and finished with \"47 Monte Rosa\" in 1965. With this publication, the \"Dufourkarten\" have been entirely replaced.\n\nThe 1:200.000 series started with No. 3 in 1971 and finished with No. 4 in 1976.\n\nThe maps on the scales 1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000 were respectively first published in 1965 and 1994. With the publication of the latter map, the work required by the Federal Act of 1935 was finally finished.\n\nSince 1951, different sorts of leisure maps have been published by the Federal Office of Topography. See above for a list of those.\n\nIn 1958, the coordinate system of the maps was changed. Before 1958, the centre of the coordinate system, Bern, had coordinates (0, 0). Subsequently, it has coordinates (600, 200). This was done so that any coordinate is either a x-coordinate or a y-coordinate: this prevents confusion about the order of the coordinates.\n\nIn 1968, the name officially became \"Eidgenössische Landestopographie\" instead of \"Abteilung für Landestopographie\", although this had been common practice for decades. The English name remained unchanged (\"Topographical Survey of Switzerland\").\n\nIn 1979, the \"Eidgenössische Landestopographie\" was renamed to the current name \"Bundesamt für Landestopographie\". See above for the names in other languages. Since 2002, the international name \"Swisstopo\" has been used. This name had already been used since the website went online in 1997.\n\nSome maps produced by Swisstopo scarcely have any Switzerland on it. This is especially true for the scales 1:100.000 and 1:50.000. As can be seen here, the map \"45 Haute Savoie\" only has a very little spot of Switzerland on it, in the extreme north-western corner. The same is true for the 1:50.000 map 285 Domodossola. In both cases, no 1:25.000 maps have been published for the corresponding part of the 1:50.000 map: at the 1:25.000 scale, some maps are a tiny bit larger than others, to be able to get all of Switzerland onto a map without the need of maps with less than 0.1% domestic territory on it.\n\nInitially, the plan was to be more generous also for 1:25.000 maps. Thirty-one maps were once planned, most of which did not have a single km^2 Switzerland on it, that were never published. Some of them (\"1158 Zeinisjoch\") were up to ten kilometers away from the Swiss border. On old Swiss maps, one can still see the \"Blattübersicht\" were those are signified as \"planned maps\".\n\nSome maps have been published in the past, but have been discontinued, also because they lack any part of Switzerland. \"1035 Friedrichshafen\" is an example of that. When one looks at the Mapsheet Index Northeast, there is no map to the east or to the north of \"1055 Romanshorn\". However, when one then looks at the area of \"1055 Romanshorn\", it can be seen that these maps do in fact exist, but do not have any Swiss land on the map.\n\n\n"}

The Thai Ministry of Science and Technology funds the program.\n\nTHEOS was launched from Dombarovskiy at 06:37 GMT on 1 October 2008, by a Dnepr rocket. The satellite was initially planned for a 2007 launch using the space vehicle Rokot of Eurockot Launch Services . The contract was however canceled when Eurockot faced a parts shortage.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, THEOS captured images showing some 300 objects in close proximity to the suspected crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, in the Indian Ocean. The discovery was reported by GISTDA on 27 March 2014. The objects have not yet been identified as debris.\n\nTHEOS was used to observe natural resources in the country by gathering information to be used by both the government and public for research and mapping. THEOS observation missions are conducted to observe agriculture sites, the production of agricultural crops, forest demolition, forest types, shrimp farms, water pollution from oil leaks, water sources, community areas, illegal farms, disaster areas, and the satellite can also be used for city planning. THEOS also reduces the cost of purchasing satellite images from other countries. Moreover, the information that is gathered from the satellite can also be sold to other countries. Thailand has also gained knowledge and technology for designing and building satellite from the French. In addition, specialists from France also travel to Thailand to teach Thai personnel every year.\n\nTHEOS was designed to be a small sized satellite with a mass of 750 kg (include equipment and fuel). It has a hexagonal shape with a height of 2.4 meters and a width of 2 meters (when the solar panel folds). It was launched into low earth orbit in 2008 to an altitude of 822 km and with an inclination of 98 degrees. It is equipped with optical imagery which can observe in the visible band to near infrared. Its mission duration is expected to be at least 5 years.\n"}

It is one of the most desolate parts of the Sahara Desert.\n\nTanezrouft is a barren plain extending to the west of the Hoggar mountains and to the southeast of the sandy Erg Chech. It is composed of differing materials: the Tanezrouft contains mostly sandstone deposits, whereas the Hoggar formations are metamorphic rocks.\n\nThe Tanezrouft's sandstone hills contain steep canyon walls, some rising to 500 meters elevation. Numerous sand dunes rise from sandy stretches, interspersed with sandstone outcrops. The terrain shows stark evidence of long-ago water erosion (when the Sahara Desert's climate was much wetter; present annual rainfall is much less than 20 mm). In the present era the terrain is being shaped by wind erosion, which occurs much faster than in other areas, since there is little or no vegetation to hold the surface in place. The area is known for aridity and extreme heat, and high temperatures in summer can easily reach 52 °C (125.6 °F) or more.\n\nTanezrouft has been long-shunned by nearby civilizations (it is known as \"Land of Thirst\"). A trade route may have connected the area with Ghadames and the Hoggar, since perhaps 500 BC. It is now spanned north-south by a trans-Saharan motor route, from Béchar in Algeria to Gao in Mali. Poste Maurice Cortier is a fueling station along the route. Tanezrouft is nearly uninhabited; its few nomadic dwellers are of the Tuareg people. There is a vast water-bearing stratum a few thousand feet below the dry lifeless desert surface.\n\nIn the Niger portion of Tanezrouft, populations of the endangered painted hunting dog were previously viable west of the Hoggar Mountains, but now the painted hunting dog is thought to be extinct for the entirety of Niger.\n\nIn 2018, the asteroid 26871 Tanezrouft was named after the Tanezrouft Basin\n\n"}

The former story Hallie Flanagan (later director of the WPA's Federal Theatre Project) made into a popular play under the title \"Can You Hear Their Voices?\"\n\n\n"}
