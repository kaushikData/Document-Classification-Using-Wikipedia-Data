The instrument was patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born geologist named David W. Brunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit utilizes magnetic induction damping rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation. Although Brunton, Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make accurate navigational and slope-angle measurements in the field. Users are primarily geologists, but archaeologists, environmental engineers, mining engineers and surveyors also make use of the Brunton's capabilities. The United States Army has adopted the Pocket Transit as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served artillery.\n\nThe Pocket Transit may be adjusted for declination angle according to one's location on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements (azimuth) through use of the Earth's magnetic field. Holding the compass at waist-height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line that is on the mirror. Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made. Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the strike and dip of geological features (faults, contacts, foliation, sedimentary strata, etc.). Strike is measured by leveling (with the bull's eye level) the compass along the plane being measured. Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made. If field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance.\n\nAs with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in reference to the Earth's magnetic field. Thus, measurements are sensitive to magnetic intereference. For example, if the user is near an outcrop that contains magnetite or some other iron-bearing material, compass readings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the outcrop to tens of yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field). Since they are measured with a rotating level, dip measurements are unaffected by magnetic interference.\n\nThere are numerous other compasses used by geologists: The Breithaupt compass is one example. Portable electronic devices are changing the way geologists conduct field work. Unlike analogue compasses, a digital compass relies on an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and may provide information about the reliability of a measurement (e.g. by repeating the same measurement and performing statistical analysis).\n\n\n"}

The idea was to create roses that bloomed with the polyantha profusion, but with hybrid tea floral beauty and colour range.\n\nThe first polyantha/hybrid tea cross, 'Rödhätte' ('Red Riding Hood'), was introduced by the Danish breeder Dines Poulsen in 1907. It possessed characteristics of both its parent classes, and was initially called a Hybrid Polyantha or Poulsen rose. Poulsen continued this line of work in subsequent years, introducing several Hybrid Polyanthas such as 'Else Poulsen' in 1924. Other breeders also began introducing similar varieties, and in 1930 the name \"floribunda\" was coined by Dr. J.N. Nicolas, a rose hybridizer for Jackson & Perkins in the US. This term has been used since then to describe cultivars which in their ancestry have crosses between hybrid teas and polyanthas.\n\nTypical floribundas feature stiff shrubs, smaller and bushier than the average hybrid tea but less dense and sprawling than the average polyantha. The flowers are often smaller than hybrid teas but are carried in large sprays, giving a better floral effect in the garden. Floribundas are found in all hybrid tea colours and with the classic hybrid tea-shaped blossom, sometimes differing from hybrid teas only in their cluster-flowering habit. Today they are still used in large bedding schemes in public parks and similar spaces.\n\n"}
{"id": "1351340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1351340", "title": "Footbridge", "text": "Footbridge\n\nA footbridge (also a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed solely for pedestrians. While the primary meaning for a bridge is a structure which links \"two points at a height above the ground\", a footbridge can also be a lower structure, such as a boardwalk, that enables pedestrians to cross wet, fragile, or mashy land. Bridges range from stepping stones–possibly the earliest man-made structure to \"bridge\" water–to elaborate steel structures. Another early bridge would have been simply a fallen tree. In some cases a footbridge can be both functional and a beautiful work of art. \n\nFor rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets. Simple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and easily constructed in such areas using only local materials and labor.\n\nAn enclosed footbridge between two buildings is sometimes known as a skyway. Bridges providing for both pedestrians and cyclists are often referred to as greenbridges and form an important part of a sustainable transport system. \n\nFootbridges are often situated to allow pedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads. They are also located across roads to let pedestrians cross safely without slowing traffic. The latter is a type of pedestrian separation structure, examples of which are particularly found near schools.\n\nThe simplest type of a bridge is stepping stones, so this may have been one of the earliest types of footbridge. Neolithic people also built a form of a boardwalk across marshes, of which the Sweet Track, and the Post Track are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old. Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used log bridges; that is a timber bridge that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams. Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees. \n\nAmong the oldest timber bridges is the Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden crossing upper Lake Zürich in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the Seedamm date back to 1523 B.C. The first wooden footbridge led across Lake Zürich, followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the Roman Empire built a wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately in length and wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland. \n\nA clapper bridge is an ancient form of bridge found on the moors of Devon (Dartmoor and Exmoor) and in other upland areas of the United Kingdom including Snowdonia and Anglesey, Cumbria, Yorkshire and Lancashire. It is formed by large flat slabs of stone, often granite or schist, supported on stone piers (across rivers), or resting on the banks of streams. Although often credited with prehistoric origin, most were erected in medieval times, and some in later centuries. A famous example is found in the village of Postbridge. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been originally built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross the river. Nowadays clapper bridges are only used as footbridges. \n\nThe Kapellbrücke is a footbridge crossing the River Reuss in the city of Lucerne in Switzerland. It is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, and one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions. The bridge was originally built 1365 as part of Lucerne's fortifications.\n\nAn early example of a skyway is the Vasari Corridor, an elevated, enclosed passageway in Florence, central Italy, which connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the river at Ponte Vecchio. It was built in five months by order of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565, to the design of Giorgio Vasari.\n\nBank Bridge is a famous 25 metre long pedestrian bridge crossing the Griboedov Canal in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Like other bridges across the canal, the existing structure dates from 1826. The special popularity of the bridge was gained through angular sculptures of four winged lions crowning the abutments. They were designed by sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835), who also contributed lions for Bridge of Lions.\n\nDesign of footbridges normally follows the same principles as for other bridges. However, because they are normally significantly lighter than vehicular bridges, they are more vulnerable to vibration and therefore dynamics effects are often given more attention in design. International attention has been drawn to this issue in recent years by problems on the Pont de Solférino in Paris and the Millennium Bridge in London.\n\nTo ensure footbridges are accessible to disabled and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is nowadays also given to provision of access lifts or ramps, as required by relevant legislation (e.g. Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the UK). Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a stairlift so that residents with a disability can cross them.\n\nTypes of footbridges include:\n\nThe residential-scale footbridges all span a short distance and can be used for a broad range of applications. Complicated engineering is not needed and the footbridges are built with readily available materials and basic tools.\n\nDifferent types of design footbridges include:\n\nFootbridges can also be built in the same ways as road or rail bridges; particularly suspension bridges and beam bridges. Some former road bridges have had their traffic diverted to alternative crossings and have become pedestrian bridges; examples in the UK include The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, Shropshire, the Old Bridge at Pontypridd and Windsor Bridge at Windsor, Berkshire.\n\nMost footbridges are equipped with guard rails to reduce the risk of pedestrians falling. Where they pass over busy roads or railways, they may also include a fence or other such barrier to prevent pedestrians from jumping, or throwing projectiles onto the traffic below.\n\nIt was originally usual for passengers to cross from one railway platform to another by stepping over the tracks, but from the mid-19th century onwards safety demanded the provision of a footbridge (or underpass) at busier places. However, in some quieter areas, crossing the line by walking over the tracks is possible.\n\nNarrow footbridges or walkways to allow workers access to parts of a structure otherwise difficult to reach are referred as catwalks or cat walks. Such catwalks are located above a stage (theater catwalk) in a theater, between parts of a building, along the side of a bridge, on the inside of a tunnel, on the outside of any large storage tank in a refinery or elsewhere, etc. The walkway on the outside (top) of a railroad cars such as boxcars, before air brakes came into use, or on top of some covered hopper cars is also called a catwalk. With the exception of those on top of railroad cars, catwalks are equipped with railings or handrails.\n\nSince the early 1980s, several charities have developed standardized footbridge designs that are sustainable for use in developing countries. The first charity to develop such designs was Helvetas, located in Zurich, Switzerland. Designs that can be sustainably and efficiently used in developing countries are typically made available to the public gratis.\n\nThe record for the longest footbridge in the world was claimed by the NY State Governor David Paterson in an Oct. 3, 2009 Poughkeepsie Journal article about The Walkway Poughkeepsie Bridge across the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York. On July 22, 2017, the Champlain Bridge Ice Structure, or \"l'Estacade Champlain\" in French, a bridge built for bicycles and foot traffic only to parallel the Champlain Bridge from Brossard, Quebec west to Nun's Island (L'ile Des Soeurs) & the Island of Montreal, was measured by a calibrated device as being 7,512 feet (2,292 meters) long or 1.4227 miles or 2.292km, starting and ending where the treadway rises above the ground and a pedestrian could access the bridge as close as possible to the St Lawrence River.\n\nThe Walkway Over The Hudson footbridge was originally built for trains, it was recently restored as a pedestrian walkway. The footbridge has a total length of 2,063 meters (6,768 feet). Before it was demolished in 2011, the Hornibrook Bridge which crossed Bramble Bay in Queensland, Australia was longer than the Poughkeepsie Bridge at 2.8 km (1.7 mi).\n\nMuch rural travel takes place on local footpaths, tracks and village roads. These provide essential access to water, firewood, farm plots and the classified road network. Communities and/or local government are generally responsible for this infrastructure.\n\nPedestrian overpasses over highways or railroads are expensive, especially when elevators or long ramps for wheelchair users are required. Without elevators or ramps, people with mobility handicaps will not be able to use the structure. People may prefer to walk across a busy road rather than climb a bridge. It is recommended that overpasses should only be used where the number of users justify the costs.\n\nNarrow, enclosed structures can result in perceptions of low personal security among users. Wider structures and good lighting can help reduce this.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57593286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57593286", "title": "Geology of Cameroon", "text": "Geology of Cameroon\n\nThe geology of Cameroon is almost universally Precambrian metamorphic and igneous basement rock, formed in the Archean as part of the Congo Craton and the Central African Mobile Zone and covered in laterite, recent sediments and soils. Some parts of the country have sequences of sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic as well as volcanic rock produced by the 1600 kilometer Cameroon Volcanic Line, which includes the still-active Mount Cameroon. The country is notable for gold, diamonds and some onshore and offshore oil and gas.\n\nThe basement rocks in Cameroon are divided between the Central African Mobile Zone (CAMZ) and the Congo Craton, a section of ancient, stable continental crust.\n\nThe Congo Craton formed over two billion years ago in the Archean and covers much of southern Cameroon. In the south, it is referred to as the Ntem Group and contains gneiss, granite and charnockite. The CAMZ also dates to the Archean and includes mica schist, migmatite gneiss with plagioclase and migmatites intruded by quartz, granodiorite and diorite.\n\nThe Mangbei Basin, Douala Basin and Rio-del-Rey Basin formed in CAMZ and filled with Early Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The Douala and Rio-del-Rey basins both formed as a result of the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe conglomerate and sandstone of Mudeck Formation probably formed in the Early Cretaceous and is overlain by fossil-bearing shale. There is an unconformity between the crystalline basement rock and the Mudeck Formation. \n\nDuring the Cenozoic, Cameroon experienced igneous activity related to the Cameroon Volcanic Line. More than 60 sub-volcanic ring complexes formed, one to 10 kilometers in diameter and made up of syenite and granite. Geologists have dated ring complexes to as far back as 66 million years ago or as recently 30 million years ago and they may represent heavily eroded remnants of earlier volcanoes, that intruded through metamorphic basement rock into early Cenozoic sediments. Known as Granites Ultimes, these ring complexes extend over a span of 1000 kilometers parallel to the Cameroon Volcanic Line, which stretches from the interior of Africa to Pagalu in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nMount Cameroon is the southernmost volcano on the continental extent of the line and has erupted within recent years. There are no sedimentary rocks in central Cameroon and they are only present in the north and south. With tectonic activity in the Cenozoic related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, the Douala and Rio-del-Rey basins formed a continuous sedimentary basin from Nigeria to southern Cameroon until the Miocene.\n\nSome of the youngest sediments in Cameroon are located in the Lake Chad basin, dating to the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. Even more recent Holocene sediments cover much of the landscape, forming soils and alluvial material in rivers. \n\nThe CAMZ is divided by the Foumban Shear Zone. The Douala Basin is defined by northeast-southwest strike-slip faults and was divided from the Rio-del-Rey basin by volcanic activity. The Cameroon Volcanic Line formed along the preexisting Central African Shear Zone, which cuts through the Adamawa Uplift. The Benue Trough is a major tectonic feature in the north of Cameroon. \n\nVirtually all groundwater in much of Cameroon is sourced from a combination of thin layers of unconsolidated alluvium, laterite soils and underlying fractured Precambrian crystalline basement rock, between eight and 20 meters thick. Small springs, including some thermal springs are found in the fractured bedrock around volcanoes.\nCenozoic sediments from the Pliocene and the Quaternary form a key aquifer in the Douala Basin. During the dry season, the water table sometimes falls resulting in seawater intrusion. The Garoua Basin and Lake Chad Basin Aquifer are also important water supplies, often with Cretaceous sandstones at the base.\n\nMount Cameroon is the only active volcano in the country, but has erupted frequently in recent history, including seven times in the 20th century destroying plantations and parts of the surrounding landscape in 1909, 1922, 1959, 1982, 1999 and 2000. Cameroon has very active and dangerous crater lakes that accumulate and periodically release carbon dioxide causing the mass death during the Lake Nyos disaster in 1986, which killed 1700 people, as well as the deadly 1984 release at Lake Mounoun which killed 37. \n\nArtisanal mining has targeted alluvial diamonds in the Series de Carnot, a group of river and lake formations from the Cretaceous along the border with the Central African Republic. Gold is common across the country in crystalline basement rock, particularly in the east.\n\nThere is a small cassiterite deposit at Mayo Darle in northwest Cameroon, nickel and cobalt near Lomie and rutile that was mined until 1957 near Yaounde. Cameroon has two large bauxite deposits in Ngaoundal and the Minim-Martap ComplexI in the south, along with Fongo-Tongo in the west. Iron ore, with an iron concentration between 30 and 40% are situated near Mbalam in the southwest and at Kribi on the coast. Local cement plants exploit limestone deposits at Figuil and there is some marble close to Bidzar in the north. The Djoungo quarry extracts pozzolana.\n\nCameroon has small oil and gas reserves, extracted near Victoria on the north coast, as well as offshore on the Mokoko-Abana Oilfield. \n"}

Nevertheless, the Governor retains the reserve powers of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier.\n\nSee Governors of the Australian states for a description and history of the office of governor.\n\nThe official residence of the Governor is Government House located at the Queens Domain.\n\nThe first Australian-born Governor of Tasmania was Sir Stanley Burbury (appointed 1973).

Since Burbury, all Tasmanian governors have been Australian-born, except for Peter Underwood, who was born in Britain but emigrated to Australia when a teenager. The position was vacant for over five months in 2014, due to the unexpected death of the incumbent Peter Underwood on 7 July, with Chief Justice and Lieutenant-Governor Alan Blow acting as Administrator.

The northern settlement at Port Dalrymple (now George Town) was administered by four Commandants until the settlements were merged to form the single colony under the governorship of Thomas Davey in 1813.\n\nThe colony was called Van Diemen's Land until 1856.\n\nFour former governors are alive, the oldest being Sir Phillip Bennett (1987–95, born 1928). The latest-serving former governor to die was Sir Stanley Burbury (1973–82), on 24 April 1995. The most recently serving governor to die was Peter Underwood (2008–14), who died in office on 7 July 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "1017293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1017293", "title": "NASA WorldWind", "text": "NASA WorldWind\n\nWorldWind is an open-source (released under the NOSA license) virtual globe. It was first developed by NASA in 2003 for use on personal computers and then further developed in concert with the open source community since 2004. As of 2017, a web based version of WorldWind is available online. An Android version is also available.\n\nThe original version relied on .NET Framework, which ran only on Microsoft Windows. The more recent Java version, WorldWind Java, is cross platform, a software development kit (SDK) aimed at developers and, unlike the old .NET version, not a standalone virtual globe application in the style of Google Earth. The SDK includes a suite of basic demos, available at goworldwind.org. The WorldWind Java version was awarded NASA Software of the Year in November 2009. The program overlays NASA and USGS satellite imagery, aerial photography, topographic maps, Keyhole Markup Language (KML) and Collada files.\n\nThough widely available since 2003, WorldWind was released with the NASA Open Source Agreement license in 2004. The latest Java-based version (2.1.0), was released in December 2016. As of 2015 a web based version of WorldWind is under development and available online. An Android version is also available.\n\nThe previous .NET-based version was an application with an extensive suite of plugins. Apart from the Earth there are several worlds: Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter (with the four Galilean moons of Io, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto) and SDSS (imagery of stars and galaxies).\n\nUsers could interact with the selected planet by rotating it, tilting the view, and zooming in and out. Five million place names, political boundaries, latitude/longitude lines, and other data can be displayed. WorldWind.NET provided the ability to browse maps and geospatial data on the internet using the OGC's WMS servers (version 1.4 also uses WFS for downloading place names), import ESRI shapefiles and kml/kmz files. This is an example of how WorldWind allows anyone to deliver their data.\n\nOther features of WorldWind.NET included support for .X (DirectX 3D polygon mesh) models and advanced visual effects such as atmospheric scattering or sun shading.\n\nThe resolution inside the US is high enough to clearly discern individual buildings, houses, cars (USGS Digital Ortho layer) and even the shadows of people (metropolitan areas in USGS Urban Ortho layer). The resolution outside the US is at least 15 meters per pixel.\n\nMicrosoft has allowed WorldWind to incorporate Virtual Earth high resolution data for non-commercial use.\n\nWorldWind uses digital elevation model (DEM) data collected by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), National Elevation Dataset (NED) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). This means one can view topographic features such as the Grand Canyon or Mount Everest in three dimensions. In addition, WW has bathymetry data which allows users to see ocean features, such as trenches and ridges, in 3D.\n\nMany people using the applications are adding their own data and are making them available through various sources, such as the WorldWind Central or blogs mentioned in the link section below.\n\nAll images and movies created with WorldWind using Blue Marble, Landsat, or USGS public domain data can be freely modified, re-distributed, and used on web sites, even for commercial purposes.\n\nWorldWind can be expanded by using one of many add-ons - small extensions that add new functionality to the program.<br>\nPossible types of add-ons:\nPlugins are small programs written in C#, VB or J# which are loaded and compiled by WorldWind at startup. Plug-in developers can add features to WorldWind without changing the program's source code.\n\nThe original recipe for WorldWind was restricted to Windows, relying on the .NET libraries and DirectX. A new SDK version has been developed in Java with JOGL referred to as WorldWind Java. The latest version (2.1.0) was released in December 2016.\n\nThis new version has an API-centric architecture with functionalities 'off-loaded' to modular components, leaving the API at the core. This makes WorldWind itself a plugin, so that it can be used as interchangeably as possible (for example via Python). This refactoring exercise allows WorldWind to be accessed via a browser as a Java Applet. A preview of the WorldWind Java SDK was released on May 11, 2007 during Sun Microsystem's annual JavaOne conference.\n\nSince WWj is an SDK, there is no single application; instead there are any number of applications using WWj, each with different functionalities, created by government agencies and commercial developers from around the world. These applications include simple virtual globe viewers, satellite tracker, GIS platforms, photo editor, F-16 simulator, mission planning software and many more.\n\n\n\nLow resolution Blue Marble datasets are included with the initial download; as a user zooms into certain areas, additional high resolution data is downloaded from the NASA servers. The size of all currently available data sets is about 4.6 terabytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The article Japanese addressing system contains related information on postal addresses.\n\nMost place names are suffixed with its administrative division. These suffixes are often dropped in common usage when no ambiguation is likely. The suffixes are as follows:\n\n\nBecause of the above four suffixes, the prefectures of Japan are commonly referred to as \"todōfuken\" (都道府県). And below the level of prefectures, there are:\n\n\nSome names contain a word indicating a direction:\n\nOther names contain a word indicating the relationship of a settlement to another of the same or a similar name:\n\nGeographic features figure prominently in Japanese place names. Some examples are\n\nOther words that express the natural world or agriculture often appear in place names:\n\nNames and parts of names of former provinces appear in many modern place names:\n\nMedieval Japan had many towns that fell into three categories: castle towns, post towns, harbor towns. In addition, the rise of commerce contributed to some place names. Here are some parts of names connected with medieval Japan:\n\nMany names in Hokkaido originated from words in the Ainu language, as people from mainland Japan conquered and colonized Hokkaido in the Edo period and the Meiji period. Examples of geographic features are \"-nai\" and \"-betsu\" meaning \"river\", as in the names Wakkanai and Noboribetsu. The name Esashi comes from the Ainu word \"esaushi\", meaning \"cape.\" Some other names come from places in other parts of Japan because in the past people migrated as a group to Hokkaido, and they give the new settlement a name reminiscent of their old home. Examples include Hiroshima and Date, Hokkaido.\n\nDuring the rule of the Shōguns (1185-1867), families of samurai often adopted place names as their surnames. Examples are the Ashikaga clan and the Taira clan.\n\nPlace names in Okinawa Prefecture are drawn from the traditional Ryukyuan languages. Many place names use the unique languages names, while other place names have both a method of reading the name in Japanese and a way to read the name in one of the traditional local languages. The capital city Naha is \"Naafa\" in the Okinawan language. Uruma, which was incorporated in 2005, comes from an old name for the Okinawa Island meaning \"coral island\" and its name is written in hiragana rather than kanji. In Okinawan, \"nishi\" meant \"north\" rather than \"west\" as it does in standard Japanese, so Nishihara means \"northern field\" in respect to its position from the old Ryūkyū Kingdom capital at Shuri; in contrast, the Okinawan word for \"west\" is \"iri\", which appears in the name of Iriomote-jima. \"Gusuku\" (城) meaning \"castle\" is also common in place names in Okinawa, found in Tomigusuku, Nakagusuku, and Kitanakagusuku, among others. Both Chatan and Yomitan turn \"tani\" (谷, \"valley\") into \"tan\"; Chatan also turns \"kita\" (北) into \"cha\" through the Okinawan language.\n\nThe following encyclopedias and dictionaries are major research tools for reading and understanding Japanese place names and histories.\n\n\"Shin Nihon chimei sakuin\" (新日本地名索引, 1993 New Index Gazetteer of Japan) Abokkusha.\nThis is the most comprehensive dictionary for reading place names.

It is named after the town of Vic, an important and ancient urban center in this natural region that lies in the midst of the plain. Other significant towns in the plain are Manlleu and Tona.\n\nThis natural depression carved by river Ter and its tributaries is longer than it is wide and stretches in a N / S direction. It is completely surrounded by mountains: The Sub-Pyrenees, with Bellmunt mountain towering in the north, the Lluçanès and Moianès high plateaus in the West, the Montseny in the southeast and the Guilleries, located at the apex of the Catalan Transversal Range and the Pre-Coastal Range, in the east.\n\nThe Plain of Vic was the bed of an ancient sea. It is mainly formed by sedimentary rocks, like carbonatic lutite, from the eocene. The most remarkable characteristic of the landscape in the plain are low, isolated hills known as \"turons testimoni\", \"testimonial hills\". Fossils are quite abundant in areas of the Plain of Vic.\n\nThe plain is subject to a phenomenon of thermal inversion, especially marked in calm weather days during the fall and the winter, by which the surrounding mountain ranges are often warmer than the plain. This inversion in temperature also reflects in the vegetation. The original vegetation of the plain was oak \"(Quercus pubescens)\" forest, but little is left owing to continuous human intervention since ancient times. Some very ancient oaks have been preserved as a tourist attraction.\n\n\n"}

Most subtropical climates fall into two basic types: humid subtropical, where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months (for example Brisbane, Queensland or Jacksonville, Florida), and dry summer climate or (Mediterranean), where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months (for example Naples, Italy or Los Angeles, California).\n\nSubtropical climates can occur at high elevations within the tropics, such as in the southern end of the Mexican Plateau and in Vietnam and Taiwan. Six climate classifications use the term to help define the various temperature and precipitation regimes for the planet Earth.\n\nA great portion of the world's deserts are located within the subtropics, due to the development of the subtropical ridge. Within savanna regimes in the subtropics, a wet season is seen annually during the summer, which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls. Within Mediterranean climate regimes, the wet season occurs during the winter. Areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall. Plants such as palms, citrus, mango, pistachio, lychee, and avocado are grown within the subtropics.\n\nThe tropics have been historically defined as lying between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, located at latitudes 23.45° north and south, respectively. According to the American Meteorological Society, the poleward fringe of the subtropics is located at latitudes approximately 35° north and south, respectively.\n\nSeveral methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature greater than and at least one month with a mean temperature under . German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between and in the Northern Hemisphere and between and in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone, which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.\n\nAccording to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: \"Rainy winters of the west sides\" and \"Eastern subtropical climate\". According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime. According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.\n\nHeating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone. The upper-level divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As the air moves towards the mid-latitudes, it cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge. Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas, located within the subtropics. This regime is known as an arid subtropical climate, which is generally located in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents. Examples of this climate are the coastal areas of southern Africa (Namibia, South Africa), the south of the Canary Islands and the coasts of Peru and Chile.\n\nThe humid subtropical climate is often located on the western side of the subtropical high. Here, unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours, and summer is normally the season of peak annual rainfall. In the winter (dry season) the monsoon retreats, and the drier trade winds bring more stable airmass and often dry weather, and frequent sunny skies. Areas that have this type of subtropical climate include Australia, Southeast Asia, parts of South America, and the deep south of the United States. In areas bounded by warm ocean like the southeastern United States and East Asia, tropical cyclones can contribute significantly to local rainfall within the subtropics. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons.\n\nThe Mediterranean climate is a subtropical climate with a wet season in winter and a dry season in the summer. Regions with this type of climate include western Mexico. the Desert Southwest of the United States, Within the Mediterranean climate regime, the west coast of the United States and the Mediterranean coastline of Italy, Greece, and Turkey experience a wet season in the winter months. Similarly, the wet season in the Negev desert of Israel extends from October through May. At the boundary between the Mediterranean and monsoon climates in North America lies the Sonoran desert, which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate regime.\n\nThese climates do not routinely see hard frosts or snow, which allows plants such as palms and citrus to flourish. As one moves toward the tropical side the slight winter cool season disappears, while at the poleward threshold of the subtropics the winters become cooler. Some crops which have been traditionally farmed in tropical climates, such as mango, litchi, and avocado, are cultivated in the subtropics. Pest control of the crops is less difficult than within the tropics, due to the cooler winters.\n\nTree ferns (pteridophytes) are grown within subtropical areas, primarily within the subtropics and within topography within the tropics. Dracaena and yucca can grow within the subtropics. Trees within the Taxaceae family grow within subtropical climate regimes. Apple, pear and pomegranates grow well within the subtropics.\n\nThe humid subtropical climate is a subtropical climate type characterized by hot, humid summers with frequent tropical downpours of short duration and warm, and frequently dry winters. In summer, the subtropical high pressure cells bring a sultry flow of tropical air with high dew points, and daily thundershowers are typical, though brief. Normally, rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months of the year. At times, the average annual precipitation may be more evenly distributed throughout the year, or a spring maximum is present. With decreasing latitude most humid subtropical climates typically have drier winters and wetter summers.\n\nHumid subtropical climates lie on the lower east side of continents, roughly between latitudes 25° and 35° degrees away from the equator. In the United States, the humid subtropical zone is normally considered the region from central Florida north to northeastern North Carolina. \n\nThe Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of coastal southwestern North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cooler winters with rainfall. In Europe, the northernmost mediterranean climates are found along the French Riviera, located at 43° latitude. On the immediate Atlantic coastline, the mediterranean boundary goes between Porto and Vigo at around 41° latitude. Parts of southwestern Australia around Perth have a Mediterranean climate as does areas around coastal South Africa.\n\nArid subtropical climates are characterized by an annual average temperature above , the absence of regular rainfall and high humidity. Mild climate variants are generally located in areas adjacent to powerful cold ocean currents. Examples of this climate, the coastal areas of southern Africa (Namibia, South Africa), south of the Canary Islands and the coasts of Peru and Chile.\n\n"}

It is also the name of the rural community.\n\nTattaguine derives its name from a bird called \"Tatta\" or \"Tat\" in the Serer language. According to Serer mythology, prior to human habitation of this locality, it was these birds that lived there. The word \"Guine\" is the name of the bird's egg, i.e. the nesting of these birds.\nSeveral Serer religious festivals and are observed in Tattaguine. The Ndut rite of passage (the circumcision rite for boys) is just one of many rituals that are observed. It is in this rite that they receive their education about the cosmos and the paranormal world. The classical Ndut teachings prepare boys to be brave and honourable men. The \"Ndut\" (nest) is the hut where they receive their education. It is also the place they develop their arttistic skills : singing, dancing and composing songs which are religious in nature (see Njuup). The initiation usually takes place at night around a camp fire, where they are taught about the mysteries of the Universe, Serer medicine, etc.\n\nSerer religion and culture forbids the circumcision of girls (FGM). Serer girls receive their initiation by tattooing of the gum. There is also the \"Bok\" ceremony for young married women. This is a fertility rite.\n\nThe \"Misse\" is a religious dance. It takes place once year in April which coincides with the Raan festival. It is a dance that implores the for rain in order to have good harvest. It is sometimes referred to as the rain dance . Somewhat similar to Misse is the \"Xoy\" or \"Khoye\" ceremony. The Xoy is not a dance but a religious ceremony where the Serer priestly class (the Saltigues) gather once a year to divine the future and the rainy season.\n\nTattaguine is one of the old Serer countries though much younger than the historic and spiritual village of Yaboyabo. In Serer medieval and , Tattaguine, which was in the pre-colonial Serer Kingdom of Sine was partnered with Ngouye because of their geographical affinity hence Ngouye-Tattaguine. Ngouye-Tattaguine gained particular prominence in the latter part of the 14th century, during the reigne of Maad a Sinig Diessanou Faye (king of Sine). It was one of the royal villages at that time. Diessanou Faye was the cousin and brother in law of Jaraff Boureh Gnilane Joof founder of the Royal House of Boureh Gnilane Joof, the first royal house founded by the Joof family. \nDuring France's colonization of Senegal, old Tattaguine was divided due to population growth. This demarcation led to the creation of new localities : i.e. Tattaguine-Sérère (or \"Tattaguine-Serer\") and Tattaguine-Mbabara (Tattaguine-Bambara). The division of the old Tattaguine created Tattaguine-Sérère founded in 1901. Its first chief as of 1901 was Ngor Tine. The first chief of Tattaguine-Mbabara was Thierkoro Diakhate (also the same year). Since the division, position for the chief has become hereditary.\n\nTattaguine is the chief town of the Tattguine District in the Fatick Department, which lies within the Fatick Region of Senegal.\n\nThe closest localities are Yaboyabo (a holy place), Mbefel, Gaskor, Mboudaye Sek, Ndiefer and Gaolamboura Diarab.\n\nTattaguine's population consists mostly of the Serer people, the original inhabitants of this area. They make up 99% of the total population. Other groups include the Bambara people.\n\nAccording to the site of PEPAM (Programme d'eau potable et d'assainissement du Millénaire ( 2012), the rural community of Tattaguine consists of 22,561 people and 2,552 houses. That is equivalent to 2423 people for 274 homes. As of May 2003, the estimated population was 20394.\n\nThis used to be green and fertile, however, the peanut-monoculture has led to a decline in agricultural production and income. The main activity is seasonal subsistence farming. Crops growned include : millet, groundnut, cowpea (beans), watermelon, peppers, sorrel, bissap and tomato.\n\n\n"}

The ruins of the historical town of Listib (\"el-Ishtib\" or \"el-Istib\" in Arabic) or Tishbe, which \"1 Kings\", 17: 1 identifies as the residence and possibly even birthplace of the Prophet Elijah (\"Elias\" in Latin and Arabic), are very proximate to the tell, being across a valley from it. Because of its proximity to the assumed locus of historical and religiously significant Tishbe, 2 Christian churches were erected on the tell in the late Byzantine period: the site includes the ruins of one of the largest known Byzantine churches in Jordan. Artifacts from the site, including marble carvings and small metal religious objects, are displayed in the archaeological museum of nearby Ajloun Castle. Further, \"respect for the spirit of \"Nebhī-Ilyâs\" (the prophet Elias) is given to a grove of oak trees above the ruins\" of the Byzantine churches there.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30889228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30889228", "title": "The Pollinator Pathway", "text": "The Pollinator Pathway\n\nThe Pollinator Pathway is a participatory art, design and ecology social sculpture initiative founded by the artist and designer Sarah Bergmann. Its objective is to connect existing isolated green spaces and create a more hospitable urban environment for pollinators like bees with a system of ecological corridors of flowering plants by using existing urban infrastructure such as curb space and rooftops.\n\nThe first pollinator pathway () is located on Seattle, Washington's east-west Columbia Street, and connects Seattle University's campus on 12th Avenue to Nora's Woods on 29th Avenue away, crossing one third of Seattle's width. A second long official pollinator pathway is slated for Seattle's north-south 11th Avenue, connecting Seattle University's campus to Volunteer Park.\n\nThe first segment of the pathway on Columbia Street, which Bergmann received grants from the City of Seattle, Northwest Horticultural Society, and Awesome Foundation to create, replaced a long, grass strip between the street and sidewalk with plants that could attract pollinators. The pathways are composed of individual plots of perennial native plant species on city-owned property, tended by local volunteers.\n\nBergmann had a related installation, \"Portal to The Pollinator Pathway\", at Seattle Art Museum's Olympic Sculpture Park in 2012. In 2014, she made presentations on the project at Frye Art Museum and Seattle Tilth.\n\nSince late 2013, Bergmann has offered a certification program for new pathways to use the trademarked Pollinator Pathway name.\n\nCities other than Seattle have explored the idea of connecting landscapes for pollinators. In 2008, about the same time the Seattle project was getting under way, the Canadian Pollination Initiative wrote a paper on a \"pollinator park\" concept to include \"...right-of-way passages, including highways, power lines, gas lines and other maintained corridors can be designed in such a way that they serve as pollinator habitats.\"\n\nIn 2011, a New York author and artist Aaron Birk wrote an illustrated story, \"The Pollinator's Corridor\", about a pathway connecting the city's landscape.\n\nSeveral cities have used official means to initiate citizen discussions on their own pollinator pathways following Seattle's model, including Redmond, Washington; the Niagara Falls, New York area; and Los Angeles, California via the mayor's blog.\n\nIn 2012, Bergmann received \"The Stranger\"'s Genius Award and Seattle Art Museum's Betty Bowen Award for the project. In 2013, she was named one of Seattle's most influential people of the year by \"Seattle Magazine\", along with recipients of the award who had created other Seattle area pollinator conservation projects.\n\n\n"}
