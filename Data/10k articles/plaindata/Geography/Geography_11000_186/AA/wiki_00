In the context of elections, it can be called redistribution and is used to prevent unbalance of population across districts. In the United States, it is called redistricting. Unbalanced or discriminatory delimitation is called \"gerrymandering.\" Though there are no internationally agreed processes that guarantee fair delimitation, several organizations, such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, the European Union and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems have proposed guidelines for effective delimitation.\n\nIn international law, the related national delimitation is the process of legally establishing the outer limits (\"borders\") of a state within which full territorial or functional sovereignty is exercised. Occasionally this is used when referring to the maritime boundaries, in which case it is called maritime delimitation.\n\nCountries delimit electoral districts in different ways. Sometimes these are drawn based on traditional boundaries, sometimes based on the physical characteristics of the region and, often, the lines are drawn based on the social, political and cultural contexts of the area. This may need to be done in any form of electoral system even though it is primarily done for plurality or majority electoral system.\n\nThese processes of boundary delimitation can have a variety of legal justifications. Often, because of the powerful effects this process can have on constituencies, the legal framework for delimitation is specified in the constitution of a country. The Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) recommends the following pieces of information be included in this legal framework:\n\nDelimitation is regularly used in the United States and Commonwealth countries. This is called redistricting or redistribution respectively. In these countries non-partisan commissions may draw new district boundaries based on the distribution of population according to a census.\n\nA number of international organizations including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Commission for Democracy Through Law (the Venice Commission), the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the Electoral Institute of Southern Africa (EISA) have established standards which their members are encouraged to prescribe to. Among these standards the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) lists the most common as being Impartiality, Equality, Representativeness, Non-Discrimination and Transparency.\n\nAs part of its report, \"European Commission for Democracy Through Law: Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, Guidelines and Explanatory Reports adopted October 2002\", the Venice Commission proposed the following guidelines:\n\nIn the publication \"Good Commonwealth Electoral Practices: A Working Document, June 1997,\" the Commonwealth Secretariat identifies the following practices as necessary for proper delimitation:\n\nIn her study sponsored by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, Dr. Lisa Handley recommends the following considerations:\n\nAlso, she suggests that the process should:\n\nThe negotiations surrounding the modification of a state's borders is called National delimitation.

An example is found at Maritime Boundary Delimitation in the Gulf of Tonkin.

It can be done by hand (usually using a hoe), or with powered machinery, typically a tractor attachment.\n\nHilling buries the normally above-ground part of the plant, promoting desired growth. This may encourage the development of additional tubers (as with potatoes), force the plant to grow longer stems (leeks), or for some crops (chicory, leeks, asparagus etc.) this blanching technique keeps the stems or shoots pale and tender, or influences their taste.\n\nHilling may also be used to stabilize the stems of crops which are easily disturbed by wind.\n\nA common application of hilling is for potatoes. The tubers grow just below the surface, and can produce chlorophyll and solanine if exposed to light (green potatoes). Solanine is toxic in large doses, and can result in nausea, headache, and in rare cases, death. By hilling one or more times during the growing season – effectively, burying the potatoes in an additional few inches of soil – yield is improved, and the harvest remains edible.\n\n"}

{"id": "14660112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14660112", "title": "Journey planner", "text": "Journey planner\n\nA journey planner, trip planner, or route planner is a specialised search engine used to find an optimal means of travelling between two or more given locations, sometimes using more than one transport mode. Searches may be optimised on different criteria, for example \"fastest\", \"shortest\", \"fewest changes\", \"cheapest\". They may be constrained for example to leave or arrive at a certain time, to avoid certain waypoints, etc. A single journey may use a sequence of several modes of transport, meaning that the system may know about public transport services as well as transport networks for private transportation. Trip planning or Journey planning is sometimes distinguished from route planning, where route planning is typically thought of as using private modes of transportation such as driving, walking, or cycling, normally using a single mode at a time. Trip or Journey planning by contrast would make use of at least one public transport mode which operates according to published schedules; given that public transport services only depart at specific times (unlike private transport which may leave at any time), an algorithm must therefore not only find a path to a destination, but seek to optimise it so as to minimise the waiting time incurred for each leg.\n\nIn European Standards such as Transmodel trip planning is used specifically to describe the planning of a route for a passenger, to avoid confusion with the completely separate process of planning the operational journeys to be made by public transport vehicles on which such trips are made.\n\nTrip planners have been widely used in the travel industry since the 1970s by booking agents. The growth of the Internet, the proliferation of geospatial data, and the development of information technologies generally has led to the rapid development of many self-service browser-based on-line intermodal trip planners such as Rome2rio, Google Transit, FromAtoB.com and Door2Door.\n\nA trip planner may be used in conjunction with ticketing and reservation systems.\n\nJourney planners, also known as trip planners, comprise a front end user interface to gather travel requirements from the user and present the proposed travel itineraries back to them, and a back end journey planning engine which performs the actual computation of the possible trip plans, prioritising these according to the user's optimisation criteria (\"fastest, fewest changes, cheapest\", etc.) and returning a subset that best satisfy them. The user interface may run on a terminal, PC, tablet, mobile device or even be speech based and may integrate maps and location data to give a visualisation of the trip or to simplify the interaction with the user. The journey planning engine may be either local or remote and may have either a monolithic (all the data in a single search space) or a distributed architecture (the data for different regions split among different engines, each with their own search space).\n\nSimple engines cover only public transport data for a single mode , others are multimodal , covering public transport data for several modes; advanced intermodal engines may also include road and footpath routing to cover the access legs to reach the public transport stops and also simultaneously compute routes for travel by private car so that the user may make a comparison between public and private modes. Advanced trip planners may also make use of real-time data to improve their results; this use may be decorative, annotating the results with information about known incidents that might affect the trip, or computational, dynamically using the predicted departure and arrival times from a real-time feed such as the CEN Service Interface for Real Time Information to give more accurate trip plans for trips taking place in the near future. The capabilities of the back-end engine limit what may be offered in the user interface. The available data limits the capabilities of the back-end engine.\n\nThe minimum inputs to a trip planner are an origin and destination place and a date and time of travel (which can be defaulted to the current moment). The interface may provide various methods to discover and specify an origin or destination, including specifying the name of a geocoded place, a stop or station code, a street address, a point of interest (that is, a tourist attraction or other named common destination) or a spatial coordinate (usually specified by using an interactive web map - current locations can also be obtained from a GPS location service or from an IP address lookup). A location finding function of the trip planner will typically first resolve the origin and destination into the nearest known nodes on the transport network in order to compute a trip plan over its data set of known public transport journeys.\n\nDepending on the journey planning engine and the data sets which are available to it, many other additional inputs may be supported, for example:\n\nAfter the trip planner has computed and prioritised a trip or set of possible trips, these are presented to the user as a list for the user to choose from, they may also or instead be displayed on a map. Again, depending on the capabilities of the planner and the available data, the results may include;\n\nSome trip planners integrate information services other than point-to-point trip planning into their user interface, for example to provide timetables for routes, real-time arrivals and departures at stops, or real-time disruption notices. Additional visualisations may be offered; Google, for example, has a Gantt chart like 'Schedule explorer' that can be used to visualise the relative timings of different trip plans. Another powerful visualisation is the Isochrone map which shows relative travel times as relative distances.\n\nA trip planner may also have more than one user interface, with each optimised for different purposes. For example, online self-service done with a Web browser, an interface for call centre agents, one for use on mobile devices, or special interfaces for visually impaired users.\n\nSome commercial trip planners include aspects of discovery shopping for accommodation and activities and price comparison for some aspects of a trip.\n\nPaper based timetables designed for manual trip planning on public transport were developed in the 19th century, most notably by George Bradshaw who published the Bradshaw's Guide, the world's first compilation of railway timetables] in 1839. This became the definitive guide to UK railway routes and timetables, aggregating the data from the different railway companies into a common format. This served to establish both a standardised data set of stops and services, a workflow for regularly gathering data from many different providers and updating the data set, and a market for travel information products. Equivalent publications were developed for other countries.\n\nA theoretical basis for computer-based trip planning was provided in 1956 by Edsger W. Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. Graph theory itself originates from Euler's consideration of a route planning problem - the Seven Bridges of Königsberg.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, national railway operators such as British Rail, Deutsche Bahn and major metropolitan transit authorities London Transport developed internal systems to manage data for printed timetables and to support operations. National rail operators also developed reservation systems which typically have the ability for ticket offices and retailers to find the trip available between an origin and a destination in order to book a ticket.\n\nA separate development of electronic trip planning capabilities occurred in aviation, starting somewhat earlier as part of the evolution of airline reservation systems concerned with managing airline seating inventory in real-time. The earliest of these systems Sabre was launched in 1960 by American Airlines, others included Apollo (United Airlines (1972) and the rival Galileo CRS and Amadeus systems created by different European airline consortia in 1987. All were mainframe-based with remote OLTP terminals and became widely used by travel agents to find air, rail and boat journeys.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, some national railway operators and major metropolitan transit authorities developed their own specialised trip planners to support their customer enquiry services. These typically ran on mainframes and were accessed internally with terminals by their own staff in customer information centres, call centres, and at ticket counters in order to answer customer queries. The data came from the timetable databases used to publish printed timetables and to manage operations and some included simple route planning capabilities. The HAFAs timetable information system developed in 1989 by the German company Hacon, (now part of Siemens AG) is an example of such a system and was adopted by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and Deutsche Bahn in 1989. The \"Routes\" system of London Transport, now TfL, in use before the development of the on-line planner and covering all public transport services in London, was another example of a mainframe OLTP journey planner and included a large database of tourist attractions and popular destinations in London.\n\nIn the 1990s with the advent of [personal computers] with sufficient memory and processor power to undertake trip planning (which is relatively expensive computationally in terms of memory and processor requirements), systems were developed that could be installed and run on minicomputers and personal computers. The first digital public transport trip planner systems for a microcomputer was developed by Eduard Tulp, an informatica student at the Amsterdam University on an Atari PC. He was hired by the Dutch Railways to built a digital trip planner for the train services. In 1990 the first digital trip planner for the Dutch Railways (on diskette) was sold to be installed on PC´s and computers for off-line consultation. The principles of his software program was published in a Dutch university paper in 1991 This was soon expanded to include all public transport in the Netherlands.\n\nAnother pioneer was Hans-Jakob Tobler in Switzerland. His product \"Finajour\", which ran for PC DOS and MS-DOS was the first electronic timetable for Switzerland. The first published version was sold for the timetable period 1989/1990. Other European countries soon followed with their own journey planners.\n\nA further development of this trend was to deploy trip planners onto even smaller platforms such as mobile devices (for example, HAFAS Pocket), a Windows CE version of Hafas was launched in 1998 compressing the application and the entire railway timetable of Deutsche Bahn into six megabytes and running as a stand-alone application.\n\nThe development of the internet allowed HTML based user interfaces to be added to allow direct querying of trip planning systems by the general public. A test web interface for HaFAs, was launched as Deutsche Bahn's official rail trip planner in 1995 and evolved over time into the main Deutsche Bahn website. In 2001 Transport for London launched the world's first large-scale multimodal trip planner for a world city covering all of London's transport modes as well as rail routes to London; this used a trip planning engine supplied by Mentz Gmbh] of Munich after earlier attempts in the late 1990s to add a web interface to TfL's own mainframe internal trip planner failed to scale. Internet trip planners for major transport networks such as national railways and major cities must sustain very high query rates and so require software architectures optimised to sustain such traffic. The world's first mobile trip planner for a large metropolitan area, a WAP based interface to the London using the Mentz engine, was launched in 2001 by London startup company Kizoom Ltd , who also launched the UK's first rail trip planner for the mobile internet in 2000, also as a WAP service, followed by an SMS service. Starting in 2000 the Traveline service provided all parts of the UK with regional multi-modal trip planning on bus, coach, and rail. A web-based trip planner for UK rail was launched by UK National Rail Enquiries in 2003.\n\nEarly public transport trip planners typically required a stop or station to be specified for the endpoints. Some also supported inputting the name of a tourist attraction or other popular destination places by keeping a table of the nearest stop to the destination. This was later extended with ability to add addresses or coordinates to offer true point to point planning.\n\nCritical to the development of large-scale multi-modal trip planning in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the development in parallel of standards for encoding stop and schedule data from many different operators and the setting up of workflows to aggregate and distribute data on a regular basis. This is more challenging for modes such as bus and coach, where there tend to a large number of small operators than for rail, which typically involves only a few large operators who have exchange formats and processes already in place in order to operate their networks. In Europe, which has a dense and sophisticated public transport network, the CEN [[Transmodel] Transmodel reference model for Public Transport] was developed to support the process of creating and harmonising standard formats at both a national and international level.\n\nIn the 2000s, Several major projects developed distributed trip planning architectures to allow the federation of separate trip planners each covering a specific area to create a composite engine covering a very large area.\n\nPublic Transport trip planners proved to be immensely popular (for example by 2005 [[Deutsche Bahn]] was already sustaining 2.8 million requests per day and journey planning sites constitute some of the highest trafficked information sites in every country that has them. The ability to purchase tickets for travel for the journeys found has further increased the utility and popularity of the sites; early implementations such as the UK's Trainline offered delivery of tickets by mail; this has been complemented in most European countries by self-service print and mobile fulfillment methods. Internet trip planners now constitute a primary sales channel for most rail and air transport operators.\n\n[[Google]] started to add trip planning capabilities to its product set with a version of Google Transit in 2005, covering trips in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] region, as described by the [[TriMet]] agency manager Bibiana McHugh. This led to the development of the [[General Transit Feed Specification]] (GTFS), a format for collecting transit data for use in trip planners that has been highly influential in developing an ecosystem of PT data feeds covering many different countries. The successful uptake of GTFS as an available output format by large operators in many countries has allowed Google to extend its trip planner coverage to many more regions around the world. The Google Transit trip planning capabilities were integrated into the Google Map product in 2012.\n\nFurther evolution of trip planning engines has seen the integration of real time data so that trip plans for the immediate future take into account real time delays and disruptions. The UK [[National Rail|National Rail Enquiries]] added real time to its rail trip planner in 2007. Also significant has been the integration of other types of data into the trip planning results such as disruption notices, crowding levels, Co2 costs, etc. The trip planners of some major metropolitan cities such as the [[Transport for London]] trip planner have the ability to dynamically suspend individual stations and whole lines so that modified trip plans are produced during major disruptions that omit the unavailable parts of the network. Another development has been the addition of accessibility data and the ability for algorithms to optimise plans to take into account the requirements of specific disabilities such as wheelchair access.\n\nFor the London 2012 Olympics, an enhanced London trip planner was created that allowed the proposed trip results to be biased to manage available capacity across different routes, spreading traffic to less congested routes. Another innovation was the detailed modelling of all the access paths into and out of every Olympic venue, (from PT stop to individual arena entrance) with predicted and actual queueing times to allow for security checks and other delays being factored into the recommended travel times.\n\nAn initiative to develop an open source trip planner, the [[Open Trip Planner]] was seeded by Portland, Oregon's transit agency [[TriMet]] in 2009 and developed with the participation of agencies and operators in the USA and Europe; a full version 1.0 released in September 2016, is making it possible for smaller transit agencies and operators to provide trip planning without paying proprietary licence fees.\n\nThe usability of mobile internet trip planners was transformed by the launch of the [[Apple iPhone]] in 2007. The iPhone and similar smartphone such as Android allowed more intelligence to be placed in the client as well offering a larger format and maps and so much more usable interfaces could be created. The incorporation of the current spatial location from the mobile device's GPS also simplified some interactions. The first iPhone App for UK rail trip planning was launched by UK Startup [[Kizoom Ltd]] in 2008 and a large market for trip planning and travel information applications has subsequently developed around the world, with applications being provided both by transport operators and third parties. In the UK this was greatly facilitated by the open data policy of [[Transport for London]] which made its trip planning engine and other data feeds available to third party developers.\n\nAdvanced mobile applications such as [[Citymapper]] now integrate multiple types of data feed including trip planning for cities in every continent and give the user a uniform interface regardless of the country or city they are in.\n\nWhen bookings and payments are added to a mobile trip planner app, then the result is considered [[Mobility as a Service]] .\n\nA public transport route planner is an [[intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] journey planner, typically accessed via the [[web application|web]] that provides information about available [[public transport]] services. The application prompts a user to input an origin and a destination, and then uses algorithms to find a good route between the two on public transit services. Time of travel may be constrained to either time of departure or arrival and other routing preferences may be specified as well.\n\nAn intermodal journey planner supports [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal journeys]] i.e. using more than one [[modes of transport]], such as cycling, [[rapid transit]], [[bus]], [[ferry]], etc. Many route planners support door-to-door planning while others only work between stops on the [[transport network]], such as stations, [[airport]]s or [[bus stop]]s.\n\nFor public transport routing the trip planner is constrained by times of arrival or departure. It may also support different optimisation criteria – for example, \"fastest route, fewest changes, most accessible\". Optimisation by price (\"cheapest, \"most flexible fare\", etc.) is usually done by a separate algorithm or engine, though trip planners that can return fare prices for the trips they find may also offer sorting or filtering of results by price and product type. For long distance rail and air trip planning, where price is a significant consideration in price optimising trip planners may suggest the cheapest dates to travel for customers are flexible as to travel time.\n\nThe planning of road legs is sometimes done by a separate subsystem within a journey planner, but may consider both single mode trip calculations as well as intermodal scenarios (e.g. [[Park and Ride]], [[kiss and ride]], etc.). Typical optimisations for [[car routing]] are \"shortest route\", \"fastest route\", \"cheapest route\" and with constraints for specific \"waypoints.\" Some advanced journey planners can take into account average journey times on road sections, or even real-time predicted average journey times on road sections.\n\nA journey planner will ideally provide detailed routing for pedestrian access to stops, stations, points of interest etc. This will include options to take into account accessibility requirements for different types of users, for example; 'no steps', 'wheelchair access', 'no lifts', etc.\n\nSome journey planning systems can calculate bicycle routes, integrating all paths accessible by bicycle and often including additional information like topography, traffic, on-street cycling infrastructure, etc. These systems assume, or allow the user to specify, preferences for quiet or safe roads, minimal elevation change, [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle lanes]], etc.\n\nTrip planners depend on a number of different types of data and the quality and extent of this data limits their capability. Some trip planners integrate many different kinds of data from numerous sources. Others may work with one mode only, such as flight itineraries between airports, or using only addresses and the street network for driving directions.\n\nPassengers don't travel because they want to go to a particular station or stop, but because they want to go some destination of interest, such as a sports arena, tourist attraction, shopping centre, park, law court, etc., etc. Many trip planners allow users to look for such \"Points of interest\", either by name or by category (\"museum, stadium, prison,\" etc.). Data sets of systematically named, geocoded and categorized popular destinations can be obtained commercially, for example, The UK PointX data set, or derived from opensource data sets such as [[Open Street Map]]. Major operators such as [[Transport for London]] or [[National Rail]] have historically had well developed sets of such data for use in their Customer Call centres, along with information on the links to the nearest stops. For points of interest that cover a large area, such as parks, country houses or stadia, a precise geocoding of the entrances is important.\n\nTrip planning user interfaces can be made more usable by integration of [[Gazetteer]] data. This can be associated with stops to assist with stop finding in particular, for example for disambiguation; there are 33 places named Newport in the US and 14 in the UK - a Gazetteer can be used tops distinguish which is which and also in some cases to indicate the relationship of transport interchanges with towns and urban centres that passengers are trying to reach - for example only one of London's five or so Airports is actually in London. Data for this purpose typically comes from additional layers in a map data set such as that provided by [[Esri]], [[Ordnance Survey]], [[Navtech]], or specific data sets such as the UK [[National Public Transport Gazetteer]].\n\nRoad trip planners, sometimes referred to as route planners, use street and footpath network data to compute a route using simply the network connectivity (i.e. trips may run at any time and not constrained by a timetable). Such data can come from one or more public, commercial or crowdsourced datasets such as [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]], [[Esri]] or [[OpenStreetMap]]. The data is fundamental both for computing access legs to reach public transport stops, and to compute road trips in their own right. The fundamental representation is a graph of nodes and edges (i.e. points and links). The data may be further annotated to assist trip planning for different modes;\n\nAdvanced road trip planners take into account the real-time state of the network. They use two main types of feed to do this, obtained from road data services using interfaces such as [[Datex II]] or [[Urban Traffic Management and Control|UTMC]].\n\nFor transit route planners to work, transit schedule data must always be kept up to date. To facilitate data exchange and interoperability between different trip planners, several standard data formats have emerged.\n\nThe [[General Transit Feed Specification]], developed in 2006, is now used by hundreds of transit agencies around the world.\n\nIn the European Union all public passenger travel operators have the obligation to provide the information under the EU railway timetable data exchange format. In other parts of the world there similar exchange standards.\n\nThe location and identity of Public transport access points such as bus, tram and coach stops, stations, airports, ferry landing and ports are fundamental to trip planning and a stop data set is an essential layer of the transport data infrastructure. In order to integrate stops with spatial searches and road routing engines they are [[Geocoding|geocoded]]. In order to integrate them with the timetables and routes they are given a unique identifier within the transport network. In order to be recognizable to passengers they are given official names and may also have a public short code (for example the three letter [[IATA]] codes for airports) to use in interfaces. Historically, different operators quite often used a different identifier for the same stop and stop numbers were not unique within a country or even a region. Systems for managing stop data, such as the [[International Union of Railways|International Union of Railways (UIC)]] station location code set or the UK's [[NaPTAN|NaPTAN (National Public Transport Access Point)]] system for stop numbers provide a means of ensuring numbers are unique and the stops are fully described, greatly facilitate the integration of data. Timetable exchange formats, such as [[GTFS]], [[TransXChange]] or [[NeTEx]] include stop data in their formats and spatial data sets such as [[OpenStreetMap]] allow stop identifiers to be geocoded.\n\nFor public transport networks with a very high frequency of service, such as urban metro cities and inner city bus services, the topology of the network can also be used for route planning, with an average interval being assumed rather than specific departure times. Data on the routes of trains and buses is also useful for providing visualisation of results, for example, to plot the route of a train on a map. National mapping bodies, such as the UK's [[Ordnance Survey]] typically include a Transport layer in their data sets and the European [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]] framework includes public transport infrastructure links in its set of strategic digital data. The CEN [[NeTEx]] format allows both the physical layer (e.g. road and railway track infrastructure links) and the logical layer (e.g. links between scheduled stopping points on a given line) of the transport infrastructure to be exchanged\n\nData on public transport schedules is used by trip planners to determine the available journeys at specific times. Historically rail data has been widely available in national formats, and many countries also have bus and other mode data in national formats such as [[Association of German Transport Companies|VDV 452]] (Germany), [[TransXChange]] (UK) and Neptune (France). Schedule data is also increasingly becoming available in international formats such as [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] and [[NeTEx]]. To allow a route to be projected onto a map, GTFS allows the specification of a simple shape plot; whilst [[Transmodel]] based standards such as CEN [[NeTEx]], [[TransXChange]] additionally allow a more detailed representation which can recognize the constituent links and distinguish several different semantic layers.\n\nTrip planners may be able to incorporate real-time information into their database and consider them in the selection of optimal routes for travel in the immediate future. [[Automatic Vehicle Location|Automatic vehicle location]] (AVL) systems monitor the position of vehicles using [[Global Positioning System|GPS systems]] and can pass on real-time and forecast information to the journey planning system. A trip planner may use a real time interface such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to obtain this data.\n\nA situation is a software representation of an incident (for example security alert, cancellation or bad weather) or event that is affecting or is likely to affect the transport network. A trip planner can integrate situation information and use it both to revise its trip planning computations and to annotate its responses so as to inform users through both text and map representations. A trip planner will typically use a standard interface such as [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI]], [[TPEG]] or [[Datex II]] to obtain situation information.\n\nIncidents are captured through an [[Incident Capturing System|incident capturing system]] (ICS) by different operators and stakeholders, for example in transport operator control rooms, by broadcasters or by the emergency services. Text and image information can be combined with the trip result. Recent incidents can be considered within the routing as well as visualized in an interactive map.\n\nTypically journey planners use an efficient in-memory representation of the network and timetable to allow the rapid searching of a large number of paths. Database queries may also be used where the number of nodes needed to compute a journey is small, and to access ancillary information relating to the journey. A single engine may contain the entire transport network, and its schedules, or may allow the [[Distributed computing|distributed computation]] of journeys using a distributed journey planning protocol such as [[JourneyWeb]] or [[Delfi Protocol]]. A journey planning engine may be accessed by different front ends, using a software protocol or [[Application Program Interface|application program interface]] specialised for journey queries, to provide a [[User Interface|user interface]] on different types of device.\n\nThe development of journey planning engines has gone hand in hand with the development of data standards for representing the stops, routes and timetables of the network, such as [[TransXChange]], [[NaPTAN]], [[Transmodel]] or [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] that ensure that these fit together. Journey planning algorithms are a classic example of problems in the field of [[Computational complexity theory]]. Real-world implementations involve a tradeoff of computational resources between accuracy, completeness of the answer, and the time required for calculation.\n\nThe sub-problem of route planning is an easier problem to solve as it generally involves less data and fewer constraints. However, with the development of \"road timetables\", associating different journey times for road links at different times of day, time of travel is increasingly relevant for route planners as well.\n\nJourney planners use a [[Routing|routing algorithm]] to search a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]] representing the transport network. In the simplest case where routing is independent of time, the graph uses (directed) [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] to represent street/path segments and [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] to represent [[Intersection (road)|intersections]]. Routing on such a graph can be accomplished effectively using any of a number of routing algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm|Dijkstra's]], [[A* search algorithm|A*]], [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm|Floyd-Warshall]], or [[Johnson's algorithm]]. Different weightings such as distance, cost or accessibility may be associated with each edge, and sometimes with nodes (e.g. where there are traffic signals).\n\nWhen time-dependent features such as public transit are included, there are several proposed ways of representing the transport network as a graph and different algorithms may be used such as RAPTOR\n\nDistribution companies may incorporate route planning software into their [[fleet management]] systems to optimize route efficiency. A route planning setup for distribution companies will often include GPS tracking capability and advanced reporting features which enable dispatchers to prevent unplanned stops, reduce mileage, and plan more fuel-efficient routes.\n\n\n[[Category:Public transport information systems]]\n[[Category:Sustainable transport]]\n[[Category:Route planning software]]\n[[Category:Cartography]]\n[[Category:Intermodal passenger transport]]\n[[Category:Scheduling (transportation)]]"}

Doctor of Geographical Sciences (1954), professor (1965). Honored Scientist of the Georgian SSR (1966) and Abkhaz ASSR. Honorary member of the Russian Geographical Society (1985). He introduced a new concept of karst-sphere into the science. Krubera Cave, which is the world’s deepest known cave (2197 m), was discovered by the Georgian researchers in 1960 by the leadership of Professor Levan Maruashvili.\n\nLevan Maruashvili was born on 25 October, 1912 in the town of Novocherkassk of the Don Host Oblast, to the family of engineer-Roadbuilder. In 1914 the family moved to Georgia. In 1919 he entered labor school No 2 in Tbilisi. From 1926 to 1930 years he studied at Tbilisi hydro-technical school and simultaneously worked as a technician-hydrologist with field detachments, in Upper Svaneti. From 1932 to 1933 Levan Maruashvili worked in Kazbegi tourist center. In 1933 he entered the faculty of natural sciences at Tbilisi State University and at the same time collaborated with the \"Vecherni Tbilisi\" and the \"Zarya Vostoka\" newspapers as a literary-man. On graduation from the University in 1938 he began working at Kutaisi Pedagogical Institute as an assistant at the Geographical Department.\n\nIn 1941, when the Great Patriotic War broke out he joined the field Forces. After graduation from the accelerated courses of Kharkov Commissariat Academy, Levan Maruashvili took part in the battle by the town of Stalingrad defending the ways leading to the Caucasus. In 1943-1946 he was in \"Stepsgeo\" team fighting in high-mountains of the Caucasus and participated in the military-geographical expeditions in South Georgia. Being demobilized from the army in 1946, in a very short time he got ready his dissertation - \"Karst of fragmental rock, its geomorphological characteristics in the light of general karstology, Central Megrelia as an example (Western Georgia)\" and successfully defended his master's degree in 1947.\n\nSince 1947, Levan Maruashvili worked as an assistant professor at Kutaisi Pedagogical Institute, and from 1949 to 1953 took over the Department of Geography at Sokhumi Pedagogical Institute. In 1952 after defending his Doctor's degree on the subject \"South-Georgian volcanic upland (structure, relief, historical development)\" he made a great contribution to the study of volcanic areas of Alpine-Mediterranean belt, which has not lost its significance up till now.\n\nIn 1953, he began working at the Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography, Georgian Academy of Sciences. At first he headed the department of Physical Geography and from then onwards the Departments of Geomorphology and Paleogeography until his death. Almost for half a century Levan Maruashvili travelled a lot over his native land and studied its nature. Almost all the branches of Geographical science were elucidated in his works: geomorphology, physical geography, paleogeography, karstology and speleology, history of geographical discoveries et al. In his young years he was fond of mountaineering and conquered tens of peaks and high-mountain passes.\n\nHe produced over 500 scientific and popular-scientific works in Georgian and Russian languages, among then there are 30 monographs and booklets. The results of his numerous research field - works in the territory of Georgia and other regions of the Caucasus and the Pamirs are given in these works.\n\nSince 1936 Levan Maruashvili began publishing a series of vivid scientific articles in popular natural-scientific journal of Russia the \"Priroda\" - \"Zonality of the Great Caucasus\", \"Lava plateau of Keli\" (geomorphological survey). \"Glaciation of the Great Caucasus\", \"Abskril Cave\", \"Disappearance of Siveraut glacier\", \"Volcanic caves of South Georgia\" and many others. Versatility, breadth of learning, non-stop working ability, great talent displayed in Levan Maruashvili's diverse scientific interests made the basis of his creative work. In 1959, for the first time he began investigation of periglacial forms, defined their high altitude line and peculiarities of spreading of the major forms of peri-glacial formations on the South-Georgian volcanic upland in the Central Caucasus. In the scientific activity of Levan Maruashvili there may be singled out the following basic branches of Geography, in the study of which be made great contributions: Geomorphology of Georgia, Paleogeography of Georgia and the Caucasus (Neogene-Quaternary period), Regional physical Geography of Georgia and the Caucasus, Karstology and speleology, History of geographical knowledge and travels, Rustvelology and Mountaineering.\n\nIn 1975 and 1980, for the first time there was published in Georgian a three-volume work entitled \"Physical Geography of the Caucasus\". He introduced a new concept of karst-sphere into the science. These and other points were elucidated in the text-book - \"Basic of Cave Study: General Speleology\" (1973), based on the author's direct observations and analysis of scientific literature. Being the editor in chief Levan Maruashvili took over organization of all field works connected with the fundamental work entitled \"Study of Kolkhida Caves\" (1978). In 1982 for active participation in producing the \"Red Book of Georgia\" he was awarded the state Prize of the Georgian SSR.\n\nLevan Maruashvili was awarded of the Nikolay Przhevalsky Gold Medal (1972) and the Vakhushti Bagrationi Prize (1977). In 1985, he was awarded the state Prize of the Georgian SSR.\n\n"}

Many follow a transport route, such as a road, river, or canal though some form due to physical restrictions, such as coastlines, mountains, hills or valleys. Linear settlements may have no obvious centre, such as a road junction. Linear settlements have a long and narrow shape.\n\nIn the case of settlements built along a route, the route predated the settlement, and then the settlement grew up at some way station or feature, growing along the transport route. Often, it is only a single street with houses on either side of the road. Mileham, Norfolk, England is a good example of this. Later development may add side turnings and districts away from the original main street. Places such as Southport, England developed in this way.\n\nA linear settlement is in contrast with ribbon development, which is the outward spread of an existing town along a main street.\n\nA \"linear village\" or a \"chain village\" is a village that is also a linear settlement.\n\n\n"}

There are currently at least 9 Germans known to be alive over age 110, including 2 emigrants. The oldest living German is Gustav Gerneth, born 15 October 1905, aged . Gerneth is also the oldest German resident ever, and the world's second oldest living man, although his age has not yet been fully verified. Augusta Holtz, an emigrant to the United States, was the oldest German citizen whose age was validated; she lived 115 years and 79 days, from 1871 to 1986.\n\nKarl Friedrich Wedeking (10 October 1862 – 5 May 1973) was the first German-born person to reach age 110 (as Ella Ille Rentel, who was the first German supercentenarian, was born in Lithuania) and when he died aged 110 years, 207 days, was also the world's oldest living man. He was born in Blomberg and died in Dortmund. He was one of the founding members of the gliders club, which was started in 1931 and is still active in Blomberg today.\n\nWedeking was succeeded as world's oldest living man by Frederick Butterfield.\n\nMaria Laqua (12 February 1889 – 9 February 2002) was a German supercentenarian who was the oldest person ever in Germany (as German-born Augusta Holtz lived in the United States) when she died aged 112 years, 362 days, though until 12 October 2018 when her age was surpassed by Gustav Gerneth.\n\nMaria Laqua was born in 1889 in Rheydt-Odenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, as one of 13 children. She worked as a housemaid, married and gave birth to two children in the 1920s. Her husband Charles died in 1958. Both of their sons died in the Second World War. Laqua lived for 35 years in a retirement home in Bad Hönningen, Rhineland-Palatinate and died in her sleep on 9 February 2002, just three days before her 113th birthday. She was only survived by a great-niece who attended her regularly. It was reported that Laqua was in need of care, bedridden and inaccessible during her last years. Nevertheless there were also good days when she had a flash and spoke.\n\nHermann Dörnemann (27 May 1893 – 2 March 2005) was a German supercentenarian who, at the time of his death, was the oldest living person in Germany since the death of 111-year-old Lina Zimmer on 28 August 2004 and the oldest living man in Europe since the death of 114-year-old Spaniard Joan Riudavets on 5 March 2004. He was believed to have become the world's oldest living man upon the death of 113-year-old American man Fred H. Hale Sr. on 19 November 2004 but later Puerto Rican man Emiliano Mercado del Toro, who died aged 115 in January 2007, was confirmed to be almost two years older than Dörnemann.\n\nDörnemann credited his longevity to \"drinking a beer a day\". He died of pneumonia in Düsseldorf on 2 March 2005 aged 111 years, 279 days and was the oldest German man ever before being surpassed by Gustav Gerneth on 22 July 2017 (however, Gerneth is still not verified).\n\nElisabeth Schneider (19 August 1901 – 9 February 2013) was a German supercentenarian who was the oldest living person in Germany from the death of Karolina Gröber on 21 November 2011 until her own death on 9 February 2013 at the age of 111 years and 174 days. She was born in Bad Oeynhausen, North Rhine-Westphalia, in 1901 and had two sisters. She married in 1923 and gave birth to a daughter two years later. Schneider lived on her own until the age of 97. At her 111th birthday she was asked for the secret of her longevity as the oldest living German supercentenarian and replied laughing that others just would have given up gasping for breath. On 9 February 2013, she died in a retirement home in Varel, Lower Saxony. Schneider was outlived by her daughter, two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\nGertrud Henze (8 December 1901 – 22 April 2014) was a German supercentenarian who had been the oldest living person in Germany from the death of Elisabeth Schneider on 9 February 2013 until her death on 22 April 2014. The former librarian was born on Rügen and never got married or gave birth to a child. She was still in good condition and lived in a retirement home in Göttingen since 1993 where she was well-liked by many residents for her open and life-affirming attitude. Henze traced her longevity to reading a lot, having lively contact with other people, enjoying sometimes a cigarette and a glass of wine and never marry. She celebrated her 112th birthday only with some friends and relatives because the public interest in consequence of her birthday the year before was too exhausting. She enjoyed reading, even with the help of a magnifying glass. Notwithstanding her physical limitations, Henze was able to walk with the help of a walking frame to meet acquaintances and friends for a chat. Henze died on 22 April 2014 at the age of 112 years and 135 days. She bequeathed her body for genetic research to science.\n\nFrieda Szwillus (née Hennig; 30 March 1902 – 21 September 2014) was a German supercentenarian who had been Germany's oldest living person from 22 April 2014 until her death 5 months later, aged 112 years, 175 days. Frieda Hennig was born in Dessau in 1902 (now in Saxony-Anhalt) and had six siblings. In 1908, aged six; she and her family moved to Erla. Szwillus was married twice, raised one biological child and three stepchildren, and outlived all four of them. \n\nIn late-2011, Szwillus was bedridden for some weeks but recovered. Until her later years, she was living at home in Raschau with her family and she needed no medicine. Mrs. Szwillus was in good physical condition, but suffered from dementia. Szwillus’s family attributed her longevity to having a lively family life. She often visited her siblings but never went on holiday. Furthermore, Szwillus was only physically active during her youth. She also enjoyed knitting and embroidering. She died on 21 September 2014 at the age of 112 years and 175 days.\n\nGustav Gerneth (born 15 October 1905) is, at age , the oldest person ever in Germany (and the fifth oldest German-born ever behind Augusta Holtz, Charlotte Benkner, Luzia Mohrs and Adelheid Kirschbaum) and the world's second oldest living man behind Japanese man Masazo Nonaka (however, Gerneth is still not verified). He was born in Stettin, which was then part of the German Empire and is now in Poland and known as Szczecin. He worked in a shipping company and at a gas plant. In World War II, he was a mechanic with the German air force (Luftwaffe). He married his wife Charlotte (died in 1988) in 1930 and the couple had three sons. The death of Luzia Mohrs, who was born on 23 March 1904 in Germany and emigrated to Brazil, on 16 October 2017 meant that Gerneth became the oldest living German person just one day after his 112th birthday. He lives in Saxony-Anhalt in the same brick house with steep entrance stairs where he has lived for over 40 years.\n"}

{"id": "607253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=607253", "title": "Living machine", "text": "Living machine\n\nLiving Machine is a trademark and brand name for a patented form of ecological sewage treatment designed to mimic the cleansing functions of wetlands. Similar to Solar Aquatics Systems, the latest generation of the technology is based on fixed-film ecology and the ecological processes of a natural tidal wetland, one of nature’s most productive ecosystems. The diversity of the ecosystem produced with this approach allows operational advantages over earlier generations of Living Machines and over conventional waste water treatment technologies.\n\nThe Living Machine system was commercialized and is marketed by Living Machine Systems, L3C, a social benefit corporation based in Charlottesville, Va. The trademark Living Machine is owned by Dharma Group, LC, the parent company of Worrell Water Technologies.\n\nThe Living Machine is an intensive bioremediation system that can also produce beneficial byproducts, such as reuse-quality water, ornamental plants and plant products—for building material, energy biomass, animal feed. Aquatic and wetland plants, bacteria, algae, protozoa, plankton, snails and other organisms are used in the system to provide specific cleansing or trophic functions. The tidal process operates outdoors in tropical and temperate climates. In colder climates, the system of tanks, pipes and filters may be housed in a greenhouse to prevent freezing and raise the rate of biological activity.\n\nThe initial development of the technology in the United States is generally credited to Dr. John Todd, an ecological designer, and evolved out of the bioshelter concept developed at the now-defunct New Alchemy Institute. The Living Machine system falls within the emerging discipline of ecological engineering, and many systems using earlier generations of the technology are built without being dubbed a Living Machine.\n\nThe scale of Living Machine systems ranges from the individual building to community-scale public works. Some of the earliest Living Machines were used to treat domestic wastewater in small, ecologically-conscious villages, such as Findhorn Community in Scotland. Some treated the mixed municipal wastewater for semi-urban areas, such as South Burlington, Vermont (this plant closed recently). The latest-generation Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machines are being used in major urban office buildings, military bases, housing developments, resorts and institutional campuses.\n\nEach system is designed to handle a certain volume of water per day, but the system is also tailored for the qualities of the specific influent. For example, if the influent contains high levels of heavy metals, ecological wastewater treament systems must be designed to include the proper biota to accumulate the metals. During the “spring cleaning” season, there may be high levels of bleach in the water. This sudden concentration of a toxin is an example of a \"steep gradient\".\n\nSpecies diversity is a design goal that promotes complexity and resiliency in an ecosystem. Functional redundancy (the presence of multiple species that provide the same function) is an important example of the need for biodiversity. Snails and fish filter sludge and act as diagnostics; when a toxic load enters, snails will rise above the water level on the wall of the tank.\n\n\n\"The above points are an incomplete synthesis of a .\"\n\nBjörn Guterstam critiques conventional wastewater treatment for five different inadequacies that \"living machine\" systems address. This evaluation explains the basis of his five points of contention:\n\n\nA contained microsystem can be very successful in recycling nutrients, organic matter, and water. Depending on the toxicity and makeup of the influent, living machines can treat water to tertiary treatment standards and even reach potable standards for most or all metrics. This excellent organic recycling is possible if the biosolids are not heavily contaminated with persistent pollutants (such as aluminum, which retards biotic growth). Mixed domestic/industrial municipal influent is more polluted, so a living machine may not always be able to treat every contaminant to levels that would not stress the ecosystem that receives the effluent. In this case, more treatment is necessary, which can be achieved by drainage into constructed wetlands which provide a different type of ecosystem that provides a fresh lineup of ecological players and services that can further process pollutants.\n\n\nGuterstam contends that traditional facilities require larger capital investment and demand more labor and energy costs than their ecological counterparts. It is difficult to make a generalization about economic comparisons because thus far \"living machine\" systems have only been built for single commercial buildings. The next step in the development of these systems would be a larger scale ecosystem that has more diversity and higher populations to treat a larger volume of sewage. Until there is an equivalence of scale, economic comparison between the two systems is somewhat awkward and speculative. However, it is safe to say that \"Living Machine\" systems are ecologically superior.\n\nConventional wastewater treatment is heavily embedded in our industrial toolkit. A worldwide revolution in wastewater treatment would require an entire industry and profession to make a major disciplinary shift from a focus on \"industrial\" engineering to \"ecological\" engineering, applied biology and ecology. \"Living Machine\" systems have yet to be made on a comparable scale to conventional treatment plants, and this “biology of scale” could bring benefits or drawbacks in efficiency.\n\nIn tropical and temperate climates, \"Living Machine\" systems can be outdoors, as the temperature will sustain sufficient biological activity throughout the winter. In cold climates, a greenhouse is used to keep water temperatures warm so that plants do not winterize. Supplemental heating may also be necessary.\n\nLiving Machine systems use screens, biofilters, plumbing, large plastic tanks, reed beds, rocks, fans, pumps and other mechanical devices. Every system is tailored to the volume and makeup of the sewage. Some are stand-alone greenhouses, while others are built into larger buildings.\n\nJohn Todd and Michael Shaw have a patent on a device called an \"ecological fluidized bed\" which is essentially a pumice-filled tank with a concentric inner tank that contains wetland plants. Pumps rapidly recirculate water to maximize the filtration rate of this device.\n\n\nSome ecological wastewater treatment systems, including first-generation Living Machine systems, employed hydroponics and even aquaculture. However, these processes are not part of today's Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machine systems.\n\n\n\nIn a 2000 report to the USEPA on a South Burlington, Vermont, living machine, Ocean Arks International outlined five key areas which could shape the future of this field.\nThe foremost “possible breakthrough areas” is the ongoing classification of species by the biochemical, biological and ecological roles they play and how those roles effect other species under the context of wastewater treatment. The breakthrough would be to study the function of organisms in hopes of being able to more readily and successfully manage overall ecosystem function. Browne et al. (in press) have looked into the structuring of aquatic systems for water treatment.\n\nTrophic management is used to influence entire systems by selective predation based on diagnosing an imbalance and analyzing the web of ecosystem classifications, roles and relationships. This management technique exploits the close interconnections of the food web, trophic cascade, to send a ripple down through the living community. This stewardship technique is predicated upon an advanced understanding of the conditions in the ecosystem and modeling the dynamic relationships down the trophic cascade. The trophic cascade in lakes has been researched by Carpenter and Hall.\n\nLiving Machine systems have been composed largely in closed greenhouses which can only react minimally with the surrounding ecosystem, and where populations have been heavily managed to foster equilibrium. If a Living Machine were subject to the ecology of invasions, new species would be free to colonize the system, and natural selection would dictate the success of any species. This would be true ecosystem self-design and self-management partnered with human stewardship.\n\nPhotosynthetic changes, specifically the control of light exposure is another powerful management practice capable of slowing or accelerating primary production. This is similar to the idea of trophic management, except that it manipulates the other end of the food web.\n\nFinally, there is economic potential for methane generation, market crops such as flowers, fish, tomatoes, lettuce and other foods tolerant of hydroponic conditions, useful plants or medicinals. Combined with the revenue from wastewater treatment these services could turn living machines into pollution sinks and economic generators. It is well documented that a small, well-planned system in a good location can be economically viable. If a living machine can subsist in Alaska, it seems reasonable that ecologically engineered sewage treatment can be tailored to work smoothly in warm developing countries.\n\nPublic sanitation and equitable access to water in very poor countries are grave problems. Living machines could be a low-capital approach to treating and recycling water, but skilled biologists may be a limited resource as well. A brick-pool living machine was built by Americans in Auroville, Indiana.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1171003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1171003", "title": "Mount Tamalpais", "text": "Mount Tamalpais\n\nMount Tamalpais (; ; Coast Miwok: , known locally as Mount Tam) is a peak in Marin County, California, United States, often considered symbolic of Marin County. Much of Mount Tamalpais is protected within public lands such as Mount Tamalpais State Park, the Marin Municipal Water District watershed, and National Park Service land, such as Muir Woods.\n\nMount Tamalpais is the highest peak in the Marin Hills, which are part of the Northern California Coast Ranges. The elevation at the West Peak, where a radar dome currently stands, is between and . It stood over before the summit was flattened for the radar dome construction. The East Peak is at . The East Peak was considered the highest point in the county, but now that claim is being disputed by those who believe the west peak is higher. But there is no corroboration of the claim on behalf of west peak from USGS or any other official body. The site ListsOfJohn has marked the west peak to be higher, but added a footnote that the east peak may be higher since the west peak summit was razed. The mountain is clearly visible from the city of San Francisco and the East Bay region.\n\nThe majority of the mountain is contained in protected public lands, including Mount Tamalpais State Park, Muir Woods National Monument, and the Mount Tamalpais Watershed. It adjoins the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (which in turn adjoins Point Reyes National Seashore) as well as several Marin County Open Space Preserves. This provides nearly of continuous publicly accessible open space. Some of the lower slopes of Mount Tamalpais fall within several cities and unincorporated communities of Marin County, including Mill Valley, Tamalpais-Homestead Valley, Stinson Beach, and Kentfield. These areas are generally developed, consisting of mostly low-density single-family homes.\n\nLike the rest of the California Coast Ranges, Mount Tamalpais is the result of uplift, buckling, and folding of the North American plate as it slides along the Pacific Plate near the San Andreas fault zone.\n\nIn 2004 it was suggested by a team of Penn State geoscientists that a blind thrust fault, like the one that caused the infamous Northridge earthquake, lies beneath Mount Tamalpais. This idea was partly based on the steepness of Mount Tamalpais and of nearby Bolinas Ridge, such steepness on the visible surface often being the result of blind thrust faults. Another reason for the suggestion was that the San Andreas Fault creeps more slowly south of Mount Tamalpais than it does in its sections north of Mount Tamalpais and in the Olema Valley, and that the existence of a blind thrust fault may explain the different creeping velocities. If a blind thrust fault does exist under Mount Tamalpais, and if it ruptures, it could be potentially devastating to the North Bay, San Francisco, and any other nearby locale resting on unstable earth and loose fill.\n\nMajor Mount Tamalpais rockforms include serpentine, particularly evident in outcroppings near the summit and on the north side. A number of serpentine endemic plants grow in the serpentine soils in this part of the mountain.\n\nSince the steep slopes of Mount Tamalpais force out moisture from passing storms and/or fog, the mountain supports several year-round streams like Redwood Creek on the southern face of the mountain down into Muir Woods. The steep southeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais drain to Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio, which in turn discharges to Richardson Bay.\n\nWith its height, various faces, and proximity to the ocean and bay, the mountain contains many microclimates, ranging from cool and foggy in lower ocean-facing valleys with their redwood forests, to hot and dry on the manzanita slopes, cool and breezy at the summit, and shady on the heavily Douglas-fir-forested north slopes near Alpine Lake.\nAnnual precipitation around Mount Tamalpais varies greatly from around 27.5–31.5 inches (700–800 mm) in the drier, eastern foothills to about 59 inches (1,500 mm) near the Bolinas Ridge, close to the Pacific Ocean. Both Mount Tamalpais and the Bolinas Ridge force moisture out of the air efficiently, since the air is cooled rapidly as it ascends the steep mountain faces and thus Mount Tamalpais's western part is heavily forested with tall redwoods and Douglas firs. The same fact holds for the steep, south-facing bowl canyon that Muir Woods is located in, with precipitation in Redwood Canyon at around 39.4–47.2 inches (1,000–1,200 mm).\n\nAs in San Francisco, most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months. During cold, wet winter storms, the mountain also regularly gets some snowfall, sometimes as much as overnight, as observed in February 2001, March 2006, and February 2011. The region sometimes gets hit with strong Pacific storms that may topple trees, and bring hurricane-force winds to exposed, barren areas like the Bolinas Ridge and the summit of Mount Tamalpais. In summer, the area gets almost no precipitation, except for fog drip that occurs in Muir Woods, the Bolinas Ridge and the western end of Mount Tamalpais, where summer fog and oceanic breezes are more prevalent. In contrast, the eastern foothills, sheltered from the oceanic breezes and fog, are drier, since the foothills force little moisture out of the air. This leads to the fact that the eastern slopes contain only oak, pine, chaparral shrub, coastal sage scrub, grassland and sparse Douglas-fir forest. Coastal sage scrub also occurs on some of the exposed coastal slopes.\n\nTemperatures on top of Mount Tamalpais are generally somewhat cooler than places next to the San Francisco Bay or the ocean due to elevation. In summer, however, the top of Mount Tamalpais may actually be warmer than the middle, foggy elevations due to a thermal inversion. The summer fog and breezes make locations on Mount Tamalpais, closer to the ocean, cooler than the blazing hot interior valleys.\n\nHardwood woodland types are generally subtypes of California oak woodland, including oak-bay-madrone forest, oak woodland, and oak savannah. Oak-bay-madrone forests are found in areas with moderate moisture and particularly favor north-facing slopes. They are dominated by one or more of three hardwood tree species – Coast Live Oak, California bay, and madrone. Coast live oak tends to be dominant in somewhat drier areas, while bay is more dominant in shadier, moister areas; madrone is abundant in certain soil types in both moist and dry spots. Oak woodlands are a more open-canopy forest dominated by coast live oak, while oak savannah has a completely open canopy and represents a mixture of coast live oak woodland and grassland.\n\nThe great diversity of microclimates on Mount Tamalpais ensures a wide variety of plant communities as well. Plant communities on the mountain include various types of hardwood and coniferous forests, coastal scrub, chaparral, grassland, and wetland vegetation. Wholly or partially coniferous forest types are found in the moistest areas of Mount Tamalpais. Coast redwood forests are restricted to areas where the particular ecological needs of redwood are met: areas characterized by high overall moisture, low elevations below the fog line, and deep soils. Muir Woods is the most extensive and best-known redwood forest of the Mount Tamalpais area. Mixed evergreen forests of various combinations of tanoak, madrone, coast and canyon live oak, and Douglas-fir are found in moist areas on middle to high elevations on the mountain. Very moist areas of mixed evergreen forest may also include bay, redwood, and California torreya. Areas in which mixed evergreen forests are predominant include areas of Fairfax-Bolinas Road and Ridgecrest Boulevard and around Alpine Lake.\nVarious kinds of scrub communities are also widespread. Low-elevation areas below the fog line with relatively low overall rainfall or thin soils are often the site of a northern coastal scrub community characterized by coastal sage-coyote brush association, with lesser amounts of poison-oak, bush monkeyflower, California blackberry, western bracken fern, and various species of grasses and forbs. Chaparral is predominant in areas characterized by thin, rocky soils and little moisture. Two main types of chaparral are found the mountain chamise chaparral and manzanita chaparral. Chamise is dominant in the hottest, most xeric areas of the mountain, particularly on south- and west-facing slopes, while manzanita is dominant in other xeric areas, particularly on east-facing slopes and forest borders. Areas of mixed chamise-manzanita chaparral occur in relatively more mesic areas; \"Ceanothus\" and dwarfed interior live oak may also predominate on such sites. Areas in which various kinds of chaparral communities are dominant include areas along Old Railroad Grade.\n\nGrassland areas are also common on Mount Tamalpais. Native perennial bunchgrass species were originally dominant, but most of these grasslands are now dominated by invasive annual grasses of European origin. Native grasslands, still found in a few isolated areas, are of two types. Northern coastal prairie is found below the fog line and is characterized by a \"Festuca\"-\"Danthonia\" association, while valley grassland, found in drier areas, is dominated by \"Nassella pulchra\", with \"Elymus glaucus\" and \"Leymus triticoides\" also being common.\nWetland vegetation types found on Mount Tamalpais include coastal riparian forests, wet meadows, and some marsh areas. Coastal riparian forest is predominant along the valley streams of Mount Tamalpais. Red and white alder (\"Alnus rubra\" and \"Alnus rhombifolia\") and arroyo and yellow willow (\"Salix lasiolepis\" and \"S. lasiandra\") are dominant in these types of woodland, with bigleaf maple (\"Acer macrophyllum\"), box-elder (\"Acer negundo\" ssp. \"californicum\"), and California bay also being common. Wet meadows are present in several high-elevation spots on the mountain, while High Marsh represents a rare example of a marsh community on the mountain.\nSerpentine soils have a high rate of endemism and are the site of several unique subtypes of the above plant communities. Serpentine grasslands are some of the few grasslands in which native perennial grasses are still relatively dominant. Serpentine chaparral forms a unique plant community, dominated by dwarfed leather oak (\"Quercus durata\"), Jepson ceanothus (\"Ceanothus jepsonii\"), Tamalpais manzanita (\"\"), and Sargent cypress (\"Cupressus sargentii\"). On the upper slopes of the mountain, small groves of Sargent cypress trees up to 50 feet (15 m) tall can be found in serpentine areas.\n\nSeveral species of endemic plants are found only on serpentine soils; these species may be widespread, but only occur on serpentine soils, or the may be more restricted, only growing in a few other places besides Mount Tamalpais, or may even be restricted just to Mount Tamalpais. The Mount Tamalpais thistle (\"Cirsium hydrophilum\" var. \"vaseyi\"), for example, is a rare variety of thistle known only from the serpentine seeps of the mountain. The Mount Tamalpais jewelflower (\"Streptanthus batrachopus\") is also limited to the area.\n\nMount Tamalpais provides one of the last remaining wildlife refuges in the Bay Area. Urbanization has invaded wildlife habitat, forcing many fauna in southern Marin County to retreat up onto Mount Tamalpais, Muir Woods, and the Bolinas Ridge. A wide variety of avifauna, amphibians, arthropods and mammals are found on Mount Tamalpais, including a number of rare and endangered species. Nonetheless, Mt. Tamalpais and the neighboring Golden Gate Recreation Area together encompass over 115 square miles (298 square kilometers) of land, forming one of the largest preserved parklands located near a U.S. urban center.\n\nThe name \"Tamalpais\" was first recorded in 1845. It comes from the Coast Miwok name for this mountain, \"támal pájiṣ\", literally \"west hill\". Various different folk etymologies also exist, but they are unsubstantiated. One holds that it comes from the Spanish \"Tamal país\", meaning \"Tamal country,\" \"Tamal\" being the name that the Spanish missionaries gave to the Coast Miwok people. Another holds that the name is the Coast Miwok word for \"sleeping maiden\" and is taken from a \"Legend of the Sleeping Maiden.\" However, this legend actually has no basis in Coast Miwok myth and is instead a piece of Victorian-era apocrypha. Another suggests a tie to the Asian origins of the Miwoks, where \"pais\" means place and \"tamal\" is a tribe in Siberia.\n\nThe Coast Miwok are said to have believed that an evil witch dwelled at the top of Mount Tamalpais and therefore never set foot on the peak. However, it has been said the Miwoks only said this in order to keep settlers off the sacred mountain.\n\nTamalpais was home to the Mount Tamalpais and Muir Woods Railway, also known as \"The Crookedest Railroad in the World,\" a railroad which meandered its way up to the peak from downtown Mill Valley until a road was constructed to the peak, and automobiles gained popularity. The 8-mile standard-gauge railroad required geared steam locomotives and operated from 1896 to 1930.\n\nEarly wireless towers were constructed on the mountain in the early 20th century, only to be destroyed by one of the periodic hurricane-force windstorms.\n\nThe U.S. Weather Bureau operated a weather station at the site of the now defunct Mill Valley Air Force Station for many years.\n\nThe peak and its surrounding areas are the birthplace of mountain biking in the 1970s, where early mountain bikers such as Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly, and Joe Breeze were active.\n\nBritish philosopher Alan Watts owned a cabin on Mount Tamalpais later in his life where he ultimately died in his sleep of heart failure on November 16, 1973.\n\nIn 1979 and 1980, Mount Tamalpais was the scene of a series of murders of hikers carried out by serial killer David Carpenter, also known as the \"Trailside Killer.\"\nOn top of the East Peak is a fire lookout station, staffed during the summer months by volunteers with the Marin County Fire Department.\n\nMount Tamalpais is a hiking, picnicking, mountain and road cycling, horseback riding, and hang-gliding destination for residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, with over of trails and fire roads. With numerous trailheads, a well-networked trail and road system, and hikes of greatly varying length and difficulty, the mountain offers a compelling range of attractions. Marin Municipal Water District maintains several reservoirs on the north slopes of Mount Tamalpais, including Alpine Lake, Kent Lake, Bon Tempe Lake, Phoenix Lake, and Lake Lagunitas.\n\nThe western slopes of the mountain descend to the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach. The annual Dipsea Race traverses the mountain from Mill Valley to Stinson Beach. Though backpack camping isn't allowed, walk-in camping exists at the Pantoll and Bootjack campgrounds. The historic Bootjack Campground was originally established in the early 1920s by the Tamalpais Conservation Corps, and the Civilian Conservation Corps further refined the campground facilities in the\n1930s. Showing substantial signs of overuse, the campground was closed by State Parks in 1969. The Bootjack Campground and Trail were reopened on Thursday, June 5, 2014.\n\nTrailhead parking within Mt. Tamalpais State Park is available generally with a self-service fee ($8). The scenic Ridgecrest Blvd. running along the ridgeline between the Rock Spring trailhead and Fairfax-Bolinas Road, with panoramic views of the summit, Pacific, San Francisco, Bolinas, and Point Reyes, is featured in many automobile and other advertisements, as well as being the local hang-gliding launch point. Mount Tam is also home to the Edgewood Botanic Garden and to the Sidney B. Cushing Amphitheatre where Broadway musical productions are performed every year by the Mountain Play Association. Monthly astronomy viewings and lectures are held at Rock Spring and Mountain Theater April through October.\n\nSince the Mount Tamalpais area contains large expanses of undeveloped, natural land, there are many trails and trailheads that criss-cross the area. Many of these trails are used by hikers and bikers seeking refuge from the urban landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of these trails, including the mountaintop or ridgetop trails, have views of the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. Other trails, usually lower elevation valley trails, lead into natural, dense groves of mature Douglas-fir and redwood trees, clear, open grassland, and shrublands. All roads leading to the many trailheads around Mount Tamalpais are usually open, but during fire season some of these roads may be closed due to high fire risk.\n\nThe many roads, paved and unpaved, that cross the Mount Tamalpais region are used by mountain bikers, especially on weekends. Mount Tamalpais played a role in the birth of mountain biking many years ago. There has been considerable controversy over trail access for mountain bikes, both in terms of environmental impact and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles have been banned from the majority of narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are still allowed on fire roads. The fire roads on Mt. Tam are mixed-use and they are commonly used as running, hiking, biking and horseback riding routes.\n\nMount Tamalpais has been a common subject in California landscape painting. Painters who have made Tamalpais the subject of one or more paintings include Etel Adnan, Harry Cassie Best, Albert Bierstadt, Norton Bush, Russell Chatham, Edwin Deakin, Percy Gray, Ransome Gillett Holdridge, William Keith, Tom Killion, William Marple, William Birch McMurtrie, Gilbert Munger, Julian Rix, Frederick Schafer, Jules Tavernier, Nancy Wallace, Thaddeus Welch, Ludmilla Welch, Virgil Williams, Jack Wisby, Theodore Wores, and Raymond Dabb Yelland.\n\nBroadway musicals are performed outdoors, several times each summer, in the stone open air Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre on the southern side of Mt. Tam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Google Maps and nearly every map creating company use this technique to increase image quality. Pansharpening produces a high-resolution color image from three, four or more low-resolution multispectral satellite bands plus a corresponding high-resolution panchromatic band:\n\nSuch band combinations are commonly bundled in satellite data sets, for example Landsat 7, which includes six 30 m resolution multispectral bands, a 60 m thermal infrared band plus a 15 m resolution panchromatic band. SPOT, GeoEye and DigitalGlobe commercial data packages also commonly include both lower-resolution multispectral bands and a single panchromatic band. One of the principal reasons for configuring satellite sensors this way is to keep satellite weight, cost, bandwidth and complexity down. Pan sharpening uses spatial information in the high-resolution grayscale band and color information in the multispectral bands to create a high-resolution color image, essentially increasing the resolution of the color information in the data set to match that of the panchromatic band.\n\nOne common class of algorithms for pansharpening is called “component substitution,” which usually involves the following steps: \n\nCommon color-space transformation used for pan sharpening are HSI (hue-saturation-intensity), and YCbCr. The same steps can also be performed using wavelet decomposition or PCA and replacing the first component with the pan band.\n\nPan-sharpening techniques can result in spectral distortions when pan sharpening satellite images as a result of the nature of the panchromatic band. The Landsat panchromatic band for example is not sensitive to blue light. As a result, the spectral characteristics of the raw pansharpened color image may not exactly match those of the corresponding low-resolution RGB image, resulting in altered color tones. This has resulted in the development of many algorithms that attempt to reduce this spectral distortion and to produce visually pleasing images.\n"}

{"id": "226761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226761", "title": "Set and drift", "text": "Set and drift\n\nThe term “set and drift” is used to describe external forces that affect a boat and keep it from following an intended course. To understand and calculate set and drift, one needs to first understand currents. Ocean currents are the horizontal movements of water from one location to another. The movement of water is impacted by: meteorological effects, wind, temperature differences and gravity and on occasion earthquakes. Set is referred to as the current’s direction, expressed in true degrees, and the drift is referred to as the current’s speed, which is usually measured in knots. Ignoring set and drift can cause a mariner to get off their desired course, sometimes by hundreds of miles. A mariner needs to be able to steer the ship and compensate for the effects of set and drift upon their vessel while underway. A vessel’s actual course that is travels is referred to as the course over the ground and the current of the ocean alters this course whether pushing it away from its desired course of in the same direction. The vessel’s speed through the water is also referred to as the speed over the ground and the current can affect how fast or slow the vessel moves through the water.\n\nIn order to utilize set and drift in navigation, navigators much first set the course using Dead Reckoning.\n\nA Dead Reckoning, DR, is calculated by using a previously determined position on a chart, and advancing that position based on known or estimated speed over a set amount of time. This can be calculated by using the formula Speed = Distance / Time.\n\nOnce an advance position has been plotted, then set and drift can be factored in. If there is a known set and drift, then the corrections can be applied to the Dead Reckoning position to then get an Estimated Position on a chart.\n\nThe Course Made Good is the direction in which a ship or vessel has traveled with the effects of current, wind, and helmsman ship. If a current is flowing in the same direction as the ships heading, then the Course Made Good remains the same, but the current speed and ship speed are added together. If the speeds are in opposite directions, then the smaller speed is subtracted from the larger speed. If a vessel runs directly against a current or directly with a current, the speed of the vessel and speed of the current can be added or subtracted from each other. Such as, a vessel has a speed of 8 knots through the water and the vessel is traveling with the current, which is at 2 knots, then the speed over ground is 8+2 and the vessel’s true speed is 10 knots. \n\nSet and Drift can be calculated by using a vector diagram and can be drawn and measured on a chart, maneuvering board or even a plain piece of paper.\n\nYou are underway on course 150 degrees true at 8 knots. Your vessel is making good a course of 166 degrees true and a speed made good of 8.8 knots. What is your set and drift? \n\nStep 1. Plot out course of 150 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet\n\nStep 2. Measure length of course by using speed of 8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale\n\nStep 3. Plot the length of speed on Radar Plotting sheet\n\nStep 4. Plot out desired course of 166 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet\n\nStep 5. Measure length of course by using speed of 8.8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale\n\nStep 6. Connect the two ends of the vectors from the current course to the course made good. Thus creating your set and drift vector\n\nStep 7. Using the navigational triangle, place on set and drift vector. Then drag to center crosshairs keeping the same angle and find the degrees on the outer circle\n\nStep 8. Measure the length of the set and drift vector with the compass. Convert from nautical miles into knots using the time, speed, and distance scale.\n\nStep 9. Your set is 230 degrees true at a drift of 2.5 knots\n\nTo use Navigation Triangles, a navigator need two of them to be able to navigate correctly. Navigation Triangles can be used to find Lines of Positions, Dead Reckoning, ranges, Estimated Positions, Running Fixes and so on. They are also used to connect all the types of fixes to be able to determine a course.\n\nDividers can be used for the measurement of lengths of lines on a chart and approximating the lengths of non-linear lines on a chart. Dividers can also be turned into a compass by replacing the metal leg of the divider with a piece of lead. A compass can measure and draw arc and circles on charts and maneuvering boards.\n"}

{"id": "29501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29501", "title": "Sustainable development", "text": "Sustainable development\n\nSustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.\n\nWhile the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 Brundtland Report, it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on economic development, social development and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that \"the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability\". The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the natural resources and ecosystem, the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).\n\nThe concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a non-renewable resource, since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.\n\nSustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems. Sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. Sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.\n\nSustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, John Evelyn argued that \"sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources\" in his 1662 essay \"Sylva\". In 1713 Hans Carl von Carlowitz, a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published \"Sylvicultura oeconomica\", a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield. His work influenced others, including Alexander von Humboldt and Georg Ludwig Hartig, eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like Gifford Pinchot, first head of the US Forest Service, whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and Aldo Leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s.\n\nFollowing the publication of Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\" in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. Kenneth E. Boulding in his influential 1966 essay \"The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth\" identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources. One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the Club of Rome in 1972 in its classic report on the \"Limits to Growth\", written by a group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Describing the desirable \"state of global equilibrium\", the authors wrote: \"We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people.\"\n\nFollowing the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on \"Growth and Its Implication for the Future\" (Roundtable Press, 1973) for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. William Flynn Martin, David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman John Dingell.\n\nIn 1980 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term \"sustainable development\". Two years later, the United Nations World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged. In 1987 the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released the report \"Our Common Future\", commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.\n\nSince the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of \"socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth\". In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development published the Earth Charter, which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan Agenda 21 for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.\n\nUnder the principles of the United Nations Charter the Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, social development and environmental protection. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education, public health, and standard of living.\n\nA 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.\n\nIn September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the \"universal, integrated and transformative\" 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.\n\nSustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979. It has also been worded as \"economic, environmental and social\" or \"ecology, economy and equity\". This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance, or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture, thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.\n\nThe ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural, social and built environments. Also termed human ecology, this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health. Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development; addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which, in this sense, extends to all species.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since natural resources are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change, and lists options for adaptation and mitigation. Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).\n\nAn unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support. If the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity.\n\nIntegral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy, which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.\n\nPollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons. When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons. So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.\n\nSo, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public. Once again, this issue needs to be addressed. Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way. So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.\n\nSustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted. Elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture, agroforestry, mixed farming, multiple cropping, and crop rotation. It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). \n\nNumerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist, including organic certification, Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, UTZ Certified, Bird Friendly, and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C).\n\nIt has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation, environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets, called natural capital. Economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product. This model of unlimited personal and GDP growth may be over. Sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption.\nAccording to ecological economist , ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of intergenerational equity, irreversibility of environmental change, uncertainty of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.\n\nAs early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy \"in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems\". Scientists in many fields have highlighted \"The Limits to Growth\", and economists have presented alternatives, for example a 'steady-state economy'; to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet. In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study \"The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development\", where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.\n\nA World Bank study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in macroeconomics or purely environmental. Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.\n\nThe study, \"Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms\", found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, intergenerational equity, and dynamic efficiency.\n\nBut Gilbert Rist points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: \"From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies.\"\n\nThe World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts. Herman Daly, an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:\nWhen authors of \"WDR\" '92 [the highly influential 1992 \"World Development Report\" that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of \"win-win\" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not \"win-wins.\" But they want to see a world of \"win-wins\" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because \"WDR\"s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work...\"\n\nA meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of \"sustainability policies\". A study in 2004 asked if we consume too much. A study concluded in 2007 that knowledge, manufactured and human capital (health and education) has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world. It has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making, as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics. A meta review in 2009 identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change, and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare. According to free-market environmentalist John Baden \"the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights\". They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment. The State can in this context \"create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment\".\n\nMisum, Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at Stockholm School of Economics, aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors on Sustainable Markets. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.\n\nThe total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.\n\nAs countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good. In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.\n\nBenefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action. Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.\n\nSustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution. Solar energy is commonly used on public parking meters, street lights and the roof of buildings. Wind power has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%. Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities, and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system. These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.\nOverall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.\n\nMain article: Green manufacturing and Distributed manufacturing\n\nOne of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as appropriate technology, which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist E. F. Schumacher in his influential work, \"Small is Beautiful.\" and now covers a wide range of technologies. Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered. Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles, which have led to open-source appropriate technology (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet. OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development.\n\nTransportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation. Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.\n\nSustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), sustainable transport can help create jobs, improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways, make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets, making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.\n\nSome Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations. An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg, Germany. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.\n\nSince many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars. Therefore, California, is one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:\n\n\nOther states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies.\n\nThe most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital. This eco-efficiency is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact. This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) under the following definition: \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).\n\nSimilar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.\n\nBoth eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.\n\nCASI Global, New York \"CSR & Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company.\" http://casiglobal.us/\n\nAt the present time, sustainable development can reduce poverty. Sustainable development reduces poverty through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.\n\nIn sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and International Style architecture, as well as opposing to solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl, with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints. Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.)\n\nA study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making. The International Institute for Sustainable Development has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.\n\nThe United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:\n\n\nThis accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).\n\nWorking with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the Agenda 21 for culture and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement \"Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development\", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders – 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The Circles of Sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.\n\nOther organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence \"Sustainable Development in a Diverse World\", sponsored by the European Union, integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at UNESCO Vito Di Bari in his manifesto of art and architectural movement Neo-Futurism, whose name was inspired by the 1987 United Nations’ report Our Common Future. The Circles of Sustainability approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development, which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the Sustainable Development Goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the World Wide Fund for Nature's definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006. Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nIn 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: \"While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them.\" Nevertheless, a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible. Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).\n\nThe most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources. However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?\n\nThe Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise. Furthermore, this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources.\n\nReasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.\n\nRecent research efforts created also the SDEWES Index to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The SDEWES Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.\n\nThe sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, for example, points to the fact that natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.\n\nAnother problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The loss of biodiversity, for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates. Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.\n\nIf the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality.\n\n\"Main page: Education for sustainable development\"\n\nEducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’\n\nHigher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.\nCorporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability. \nReference\nhttps://www.wharton.upenn.edu/\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/\nhttp://casiglobal.us/\n\nIt has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.\n\nIn the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the Brundtland Commission's report on \"Our Common Future\" when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application. In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.\n\nBut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like minerals). This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial recycling effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.\"\n\nIn effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.\n\nOne critic has argued that the Brundtland Commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of \"sustainable development\" attached as a public relations slogan: The report on \"Our Common Future\" was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to , the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed \"a change in the \"quality\" of growth\". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide.\n\n\n"}

A few small parks are sprinkled through the neighbourhood; Adam Smith Square and Siegert Square are the two largest. The Community Association held a series of events in August 2011 to celebrate its 100th anniversary.\n\nJust north of Woodbrook along Tragarete Road is the Queen's Park Oval, a major Test cricket ground, which is owned by the private Queen's Park Cricket Club (QPCC). At Woodbrook's western end, at the edge of Invaders Bay, is the Hasely Crawford Stadium, the national venue for football and track and field events.\n\nOne of the larger and older green spaces in Woodbrook is Adam Smith Square. This square is located on Ariapita Avenue in close proximity to Murray Street and was one of the parks of the old days. Adam Smith Square is surrounded by residences which have been restored and modified, many of which now function as business places.\n\nIn the weeks preceding Carnival each year, the look of the square changes as stadium style benches are built up by one of the City Corporations. On Carnival Monday and Tuesday, this square is one of the judging points for mas Bands which elect to cross the stage at this location.\n\nOutside of Carnival, the square functions as a time-out spot as persons sit on benches while visiting any of the businesses in the neighbourhood. On weekends several young families bring their toddlers and young children to the square to run, play and get in some exercise and bonding time prior to the start of the next week.\n\nIn 2015, Adam Smith Square was one of the outdoor locations for a community cinema.\n"}
