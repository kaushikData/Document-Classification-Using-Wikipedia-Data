It was formerly a sub-district in Bilad al-Sham during the 7th–11th centuries CE.\n\nIn modern-day Jordan, the region of Al-Sharat starts immediately south of Wadi Mujib. The northern range contains mountains with peaks up to 1,200 meters above sea level, while to the south the mountains get as high as 1,500 meters above sea level. The principal city of Bilad al-Sharat is al-Karak. The northern part of the region in Jordan is under the administration of the Karak Governorate, while the more arid part south of Wadi Arabah comes under the Ma'an Governorate.\n\nIn the 9th century, Al-Sharat's capital was Adhruh, but by the late 10th century, it apparently was replaced by Sughar (Zoar). Other principal towns in the district included Tabuk, Ma'an (Mu'an), Madyan, Aynunah (on the northern Red Sea coast), Wayla (Ayla) and Maab (Rabba).\n\nFrom the beginning of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, Al-Sharat formed the southern \"kurah\" (district) of \"Jund Dimashq\" (Province of Damascus), until the late 9th century, after which it became part of \"Jund Filastin\" (Province of Palestine). It was the Tulunids who first attached Al-Sharat to Filastin for practical purposes, as the district was closer to Filastin than Damascus. In 985, during the late Abbasid period, the Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi described Al-Sharat as its own district, neither belonging to Dimashq nor Filastin, in the larger province of \"Ash-Shaam\" (, the 'Syria' or 'Levant').\n\nThe district of Al-Sharat corresponded with the mountains of Moab. Persian geographer Al-Istakhri (d. 957) described the district as \"extremely fertile and rich\" and dominated by marauding Bedouin tribes. In the late 10th century, the old-established Yamani tribes of Lakhm and Judham were engaged in a struggle over dominance of Al-Sharat with newcomers from the tribe of Tayy. Though information about the Fatimid administration over the Levant is vague, Caliph al-Aziz (975–996) may have made Al-Sharat (south of Wadi Mujib) its own province which lasted until the Crusader invasion in the early 12th century.\n\nThe Crusaders annexed Al-Sharat in the 1110s. Initially, it was part of the royal demesne of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1126, the feudal lordship of Oultrejordain was formed out of the former district of Al-Sharat. Its jurisdiction extended from the Zarqa River in the north to the Red Sea in the south. The Crusaders built the fortresses of Montreal (Shawbak) in 1115 and Crac (al-Karak) in 1145. Both became major centers of the lordship. By the mid-12th century, the inhabitants of Al-Sharat were mainly Bedouin from various Qaysi tribes. At that time, the Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi (d. 1165) wrote about the fertility of the district and that it produced an abundance of olives, almonds, figs, grapes and pomegranates.\n\nBilad al-Sharat was conquered by the Ayyubids under Saladin in 1187. During Ayyubid rule, Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229) noted that Al-Sharat was a mountainous region through which the Hajj caravan road from Damascus to Mecca passed. During Mamluk rule, Al-Sharat became \"Mamlakat al-Karak\" (Province of al-Karak). By the mid-19th century, Bedouin from the Huwaytat tribe were encroaching into the southern parts of Bilad al-Sharat, and amid the Bedouin-induced anarchy in the region, Christians from Tafilah and al-Karak began fleeing to the north. During that time, Bilad al-Sharat, with the exception of Aqaba, was largely part of the Ottoman district of Mutassarifyya al-Karak.\n\n"}
{"id": "276825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276825", "title": "Apparent wind", "text": "Apparent wind\n\nApparent wind is the wind experienced by a moving object.\n\nThe \"apparent wind\" is the wind experienced by an observer in motion and is the relative velocity of the wind in relation to the observer.\n\nThe \"velocity of the apparent wind\" is the vector sum of the \"velocity of the headwind\" (which is the velocity a moving object would experience in still air) plus the \"velocity of the true wind\". The headwind is the additive inverse of the object's velocity; therefore, the \"velocity of the apparent wind\" can also be defined as a vector sum of the \"velocity of the true wind\" minus the \"velocity of the object\".\n\nIn sailing, \"apparent wind\" is the speed and direction of wind indicated by a wind instrument (anemometer) on a \"moving\" craft (on water, land or ice) in undisturbed air. It is composed of the \"combined\" speeds and directions of the craft and wind observed by a \"stationary\" wind instrument—the \"true wind\". A true wind coming from the bow increases the apparent wind induced by the speed of the craft, coming from the stern it decreases apparent wind, and coming from the side the apparent wind angle and speed change according to the combined speed and direction of each the craft and the true wind. Apparent wind is important to sailors in order to set sail angle with respect to the wind and to anticipate how much power the wind will generate on a point of sail. Apparent wind differs in speed and direction from the true wind that is experienced by a stationary observer and composed of the true wind speed (TWS) and true wind direction (TWD) or the TWS and true wind angle (TWA) relative to the boat if it were stationary.\nIn nautical terminology, apparent wind is measured in knots and degrees.\n\nNote that a number of additional factors come into play when converting the measurements from the masthead anemometer into the true wind if a high degree of accuracy is required, including the following:\n\nIn the presence of a current, the true wind is considered to be that measured on the craft drifting with the water over the bottom, and wind with respect to the sea bed as the \"ground\" or \"geographical wind\".\n\nThe apparent wind on board (a boat) is often quoted as a speed measured by a masthead transducer containing an anemometer and wind vane that measures wind speed in knots and wind direction in degrees relative to the heading of the boat. Modern instrumentation can calculate the true wind velocity when the apparent wind and boat speed and direction are input.\n\nIn sailboat racing, and especially in speed sailing, apparent wind is a vital factor, when determining the points of sail a sailboat can effectively travel in. \nA vessel traveling at increasing speed relative to the \"prevailing wind\" will encounter the wind driving the sail at a decreasing angle and increasing velocity. Eventually, the increased drag and diminished degree of efficiency of a sail at extremely low angles will cause a loss of accelerating force. This constitutes the main limitation to the speed of wind-driven vessels and vehicles.\n\nWindsurfers and certain types of boats are able to sail faster than the true wind. These include fast multihulls and some planing monohulls. Ice-sailors and land-sailors also usually fall into this category, because of their relatively low amount of drag or friction.\n\nIn the foiling AC72 America's cup catamarans, the boats sail through the water at up to double the environmental wind strength. The effect of this is to radically change the apparent wind direction when sailing \"downwind\". In these boats the forward speed is so great that the apparent wind is always forward—at an angle that varies between 2 and 4 degrees to the wing sail. This means that AC72's are effectively tacking downwind, although at a greater angle than the normal 45-degree upwind angle, usually between 50 and 70 degrees.\n\nIn fixed-wing aircraft, apparent wind is what is experienced on board, and it determines the necessary speeds for take-off and landing. Aircraft carriers generally steam directly upwind at maximum speed, in order to increase apparent wind and reduce the necessary take-off velocity. Land-based airport traffic, as well as most mid-sized and large birds generally take off and land facing upwind for the same reason.\n\nformula_1\n\nWhere:\nThe above formula is derived from the Law of cosines and using formula_6.\n\nThe angle of apparent wind (formula_7) can be calculated from the measured velocity of the boat and wind using the inverse cosine in degrees (formula_8)\n\nformula_9\n\nIf the velocity of the boat and the velocity and the angle of the apparent wind are known, for instance from a measurement, the true wind velocity and direction can be calculated with:\n\nformula_10\n\nand\n\nformula_11\n\n\"Note:\" Due to quadrant ambiguity, this equation for formula_12 is only valid when the apparent winds are coming from the starboard direction (0° < \"β\" < 180°). For port apparent winds (180° < \"β\" < 360° or 0° > \"β\" > -180°), the true pointing angle (\"α\") has the opposite sign:\n\nformula_13\n\n"}
{"id": "3426153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3426153", "title": "Aquatic biomonitoring", "text": "Aquatic biomonitoring\n\nAquatic biomonitoring is the science of inferring the ecological condition of rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands by examining the organisms that live there. While aquatic biomonitoring is the most common form of such biomonitoring, any ecosystem can be studied in this manner.\n\nBiomonitoring typically takes different approaches:\n\n\nAquatic invertebrates have the longest history of use in biomonitoring programs. In typical unpolluted temperate streams of Europe and North America, certain insect taxa predominate. Mayflies (Ephemeroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), and stoneflies (Plecoptera) are the most common insects in these undisturbed streams. In rivers disturbed by urbanization, agriculture, forestry, and other perturbations, flies (Diptera), and especially midges (family Chironomidae) predominate. Aquatic invertebrates are responsive to climate change.\n\nAquatic Biomonitoring is important in monitoring marine life and their ecosystems. Monitoring aquatic life can also be beneficial in understanding land ecosystems as well. Before there were tetrapods, there were fish. These fish then evolved into tetrapods that we see today. Because of this, aquatic life still has a major impact on life on land. Aquatic biomonitoring can represent the overall health and status of the environment, detect different environmental trends and how different stressors will affect those trends, and interpret the affect of different environmental activity will have on the overall health of the environment. Pollution and general stresses to aquatic life can have a huge impact on the environment in general. The main sources of pollution to oceans, rivers, and lakes are sewage, oil spills, land runoff, littering, ocean mining, and nuclear waste. These types of pollution cause a huge upset to marine life and can endanger any species in the water or that live close to the water. When aquatic species are affected, it causes a ripple effect. Many aquatic animals are a main food source for many land animals. For example: if a specific species of fish ingest toxins and become sick, the birds that ingest that species of fish will also become sick. Then the animal that ingest that bird will also become sick. This is a problem that can be avoided by monitoring all life and conditions in different bodies of water, including fresh and salt water.\n\nThe main draw back on aquatic biomonitoring is simplifying data and making data easier for all to understand. Taking data from monitoring sites and making it available for people to use in the health fields and other environmental fields can be a challenge.\n\nMechanisms that are used for Aquatic Biomonitoring are monitoring and assessing aquatic species and ecosystems, monitoring the behavior of certain aquatic species and assessing any changes in species behavior, and looking at contaminants in the water and their effect on marine life. Water is graded on several scales. One is the water’s appearance. Is the water clear, cloudy, full of algae. Next, water is graded on its chemistry levels. How much of each enzyme or mineral located in the water is extremely important. Any changes in any of these factors can change the water’s environment overall and therefore change how life in the water is. These changes can severely impact aquatic life. Certain contaminants, such as metal and certain organic waste, can cause death of some individuals and which could ultimately cause extinction to certain species. This would be detrimental to not only aquatic ecosystems, but also to some ecosystems on land as well. Extinction of any species can have a ripple effect and can cause disruption in other biomes and ecosystems.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42282764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42282764", "title": "Arctic ice pack", "text": "Arctic ice pack\n\nThe Arctic ice pack is the sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean and its vicinity. The Arctic ice pack undergoes a regular seasonal cycle in which ice melts in spring and summer, reaches a minimum around mid-September, then increases during fall and winter. Summer ice cover in the Arctic is about 50% of winter cover. Some of the ice survives from one year to the next. Currently 28% of Arctic basin sea ice is multi-year ice, thicker than seasonal ice: up to thick over large areas, with ridges up to thick. As well as the regular seasonal cycle there has been an underlying trend of declining sea ice in the Arctic in recent decades.\n\nSea ice has an important effect on the heat balance of the polar oceans, since it insulates the (relatively) warm ocean from the much colder air above, thus reducing heat loss from the oceans. Sea ice is highly reflective of solar radiation, reflecting about 60% of incoming solar radiation when bare and about 80% when covered with snow. This is due to a feedback known as the albedo effect. This is much greater than the reflectivity of the sea (about 10%) and thus the ice also affects the absorption of sunlight at the surface.\n\nThe sea ice cycle is also an important source of dense (saline) \"bottom water\". When sea water freezes it leaves most of its salt content behind. The remaining surface water, made dense by the extra salinity, sinks and produces dense water masses such as North Atlantic Deep Water. This production of dense water is essential in maintaining the thermohaline circulation, and the accurate representation of these processes is important in climate modelling.\n\nIn the Arctic, a key area where pancake ice forms the dominant ice type over an entire region is the so-called Odden ice tongue in the Greenland Sea. The Odden (the word is Norwegian for \"the headland\") grows eastward from the main East Greenland ice edge in the vicinity of 72–74°N during the winter because of the presence of very cold polar surface water in the Jan Mayen Current, which diverts some water eastward from the East Greenland Current at that latitude. Most of the old ice continues south, driven by the wind, so a cold open water surface is exposed on which new ice forms as frazil and pancake in the rough seas.\n\nRecords of Arctic Sea ice from the United Kingdom’s Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research go back to the turn of the 20th century, although the quality of the data before 1950 is debatable. Reliable measurements of sea ice edge begin within the satellite era. From the late 1970s, the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on Seasat (1978) and Nimbus 7 (1978–87) satellites provided information that was independent of solar illumination or meteorological conditions. The frequency and accuracy of passive microwave measurements improved with the launch of the DMSP F8 Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI) in 1987. Both the sea ice area and extent are estimated, with the latter being larger, as it is defined as the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice.\n\nA modeling study of the 52-year period from 1947 to 1999 found a statistically significant trend in Arctic ice volume of −3% per decade; splitting this into wind-forced and temperature forced components shows it to be essentially all caused by the temperature forcing. A computer-based, time-resolved calculation of sea ice volume, fitted to various measurements, revealed that monitoring the ice volume is much more significant for evaluating sea ice loss than pure area considerations.\n\nThe trends from 1979 to 2002 have been a statistically significant Arctic sea ice decrease of −2.5% ± 0.9% per decade during those 23 years. Climate models simulated this trend in 2002. The September minimum ice extent trend for 1979–2011 declined by 12.0% per decade during 32 years. In 2007 the minimum extent fell by more than a million square kilometers, the biggest decline since accurate satellite data has been available, to . New research shows the Arctic Sea ice to be melting faster than predicted by any of the 18 computer models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in preparing its 2007 assessments. In 2012, a new record low of about was reached.\n\nIn the overall mass balance, the volume of sea ice depends on the thickness of the ice as well as the areal extent. While the satellite era has enabled better measurement of trends in areal extent, accurate ice thickness measurements remain a challenge. \"Nonetheless, the extreme loss of this summer’s sea ice cover and the slow onset of freeze-up portends lower than normal ice extent throughout autumn and winter, and the ice that grows back is likely to be fairly thin\". As more and more of the sea ice is thinner first-year ice the greater effect storms have on its stability with turbulence resulting from major extratropical cyclones resulting in extensive fractures of sea ice.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3708", "title": "Brussels", "text": "Brussels\n\nBrussels ( ; ), officially the Brussels-Capital Region (, ), is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels, which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the Flemish Region (in which it forms an enclave) and the Walloon Region. Brussels is the most densely populated and the richest region in Belgium in terms of GDP per capita. It covers , a relatively small area compared to the two other regions, and has a population of 1.2 million. The metropolitan area of Brussels counts over 2.1 million people, which makes it the largest in Belgium. It is also part of a large conurbation extending towards Ghent, Antwerp, Leuven and Walloon Brabant, home to over 5 million people.\n\nBrussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river Senne to become an important city-region in Europe. Since the end of the Second World War, it has been a major centre for international politics and the home of numerous international organisations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Brussels is the \"de facto\" capital of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions (the two other capitals are Luxembourg and Strasbourg)<ref name=\"12010E/PRO/06\"></ref> and its name is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions. The secretariat of the Benelux and headquarters of NATO are also located in Brussels. As the economic capital of Belgium and one of the top financial centres of Western Europe with Euronext Brussels, it is classified as an \"Alpha\" global city. Brussels is a hub for rail, road and air traffic, sometimes earning the moniker \"Crossroads of Europe\". The Brussels Metro is the only rapid transit system in Belgium. In addition, both its airport and railway stations are the largest and busiest in the country.\n\nHistorically Dutch-speaking, Brussels saw a language shift to French from the late 19th century. The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual in Dutch and French, even though French is now the \"de facto\" main language with over 90% of the population speaking it. Brussels is also increasingly becoming multilingual. English is spoken as a second language by nearly a third of the population and a large number of migrants and expatriates speak other languages.\n\nBrussels is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, as well as its historical and architectural landmarks; some of them are registered as UNESCO World Heritage sites. Main attractions include its historic Grand Place, Manneken Pis, Atomium, and cultural institutions such as La Monnaie and the Museums of Art and History. It is also a capital of the comic strip.\n\nThe most common theory of the origin of the name \"Brussels\" is that it derives from the Old Dutch , \"Broekzele\" or \"Broeksel\", meaning \"marsh\" (\"bruoc\" / \"broek\") and \"home\" (\"sella\" / \"zele\" / \"sel\") or \"home in the marsh\". Saint Vindicianus, the bishop of Cambrai, made the first recorded reference to the place \"Brosella\" in 695, when it was still a hamlet. The names of all the municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region are also of Dutch origin, except for Evere, which is Celtic.\n\nIn French, \"Bruxelles\" is pronounced (the \"x\" is pronounced , like in English) and in Dutch, \"Brussel\" is pronounced . Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as \"Bruxellois\" and in Dutch as \"Brusselaars\". In the Brabantian dialect of Brussels, they are called \"Brusseleers\" or \"Brusseleirs\".\n\nOriginally, the written \"x\" noted the group . In the Belgian French pronunciation as well as in Dutch, the \"k\" eventually disappeared and \"z\" became \"s\", as reflected in the current Dutch spelling, whereas in the more conservative French form, the spelling remained. The pronunciation in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels' usage. In France, the pronunciations and (for \"bruxellois\") are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium.\n\nThe history of Brussels is closely linked to that of Western Europe. Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age, with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of megaliths, dolmens and standing stones (\"Plattesteen\", \"Tomberg\"). During late antiquity, the region was home to Roman occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered near the centre. Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, it was incorporated into the Frankish Empire.\n\nThe origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in Saint Gaugericus' construction of a chapel on an island in the river Senne around 580. The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia transferred the relics of Saint Gudula from Moorsel to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.\n\nLambert I of Leuven, Count of Leuven, gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the Senne, on an important trade route between Bruges and Ghent, and Cologne, Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (\"Treurenberg\", \"Coudenberg\" and \"Sablon\" areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula (1225), replacing an older Romanesque church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became Dukes of Brabant. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire. In the early 13th century, Brussels got its first walls, and after this, the city grew significantly. To let the city expand, a second set of walls was erected, between 1356 and 1383. Traces of it can still be seen today, mostly because the \"small ring\", a series of roadways bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.\n\nIn the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress Margaret III of Flanders with Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of Valois (namely Antoine, their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold perished in the Battle of Nancy. Through the marriage of his daughter Mary of Burgundy (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, the Low Countries fell under Habsburg sovereignty. Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous Burgundian Netherlands, also known as the Seventeen Provinces, and flourished. After the death of Mary in 1482, her son Philip the Handsome succeeded as Duke of Brabant. In 1506, he became King of Castile, and hence the period of the Spanish Netherlands began.\n\nIn 1516, Charles V, who had been heir of the Low Countries since 1506, was declared King of Spain in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula. Upon the death of his grandfather Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, Charles became the new ruler of the Habsburg Empire and was subsequently elected Holy Roman Emperor. It was in the Palace complex at Coudenberg that Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731. In the 17th century, the city was a capital of the lace industry.\n\nIn 1695, during the Nine Years' War, King Louis XIV of France sent troops to bombard Brussels with artillery. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The Grand Place was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings – a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of the city centre, effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed its appearance and left numerous traces still visible today.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the Austrian Netherlands. Brussels was captured by France in 1746, during the War of the Austrian Succession, but was handed back to Austria three years later. It remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France, and became the capital of the department of the Dyle. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of Napoleon on the battlefield of Waterloo, located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the Congress of Vienna, the Southern Netherlands joined the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, under William I of Orange. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.\n\nIn 1830, the Belgian revolution took place in Brussels, after a performance of Auber's opera \"La Muette de Portici\" at La Monnaie theatre. The city became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply Brabant, with Brussels as its administrative centre. On 21 July 1831, Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.\n\nFollowing independence, Brussels underwent many more changes. It became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies put into orbit by the Société Générale de Belgique. The Industrial Revolution and the building of the Brussels-Charleroi Canal brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The Free University of Brussels was established in 1834. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked the municipality of Molenbeek with Mechelen.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The Senne had become a serious health hazard, and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of mayor Jules Anspach, its entire course through the urban area was completely covered over. This allowed urban renewal and the construction of modern buildings of \"hausmannien\" style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the Brussels Stock Exchange (1873), the Palace of Justice (1883) and Saint Mary's Royal Church (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of King Leopold II. The International Exposition of 1897 contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's Royal Museum for Central Africa), in the suburb of Tervuren, was connected to the capital by the construction of an 11-km long grand alley.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the Solvay Conference on Physics and on Chemistry, and three world fairs: the Brussels International Exposition of 1910, the Brussels International Exposition of 1935 and the Expo '58. During World War I, Brussels was an occupied city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During World War II, it was again occupied by German forces, and spared major damage, before it was liberated by the British Guards Armoured Division on 3 September 1944. The Brussels Airport, in the suburb of Zaventem, dates from the occupation.\n\nAfter the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernisation. The construction of the North–South connection, linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first \"premetro\" was finished in 1969, and the first line of the metro was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the \"de facto\" capital of what would become the European Union, and many modern buildings were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of \"Brusselisation\".\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989, after a constitutional reform in 1988. It is one of the three federal regions of Belgium, along with Flanders and Wallonia, and has bilingual status. The yellow iris is the emblem of the region (referring to the presence of these flowers on the original site of the city) and a stylised version in shown on its official flag.\n\nIn recent years, Brussels has become an important venue for international events. In 2000, it and eight other European cities were named European Capital of Culture. In 2014, the city hosted the 40th G7 summit.\n\nOn 22 March 2016, three coordinated nail bombings were detonated by ISIL in Brussels – two at Brussels Airport in Zaventem and one at Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station – resulting in 32 victims and three suicide bombers killed, and 330 people were injured. It was the deadliest act of terrorism in Belgium.\n\nBrussels lies in the north-central part of Belgium, about from the Belgian coast and about from the southern tip of Belgium. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about south of Antwerp (Flanders), and north of Charleroi (Wallonia). Its average elevation is above sea level, varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered Senne, which cuts the region from east to west, up to high points in the Sonian Forest, at the southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the Maalbeek and the Woluwe, to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. Brussels' central boulevards are above sea level. The highest point lies at a height of about , near \"Place de l'Altitude Cent\"/\"Hoogte Honderdplein\", in Forest.\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Brussels experiences an oceanic climate (Cfb). Proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements over the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the highest totals for any European capital. Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. The city also often experiences violent thunderstorms.\n\nDespite its name, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of Belgium. Article 194 of the Belgian Constitution establishes that the capital of Belgium is the City of Brussels, the municipality in the region that is the city's core.\n\nThe City of Brussels is the location of many national institutions. The Royal Palace, where the King of Belgium exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside the Brussels Park (not to be confused with the Royal Castle of Laeken, the official home of the Belgian Royal Family). The Palace of the Nation is located on the opposite side of this park, and is the seat of the Belgian Federal Parliament. The office of the Prime Minister of Belgium, colloquially called \"Law Street 16\" (Dutch: \"Wetstraat 16\", French: \"16, rue de la Loi\"), is located adjacent to this building. It is also where the Council of Ministers holds its meetings. The Court of Cassation, Belgium's main court, has its seat in the Palace of Justice. Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the Constitutional Court, the Council of State, the Court of Audit, the Royal Belgian Mint and the National Bank of Belgium.\n\nThe City of Brussels is also the capital of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community. The Flemish Parliament and Flemish Government have their seats in Brussels, and so do the Parliament of the French Community and the Government of the French Community.\n\nThe 19 municipalities (communes) of the Brussels-Capital Region are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.\n\nIn 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region. Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975. However, several municipalities outside the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the City of Brussels throughout its history, including Laeken, Haren and Neder-Over-Heembeek, which were merged into the City of Brussels in 1921.\n\nThe largest in area and population of the municipalities is the City of Brussels, covering and with 145,917 inhabitants. The least populous is Koekelberg with 18,541 inhabitants; the smallest in area is Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, which is only but still has the highest population density in the region, with . Watermael-Boitsfort has the lowest population density in the region, with .\n\nThere is much controversy on the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanised region, which is considered as (half of) one city by most people. Some politicians mock the '19 baronies' and want to merge the municipalities under one city council and one mayor. That would lower the number of politicians needed to govern Brussels, and centralise the power over the city to make decisions easier, thus reduce the overall running costs. The current municipalities could be transformed into districts with limited responsibilities, similar to the current structure of Antwerp or to structures of other capitals like the boroughs in London or \"arrondissements\" in Paris, to keep politics close enough to the citizen.\n\nAs of early 2016, Sint-Jans-Molenbeek held a reputation as a safe haven for jihadists in relation to the support shown by some residents towards the bombers who carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks.\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside the Walloon Region and the Flemish Region. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual enclave in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the French Community or the Flemish Community for matters such as culture and education, as well as a Common Community for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and social welfare.\n\nSince the splitting of Brabant in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the provinces of Belgium, nor is it subdivided into provinces itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Remaining is only the governor of Brussels-Capital and some aides, analogously to provinces. Its status is roughly akin to that of a federal district.\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a parliament of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking – parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a minister-president, four ministers and three state secretaries. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: \"ordonnances\", Dutch: \"ordonnanties\"), which have equal status as a national legislative act.\n\n19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium, and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the Flemish Parliament. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.\n\nBefore the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the \"Brussels Agglomeration\". The \"Brussels Agglomeration\" was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.\n\nThe \"Brussels Agglomeration\" had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.\n\nAfter the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the \"Brussels Agglomeration\" was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.\n\nThe French Community and the Flemish Community exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French: \"Commission communautaire française\" or \"COCOF\") and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: \"Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie\" or \"VGC\"). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nThe French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.\n\nA bi-communitarian public authority, the Common Community Commission (French: \"Commission communautaire commune, COCOM\", Dutch: \"Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC\") also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers – not the secretaries of state – of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.\n\nBrussels has, since World War II, become the administrative centre of many international organisations. The European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the World Customs Organization and EUROCONTROL, as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts, also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world. The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has, for example, led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in Washington D.C. International schools have also been established to serve this presence. The \"international community\" in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people. In 2009, there were an estimated 286 lobbying consultancies known to work in Brussels.\n\nBrussels serves as \"de facto\" capital of the European Union, hosting the major political institutions of the Union. The EU has not declared a capital formally, though the Treaty of Amsterdam formally gives Brussels the seat of the European Commission (the executive branch of government) and the Council of the European Union (a legislative institution made up from executives of member states). It locates the formal seat of European Parliament in Strasbourg, where votes take place, with the Council, on the proposals made by the Commission. However, meetings of political groups and committee groups are formally given to Brussels, along with a set number of plenary sessions. Three quarters of Parliament sessions now take place at its Brussels hemicycle. Between 2002 and 2004, the European Council also fixed its seat in the city. In 2014, the Union hosted a G7 summit in the city.\n\nBrussels, along with Luxembourg and Strasbourg, began to host European institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the \"European Quarter\", in the east of the city. Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled, with little planning. The current major buildings are the Berlaymont building of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the Justus Lipsius building of the Council and the Espace Léopold of the Parliament. Today, the presence has increased considerably, with the Commission alone occupying 865,000 m within the \"European Quarter\" (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has created a \"ghetto effect\" in that part of the city. However, the European presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre.\n\nThe European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, commonly known as Eurocontrol, is an international organisation which coordinates and plans air traffic control across European airspace. The corporation was founded in 1960 and currently has 41 member states. Its headquarters are located in Haren, on the northeast perimeter of the City of Brussels.\n\nThe Treaty of Brussels, which was signed on 17 March 1948 between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was a prelude to the establishment of the intergovernmental military alliance which later became the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Today, the alliance consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. Several countries also have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium. Since 1949, a number of NATO Summits have been held in Brussels, the most recent taking place in May 2017. The organisation's political and administrative headquarters are located on Boulevard Léopold III/Leopold III-laan in Haren, Brussels. A new €750 million headquarters building begun in 2010 and was completed in 2017.\n\nBrussels is located in one of the most urbanised regions of Europe, between Paris, London, the Rhine-Ruhr (Germany), and the Randstad (Netherlands). The Brussels-Capital Region has a population of around 1.2 million and has witnessed, in recent years, a remarkable increase in its population. In general, the population of Brussels is younger than the national average, and the gap between rich and poor is wider.\n\nBrussels and its suburbs, taking into account its outer commuter zone (RER/GEN area), have a population of about 2.6 million and extend over a large part of the two Brabant provinces. Brussels is also part of a wider diamond-shaped conurbation, with Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven, which has about 4.4 million inhabitants (a little more than 40% of the total population of Belgium). \n\nBrussels is home to a large number of immigrants. At the last Belgian census in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including political refugees (Karl Marx, Victor Hugo, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Léon Daudet, for example), from neighbouring or more distant countries, as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.\n\nBrussels has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of Moroccan (Riffian, Berber) and Turkish ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from former Belgian colonies, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi.\n\nPeople of foreign origin make up nearly 70% of the population of Brussels, most of whom have been naturalised following the great 1991 reform of the naturalisation process. About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian European origin, and 36% are of another background, mostly from Morocco, Turkey and Sub-Saharan Africa. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.\n\nSince the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking (Brabantian dialect to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically Belgian French) as the majority language and \"lingua franca\". This language shift, the \"Francisation\" of Brussels, is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.\n\nFrench-speaking immigration contributed to the \"Frenchification\" of Brussels; both Walloons and expatriates from other countries – mainly France – came to Brussels in great numbers. However, a more important cause for the \"Frenchification\" was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was carried out by Flemish inhabitants themselves. The main reason for this was a political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium, and thus necessary for social mobility. From 1880 on, faced with the necessity of using French in dealing with such institutions, more and more Dutch-speakers in Brussels became bilingual, and a rise in the number of monolingual French-speakers was seen after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.\n\nOnly since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border, and after the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. Through immigration, a further number of formerly Dutch-speaking municipalities surrounding Brussels became majoritively French-speaking in the second half of the 20th century. This phenomenon is, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in all of Belgian politics.\n\nGiven its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that the City of Brussels plays as capital in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communautarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded, for decades, that the Flemish part of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde \"arrondissement\" be separated from the Brussels Region (which made Halle-Vilvoorde a monolingual Flemish \"arrondissement\"). BHV was divided mid-2012. The French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six municipalities with language facilities in the surroundings of Brussels. Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals.\n\nThe original Dutch dialect of Brussels (\"Brussels\") is a form of Brabantic (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient Duchy of Brabant) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called \"Brusseleers\", many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing in Dutch. Brussels and its suburbs have evolved from a Dutch-dialect-speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.\n\nFor their French-speaking \"Bruxellois\", it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, \"Bruxellois\" (like the Memellanders in interwar ethnic censuses in Memel), Walloon (for people who migrated from the Wallonia Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels, it is mainly either Flemish or \"Brusselaar\" (Dutch for an inhabitant), and often both. For the \"Brusseleers\", many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.\n\nThe two largest foreign groups come from two francophone countries: France and Morocco. The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region. Nevertheless, about three out of four residents are Belgian nationals.\n\nIn recent decades, owing to migration and the city's international role, Brussels is home to a growing number of foreign language speakers. In 2013, figures cited in the Marnix Plan show that 63.2% of Brussels inhabitants are native speakers of French, while less than 20% are native Dutch speakers. Just 2.5% speak English as their mother tongue, but 29.7% of people living in the city claim to speak English well or very well. Even though some people want English to be used as an unofficial compromise language between Dutch and French, French remains the \"lingua franca\", and laws still require Dutch and French translations in most cases. The acceptance of English as a language for communication with the city's public servants depends entirely on their knowledge of this language, though they must accept questions in French and Dutch.\n\nThe migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other member states, speak many languages like French, Turkish, Arabic, Berber, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, German, and (increasingly) English. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.\n\nHistorically, Brussels has been predominantly Roman Catholic, especially since the expulsion of Protestants in the 16th century. This is clear from the large number of historical churches around the area, particularly in the City of Brussels. The pre-eminent Catholic cathedral in Brussels is the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, which serves as the co-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels. On the northwestern side of the city, the National Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the 14th largest church building in the world. The Church of Our Lady of Laeken holds the tombs of many members of the Belgian royal family, including all the former Kings of Belgium, within the Royal Crypt.\n\nIn reflection of its multicultural makeup, Brussels hosts a variety of religious communities, as well as large numbers of atheists and agnostics. Minority faiths include Islam, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Buddhism. According to a 2016 survey, approximately 40% of residents of Brussels declared themselves Catholics (12% were practising Catholics and 28% were non-practising Catholics), 30% were non-religious, 23% were Muslim (19% practising, 4% non-practising), 3% were Protestants and 4% were of another religion.\n\nRecognised religions and \"Laïcité\" enjoy public funding and school courses. It was once the case that every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 had to choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion – or \"Laïcité –\" inspired morals. However, in 2015, the Belgian Constitutional court ruled religious studies could no longer be required in the primary and secondary education system.\nBrussels has a large concentration of Muslims, mostly of Moroccan and Turkish ancestry. The Great Mosque of Brussels, located in the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark, is the oldest mosque in Brussels. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown. It was estimated that, in 2005, people of Muslim background living in the Brussels Region numbered 256,220 and accounted for 25.5% of the city's population, a much higher concentration than those of the other regions of Belgium.\nThe architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of Gothic, Baroque, and Louis XIV styles on the Grand Place to the postmodern buildings of the EU institutions.\n\nVery little medieval architecture is preserved in Brussels. Buildings from that period are mostly found in the historic centre (called \"Îlot Sacré\"), \"Saint Géry/Sint-Goriks\" and \"Sainte-Catherine/Sint Katelijne\" neighbourhoods. The Brabantine Gothic Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula remains a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels. Isolated portions of the first city walls were saved from destruction and can be seen to this day. One of the only remains of the second walls is the Halle Gate. The Grand Place is the main attraction in the city centre and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998. The square is dominated by the 15th century Flamboyant Town Hall, the Neo-Gothic \"Breadhouse\" and the Baroque guildhalls of the Guilds of Brussels. The \"Manneken Pis\", a fountain containing a small bronze sculpture of a urinating youth, is a tourist attraction and symbol of the city.\n\nThe neoclassical style of the 18th and 19th centuries is represented in the \"Royal Quarter/Coudenberg\" area, around the Brussels Park and Royal Square. Examples include the Royal Palace, the Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg, the Palace of the Nation (Parliament building), the Academy Palace, the Palace of Charles of Lorraine and the Egmont Palace. Other uniform neoclassical ensembles can be found around Martyrs' Square and Barricades' Square. Some other landmarks in the centre are the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert (1847), one of the oldest covered shopping arcades in Europe, the Congress Column (1859), the Brussels Stock Exchange building (1873) and the Palace of Justice (1883), designed by Joseph Poelaert, in eclectic style, and reputed to be the largest building constructed in the 19th century.\n\nLocated outside the centre, in a greener environment, are the \"Cinquantenaire\" park with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, and in Laeken, the Royal Castle of Laeken and the Royal Domain with its large greenhouses, as well as the Museums of the Far East.\n\nAlso particularly striking are the buildings in the Art Nouveau style, most famously by the Belgian architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar and Henry Van de Velde. Some of Brussels' municipalities, such as Schaerbeek, Etterbeek, Ixelles, and Saint-Gilles, were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau and have a large number of buildings in that style. The Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta – Hôtel Tassel (1893), Hôtel Solvay (1894), Hôtel van Eetvelde (1895) and the Horta Museum (1901) – have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. Another example of Brussels' Art Nouveau is the Stoclet Palace (1911), by the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.\n\nArt Deco structures in Brussels include the \"Résidence Palace\" (1927) (now part of the Europa building), the Centre for Fine Arts (1928), the Villa Empain (1934), the Town Hall of Forest (1938), and the former House of the Radio building on Flagey Square (1935–1938) in Ixelles. Some religious buildings from the interwar era were also constructed in that style, such as the Church of St John the Baptist (1932) in Molenbeek and the Church of Saint Augustine (1935) in Forest. Completed only in 1969, and combining Art Deco with Neo-Byzantine elements, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Koekelberg is one of the largest Roman Catholic basilicas by area in the world, and its cupola provides a panoramic view of Brussels and its outskirts. Another example are the exhibition halls of the Centenary Palace (\"Brussels Expo\"), built for the 1935 World Fair on the Heysel Plateau in northern Brussels.\nThe Atomium is a symbolic tall modernist structure, located on the Heysel Plateau, which was originally built for the 1958 World's Fair (Expo '58). It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a unit cell), magnified 165 billion times. The architect A. Waterkeyn devoted the building to science. It is now considered a landmark of Brussels. Next to the Atomium, is the \"Mini-Europe\" park, with 1:25 scale maquettes of famous buildings from across Europe.\nSince the second half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels (Madou Tower, Rogier Tower, Proximus Towers, Finance Tower, the World Trade Center, among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly concentrated in the city's main business district: the Northern Quarter (also called \"Little Manhattan\"), near Brussels-North railway station. The South Tower, standing adjacent to Brussels-South railway station, is the tallest building in Belgium, at . Along the North-South connection, is the \"State Administrative City\", an administrative complex in the International Style. The postmodern buildings of the Espace Léopold complete the picture.\n\nThe city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach towards historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, most famously the Maison du Peuple by Victor Horta, a process known as \"Brusselisation\".\n\nBrussels contains over 80 museums. The Royal Museums of Fine Arts has an extensive collection of various painters, such as Flemish old masters like Bruegel, Rogier van der Weyden, Robert Campin, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and Peter Paul Rubens. The Magritte Museum houses the world's largest collection of the works of the surrealist René Magritte. Museums dedicated to the national history of Belgium include the BELvue Museum, the Royal Museums of Art and History, and the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History. The Musical Instruments Museum (MIM), housed in the \"Old England\" building, is part of the Royal Museums of Art and History, and is internationally renowned for its collection of over 8,000 instruments.\n\nThe city has had a distinguished artist scene for many years. The famous Belgian surrealists René Magritte and Paul Delvaux, for instance, studied and lived in Brussels, as did the avant-garde dramatist Michel de Ghelderode. The city was also home of the impressionist painter Anna Boch from the Artist Group Les XX, and includes others famous Belgian painters such as Léon Spilliaert and Guy Huygens. The city is also a capital of the comic strip; some treasured Belgian characters are Tintin, Lucky Luke, The Smurfs, Spirou, Gaston, Marsupilami, Blake and Mortimer, Boule et Bill and Cubitus (see Belgian comics). Throughout the city, walls are painted with large motifs of comic book characters; these murals taken together are known as the Brussels' Comic Book Route. Also, the interiors of some Metro stations are designed by artists. The Belgian Comic Strip Center combines two artistic leitmotifs of Brussels, being a museum devoted to Belgian comic strips, housed in the former Waucquez department store, designed by Victor Horta in the Art Nouveau style.\n\nBrussels is well known for its performing arts scene, with the Kunstenfestivaldesarts (a festival of international contemporary art organised in May), the Kaaitheater and La Monnaie among the most notable institutions. The International Fantastic Film Festival of Brussels (BIFFF) is organised during the Easter holidays and the Magritte Awards in February. The King Baudouin Stadium is a concert and competition facility with a 50,000 seat capacity, the largest in Belgium. The site was formerly occupied by the Heysel Stadium. Furthermore, the Center for Fine Arts (often referred to as \"Bozar\" in French or \"PSK\" in Dutch), a multi-purpose centre for theatre, cinema, music, literature and art exhibitions, is home to the National Orchestra of Belgium and to the annual Queen Elisabeth Competition for classical singers and instrumentalists, one of the most challenging and prestigious competitions of the kind. The Studio 4 in Flagey cultural centre hosts the Brussels Philharmonic. Other concert venues include Forest National/Vorst Nationaal, the Ancienne Belgique, the Cirque Royal, the Botanique and the Palais 12. The Jazz Station (Saint-Josse-ten-Noode) is a museum and archive on jazz, and a venue for jazz concerts.\n\nBrussels' identity owes much to its rich folklore and traditions, among the liveliest in the country.\n\nMany events are organised or hosted in Brussels throughout the year. In addition, a large number of festivals animate the Brussels' scene.\n\nThe Iris Festival is the official festival of the Brussels-Capital Region and is held every year in spring. The Festival of Europe, an open day and activities in and around the institutions of the European Union, is celebrated on 9 May. On Belgian National Day, on 21 July, a military parade and celebrations take place on the \"Place des Palais/Paleizenplein\" and in Brussels Park, ending with a display of fireworks in the evening.\n\nSome summer festivities include the Couleur Café Festival, a festival of world and urban music, around the end of June or early July, the Brussels Summer Festival (BSF), a music festival in August, the Brussels Fair, the most important yearly fair in Brussels, lasting more than a month, in July and August, and \"Brussels Beach\", when the banks of the canal are turned into a temporary urban beach. The \"Winter Wonders\" animate the heart of Brussels in December; these winter activities were launched in Brussels in 2001.\n\nOther biennial events are the \"Zinneke Parade\", a colourful, multicultural parade through the city, which has been held since 2000 in May, as well as the popular Flower Carpet at the Grand Place in August.\n\nHeritage Days are organised on the third weekend of September (coinciding with the car-free day) and are a good opportunity to discover the wealth of buildings, institutions and real estate in Brussels.\n\nBrussels is known for its local waffle, its chocolate, its French fries and its numerous types of beers. The Brussels sprout, which has long been popular in Brussels, and may have originated there, is also named after the city.\n\nThe gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 restaurants, and a number of high quality bars. Belgian cuisine is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are a large number of cafés, bistros, and the usual range of international fast food chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; coffee houses are called \"salons de thé\". Also widespread are \"brasseries\", which usually offer a large number of beers and typical national dishes.\n\nBelgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include Brussels waffles (gaufres) and mussels (usually as \"moules-frites\", served with fries). The city is a stronghold of chocolate and pralines manufacturers with renowned companies like Côte d'Or, Neuhaus, Leonidas and Godiva. Pralines were first introduced in 1912, by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian chocolatier of Swiss origin, in the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert. Numerous friteries are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot waffles are also sold on the street.\n\nAs well as other Belgian beers, the spontaneously fermented lambic style, brewed in and around Brussels, is widely available there and in the nearby Senne valley where the wild yeasts which ferment it have their origin. Kriek, a cherry lambic, is available in almost every bar or restaurant in Brussels.\n\nBrussels is known as the birthplace of the Belgian Endive. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.\n\nFamous shopping areas in Brussels include the pedestrian-only Rue Neuve (Dutch: \"Nieuwstraat\"), the second busiest shopping street in Belgium (after the Meir, in Antwerp) with a weekly average of 230,000 visitors, home to popular international chains (H&M, C&A, Zara, Primark), as well as the City 2 and Anspach galleries. The Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert hold a variety of luxury shops and some six million people stroll through them each year. The neighbourhood around Antoine Dansaert Street has become, in recent years, a focal point for fashion and design; this main street and its side streets also feature Belgium's young and most happening artistic talent.\n\nIn Ixelles, the Avenue de la Toison d'Or and Namur Gate area offer a blend of luxury shops, fast food restaurants and entertainment venues, and Chaussée d'Ixelles, in the Congolese \"Matongé\" district, offers a great taste of African fashion and lifestyle. The nearby Avenue Louise is lined with high-end fashion stores and boutiques, making it one of the most expensive streets in Belgium.\n\nThere are shopping centers outside the inner ring: Basilix, Woluwe Shopping Center, Westland Shopping Center and Docks Bruxsel, which opened in October 2017.\n\nIn addition, Brussels ranks as one of Europe's best capital cities for flea market shopping. The\" Old Market\", on the Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein, in the \"Marollen\" neighbourhood, is particularly renowned. The nearby \"Sablon\" area is home to many of Brussels' antique dealers. The \"Midi Market\" around Brussels-South station and Boulevard du Midi/Zuidlaan is reputed to be one of the largest markets in Europe.\n\nSport in Brussels is under the responsibility of the Communities. The \"Administration de l'Éducation Physique et du Sport\" (ADEPS) is responsible for recognising the various French-speaking sports federations and also runs three sports centres in the Brussels-Capital Region. Its Dutch-speaking counterpart is \"Sport Vlaanderen\" (formerly called BLOSO).\n\nThe King Baudouin Stadium (formerly Heysel Stadium) is the largest in the country and home to the national teams in football and rugby union. It hosted the final of the 1972 UEFA European Football Championship, and the opening game of the 2000 edition. Several European club finals have been held at the ground, including the 1985 European Cup Final which saw 39 deaths due to hooliganism and structural collapse. The King Baudouin Stadium is also home of the annual Memorial Van Damme athletics event, Belgium's foremost track and field competition, which is part of the IAAF Diamond League. Other important athletics events are the Brussels Marathon and the 20 km of Brussels.\n\nBrussels is home to notable cycling races. The city is the arrival location of the Brussels Cycling Classic, formerly known as Paris–Brussels, which is one of the oldest semi classic bicycle races on the international calendar. From World War I until the early 1970s, the Six Days of Brussels was organised regularly. In the last decades of the 20th century, the Grand Prix Eddy Merckx was also held in Brussels.\n\nR.S.C. Anderlecht, based in the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium in Anderlecht, is the most successful Belgian football club in the Belgian Pro League, with 34 titles. It has also won the most major European tournaments for a Belgian side, with 6 European titles.\n\nBrussels is also home to Union Saint-Gilloise, the most successful Belgian club before World War II, with 11 titles The club was founded in Saint-Gilles but is based in nearby Forest, and currently plays in Second Division. White Star Bruxelles is another football club that plays in second division. Racing White Daring Molenbeek, based in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, and often referred to as RWDM, was a very popular football club until it was dissolved in 2002. Since 2015, its reincarnation RWDM47 is back playing in the fourth division.\n\nOther Brussels clubs that played in the national series over the years were Ixelles SC, Crossing Club de Schaerbeek (born from a merger between RCS de Schaerbeek and Crossing Club Molenbeek), Scup Jette, RUS de Laeken, Racing Jet de Bruxelles, AS Auderghem, KV Wosjot Woluwe and FC Ganshoren.\n\nServing as the centre of administration for Belgium and Europe, Brussels' economy is largely service-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of multinationals, by European institutions, by various local and federal administrations, and by related services companies, though it does have a number of notable craft industries, such as the Cantillon Brewery, a lambic brewery founded in 1900.\n\nBrussels has a robust economy. The region contributes to one fifth of Belgium's GDP, and its 550,000 jobs account for 17.7% of Belgium's employment. Its GDP per capita is nearly double that of Belgium as a whole, and it has the highest GDP per capita of any NUTS 1 region in the EU, at ~$80,000 in 2016. That being said, the GDP is boosted by a massive inflow of commuters from neighbouring regions; over half of those who work in Brussels live in Flanders or Wallonia, with 230,000 and 130,000 commuters per day respectively. Conversely, only 16.0% of people from Brussels work outside Brussels (68,827 (68.5%) of them in Flanders and 21,035 (31.5%) in Wallonia). Not all of the wealth generated in Brussels remains in Brussels itself, and as of December 2013, the unemployment among residents of Brussels is 20.4%.\n\nThere are approximately 50,000 businesses in Brussels, of which around 2,200 are foreign. This number is constantly increasing and can well explain the role of Brussels in Europe. The city's infrastructure is very favourable in terms of starting up a new business. House prices have also increased in recent years, especially with the increase of young professionals settling down in Brussels, making it the most expensive city to live in Belgium. In addition, Brussels holds more than 1,000 business conferences annually, making it the ninth most popular conference city in Europe.\n\nBrussels is rated as the seventh most important financial centre in the world. The Brussels Stock Exchange, abbreviated to BSE, now called \"Euronext Brussels\", is part of the European stock exchange Euronext N.V., along with Paris Bourse, Lisbon Stock Exchange and Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Its benchmark stock market index is the BEL20.\n\nBrussels is a centre of both media and communications in Belgium, with many Belgian television stations, radio stations, newspapers and telephone companies having their headquarters in the region. The Belgian French-language public broadcaster RTBF, the Belgian Dutch-speaking public broadcaster VRT, the two regional channels BX1 (formerly \"Télé Bruxelles\") and Bruzz (formerly \"TV Brussel\"), the encrypted BeTV channel and private channels RTL-TVI and VTM are headquartered in Brussels. Some national newspapers such as Le Soir, La Libre, De Morgen and the news agency Belga are based in or around Brussels. The Belgian postal company Bpost, as well as the telecommunication companies and mobile operators Proximus, Orange Belgium and Telenet are all located there. The multilingual pan-European news channel Euronews also maintains an office in Brussels.\n\nThere are several universities in Brussels. The two main universities are the Université libre de Bruxelles, a French-speaking university, with about 20,000 students, in three campuses in the city (and two others outside), and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, a Dutch-speaking university, with about 10,000 students. Both universities originate from a single ancestor university, founded in 1834, namely the Free University of Brussels, which was split in 1970, at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organisation of higher education.\n\nTwo other institutions based in Brussels are recognised as universities: the Université Saint-Louis - Bruxelles, specialised in social and human sciences, with 4,000 students, and the Royal Military Academy, a military college established in 1834 by a French colonel. Also a dozen of university colleges are located in Brussels, including two drama schools, founded in 1832: the French-speaking Conservatoire Royal and the Dutch-speaking Koninklijk Conservatorium.\n\nStill other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the Université catholique de Louvain, which has had its medical faculty in the city since 1973, in addition to its faculty of architecture, and its sister Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (offering bachelor & master's degrees in economics & business, law, arts, and architecture). In addition, the University of Kent's Brussels School of International Studies is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies.\n\nMost of Brussels pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 go to schools organised by the Flemish Community or the French-speaking Community, with roughly 20% going to Dutch-speaking schools, and close to 80% to French-speaking schools. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the International School of Brussels, with 1,450 pupils, between the ages of 2½ and 18, the British School of Brussels, and the four European Schools, which provide free education for the children of those working in the EU institutions. The combined student population of the four European Schools in Brussels is currently around 10,000.\n\nBrussels has a number of public or private-owned libraries on its territory. Libraries in Brussels fall under the competence of the Communities and are usually separated between French-speaking and Dutch-speaking institutions, although some are mixed.\n\nScience and technology in Brussels is well developed with the presence of several universities and research institutes.\n\nThe Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences houses the world's largest hall completely dedicated to dinosaurs, with its collection of 30 fossilised \"Iguanodon\" skeletons. The Planetarium of the Royal Observatory of Belgium is one of the largest in Europe.\n\nBrussels is home to a thriving pharmaceutical and health care industry which includes pioneering biotechnology research. The health sector employs 70,000 employees in 30,000 companies. There are 3,000 life sciences researchers in the city and two large science parks: Da Vinci Research Park and Erasmus Research Park. There are five university hospitals, a military hospital and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region is served by several airports, all of which are located outside of the administrative territory of the region. The most notable are:\nThe first two are also the main airports of Belgium.\n\nSince the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the port of Brussels. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijne square, it lies today in the northwest of the region, on the Brussels–Scheldt Maritime Canal (commonly called \"Willebroek Canal),\" which connects Brussels to Antwerp via the Scheldt. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, and thus offering a competitive advantage.\n\nMoreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, in the very heart of the capital, creates a north-south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of Hainaut (Wallonia). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important inclined plane of Ronquières and the lifts of Strépy-Bracquegnies.\n\nThe importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year – almost 2,000 per day – which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.\n\nThe Brussels-Capital Region has three main train stations: Brussels-South, Central and North, which are the busiest of the country. Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to London by Eurostar trains via the Channel Tunnel (1hr 51min); to Amsterdam by Thalys and \"InterCity\" connections; to Amsterdam, Paris (1hr 50min and 1hr 25min respectively ), and Cologne by Thalys; and to Cologne (2hr 59min) and Frankfurt (3hr 16min) by the German ICE.\n\nThe train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the North–South connection, with the Brussels-Central station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.\n\nThe City of Brussels has minor railway stations at Bockstael, Brussels-Chapel, Brussels-Congres, Brussels-Luxembourg, Brussels-Schuman, Brussels-West, Haren, Haren-South and Simonis.\n\nIn the Brussels Region, there are also railways stations at Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Boitsfort, Boondael, Bordet (Evere), Etterbeek, Evere, Forest-East, Forest-South, Jette, Meiser (Schaerbeek), Moensberg (Uccle), Saint-Job (Uccle), Schaarbeek, Uccle-Calevoet, Uccle-Stalle, Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle), Merode and Watermael.\n\nThe Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company STIB/MIVB is the local public transport operator in Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.\n\nThe Brussels Metro dates back to 1976, but underground lines known as \"premetro\" have been serviced by tramways since 1968. The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three \"premetro\" lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of . As of 2017, the metro network within the region has a total of 69 metro and \"premetro\" stations. The metro is an important means of transport, connecting with six railway stations of the National Railway Company of Belgium, and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with Flemish De Lijn and Walloon TEC bus stops.\n\nA comprehensive bus and tram network covers the region. , the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which – lines T3, T4 and T7 – qualify as \"premetro\" lines). The total route length is , making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning . Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called \"Noctis\". On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nAn interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the region. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by De Lijn, TEC and NMBS/SNCB will, in the next few years, be augmented by the Brussels RER/GEN network, which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.\n\nSince 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the Bremen company \"Cambio,\" in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company \"Taxi Stop\". In 2006, a public bicycle-sharing programme was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by \"Villo!\". Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by \"Collecto\", a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the \"Zen Car\" electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.\n\nIn medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east-west (Chaussée de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du Marché aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets, radiating from the Grand Place, in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built over the River Senne, over the city walls and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations.\n\nToday, Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe, according to US traffic information platform INRIX.\n\nBrussels is the hub of a range of old national roads, the main ones being clockwise: the N1 (N to Breda), N2 (E to Maastricht), N3 (E to Aachen), N4 (SE to Luxembourg) N5 (S to Rheims), N6 (S to Maubeuge), N7 (SW to Lille), N8 (W to Koksijde) and N9 (NW to Ostend). Usually named \"chaussées/steenwegen\", these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.\n\nThe region is skirted by the European route E19 (N-S) and the E40 (E-W), while the E411 leads away to the SE. Brussels has an orbital motorway, numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the \"Ring\". It is pear-shaped, as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.\n\nThe city centre, sometimes known as the \"pentagon\", is surrounded by an inner ring road, the \"Small Ring\" (French: \"Petite Ceinture\", Dutch: \"Kleine Ring\"), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon the site of the second set of city walls following their demolition. The metro line 2 runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the pentagon have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.\n\nOn the eastern side of the region, the R21 or \"Greater Ring\" (French: \"Grande Ceinture\", Dutch: \"Grote Ring\") is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from Laeken to Uccle. Some \"premetro\" stations (see Brussels Metro) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to Saint-Job.\n\nThe Brussels local police, supported by the federal police, is responsible for law enforcement in Brussels. The 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region are divided into six police zones, all bilingual (French and Dutch):\n\nThe Brussels Fire and Emergency Medical Care Service, commonly known by its acronym SIAMU (DBDMH), operates in the 19 municipalities of Brussels. It is a class X fire department and the largest fire service in Belgium in terms of annual operations, equipment, and personnel. It has 9 fire stations, spread over the entire Brussels-Capital Region, and employs about 1,000 professional firefighters. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French–Dutch).\n\nBrussels is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with over 8,000 hectares of green spaces. Vegetation cover and natural areas are higher in the outskirts, where they have limited the peri-urbanisation of the capital, but they decrease sharply towards the centre of Brussels; 10% in the central \"pentagon\", 30% of the municipalities in the first ring, and 71% of the municipalities in the second ring are occupied by green spaces.\n\nA multitude of parks and gardens, both public and privately owned, are scattered throughout the city. In addition to this, the Sonian Forest is located in its southern part and stretches out over the three Belgian regions. As of 2017, it has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the only Belgian component to the multinational inscription 'Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe'.\n\nBrussels is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57706209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57706209", "title": "Geology of Senegal", "text": "Geology of Senegal\n\nThe geology of Senegal formed beginning more than two billion years ago. The Archean greenschist Birimian rocks common throughout West Africa are the oldest in the country, intruded by Proterozoic granites. Basins formed in the interior during the Paleozoic and filled with sedimentary rocks, including tillite from a glaciation. With the rifting apart of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Mesozoic, the large Senegal Basin filled with thick sequences of marine and terrestrial sediments. Sea levels declined in the Eocene forming large phosphate deposits. Senegal is blanketed in thick layers of terrestrial sediments formed in the Quaternary. The country has extensive natural resources, including gold, diamonds, and iron. \n\nThe oldest rocks in Senegal are Archean or Proterozoic Birimian, commonly found throughout much of West Africa. Birimian rock units include the metabasic, meta-andesite, breccia and greywacke of the Mako Series, Diale Series meta-basites, red jasper, conglomerate, schist and marble, as well as the schist, greywacke and conglomerates of the Dalema Series. In the Kedougou inlier, these volcanic and sedimentary rocks were intruded by granite plutons in the Paleoproterozoic, during the Eburnean orogeny between 2 billion and 1.8 billion years ago. In southeastern Senegal, the Neoproterozoic Madina-Kouta Basin outcrops along the edge of the inlier. \n\nThe Komba Basin, bounded by the Kedougou inlier, Madina-Kouta Basin and eastern edge of the Bassaris branch contains the horizontal sedimentary rocks of the Early Cambrian Mali Group. The basin has a northern extension, known as the Faleme Basin is filled with chert, limestone and tillite potentially related to the glaciations of the Paleozoic. \n\nThe Senegal sedimentary basin, also known as the Senegal-Mauritania Basin, formed as the largest marginal basin in Africa during the rifting apart of the center of the supercontinent Pangaea to form the Atlantic Ocean in the Mesozoic. The basin is 1400 kilometers from north to south and 500 kilometers at its maximum width at Dakar. This Atlantic-type half-basin has gently dipping sedimentary units that get thicker closer to the coast. Due to overlying sediments from the Oligocene to modern times, its exact structure and origins are unclear. \n\nPre-Mesozoic basement rock slopes gently westward onshore and then drops offshore along a north-south fault. The depth to basement rock is six kilometers off of Dakar and eight kilometers off of Casamance. Two major north-south faults, formed in the Cretaceous through the late Miocene, break up the basin into horsts and grabens. The southern part of the basin has 10 salt domes (also known as diapirs). There are several disconformities, one offshore from the Senonian and the from the Oligocene, spanning the entire basin. The sedimentary sequence begins with [Triassic]] evaporite, gypsum, halite and anhydrite, which coincided with a tholeiitic magma series. \n\nTwo kilometers of carbonates formed in the Jurassic, with large amounts of detrital elements during the Aptian and clastic sedimentation between the Aptian and the Lutetian. The Albian through the Turonian are represented by argillite and organic-rich sediments, followed by biochemical precipitation since the Paleocene epoch of the Cenozoic. During the Maastrichtian, an alkali syenite dome near Saint Louis intruded sand deposits. \n\nBy the early Cenozoic, the ocean retreated, except in the Casamance Gulf and by the Eocene, the region was experiencing intense, terrestrial weathering. The Cap-Vert experienced two peaks of volcanism, one in the Miocene and the other in the Quaternary, producing small occurrences of understaturated, alkaline lavas. During the Quaternary, volcanism at the head of the Cap-Vert peninsula built the Mamelles volcano and its associated vents and flows. \n\nThe Senegal Superficial aquifer system is formed of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments, covering the entirety of the Senegal Basin. In some cases, groundwater is hosted beneath basalts, and water depths range considerably between a few meters and up to 72 meters below the surface. The Intermediate aquifer is consolidated limestone karst, beneath the Superficial aquifer. It experiences salt water intrusion near the coast and high iron and fluoride in the center of the country. The deep aquifer system is composed of Maastrichtian calcareous sandstone. This 250 meter thick aquifer is the main water supply for much of Senegal, and experiences comparable salinity and iron contamination issues. \n\nSenegal has extensive natural resources and there is high potential for gold in Paleoproterozoic rocks. Artisanal mines extract gold from the Birimian greenschist belts in the southeast. The carbonate-hosted Faleme iron deposit contains 800 million tons of ore, in one of the largest Paleoproterozoic deposits in Africa. Magnetite and iron hydroxide in the formation is up to 60 percent pure iron. Diamonds are found in the Faleme River and the Gambia River and prospecting for titanium-bearing sands began in the 1980s. \nIn addition to metals, Senegal has large phosphate reserves, formed in Cenozoic, particularly the Eocene. The switch from a marine to a continental environment in the Eocene led to the long-running enrichment of lime phosphates to aluminum phosphates. \n"}

{"id": "1809289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809289", "title": "Hardscape", "text": "Hardscape\n\nHardscape refers to hard landscape materials in the built environment structures that are incorporated into a landscape. This can include paved areas, driveways, retaining walls, sleeper walls, stairs, walkways, and any other landscaping made up of hard wearing materials such as wood, stone, concrete etc. as opposed to softscape, the horticultural elements of a landscape.\n\nHard landscaping involves projects that cover the entirety of the yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the \"bricks and mortar\", and so only once this is completed can the landscaper begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water – something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall is not an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that the yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space, rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is achieved through hard landscaping.\n\nFrom an urban planning perspective, hardscapes can include very large features, such as paved roads, driveways or fountains, and even small pools. Most water features are hardscapes because they require a barrier to retain the water, instead of letting it drain into the surrounding soil.\n\nHardscaping allows the erection of man-made landscaping features that would otherwise be impossible due to soil erosion, including some that compensate for large amounts of human traffic that would cause wear on bare earth or grass. For example, sheer vertical features are possible.\n\nWithout nearby bare soil, or natural drainage channels or culverts, hardscape with an impervious surface requires artificial methods of drainage or surface runoff to carry off the water that would normally be absorbed into the ground as groundwater and prevent premature wear to itself. Lack of capacity, or poorly planned or executed drainage or grading of the surface can cause problems after severe storms or heavy extended periods of rain fall, such as flooding, washout, mud flows, sink holes, accelerated erosion, wet rot to wood elements, drowning of plants trees and shrubs, and even foundation problems to an adjacent home such as cracking the foundation, basement flooding due to water infiltration, and pest infiltration, such as ants and other insects entering through damaged areas.\n\nHardscape landscaping in Queensland, Australia is a licensed qualification called Structural Landscaping, which is divided into two classes of licenses: Trade Contractor Structural Landscaper, and a Builder restricted to Structural Landscaping, referred to as the \"jack of all trades\" due to its large scope of works. These Structural Landscaping licenses include the erection and fabrication of decking, fences, carports, pergolas, paving and the construction of retaining walls.\n\n"}

Following this, he worked in Irkutsk, taking part in an expedition to the summit of Mönkh Saridag and acting as an expert in to the gold mining industry in Transbaikal. He is credited with discovering and naming several glaciers, as well as making many geomorphological and meteorological observations. In addition to this he spent time studying the geology of the shores of Lake Khövsgöl in Mongolia.\n\nJaczewski is noted as one of the first researchers in the world to discover the relationship of the thickness of snow cover to the depth of a layer of permafrost. He also clarified the location of the southern boundary of the permafrost in Siberia. Until 1890 he took part in the classification of deposits (bituminous coals, for example) in the Semipalatinsk area, the Urals, and Kazakhstan, then moved to the Yenisei, where he was hired by Jenisejskim District Operation Gold.\n\nFrom 1893 to 1894 Jaczewski worked in a group of geologists and engineers alongside Charles Bohdanowcza, on the Achinsk - Baikal stretch of the Trans-Siberian railway. At the same time he investigated the area for mineral deposits and water. Jaczewski was co-author of a geological map of the areas adjacent to this section of the railway.\n\nIn the years 1895 - 1898 Jaczewski set out individually to look for jade, and in 1896 he discovered riverside deposits. In 1905, he was head of a geological expedition in the region of Minusinsk (Tuva). In 1908, he was requested by the authorities to develop the first Russian Geological Survey in Siberia, which was founded in 1918. In 1913 Jaczewski was elected as a member of the St. Petersburg Committee of Geology.\n\nTowards the end of his life he became professor of mineralogy at the School of Mining in Yekaterinburg in the Urals, where he became the chair of mineralogy.

She was born on 21 February 1875, and died on 4 August 1997, aged 122 years and 164 days. The verified oldest French man ever was Maurice Floquet, a veteran of World War I who lived 111 years and 320 days across three centuries (1894–2006).\n\nMarie Marthe Augustine Lemaitre Brémont (née Mesange; 25 April 1886 – 6 June 2001) was the oldest recognized person in the world from November 2000 until her death at age 115 years 42 days. Brémont is the second oldest French person to have ever lived, after longevity world record holder Jeanne Calment.\n\nShe was born in Noëllet, Western France on April 25, 1886 to a lumberjack. Her first husband, railroad worker Constant Lemaitre, was killed in the First World War. She married again to a taxi driver, Florentin Brémont, who died in 1967. She had no children. Over the course of her life, she worked as a farmer, as well as in a pharmaceutical factory, as a nanny and as a seamstress. At 103, she was hit by a car and broke her arm as a result.

SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour during the 11-day STS-99 mission in February 2000, based on the older \"Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar\" (SIR-C/X-SAR), previously used on the Shuttle in 1994. To acquire topographic data, the SRTM payload was outfitted with two radar antennas. One antenna was located in the Shuttle's payload bay, the other – a critical change from the SIR-C/X-SAR, allowing single-pass interferometry – on the end of a 60-meter (200-foot) mast that extended from the payload bay once the Shuttle was in space. The technique employed is known as interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Intermap Technologies was the prime contractor for processing the interferometric synthetic aperture radar data. \n\nThe elevation models are arranged into tiles, each covering one degree of latitude and one degree of longitude, named according to their south western corners. For example, \"n45e006\" stretches from 45°N 6°E to 46°N 7°E and \"s45w006\" from 45°S 6°W to 44°S 5°W. The resolution of the raw data is one arcsecond (30 m along the equator) and coverage includes Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. A derived one arcsecond dataset with trees and other non-terrain features removed covering Australia was made available in November 2011; the raw data are restricted for government use. For the rest of the world, only three arcsecond (90 m along the equator) data are available. Each one arcsecond tile has 3,601 rows, each consisting of 3,601 16 bit bigendian cells. The dimensions of the three arcsecond tiles are 1201 x 1201. The original SRTM elevations were calculated relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid and then the EGM96 geoid separation values were added to convert to heights relative to the geoid for all the released products.\n\nThe elevation models derived from the SRTM data are used in geographic information systems. They can be downloaded freely over the Internet, and their file format (.hgt) is widely supported.\n\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is an international project spearheaded by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA transferred the SRTM payload to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in 2003; the canister, mast, and antenna are now on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThe elevation datasets are affected by mountain and desert no-data areas. These amount to no more than 0.2% of the total area surveyed, but can be a problem in areas of very high relief. They affect all summits over 8,000 meters, most summits over 7,000 meters, many Alpine and similar summits and ridges, and many gorges and canyons. There are some SRTM data sources which have filled these data voids, but some of these have used only interpolation from surrounding data, and may therefore be very inaccurate. If the voids are large, or completely cover summit or ridge areas, no interpolation algorithms will give satisfactory results. Other developers, including NASA World Wind and Google Earth, have improved their results by using 1-arc-second for the United States and 3-arc-second for the rest of the world, data in the interpolation process, but, due to the poor resolution of these data, and very poor quality of some of them, they have further improved their earth viewing services by adding data from other sources.\n\nGroups of scientists have worked on algorithms to fill the voids of the original SRTM data. Two datasets offer global coverage void-filled SRTM data at full resolution: the CGIAR-CSI versions\nand the USGS HydroSHEDS dataset.\n\nThe CGIAR-CSI version 4 provides the best global coverage full resolution SRTM dataset. The HydroSHEDS dataset was generated for hydrological applications and is suitable for consistent drainage and water flow information. References are provided on the algorithms used and quality assessment. The void-filled SRTM data from Viewfinder Panoramas are high quality at full SRTM resolution. Since November 2012 there is free and global coverage at 3 arc seconds available.\n\nIn November 2013, LP DAAC released the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3.0 (SRTM Plus) Product collection with all voids eliminated. Voids were filled primarily from ASTER GDEM2, and secondarily from USGS GMTED2010 – or USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) for the United States (except Alaska) and northernmost Mexico according to the announcement.\n\n1-arc second global digital elevation model (30 meters) is available from the United States Geological Survey web site. The United States Government announced on September 23, 2014 over a United Nations Climate Summit that the highest possible resolution of global topographic data derived from the SRTM mission will be released to public. Before the end of the same year, a 1-arc second global digital elevation model (30 meters) was released. Most parts of the world have been covered by this dataset ranging from 54°S to 60°N latitude except for the Middle East and North Africa area. Missing coverage of the Middle East was completed in August 2015.\n\nIn early June 2011, there were 750,000 confirmed users of SRTM topography dataset. Users in 221 countries have accessed the site.\n\n\n\nHennig, T., Kretsch, J, Salamonowicz, P, Pessagno, C, and Stein, W., The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Digital Earth Moving 2001, Springer Verlag, London, UK.\n\n"}

The grade II* listed building was originally a town hall. There are three venues in the Guildhall catering for various event formats: the Guildhall, the Solent Suite and a lecture theatre.\n\nThe Guildhall was designed to complement the rest of the Civic Suite and opened on 13 February 1937. It houses a large pipe organ which was built into it from new. The organ has two distinct consoles: a classical concert organ and a theatre organ. The consoles share the same body of approximately 4,000 pipes which are housed in chambers above the proscenium arch. It was the largest organ made by its builder, John Compton. On 7 October 2013, the venue was renamed to the O Guildhall Southampton, due to partnership between Live Nation UK and O Telefónica.\n\n\nWebsite with information about the venue's organ: www.guildhall-compton.org.uk\n"}

The Conference is an educational organisation with the aim of educating people about the realities of the endangered environment and the inevitable catastrophic consequences if no proactive and preventive steps are taken.\n\nThe project has reached many institutions and organisations all over the world, spreading the message \"Education for Preservation\". The organisation has given birth to other initiatives, such as The Amazonia Society, the Amazonia Seminar, the Amazonia Experience, and the Amazonia Files.\n\nThe Amazonia Conference is an educational organisation which, unlike other environmental organisations, focuses in education instead of radical campaigning. This does not mean that the organisation does not campaign. The organisation believes that it is effectively easier to 'form the minds of the young instead of attempting to amend adult ones.' Therefore, by educating the young, next generations will be equipped with environmentally aware citizens. The project also has a special division which visits companies and other organisations to educate their employees or members, on the current environmental issues which our planet is suffering due to human activities.\n\nThe Amazonia Conference is considered to be the biggest educational project in Portugal (Diario de Noticias, 2000), and has recently received the British Airways Best Environmental Project Award 2004.\n\nThe Amazonia Conference was established in 1990 by Professor Valdir Bento, physicist and former head of NASA's Laser technology department. The project has developed into the leading educational project in Portugal, and is expanding to become one of the predominant environmental organisations in the United Kingdom. The 'Conference' has also conquered the United States and France and current plans reflect the need to explore the Asia-Pacific.\n\n"}

They are similar to municipalities and communes in other countries and in turn may contain village committees and villages. In 1995 there were 29,502 townships and 17,532 towns (a total of 47,034 township-level divisions) in China.\n\nMuch like other levels of government in mainland China, the township's governance is divided between the Communist Party Township Secretary, and the \"county magistrate\" (). The township party secretary, along with the township's party committee, determines policy. The magistrate is in charge of administering the daily affairs of government and executing policies as determined by the party committee. A township official is the lowest-level ranked official in the civil service hierarchy; in practice, however, the township party secretary and magistrate can amass high levels of personal power.\n\nA township government is formally responsible for local economic development, planning, maintenance of local roads, family planning (enforcing One-Child Policy), sanitation & health, sports, and \"other responsibilities as determined by higher level governments\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

This requires close cooperation of the design team, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages, from site selection, scheme formation, material selection and procurement, to project implementation. Tropical Green Building has the same basis as green building in more temperate climates, but the methods of construction are completely different. In the tropics, the focus is on keeping cool, preventing insect infestations, and reduced mould, damp and maintenance in the home.\n\nGenerally, tropical green building also seeks to reduce power consumption through intelligent architecture, such as by allowing in lots of natural light so that electric lights aren't needed during the daytime, and at night, using white-painted roofs, ceilings and low-energy light bulbs such as compact fluorescents or LED lamps.\n\nSolar power, wind power, and/or the use of micro hydro are often deployed, but not always the focus of tropical green building.\n\n"}
{"id": "3469713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3469713", "title": "World Geographic Reference System", "text": "World Geographic Reference System\n\nThe World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF) is a grid-based method of specifying locations on the surface of the Earth. GEOREF is essentially based on the geographic system of latitude and longitude, but using a simpler and more flexible notation. GEOREF was used primarily for air navigation, particularly in military or inter-service applications, but it is rarely seen today. However, GEOREF can be used with any map or chart that has latitude and longitude printed on it.\n\nGEOREF is based on the standard system of latitude and longitude, but uses a simpler and more concise notation. GEOREF divides the Earth's surface into successively smaller quadrangles, with a notation system used to identify each quadrangle within its parent. Unlike latitude/longitude, GEOREF runs in one direction horizontally, east from the 180° meridian; and one direction vertically, north from the South Pole. GEOREF can easily be adapted to give co-ordinates with varying degrees of precision, using a 2–12 character geocode.\n\nGEOREF co-ordinates are defined by successive divisions of the Earth's surface, as follows:\n\n\nThe initial two letters of a GEOREF reference, designating the 15 degree quadrangle, can be omitted, if it is clear which 15 degree quadrangle the reference applies to (e.g., when working within a restricted geographical area).\n\nFor example, on a GEOREF chart, Naval Air Station Patuxent River (38°17′10″N 76°24′42″W) / (38.286108, -76.4291704) is located (to the nearest minute) at position GJPJ3716. \n\nTo locate the position from the coordinates, proceed as follows:\n\n\nThe same co-ordinate shown in 6-digit (1/10 minute) format is GJPJ370160 and in 8-digit (1/100 minute) format is GJPJ37001600.\n\nExtensions to the above notation allow the GEOREF system to be used to designate an area around a reference point. This is achieved by adding an area designation to a base GEOREF co-ordinate. The area designation can be the letter S, to specify the sides of a rectangle (separated by the letter X); or the letter R, to specify the radius of a circle. In both cases the units are nautical miles. In addition, the letter H can be added, followed by an altitude in thousands of feet.\n\nFor example, the reference GJQJ0207S6X8 designates a rectangle centered on Deal Island (GJQJ0207), running east–west and north–south. Designation GJPJ4103R5 means a circle around Point Lookout (GJPJ4103) with a radius of . Designation GJPJ3716H17 means a height of 17,000 feet over GJPJ3716.\n\n\n"}
