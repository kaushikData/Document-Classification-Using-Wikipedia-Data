Postnikov (born 1939) is an internationally known specialist on the History of Science, with particular emphasis on the geography and cartography of Russia and these countries that have been under Russian influence from the 17th through the 20th centuries.\n\nHe analyzed the development of Earth Sciences and Cartography in a broad social-cultural context. It reveals the limitation of Eurocetric approach by including the rich traditions of old Asian and American countries and people, as well as historical processes of their interaction and mutual influences with European geographical practices and theories. His work \"Mapping of Russian America: A History of Russian–American Contacts in Cartography\" is the most representative examples of this. Besides that fundamental monograph, the article \"Learning from Each Other – a History of Russian-native contacts in late Eighteenth - early Nineteenth Century Exploration and Mapping of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands\" in the \"International Hydrographic Review\" may be mentioned in this connection, whiсh deals with Native Americans' geographical data's use by Russian in Alaska and Aleutian Island.\n\nIn addition to their value as fundamental research on the development of cosmographical and geographical ideas and methods in different periods of the human history, Prof. Postnikov's studies in the History of Science, are important research tools for historical geographers who deal with detailed studies of territorial aspects of changes in nature and society.\n\nBorn in Moscow in 1939 in the family of a diplomat (father Vladimir M.

It is used in the state of North Dakota for rural addresses to be used for the 911 system as well as mail delivery to rural properties. Because of its use in the 911 system, it is enshrined in North Dakota state law and is used across the state.\n\nThe system was created by the Stark County, North Dakota emergency coordinator Kornard Burkle as a way of assigning addresses to houses for use in the then soon to be implemented enhanced 911 services in Stark County. A key problem for the system was that since most of the county was rural farmland a significant number of farms in the county either lacked a proper address, or the address they had was not in any uniform system. After a meeting on the proposed E911 implementation, Burkle went home and devised what would become the Burkle addressing system to address the challenges faced by the county. Because other counties implementing the E911 system in North Dakota faced the same problem and to add a measure of consistency across the state, it was decided that the Burkle system would be used state wide for addressing rural properties. At the time it was proposed, no state had adopted a statewide addressing system but since then other states have adopted similar systems.\n\nThe basic idea of the system was inspired by the existing address system used in many towns where streets and avenues are numbered outwards from a starting \"main street\" near the center of town. To number rural section line roads in the state the rough geographical centerlines of the state were designated as \"Main Street\" (running east-west) and \"Main Avenue\" (running north-south). Roads are assigned an increasing number moving out from these centerlines with the number of the road determined by the number of miles it is from the corresponding centerline. For roads on half section lines an M is added to the road name and for quarter section lines an F is added.\n\nIn addition to providing names for the many rural roads, the system also provides a method of assigning addresses to properties along these roads. As with most city house numbering systems, the first digits of the house number are simply taken from the lower numbered crossing street or avenue on the \"block\" that the property resides on. For the final two digits of the house number the one mile section lines are divided into segments of 1/50th of a mile and this is used to assign the final two digits; choosing an odd number if the property is on the north or west side of the road or an even number for properties on the south or east side. In areas of subdivisions where the system is employed but a higher address accuracy is required, the increments are reduced to 1/100th of a mile.\n"}

{"id": "48381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48381", "title": "Celestial coordinate system", "text": "Celestial coordinate system\n\nIn astronomy, a celestial coordinate system (or celestial reference system) is a system for specifying positions of celestial objects: satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and so on. Coordinate systems can specify an object's position in three-dimensional space or plot merely its direction on a celestial sphere, if the object's distance is unknown or trivial.\n\nThe coordinate systems are implemented in either spherical or rectangular coordinates. Spherical coordinates, projected on the celestial sphere, are analogous to the geographic coordinate system used on the surface of Earth. These differ in their choice of fundamental plane, which divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres along a great circle. Rectangular coordinates, in appropriate units, are simply the cartesian equivalent of the spherical coordinates, with the same fundamental () plane and primary (-axis) direction. Each coordinate system is named after its choice of fundamental plane.\n\nThe following table lists the common coordinate systems in use by the astronomical community. The fundamental plane divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the equator in the geographic coordinate system. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates. The origin is the zero distance point, the \"center of the celestial sphere\", although the definition of celestial sphere is ambiguous about the definition of its center point.\n\nThe \"horizontal\", or altitude-azimuth, system is based on the position of the observer on Earth, which revolves around its own axis once per sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.091 seconds) in relation to the star background. The positioning of a celestial object by the horizontal system varies with time, but is a useful coordinate system for locating and tracking objects for observers on Earth. It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's ideal horizon.\n\nThe \"equatorial\" coordinate system is centered at Earth's center, but fixed relative to the celestial poles and the vernal equinox. The coordinates are based on the location of stars relative to Earth's equator if it were projected out to an infinite distance. The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the solar system, and modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates.\n\nThe \"equatorial\" system is the normal coordinate system for most professional and many amateur astronomers having an equatorial mount that follows the movement of the sky during the night. Celestial objects are found by adjusting the telescope's or other instrument's scales so that they match the equatorial coordinates of the selected object to observe.\n\nPopular choices of pole and equator are the older B1950 and the modern J2000 systems, but a pole and equator \"of date\" can also be used, meaning one appropriate to the date under consideration, such as when a measurement of the position of a planet or spacecraft is made. There are also subdivisions into \"mean of date\" coordinates, which average out or ignore nutation, and \"true of date,\" which include nutation.\n\nThe fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic plane. There are two principal variants of the ecliptic coordinate system: geocentric ecliptic coordinates centered on the Earth and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centered on the center of mass of the solar system.\n\nThe geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.\n\nThe heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centers on the barycenter of the solar system (i.e. very close to the center of the Sun). The system is primarily used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, as well as defining their orbital elements.\n\nThe galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane. The solar system is still the center of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic center. Galactic latitude resembles the elevation above the galactic plane and galactic longitude determines direction relative to the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe supergalactic coordinate system corresponds to a fundamental plane that contains a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.\n\nConversions between the various coordinate systems are given. See the notes before using these equations.\n\n\nThe classical equations, derived from spherical trigonometry, for the longitudinal coordinate are presented to the right of a bracket; simply dividing the first equation by the second gives the convenient tangent equation seen on the left. The rotation matrix equivalent is given beneath each case. This division is ambiguous because tan has a period of 180° () whereas cos and sin have periods of 360° (2).\n\nNote that azimuth () is measured from the south point, turning positive to the west.\nZenith distance, the angular distance along the great circle from the zenith to a celestial object, is simply the complementary angle of the altitude: .\n\nIn solving the equation for , in order to avoid the ambiguity of the arctangent, use of the two-argument arctangent, denoted , is recommended. The two-argument arctangent computes the arctangent of , and accounts for the quadrant in which it is being computed. Thus, consistent with the convention of azimuth being measured from the south and opening positive to the west,\n\nwhere\n\nIf the above formula produces a negative value for , it can be rendered positive by simply adding 360°.\n\nAgain, in solving the equation for , use of the two-argument arctangent that accounts for the quadrant is recommended. Thus, again consistent with the convention of azimuth being measured from the south and opening positive to the west,\n\nwhere\n\nThese equations are for converting equatorial coordinates to Galactic coordinates.\n\nformula_10 are the equatorial coordinates of the North Galactic Pole and formula_11 is the Galactic longitude of the North Celestial Pole. Referred to J2000.0 the values of these quantities are:\n\nIf the equatorial coordinates are referred to another equinox, they must be precessed to their place at J2000.0 before applying these formulae.\n\nThese equations convert to equatorial coordinates referred to B2000.0.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4254743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4254743", "title": "Chorography", "text": "Chorography\n\nChorography (from χῶρος \"khōros\", \"place\" and γράφειν \"graphein\", \"to write\") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district, and by extension such a description or map. This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer Pomponius Mela and Ptolemy, where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that \"chorography defines itself by opposition to chronicle. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time\". Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of \"the representation of space or place\".\n\nIn his text of the \"Geographia\" (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined geography as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was \"an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye\"; and it dealt with \"the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down\". Ptolemy implied that it was a \"graphic\" technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording \"proportional placements\". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as \"regional cartography\".\n\nPtolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term \"chorography\" was revived by humanist scholars. An early instance is a small-scale map of Britain in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a \"tabula chorographica\". John Dee in 1570 regarded the practice as \"an underling, and a twig of \"Geographie\"\", by which the \"plat\" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.\nThe term also came to be used, however, for \"written\" descriptions of regions. These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably William Camden's \"Britannia\" (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a \"Chorographica descriptio\". William Harrison in 1587 similarly described his own \"Description of Britaine\" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's \"Chronicles\" (to which the \"Description\" formed an introductory section). Peter Heylin in 1652 defined chorography as \"the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same\", and gave as examples Pausanias's \"Description of Greece\" (2nd century AD); Camden's \"Britannia\" (1586); Lodovico Guicciardini's \"Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi\" (1567) (on the Low Countries); and Leandro Alberti's \"Descrizione d'Italia\" (1550).\n\nCamden's \"Britannia\" was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with antiquarian texts. William Lambarde, John Stow, John Hooker, Michael Drayton, Tristram Risdon, John Aubrey and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly topophilia and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of county history. A late example was William Grey's \"Chorographia\" (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Even before Camden's work appeared, Andrew Melville in 1574 had referred to chorography and chronology as the \"twa lights\" [two lights] of history.\nHowever, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or county areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers Christopher Saxton and John Norden as \"most skilfull Chorographers\"; and Robert Plot in 1677 and Christopher Packe in 1743 both referred to their county maps as chorographies.\n\nBy the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either \"topography\" or \"cartography\". Samuel Johnson in his \"Dictionary\" (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being \"less in its object than geography, and greater than topography\". In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.\n\nIn more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and city maps became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific surveying. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.\n\nThe term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the early modern genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.\n\n\n"}

The goal of deadheading is thus to preserve the attraction of the plants in beds, borders, containers and hanging baskets, as well as to encourage further blooming. Deadheading flowers with many petals, such as roses, peonies, and camellias prevents them from littering. Deadheading can be done with finger and thumb or with pruning shears, knife, or scissors.\n\nOrnamental plants that do not require deadheading are those that do not produce a lot of seed or tend to deadhead themselves. These include lobelias, salvias, and fuchsias. Deadheading is undesirable if the plant's seed is enjoyed by birds, as is the case with many species from the sunflower family. Likewise, if the plant bears attractive seeds or fruits, deadheading is normally avoided.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "162535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162535", "title": "Joshua Slocum", "text": "Joshua Slocum\n\nJoshua Slocum (February 20, 1844 – on or shortly after November 14, 1909) was the first man to sail single-handedly around the world. He was a Nova Scotian-born, naturalised American seaman and adventurer, and a noted writer. In 1900 he wrote a book about his journey; \"Sailing Alone Around the World\", which became an international best-seller. He disappeared in November 1909 while aboard his boat, the \"Spray\".\n\nJoshua Slocum was born on February 20, 1844 in Mount Hanley, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia (officially recorded as Wilmot Station), a community on the North Mountain within sight of the Bay of Fundy. The fifth of eleven children of John Slocombe and Sarah Jane Slocombe \"née\" Southern, Joshua descended, on his father's side, from a Quaker, known as \"John the Exile\" who left the United States shortly after 1780 because of his opposition to the American War for Independence. Part of the Loyalist migration to Nova Scotia, the Slocombes were granted of farmland in Nova Scotia's Annapolis County.\n\nJoshua Slocum was born in the family's farm house in Mount Hanley and learned to read and write at the nearby Mount Hanley School. His earliest ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the Bay of Fundy.\n\nWhen Joshua was eight years old, the Slocombe family moved from Mount Hanley to Brier Island in Digby County, at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Slocum's maternal grandfather was the keeper of the lighthouse at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making leather boots for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more alluring than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.\n\nHe made several attempts to run away from home, finally succeeding, at age fourteen, by hiring on as a cabin boy and cook on a fishing schooner, but he soon returned home. In 1860, after the birth of the eleventh Slocombe (Joshua changed the spelling of his last name later in his life) child and the subsequent death of his kindly mother, Joshua, then sixteen, left home for good. He and a friend signed on at Halifax as ordinary seamen on a merchant ship bound for Dublin, Ireland.\n\nFrom Dublin, he crossed to Liverpool to become an ordinary seaman on the British merchant ship \"Tangier\" (also recorded as \"Tanjore\"), bound for China. During two years as a seaman, he rounded Cape Horn twice, landed at Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies, and visited the Maluku Islands, Manila, Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, and San Francisco. While at sea, he studied for the Board of Trade examination, and, at the age of eighteen, he received his certificate as a fully qualified Second Mate. Slocum quickly rose through the ranks to become a Chief Mate on British ships transporting coal and grain between the British Isles and San Francisco.\n\nIn 1865, he settled in San Francisco, became an American citizen, and, after a period of salmon fishing and fur trading in the Oregon Territory of the northwest, he returned to the sea to pilot a schooner in the coastal trade between San Francisco and Seattle. His first blue-water command, in 1869, was the barque \"Washington\", which he took across the Pacific, from San Francisco to Australia, and home via Alaska.\n\nHe sailed for thirteen years out of the port of San Francisco, transporting mixed cargo to China, Australia, the Spice Islands, and Japan. Between 1869 and 1889, he was the master of eight vessels, the first four of which (the \"Washington\", the \"Constitution\", the \"Benjamin Aymar\" and the \"Amethyst\") he commanded in the employ of others. Later, there would be four others that he himself owned, in whole or in part.\n\nShortly before Christmas 1870, Slocum and the \"Washington\" put in at Sydney. There, in about a month's time, he met, courted, and married a young woman named Virginia Albertina Walker. Their marriage took place on January 31, 1871. Miss Walker, quite coincidentally, was an American whose New York family had migrated west to California at the time of the 1849 gold rush and eventually continued on, by ship, to settle in Australia. She sailed with Slocum, and, over the next thirteen years, the couple had seven children, all born at sea or foreign ports. Four children, sons Victor, Benjamin Aymar, and Garfield, and daughter Jessie, survived to adulthood.\n\nIn Alaska, the \"Washington\" was wrecked when she dragged her anchor during a gale, ran ashore, and broke up. Slocum, however, at considerable risk to himself, managed to save his wife, the crew, and much of the cargo, bringing all back to port safely in the ship's open boats. The owners of the shipping company that had employed Slocum were so impressed by this feat of ingenuity and leadership, they gave him the command of the \"Constitution\" which he sailed to Hawaii and the west coast of Mexico.\n\nHis next command was the \"Benjamin Aymar\", a merchant vessel in the South Seas trade. However, the owner, strapped for cash, sold the vessel out from under Slocum, and he and Virginia found themselves stranded in the Philippines without a ship.\n\nWhile in the Philippines, in 1874, under a commission from a British architect, Slocum organized native workers to build a 150-ton steamer in the shipyard at Subic Bay. In partial payment for the work, he was given the ninety-ton schooner, \"Pato\" (Spanish for \"Duck\"), the first ship he could call his own.\n\nOwnership of the \"Pato\" afforded Slocum the kind of freedom and autonomy he had never experienced before. Hiring a crew, he contracted to deliver a cargo to Vancouver in British Columbia. Thereafter, he used the \"Pato\" as a general freight carrier along the west coast of North America and in voyages back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. During this period, Slocum also fulfilled a long-held ambition to become a writer; he became a temporary correspondent for the \"San Francisco Bee\".\n\nThe Slocums sold the \"Pato\" in Honolulu in the spring of 1878. Returning to San Francisco, they purchased the \"Amethyst.\" He worked this ship until June 23, 1881.\nThe Slocums next bought a third share in the \"Northern Light 2\". This large clipper was 233 feet in length, 44 feet beam, 28 feet in the hold. It was capable of carrying 2000 tons on three decks. Although Joshua Slocum called this ship \"my best command\", it was a command plagued with mutinies and mechanical problems. Under troubling legal circumstances (caused by his alleged treatment of the chief mutineer) he sold his share in the \"Northern Light 2\" in 1883.\n\nThe Slocum family continued on their next ship, the 326-ton \"Aquidneck\". In 1884, Slocum's wife Virginia became ill aboard the \"Aquidneck\" in Buenos Aires and died. After sailing to Massachusetts, Slocum left his three youngest children, Benjamin Aymar, Jessie, and Garfield in the care of his sisters; his oldest son Victor continued as his first mate.\n\nIn 1886, at age 42, Slocum married his 24-year-old cousin, Henrietta \"Hettie\" Elliott. The Slocum family, with the exception of Jessie and Benjamin Aymar, again took to the sea aboard the \"Aquidneck\", bound for Montevideo, Uruguay. Slocum's second wife would find life at sea much less appealing than his first. A few days into Henrietta's first voyage, the \"Aquidneck\" sailed through a hurricane. By the end of this first year, the crew had contracted cholera, and they were quarantined for six months. Later, Slocum was forced to defend his ship from pirates, one of whom he shot and killed; he was tried and acquitted of murder. Next, the \"Aquidneck\" was infected with smallpox, leading to the death of three of the crew. Disinfecting of the ship was performed at considerable cost. Shortly afterward, near the end of 1887, the unlucky \"Aquidneck\" was wrecked in southern Brazil.\n\nAfter being stranded in Brazil with his wife and sons Garfield and Victor, he started building a boat that could sail them home. He used local materials, salvaged materials from the \"Aquidneck\" and worked with local workers. The boat was launched on May 13, 1888, the very day slavery was abolished in Brazil, and therefore the ship was given the Portuguese name \"Liberdade\".\nIt was an unusual junk-rigged design which he described as \"half Cape Ann dory and half Japanese sampan\". He and his family began their voyage back to the United States, his son Victor (15) being the mate.\n\nAfter fifty-five days at sea and 5510 miles, the Slocums reached Cape Roman, South Carolina and continued inland to Washington D.C. for winter and finally reaching Boston via New York in 1889. This was the last time Henrietta sailed with the family. In 1890, Slocum published the accounts of these adventures in \"Voyage of the Liberdade\".\n\nIn the northern winter of 1893/94, Slocum undertook what he described as at that time being \"the hardest voyage that I have ever made, without any exception at all.\" It involved delivering the steam-powered torpedo boat \"Destroyer\" from the east coast of the United States to Brazil.\n\n\"Destroyer\" was a ship 130 feet in length, conceived by the Swedish-American inventor and mechanical engineer John Ericsson, and intended for the defence of harbours and coastal waters. Equipped in the early 1880s with sloping armour plate and a bow-mounted submarine gun it was an evolution of the Monitor warship type of the American Civil War. \"Destroyer\" was intended to fire an early form of torpedo at an opposing ship from a range of 300 feet, and was a \"vessel of war partially armored to attack bows-on at short range\".\n\nDespite the loss of the \"Aquidneck\" and the privations of his family's voyage in the self-built \"Liberdade\", Slocum retained a fondness for Brazil. During 1893, Brazil was faced with a political crisis in Rio Grande do Sul and an attempt at civil war that was intensified by the revolt of the country's navy in September.\n\nSlocum agreed to a request by the Brazilian government to deliver the \"Destroyer\" to Pernambuco, Brazil. His motive was also financial. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, \"to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them – big and little – for a handsome sum of gold …\" In addition, Slocum saw the possibility of getting even with the \"arch rebel\" Admiral Melo (whom he writes as \"Mello\"): \"Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his \"Aquideban\". He it was, who in that ship expelled my bark, the \"Aquidneck\", from lIha Grand some years ago, under the cowardly pretext that we might have sickness on board. But that story has been told. I was burning to let him know and palpably feel that this time I had in dynamite instead of hay\".\n\nTowed by the \"Santuit\", Slocum and a small crew aboard the \"Destroyer\" left Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 7 December 1893. The following day the ship was already taking on water: \"A calamity has overtaken us. The ship's top seams are opening and one of the new sponsons, the starboard one, is already waterlogged\". Despite all hands pumping and bailing, by midnight the seas were extinguishing the fires in the boilers which were kept alight only by throwing on rounds of pork fat and tables and chairs from the vessel.\n\nWith a storm continuing to blow on the 9th, the crew was able to lower the level of water in the hold and plug some of the holes and leaks. Bailing out water using a large improvised canvas bag continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below three feet. On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the \"Destroyer\" was to the southwest of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.\n\nBy this time, with the fires in the boilers extinguished, all hands were bailing for their lives: \"The main hull of the \"Destroyer\" is already a foot under water, and going on down\". The crew had no other option than to keep bailing and try to keep the ship afloat, as the vessel \"could not be insured for the voyage; nor would any company insure a life on board\". By the morning of the 16th the storm had abated, allowing the \"Destroyer\" to anchor to the south of Puerto Rico.\n\nAlthough the ship's best steam pump had been put out of action on 19 December, more favourable seas allowed the crew to reach Martinique, where repairs were made before again setting sail on 5 January 1894. On 18 January the \"Destroyer\" arrived at Fernando de Noronha, an island some 175 miles from the coast of Brazil, before finally reaching Recife, Pernambuco, on the 20th.\n\nSlocum wrote: \"My voyage home from Brazil in the canoe \"Liberdade\", with my family for crew and companions, some years ago, although a much longer voyage was not of the same irksome nature\".\n\nAt Pernambuco, the \"Destroyer\" joined up with the Brazilian navy and the crew was again engaged in repairs as the long tow in heavy seaways had severed rivets at the bow, resulting in leaks.\n\nWet powder led to a failed test firing of the submarine gun and the ship was grounded to remove the projectile. But the strain of the swell led to a further leak. Following further repairs the \"Destroyer\" made for Bahia with replenishments of powder for the Brazilian fleet, arriving on 13 February. Once there, however, Admiral Goncalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the \"Destroyer\" on a rock in the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.\n\nIn Fairhaven, Massachusetts, he rebuilt the gaff rigged sloop oyster boat named \"Spray\".\n\nOn April 24, 1895, he set sail from Boston, Massachusetts. In his famous book, \"Sailing Alone Around the World\", now considered a classic of travel literature, he described his departure in the following manner:\n\nAfter an extended visit to his boyhood home at Brier Island and visiting old haunts on the coast of Nova Scotia, Slocum departed North America at Sambro Island Lighthouse near Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 3, 1895.\n\nSlocum intended to sail eastward around the world, using the Suez Canal, but when he got to Gibraltar he realized that sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because of the piracy that still went on there at that time. So he decided to sail westward, in the southern hemisphere. He headed to Brazil, and then the Straits of Magellan. At that point he was unable to start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually he made his way to Australia, sailed north along the east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and then headed back to North America.\n\nSlocum navigated without a chronometer, instead relying on the traditional method of dead reckoning for longitude, which required only a cheap tin clock for approximate time, and noon-sun sights for latitude. On one long passage in the Pacific, Slocum also famously shot a lunar distance observation, decades after these observations had ceased to be commonly employed, which allowed him to check his longitude independently. However, Slocum's primary method for finding longitude was still dead reckoning; he recorded only one lunar observation during the entire circumnavigation.\n\nSlocum normally sailed the \"Spray\" without touching the helm. Due to the length of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the \"Spray\" was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the helm fast. He sailed west across the Pacific without once touching the helm.\n\nMore than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to Newport, Rhode Island, having circumnavigated the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000 km). Slocum's return went almost unnoticed. The Spanish–American War, which had begun two months earlier, dominated the headlines. After the end of major hostilities, many American newspapers published articles describing Slocum's amazing adventure.\n\nIn 1899 he published his account of the epic voyage in \"Sailing Alone Around the World\", first serialized in \"The Century Magazine\" and then in several book-length editions. Reviewers received the slightly anachronistic age-of-sail adventure story enthusiastically. Arthur Ransome went so far as to declare, \"Boys who do not like this book ought to be drowned at once.\" In his review, Sir Edwin Arnold wrote, \"I do not hesitate to call it the most extraordinary book ever published.\"\n\nSlocum's book deal was an integral part of his journey: his publisher had provided Slocum with an extensive on-board library, and Slocum wrote several letters to his editor from distant points around the globe.\n\nSlocum's \"Sailing Alone\" won him widespread fame in the English-speaking world. He was one of eight invited speakers at a dinner in honor of Mark Twain in December 1900. Slocum hauled the \"Spray\" up the Erie Canal to Buffalo, New York for the Pan-American Exposition in the summer of 1901, and he was well compensated for participating in the fair.\n\nIn 1901, Slocum's book revenues and income from public lectures provided him enough financial security to purchase a small farm in West Tisbury, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts. After a year and a half, he found he could not adapt to a settled life and Slocum sailed the \"Spray\" from port to port in the northeastern US during the summer and the West Indies during the winter, lecturing and selling books wherever he could. Slocum spent little time with his wife on the Vineyard and preferred life aboard the \"Spray\", usually wintering in the Caribbean.\n\nSlocum's mental health deteriorated during his later years. Visiting Riverton, New Jersey in May 1906, Slocum was charged with raping a 12-year-old girl. After further investigation and questioning, it became apparent that the crime was indecent exposure, but Slocum claimed to have no memory of any wrongdoing and that, if anything had happened, it must have occurred during one of his mental lapses. Slocum spent 42 days in jail awaiting trial. At his trial he pleaded \"no contest\" and was released for time-served. The judge at his trial told him, \"upon request of the family, I can deal leniently with you\".\n\nA few weeks after his conviction in New Jersey, Slocum and the \"Spray\" visited Sagamore Hill, the estate of US President Theodore Roosevelt on the north shore of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum's solo circumnavigation. The President's young son, Archie, along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the \"Spray\", which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the White House in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, \"Captain, our adventures have been a little different.\" Slocum answered, \"That is true, Mr. President, but I see you got here first.\"\n\nBy 1909, Slocum's funds were running low; book revenues had tailed off. He prepared to sell his farm on Martha's Vineyard and began to make plans for a new adventure in South America. He had hopes of another book deal.\n\nOn November 14, 1909, Slocum set sail for the West Indies on one of his usual winter voyages. He had also expressed interest in starting his next adventure, exploring the Orinoco, Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers. Slocum was never heard from again. In July 1910, his wife informed the newspapers that she believed he was lost at sea.\n\nAt the time, most who knew Slocum believed that the \"Spray\" had been run down by a steamer or struck by a whale, the \"Spray\" being too sound a craft and Slocum too experienced a mariner for any other cause to be considered likely.\n\nDespite being an experienced mariner, Slocum never learned to swim and considered learning to swim to be useless.\n\nIn 1924, Joshua Slocum was declared legally dead.\n\nJoshua Slocum's achievements have been well publicised and honoured. The name \"Spray\" has become a choice for cruising yachts ever since the publication of Slocum's account of his circumnavigation. Over the years, many versions of \"Spray\" have been built from the plans in Slocum's book, more or less reconstructing the sloop with various degrees of success.\n\nSimilarly, the French long-distance sailor Bernard Moitessier christened his ketch-rigged boat \"Joshua\" in honor of Slocum. It was this boat that Moitessier sailed from Tahiti to France, and he also sailed \"Joshua\" in the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race around the world, making great time, only to abandon the race near the end and sail on to the Polynesian Islands.\n\nFerries named in Slocum's honour (\"Joshua Slocum\" and \"Spray\") served the two Digby Neck runs in Nova Scotia between 1973 and 2004. The \"Joshua Slocum\" was featured in the film version of \"Dolores Claiborne\".\n\nAn underwater glider—an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), designed by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, was named after Slocum's ship \"Spray\". It became the first AUV to cross the Gulf Stream, while operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Another AUV has been named after Slocum himself: the Slocum Electric Glider, designed by Douglas Webb of Webb Research (since 2008, Teledyne Webb Research).\n\nIn 2009, a Slocum glider, modified by Rutgers University, crossed the Atlantic in 221 days. The RU27 traveled from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to Baiona, Pontevedra, Spain — the port where Christopher Columbus landed on his return from his first voyage to the New World. Like Slocum himself, the Slocum glider is capable of traveling over thousands of kilometers. These gliders continue to be used by various research institutions, including Texas A&M University's Department of Oceanography and Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG), to explore the Gulf of Mexico and other bodies of water.\n\nA monument to Slocum exists on Brier Island, Nova Scotia, not far from his family's boot shop. Slocum is commemorated in museum exhibits at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum near his birthplace. Several biographies about Slocum are published.\n\nThe Slocum River in Dartmouth, Massachusetts was named for him, as was a newly discovered plant in Mauritius while he was there: \"Returning to the \"Spray\" by way of the great flower conservatory near Moka, the proprietor, having only that morning discovered a new and hardy plant, to my great honor named it 'Slocum'\". Slocum himself discovered an island by accident, and named it \"Alan Erric Island\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28599866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28599866", "title": "Kirkwood Estate, East Ayrshire", "text": "Kirkwood Estate, East Ayrshire\n\nThe Lands of Kirkwood (NS3947) formed a small estate in the Parish of Stewarton, East Ayrshire lying between Stewarton and Dunlop, which in 1678 became part of the lands of Lainshaw, known as the Lainshaw, Kirkwood and Bridgehouse Estate. Kirkwood was anciently known as Bloak Cunninghame. Kirkwood remains as a farm in 2010.\n\nKirkwood was the possession of the Niven family for several generations from circa 1532. John Niving (sic), a notary public held the property in the early 17th century and died in December 1616. His son, also John Niven, is on record in September 1606. The wife of John Niven was Kathrein Fairnlie and his children were Hew and Christiane Nevingis. In January 1635, James Nevein (sic) is on record as the heir to his grandfather James Nevein of Kirkwood in the two and a half merk land of Kirkwood.\n\nStephen Nevin, was the father of James Nevin, the first laird of Kirkwood. At Edinburgh, on 15 December 1543, Christine Boyd daughter of Patrick Boyd in Clerkland near Stewarton, married John Nevin son and heir apparent of James Nevin of Kirkwood. James had held the nearby lands of Nether Oldhall with mansion, houses, tenants, etc.\n\nJohn Nevin, the third laird of Kirkwood, and Christine Boyd his wife, had a son John; the fourth laird of Kirkwood. In 1579 the estate of Oldhall was granted to Adam Cunningham of Colynane and Jean Mure his wife, which had been held by John Nevin son and heir of John Nevin of Kirkwood, and liferent of John the elder and Christian Boyd mother of the said John younger.\n\nThe marriage contract of John Nevin is dated 9 December 1580. The King granted to John Neving younger, son and heir apparent of John Nevin of Kirkwood, and Cristine Montomerie his wife, half of the 2½ mercates of the lands of Kirkwood. John Elder resigned personally in favour of John Younger and Cristine. John elder and Cristine Boyd his wife kept the free tenement of one half of the lands with the dwelling house.\n\nThe fifth laird of Kirk wood was also named John Nevin, and his wife was Katherine Fairnellie, Hew and Christine Nevings being their children. The inventory of his estate in 1618 showed it to be free from debt, the value amounting to £313. Their son Hugh, died before succeeding, leaving a son James as sixth laird of Kirkwood, who is retoured heir male of John Nevin of Kirkwood, his grandfather, 22 January 1635, in the 2½ lands of Kirkwood. James married Margaret Montgomery, but left no children and the property passes to Hugh Nevin, seventh laird of Kirkwood.\n\nHugh Nevin had been portioner of Auchenmade and inherited the 2½ merklands of Kirkwood called Kirkwode-Nevein. Hugh Nevin, was a baillie burgess of Irvine and Jonet Pawtoun was his wife. Hugh was the brother of Andrew Nevin of Monkredding. Jonet died 28 April 1591, her will mentions one child, a daughter, also Jonet. Whether there was a son Hugh who became portioner of Achinmade or whether it was Andrew's son is not clear. Stephan of Oldhall may have been the common ancestor of the Kirkwood and Monkredding families.\n\nHugh of Kirkwood died in December 1645, and Hugh, his son, succeeded him. The sum of the inventory was £662-13-8. Hugh of Kirkwood was baillie to Sir Alexander Cunningham as appears in Corshill Baron-Court Book, 7 March 1673, \"Court holden within the hall of Corshill, the threttene day of January 1673 be the Rycht honourabill Sir Alexander Cunyhame of Corshil, and Hughe Niven of Kirkwood, his honouris balizee, with all other members needful.\"\n\nOn 25 July 1666, a summons was issued of \"Hew Neving of Kirkwood against John Richie in Byres of Kilwinning, for non-payment of £67 being the silver maill and duty of the lands of Darnboig, which belong to the pursuer.\" Darnboig, was in 1585, the property of Hugh Nevin, brother of Andrew Nevin of Monkredding.\n\nHugh appears to have been the last of Nevin laird of Kirkwood; on 2 May 1667, the lands were incorporated into the Eglinton estates. A charter reads:\"Charter, granting to Hugh, Earl of Eglinton, Lord Montgomery and Kilwinning his heirs &c the 2½ merk lands of the same called Kirkwood Neivine with building etc, the 2½ merk lands of Craiglie with the commomty of Large &c . . . all of which lands (except Kirkwood Neivine and Craglis) formerly belonged to Hugh, Earl of Eglinton, Kirkwood Neivine to Hugh Neivine of Kirkwood, and Craiglie to Robert Montgomerie of Heaslehead, and were resigned by them for new infeftments.\"\n\nHugh Nevin died in September 1677 and Agnes Dick was his wife. A will, dated at Over Kirkwood, 28 August 1677, states \"the said umquhile Hew Nevin of Kirkwood, he ordains that his body be buried in the churchyard of Kilwinning in his father's burial place of Kilwinning\".\n\nThe Baron-Baillie was the principal administrative officer of a barony court, his insignia of office was a Cap of Justice, a Black legal Robe, and a medal of office on a chain. The Corsehill Baron-Court records show that Hughe Niven of Kirkwood was one of the baillies from at least January 1673 as he participates as the \"honouris balizee' of Sir Alexander Cunynghame of Corshil (sic) from that date Another baillie at this time was one John Deanes, a merchant of the Kirkton of Stewarton. The last record of a Hew Nevine of Kirkwood as baillie in 1677 as he died in September of that year.\n\nA David Stewart of Kirkwood is named as the baillie to the Corsehill court from November 1680 for Sir Alexander Cuninghame, however by 1698 he is baillie to David Boyle of Kelburn.\n\nThe position of baillie was a powerful one and they had many ways of making money for themselves, such as the bailie's 'darak', as it was called, or a day's labour in the year from every tenant on the estate; confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and effects of such as suffered capitally; all fines for killing game, blackfish, or cutting green wood were laid on by themselves, and sometimes went into their own pockets. The level of fines was not closely regulated. Another lucrative right was the so called 'Herial Horse', which was the best horse, cow, ox, or other article which any tenant on the estate possessed at the time of his death. This was taken from the widow and children for the baillie, at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted to a great deal of extra income for the baillie of a large barony.\n\nThe surname was spelt Niven, Nevin, Nevins, Nivens, Navin, Newin, Nevane, Niffen, Nifen, Nephin, Niving, Neving, Neiven, and Nivine. It is derived from 'little saint' and is recorded in Ayrshire and Galloway from the end of the 13th century.\n\nThe small tower house, later a mansion, of Monkredding House near Kilwinning, was held by the Nievans or Nevins from at least the 16th to the late 17th centuries, being passed to the Cunninghams of Clonbeith by William Nevin in 1698. \nThe Nevins of Kirkwood, along with the Nevins of Kilwinning were exiled to Ireland at the end of the 18th Century. These Nevins were, as previously stated, related to the Nevin's of Kirkwood. Thomas Nevin built the present house in 1602; it was extended in 1905.\n\nA James Nevin of Drumbuie was a witness to the will of Hugh Nevin of Kirkwood in 1677.\n\nThe 1799 plan records a number of properties within the Kirkwood Estate, namely Gunshill, Smiddy Farm, Townend, Drawkiln, Coldhame, Bloak Mill, Bowhouse, Bloak North Crofts, Bloak South Crofts, Bankend, South Bloakhill Head, West Bloakhill Head, East Bloakhill Head, South Bloak Holm, North Bloak Holm, Law, Moss House, Waulkmill, Struthers, Moss Park, Lugton, Brae, Kirkwood Moss, and the Cottar houses in Bloak. The estate came to a land area of , with the Lainshaw Estate totalling .\n\nTownhead of Kirkwood's entrance previously ran up to the Kirkwood lane. The nearby Bloak Moss behind Law Farm was previously known as Kirkwood Moss. In 1922 Richard John Cunninghame of Lainshaw sold Townhead of Kirkwood to James and Thomas Paterson, Farmers.\n\nIn 1779 a mansion still stood at Kirkwood near the middle of a small enclosure, with an apparently raised area in front, delineated by trees. The first 6-inch OS map shows a well laid out garden complex in front of Kirkwood, corresponding to the raised area shown on the 1779 map, with paths that led, following field boundaries, to the old toll road near North Kilbride Farm. In 1799 a 'smiddy park' is shown with three buildings to the west of the house. Gunshill nearby is shown as a single building with a small enclosure in front of it. The field or 'Park' names of Kirkwood and Gunshill are of interest, including Whin, Johnshill, Stone, Byrestead, Gooseward, Ward, Wood, Long Crooks, Hillock Holm and the Chapel-lands across the road. \n\nThe 1775 map shows a mansion house surrounded by substantial woodland policies, as does Thomson's map of 1820. William Aiton's map of 1808 shows a mansion house at Kirkwood.\n\nA field going by the curious name of 'Kilwinning Butts' was located on the Lands of Kirkwood on the road leading to Dunlop Church in the 19th century.\n\nWhinstone, limestone and sandstone quarries were present in the area, with a limekiln near Kirkwood itself. The Spout Lynn is a waterfall on the Gunshill Burn near Kirkwood.\n\nGouknest Park lies nearby and coal pits are shown in the area in 1799, as well as at North Kilbride, where a Coalpit Park is recorded. Gouknest produced gas coal and was abandoned in November 1903.\n\nThe plethora of apparently religious names in this area – Kirkwood, Chapel-lands Park, Kirkmuirs, Kirkhill, Lady Moss, High Cross, Canaan and the Kilbride farms, suggest that in the past pre-Christian and/or Christian site or sites were located here. No documentary evidence remains and the earliest record is for Kirkry in 1654, now Kilbride. Bride, Brigit or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of Imbolc, held on the eve of the first of February. Brigid was the goddess of Spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells. The name Canaan at Kirkmuir was in use as early as 1779.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century several Niven brothers from Monkridding and Brigend areas of Kilwinning parish moved to the Girvan area. John Niven set up as a blacksmith and was well known for designing a building a cart, with wheels that rotated on a fixed axle, at a time when most farmers still used sleds.\nIt is thought that John is the smith mentioned in Robert Burns's poem 'Tam o'Shanter' and his son Robert may have been the miller in the classic poem.\n\nA Mill of Kilbride and the mill lands of Kilbride are recorded in the register of sasines.\n\nStories of ghosts at North Kilbride include an old man often seen in a rocking chair and horses cantering by onto the abandoned road to Irvinehill Farm.\n\n\nNotes;\nSources;\n\n"}

The journey is most often attempted by cyclists and walkers as a challenge route with the goal of raising money for charities. As the crow flies, the two points are apart. The shortest road distance from Malin to Mizen is approximately . The distance of the routes commonly taken have been reported as between 644 and 715 km (400 and 444 miles).\nA record cycling time of 19 hours 3 mins was set in 1993 by Alex Barry. However, the route is most commonly completed in around 5–6 days by cyclists.\nThe charity Marie Curie Cancer Care uses the route as a fundraising opportunity and provides logistical support for cyclists who are able to raise a minimum sponsorship amount and pay a registration fee.\nIn July 2014, 26 members of the Over The Hill Cycling Club from Watergrasshill in County Cork completed the cycle from Mizen Head to Malin Head in 23 hours (21:16:15 moving time). The cycle was organised to raise funds for Pieta House, the centre for the prevention of self-harm or suicide. \nCLIC Sargent, the children and young people's cancer charity, also holds a Malin to Mizen cycle challenge, as does the Neurofibromatosis Association of Ireland, where again logistical support and accommodation are provided for cyclists who raise a minimum sponsorship amount. \nBetween 3–5 August 2012, Irish Ultra-Distance Cyclist Ricky Geoghegan became the first person to cycle non-stop from \nMalin Head to Mizen Head and back to Malin Head on a route of 773.2 miles, setting an Ultra Marathon Cycling Association Record\n(UMCA) with a time of 2 days, 7 hours, and 37 minutes.\n\nThe route was attempted by a resident of Tyrone Robbie Lowe on 1.2-metre (4 foot) stilts in 1997 as a charity fundraising venture.\n\nIn 2002, Vinnie Kelly and Danny Farren from the nearby community of Glengad walked from Mizen to Malin in 12 days. They raised over €45,000 for local charities.\nStephen O'Reilly Mariead Rooney and Ciara 'O'Hara walked from Malin head to Mizen over two weeks in 2009 to raise money for Marie Curie.\n\nIn July 2013, Joshua Moore and Matthew Sloan (both 17) walked along the west coast of Ireland from Mizen Head to Malin Head unaided, covering over 550 miles. They raised over £5000 for Friends of the Cancer Centre in Belfast. \n\nIn August 2013, Mikey Regan (31) from Galway City walked a route from Malin Head to Mizen Head in 15 days for The Coombe Neonatal Hospital, Dublin.\n\nThe GeriHatrics, Adrian Diver (71) a native of Moville, Co Donegal, Ben Hilliard (68) from Navan Co Meath and Peter Richmond (64) from Dorset did the walk from Mizen Head 14 May 2014 to Malin Head 6 June 2014, covering .\n\nAgain, Mikey Regan Galway City walked Malin - Mizen Head in 11 days - 23 June to 3 July 2015. He walked an average of 64 km/40 miles a day clocking up a total of 706 km/439 miles.\n\nCasey Higgins-King (22), originally from West Cork, walked from Mizen to Malin from 10 September to 25 September 2015 as a fundraiser for ICS Progressio, a charity that works in developing countries in the fight against inequality and poverty. \n\nIn June 2016 Lorcan Doyle aged 14 from Kilkenny walked from Mizen to Malin in 15 days with his father Robert. They covered a distance of 616 km in aid of a local Kilkenny charity Teach Tom.\n\nBetween 5 and 10 July 2011, Welsh International ultra-runner, Jennifer Salter (36), broke the existing End-to-End World Running record set by Ireland's Richard Donovan by over 14 hours by covering the distance in 4 days, 23 hours, 3 minutes and 10 seconds. From 25 to 29 March 2012, Sharon Gayter (UK) broke the record again with a time of 4 days, 1 hour, 39 minutes and 55 seconds (which was verified as the world record by the Book of Alternative Records). From 22 to 25 September 2012, Mimi Anderson (UK) broke the record once again with a time of 3 days 15 hours 36 minutes 23 seconds, as verified by Guinness World Records.\n\nFrom 29th April to 2nd May Irish International ultra-runner Eoin Keith broke the record by over 11 hours with a time of 3 days, 3 hours, 47 minutes.\n\nFrom 3 to 7 July 2011, Malcolm McLoughlin undertook the \"runningforpearl\" crossing, running 200 km and cycling 410 km to cover the 610 km from Mizen to Malin, to raise awareness for child autism.\n\nFrom 7 to 19 June 2009, four European friends (Alex, Raif, Alfred and Peter) \"ran\" their longboard skateboards the length of Ireland to raise awareness about the crisis in Zimbabwe and to raise support for the Elias Fund. They longboarded from Mizen Head to Malin Head in twelve days.\n\nFrom 8 to 18 September 2016, Mannix \"Microscooter-Man\" McAlister scooted his microscooter the length of Ireland to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support.

R. Bown, which discusses the age of \"heroic commerce\" through biographical profiles of six of the leading \"merchant kings\" of the great chartered companies which held colonial trade monopolies: Jan Pieterszoon Coen of the Dutch East India Company, Pieter Stuyvesant of the Dutch West India Company, Robert Clive of the English East India Company, Alexander Baranov of the Russian American Company, George Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company, and Cecil John Rhodes of the British South Africa Company.\n\nEach of these companies blurred the line between corporation and state, taking on certain roles of civil government over its employees, customers, and native peoples and settlers within their domains. The men who ran them operated with impunity, far from the oversight and control of their home countries' governments and their companies' directors (many of whom never stepped foot on the territories whose commerce they profited from). These men, often from humble beginnings, grew fantastically wealthy and powerful through the activities of their companies, while serving as quasi-official representatives of their home government—roles which were often at odds. They achieved their successes as much through military conquest and treachery—against their competitors, their employees, and native peoples—as through equitable trade. Though each helped to shape the modern world, their reputations are largely tarnished by their moral failings.\n\nMainstream reviews of the book were mixed. \"The New York Times\" criticized the book, finding \"problems with Mr. Bown’s approach. His focus on individuals means that the book deals with the companies themselves in only the most glancing way, and what analysis he offers is less than eye-opening...The ideal reader of \"Merchant Kings\" would appear to be an eighth-grade boy. Both the prose and the analysis are simplistic, occasionally purple — soldiers are not shot but 'blasted' — and largely devoid of business insight.\" However, the \"Times\" credited the book for its \"easily digestible overview\" of the period, and praised Bown's coining of the phrase \"the Age of Heroic Commerce\".\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" was also critical of the author's decision to structure the book around the biographies of the companies' leaders, declaring, \"Mr. Bown writes smoothly, but he appears to have done no original research and his potted biographies are linked by the barest of thematic threads.\" The \"Journal\" concluded that \"\"Merchant Kings\" is not a robust popular history but a flimsy one, a collection of anecdotes strung together by generalizations.\"\n\nHowever, \"The Globe and Mail\" praised the book as an \"ingenious\" distillation of multinational history, and noted that \"though Bown focuses on individuals, he does not leave states and companies to plead innocence.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" called the book \"a magnificent description of the six great companies, and their leaders\".\n"}

The population was 20,837 at the 2010 census and estimated 20,407 in 2014. Nogales forms part of the larger Tucson-Nogales combined statistical area, with a total population of 1,027,683 as of the 2010 Census. The city is the county seat of Santa Cruz County.\n\nNogales, Arizona, borders the city of Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, and is Arizona's largest international border community. The southern terminus of Interstate 19 is located in Nogales at the U.S.-Mexico border; the highway continues south into Mexico as Mexico Federal Highway 15. The highways meeting in Nogales are a major road intersection in the CANAMEX Corridor, connecting Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Nogales also is the beginning of the Arizona Sun Corridor, an economically important trade region stretching from Nogales to Prescott, including the Tucson and Phoenix metropolitan areas.\n\nNogales is home to four international ports of entry, including the Morley Pedestrian Port of Entry, Dennis Deconcini Pedestrian and Passenger Vehicle Port of Entry, Nogales International Airport, and the Mariposa Port of Entry. The Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry has twelve passenger vehicle inspection lanes and eight commercial inspection lanes.\n\nDue to its location on the border and its major ports of entry, Nogales funnels an estimated $30 billion worth of international trade into Arizona and the United States, per year, in fresh produce and manufactured goods from Mexico and the world through the deep sea port in Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico. This trade helps to support tens of thousands of jobs and the overall economies in Ambos Nogales and throughout the American state of Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora.\n\nKnown in O'odham as \"Nowa:l\", (which translates as \"prickly pear cactus\" or the Spanish \"nopal\") the name Nogales means \"black walnuts\" in Spanish, and the walnut trees which once grew abundantly in the mountain pass between the cities of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, can still be found around the town.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\n\nThe city is at an elevation of .\n\nNogales has a semi-arid steppe climate, which is less hot and more rainy than a typical arid climate classification such as Phoenix. In the winter months, Nogales averages in the mid to upper 60s, with January averaging daily highs of around . Lows typically settle just below the freezing mark () on a majority of nights, but it is not uncommon to see temperatures tumble below on some winter nights.\n\nOn the other hand, in the summer months, highs average between , with the month of June being the hottest with an average daytime high of . Nighttime lows for the summer months remain in the upper 50s and lower 60s for the duration of the season. The Arizona Monsoon generally runs through July and August, and these months typically see eight inches or more of combined rainfall, which brings the average annual precipitation for Nogales to about . Some monsoon season storms are capable of producing several inches of rain in a short amount of time, creating flash flood hazards.\n\nNogales’ all-time highest recorded temperature is , which was reached on June 26, 1990. The lowest recorded temperature was on December 8, 1978.\n\nThe name \"Nogales\" is derived from the Spanish word for \"walnut\" or \"walnut tree.\" It refers to the large stands of walnut trees that once stood in the mountain pass where Nogales is located.\n\nNogales was at the beginning of the 1775–1776 Juan Bautista de Anza Expedition as it entered the present day U.S. from New Spain, and the town is now on the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. On the second floor of the 1904 Nogales Courthouse is a small room dedicated to the 1775–1776 Anza Expedition.\n\nIn 1841, a land grant from the Mexican government to the Elías family established \"Los Nogales de Elías.\" Following the Gadsden purchase in 1853, Nogales became a part of the United States of America. In 1880, Russian immigrant Jacob Isaacson built a trading post at present-day Nogales. The U.S. Postal Service opened the Isaacson post office but renamed it as Nogales in 1883.\n\nIn 1915, according to historian David Leighton, Sonora Gov. Jose M. Maytorena ordered construction of an 11-wire fence, separating Nogales, Sonora from Nogales, Arizona, but it was taken down four months later.\n\nOn August 27, 1918, a battle between United States Army forces and Mexican militia - mostly civilian in composition - took place. Culminating as the result of a decade's worth of tensions originating from the Mexican Revolution and earlier battles in Nogales along the border in 1913 and 1915, the main consequence of the 1918 violence saw the building of the first permanent border wall between Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, along the previously unobstructed boundary line on International Street.\n\nThe economy of Nogales is heavily dependent on the cross-border trade through its Ports of Entry by produce distributors and American-based manufacturing plants in Nogales, Sonora and throughout the rest of the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa. Most of Nogales' economy is based on agribusiness and produce distributors, which comes from large farms in the Mexican agri-belt. Despite its small population, Nogales actually receives much patronage from its bordering sister-city, Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Most observers guess the population of Nogales, Sonora, at roughly 300,000. International commerce is a big part of Nogales’ economy. More than 60 percent of Nogales’ sales tax comes from the estimated 30,000 Mexican shoppers crossing the border daily. Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, are home to one of the largest maquiladora clusters. This enables American manufacturing plants on both sides of the border to take advantage of favorable wage and operating costs and excellent transportation and distribution networks.\n\nThe Consulate-General of Mexico in Nogales is located on 135 W. Cardwell St.\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security is a major economic driver in the Ambos Nogales region, with thousands of employees working for both the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection. Due to the large federal, state, and local police presence, Nogales has one of the highest police per-capita levels in the United States.\n\nThe largest employers in Nogales are:\n\nThe city of Nogales has a wide range of community facilities. These include nine parks, the Pimería Alta Historical Society Museum, an art gallery, Oasis Movie Theater, four recreation centers, four swimming pools, eight athletic fields, a library, six tennis courts and three golf courses. It has public elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. Its financial institutions include six banks. Its governmental agencies include a staffed city and local fire department and a city police department. It is home to Nogales International Airport, which includes a 7,200 ft. runway and a terminal with a customs facility, passenger waiting areas, and a coffee shop. It has two regional health care facilities, including Carondolet Holy Cross Hospital located at 1171 W Target Range Road, and Mariposa Health Clinic located at 1852 N Mastick Way.\n\nArea golf courses include:\n\nThe Nogales area is served by the Nogales Unified School District for K-12 education, including 5 elementary schools, two middle schools, Nogales High School, and Pierson Vocational High School. Institutions of higher learning include Cochise College, University of Arizona Santa Cruz, and University of Phoenix.\n\nCity Hall is located at 777 North Grand Avenue. The Police Department and Fire Department are both housed here, with Fire Station 2 located at 2751 N Grand Avenue. The City Recreation Center is located at 1500 N Hohokam Drive and has a basketball court and year-round swimming pool. Softball and a soccer field are found adjacent to the Recreation Center. Public Works is located at 1450 N Hohokam Drive. A waste transfer facility is located there for public use. A skate park, baseball stadium, and little league baseball field are located at 100 E Madison St.\n\nSanta Cruz County administrative offices, courts, and jail are located at 2150 N Congress Drive in Nogales.\n\nThe county of Santa Cruz and the city of Nogales have 200 properties listed in the National Register of Historic Sites, including Tumacacori National Monument first visited by Father Eusebio Kino in 1691 and Tubac Presidio, established by the Spanish in 1752 on an Indian village site. Others include the Old Tubac Schoolhouse, Old Nogales City Hall, Santa Cruz County Courthouse, and Patagonia Railroad Depot. The Patagonia-Sonoita Creek Sanctuary, 19 miles east, attracts worldwide visitors to see its diverse bird life. It is also host to ghost towns and mining camps, curio shops, first-class restaurants and night clubs.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Historical Courthouse on Morley Street/Court Street has the statue of Lady Justice on top of the building. The Nogales version of Lady Justice is not wearing a blindfold.\n\nThe architecturally rich downtown area of Nogales near the Mexican–American border offers a unique opportunity for visitors to experience the downtown border-style shopping setting similar to those from the mid-20th century. Interesting architecture and historical homes along Crawford and Court Streets provide a glimpse of border life at its peak during that time period. A day trip to old Nogales, Sonora reveals many of the same architectural uniqueness.\n\nSeveral state parks and recreation areas are located close to Nogales, including Patagonia State Park, Peña Blanca Lake, Parker Canyon Lake, and Coronado National Forest. The Wine Country of Sonoita-Elgin is also located 20 miles east of Nogales.\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 20,878 people, 5,985 households, and 4,937 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,002.1 people per square mile (387.0/km²). There were 6,501 housing units at an average density of 312.0 per square mile (120.5/km²).

The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.3 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $28,044, and the median income for a family was $24,637. Males had a median income of $24,636 versus $18,403 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,440. About 30.8% of families and 32.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.2% of those under age 18 and 32.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\nThe City of Nogales operates under a council-manager form of government in which the mayor is elected to a 4-year term and has a single vote on the city council. The council then hires a city manager to run the day-to-day operations of the city. The 6 city council members are elected at-large to 4-year terms.\n\n\n\nNogales is located at the south end of Interstate 19.

{"id": "17696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17696", "title": "Slippery slope", "text": "Slippery slope\n\nA slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a consequentialist logical device in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect. The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences. The strength of such an argument depends on the warrant, i.e. whether or not one can demonstrate a process that leads to the significant effect. This type of argument is sometimes used as a form of fear mongering, in which the probable consequences of a given action are exaggerated in an attempt to scare the audience. The fallacious sense of \"slippery slope\" is often used synonymously with continuum fallacy, in that it ignores the possibility of middle ground and assumes a discrete transition from category A to category B. In a non-fallacious sense, including use as a legal principle, a middle-ground possibility is acknowledged, and reasoning is provided for the likelihood of the predicted outcome.\n\nOther idioms for the slippery slope argument are the \"thin end/edge of the wedge\", the \"camel's nose in the tent\", or \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\".\n\nSome writers distinguish between a slippery slope \"event\" and a slippery slope \"argument\". A slippery slope event can be represented by a series of conditional statements, namely:\nThe idea being that through a series of intermediate steps p will imply z. Some writers point out that strict necessity isn't required and it can still be characterized as a slippery slope if at each stage the next step is plausible. This is important for with strict implication p will imply z but if at each step the probability is say 90% then the more steps there are the less likely it becomes that p will cause z.\n\nA slippery slope \"argument\" is typically a negative argument where there is an attempt to dissuade someone from taking a course of action because if they do it will lead to some unacceptable conclusion. Some writers point out that an argument with the same structure might be used in a positive way in which someone is encouraged to take the first step because it leads to a desirable conclusion.\n\nIf someone is \"accused\" of using a slippery slope argument then it is being suggested they are guilty of fallacious reasoning and whilst they are claiming that p implies z, for whatever reason, this is not the case. In logic and critical thinking textbooks slippery slopes and slippery slope arguments are normally discussed as a form of fallacy although there may be an acknowledgement that non-fallacious forms of the argument can also exist.\n\nDifferent writers have classified slippery slope arguments in different and often contradictory ways, but there are two basic types of argument that have been described as slippery slope arguments. One type has been called \"the causal slippery slope\", and the distinguishing feature of this type is that the various steps leading from p to z are events with each event being the cause of the next in the sequence. The second type might be called \"the judgmental slippery slope\" with the idea being that the 'slope' does not consist of a series of events but is such that, for whatever reason, if a person makes one particular judgment they will rationally have to make another and so on. The judgmental type may be further sub-divided into conceptual slippery slopes and decisional slippery slopes.\n\nConceptual slippery slopes, which Trudy Govier calls \"the fallacy of slippery assimilation\", are closely related to the sorites paradox so, for example, in the context of talking about slippery slopes Merilee Salmon can say, \"The slippery slope is an ancient form of reasoning. According to van Fraassen (\"The Scientific Image\"), the argument is found in Sextus Empiricus that incest is not immoral, on the grounds that 'touching your mother's big toe with your little finger is not immoral, and all the rest differs only by degree.'\"\n\nDecisional slippery slopes are similar to conceptual slippery slopes in that they rely on there being a continuum with no clear dividing lines such that if you decide to accept one position or course of action then there will, either now or in the future, be no rational grounds for not accepting the next position or course of action in the sequence.\n\nThe difficulty in classifying slippery slope arguments is that there is no clear consensus in the literature as to how terminology should be used. It has been said that whilst these two fallacies \"have a relationship which may justify treating them together\", they are also distinct, and \"the fact that they share a name is unfortunate\". Some writers treat them side by side but emphasize how they differ. Some writers use the term \"slippery slope\" to refer to one kind of argument but not the other, but don't agree on which one, whilst others use the term to refer to both. So, for example, \n\nWalton suggests Alfred Sidgwick should be credited as the first writer on informal logic to describe what would today be called a slippery slope argument.\nSidgwick says this is \"popularly known as the objection to a thin end of a wedge\" but might be classified now as a decisional slippery slope. However, the wedge metaphor also captures the idea that unpleasant end result is a wider application of a principle associated with the initial decision which is often a feature of decisional slippery slopes due to their incremental nature but may be absent from causal slippery slopes.\n\nT. Edward Damer, in his book \"Attacking Faulty Reasoning\", describes what others might call a causal slippery slope but says,\n\nInstead Damer prefers to call it the \"domino fallacy\". Howard Kahane suggests that the domino variation of the fallacy has gone out of fashion because it was tied the domino theory for the United States becoming involved in the war in Vietnam and although the U.S. lost that war \"it is primarily communist dominoes that have fallen\".\n\nFrank Saliger notes that \"in the German-speaking world the dramatic image of \"the dam burst\" seems to predominate, in English speaking circles talk is more of the slippery slope argument\" and that \"in German writing dam burst and slippery slope arguments are treated as broadly synonymous. In particular the structural analyses of slippery slope arguments derived from English writing are largely transferred directly to the dam burst argument.\" In exploring the differences between the two metaphors he comments that in the dam burst the initial action is clearly in the foreground and there is a rapid movement towards the resulting events whereas in the slippery slope metaphor the downward slide has at least equal prominence to the initial action and it \"conveys the impression of a slower 'step-by-step' process where the decision maker as participant slides inexorably downwards under the weight of its own successive (erroneous) decisions.\" Despite these differences Salinger continues to treat the two metaphors as being synonymous. Walton arges that although the two are comparable \"the metaphor of the dam bursting carries with it no essential element of a sequence of steps from an initial action through a gray zone with its accompanying loss of control eventuated in the ultimate outcome of the ruinous disaster. For these reasons, it seems best to propose drawing a distinction between dam burst arguments and slippery slope arguments.\"\n\nEric Lode notes that \"commentators have used numerous different metaphors to refer to arguments that have this rough form. For example, people have called such arguments \"wedge\" or \"thin edge of the wedge\", \"camel's nose\" or \"camel's nose in the tent\", \"parade of horrors\" or \"parade of horribles\", \"domino\", Boiling Frog and \"this could snowball\" arguments. All of these metaphors suggest that allowing one practice or policy could lead us to allow a series of other practices or policies.\" Bruce Waller says it is lawyers who often call it the \"parade of horribles\" argument while politicians seem to favor \"the camel's nose is in the tent\".\n\nGiven the disagreement over what constitutes a genuine slippery slope argument, it is to be expected that there are differences in the way they are defined. Lode says that \"although all SSAs share certain features, they are a family of related arguments rather than a class of arguments whose members all share the same form.\"\n\nVarious writers have attempted to produce a general taxonomy of these different kinds of slippery slope. Other writers have given a general definition that will encompass the diversity of slippery slope arguments. Eugene Volokh says, \"I think the most useful definition of a slippery slope is one that covers all situations where decision A, which you might find appealing, ends up materially increasing the probability that others will bring about decision B, which you oppose.\"\n\nThose who hold that slippery slopes are causal generally give a simple definition, provide some appropriate examples and perhaps add some discussion as to the difficulty of determining whether the argument is reasonable or fallacious. Most of the more detailed analysis of slippery slopes has been done by those who hold that genuine slippery slopes are of the decisional kind.\n\nLode, having claimed that SSAs are not a single class of arguments whose members all share the same form, nevertheless goes on to suggest the following common features.\nRizzo and Whitman identify slightly different features. They say, \"Although there is no paradigm case of the slippery slope argument, there are characteristic features of all such arguments. The key components of slippery slope arguments are three:\nWalton notes that these three features will be common to all slippery slopes but objects that there needs to be more clarity on the nature of the 'mechanism' and a way of distinguishing between slippery slope arguments and arguments from negative consequences.\n\nCorner et al. say that a slippery slope has \"four distinct components:\n\nThe alleged danger lurking on the slippery slope is the fear that a presently unacceptable proposal (C) will (by any number of psychological processes—see, e.g., ) in the future be re-evaluated as acceptable.\"\n\nWalton adds the requirement that there must be a loss of control. He says, there are four basic components, \"One is a first step, an action or policy being considered. A second is a sequence in which this action leads to other actions. A third is a so-called gray zone or area of indeterminacy along the sequence where the agent loses control. The fourth is the catastrophic outcome at the very end of the sequence. The idea is that as soon as the agent in question takes the first step he will be impelled forward through the sequence, losing control so that in the end he will reach the catastrophic outcome. Not all of these components are typically made explicit...\"\n\nLogic and critical thinking textbooks typically discuss slippery slope arguments as a form of fallacy but usually acknowledge that \"slippery slope arguments can be good ones if the slope is real—that is, if there is good evidence that the consequences of the initial action are highly likely to occur. The strength of the argument depends on two factors. The first is the strength of each link in the causal chain; the argument cannot be stronger than its weakest link. The second is the number of links; the more links there are, the more likely it is that other factors could alter the consequences.\"\n\nIf the conditional \"if p then…z\" is understood strictly then slippery slope arguments about the real world are likely to fall short of the standards required for sound deductive reasoning and might be dismissed as a fallacy but, as Walton points out, slippery slope arguments are not formal proofs, they are practical arguments about likely consequences. Rizzo says, \"first and foremost, slippery slopes are slopes of arguments: One practical argument tends to lead to another, which means that one justified action, often a decision, tends to lead to another. When we say that one argument (and its supported action) tends to lead to another, we mean that it makes the occurrence of the subsequent argument more likely, not that it necessarily makes it highly likely or, still less, inevitable. Hence the transition between arguments is not based on strict logical entailment.\" Essentially, if accepting p raises the probability of z sufficiently that the risk of it happening passes a tolerable threshold the argument will be considered reasonable. There is, of course, considerable room for disagreement as to the likelihood of z occurring and what would be a tolerable level of risk.\n\nKahane says, \"The slippery slope fallacy is committed only when we accept without further justification or argument that once the first step is taken, the others are going to follow, or that whatever would justify the first step would in fact justify the rest.\" The problem then arises as to how to evaluate the likelihood that certain steps would follow.\n\nVolokh's article \"The Mechanisms of the Slippery Slope\" sets out to examine the various ways in which making one decision might render another decision more likely. He considers such things as implementing A making B more cost effective and implementing A changing attitudes such that acceptance of B will become more likely. He says, \"If you are faced with the pragmatic question \"Does it make sense for me to support A, given that it might lead others to support B?,\" you should consider all the mechanisms through which A might lead to B, whether they are logical or psychological, judicial or legislative, gradual or sudden ... You should think about the entire range of possible ways that A can change the conditions—whether those conditions are public attitudes, political alignments, costs and benefits, or what have you—under which others will consider B.\" Volokh concludes by claiming that the analysis in his article \"implicitly rebuts the argument that slippery slope arguments are inherently logically fallacious: the claim that A's will inevitably lead to B's as a matter of logical compulsion might be mistaken, but the more modest claim that A's may make B's more likely seems plausible.\" A similar conclusion was reached by Corner et al., who after investigating the psychological mechanism of the slippery slope argument say, \"Despite their philosophical notoriety, SSAs are used (and seem to be accepted) in a wide variety of practical contexts. The experimental evidence reported in this paper suggests that in some circumstances, their practical acceptability can be justified, not just because the decision-theoretic framework renders them subjectively rational, but also because it is demonstrated how, objectively, the slippery slopes they claim do in fact exist.\n\n"}

{"id": "52999526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52999526", "title": "Tectonic evolution of Patagonia", "text": "Tectonic evolution of Patagonia\n\nPatagonia comprises the southernmost region of South America, portions of which lie either side of the Chile–Argentina border. It has traditionally been described as the region south of the Rio Colorado, although the physiographic border has more recently been moved southward to the Huincul fault. The region's geologic border to the north is composed of the Rio de la Plata craton and several accreted terranes comprising the La Pampa province. The underlying basement rocks of the Patagonian region can be subdivided into two large massifs: the North Patagonian Massif and the Deseado Massif. These massifs are surrounded by sedimentary basins formed in the Mesozoic that underwent subsequent deformation during the Andean orogeny.\n\nThe rocks comprising Patagonia occurred along the southwestern margin of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. During a period of continental rifting in the Cambrian period, a portion of Patagonia was separated from Gondwana, and the resulting passive margin that formed was a site of extensive sedimentation throughout the early-middle Paleozoic era. During the Devonian period, a transition to convergence resulted in the eventual collision of the Patagonian landmass in the late Paleozoic, with contact first occurring in the mid-Carboniferous. Several theories exist for the origin of the Patagonian landmass, though there are two that have greater consensus. The first of these theories cites an allochthonous origin of the Patagonian landmass from Gondwana during the Paleozoic, while the other argues that Northern Patagonia is an autochthonous component and that only the southern portion is allochthonous. The collision of Patagonia was succeeded by the rifting and eventual breakup of Gondwana during the early Mesozoic, a process which invoked large-scale rotation of the Patagonian landmass. Further extension through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods formed the Rocas Verdes back-arc basin, while a transition to a compressional tectonic regime in the Cenozoic concurrent with the Andean orogeny resulted in formation of the foreland Magallanes basin. \n\nPatagonia contain two ancient regions: the North Patagonian Massif and Deseado Massif. The lithospheric mantle beneath Deseado Massif formed 1000–2100 million years ago in the Paleo and Mesoproterozoic, evidencing that its lithosphere has a much older history than the ages of crustal rocks exposed at present would suggest (~600 million years). Deseado Massif has formed a single crustal block with the Falklands Islands since these times. Like today the Deseado Massif and the Falklands Islands lied next to each other in the Neoproterozoic supercontinent of Rodinia. The lithosphere of the North Patagonian Massif formed about the same. \n\nPrior to the collision of Patagonia, the nucleus of modern-day South America was contained within a portion of the southwest margin of Gondwana. This margin consisted of the ancient Rio de la Plata craton and a number of accreted terranes, whose boundaries have been discovered using paleomagnetic studies. The Rio de la Plata Craton is believed to have been a component of southwest Gondwana since the end of the Proterozoic, likely forming a single body with other Gondwanan crustal blocks. In the late Neoproterozoic-early Cambrian, the Pampia terrane collided with the western margin of the Rio de la Plata craton, resulting in the Pampean orogeny. Evidence indicates that this Pampia terrane is of parautochthonous Gondwanan origin, separated from Gondwana in an earlier event to later be re-accreted to its margin.\n\nThe Early Paleozoic tectonic regime in southwestern Gondwana involved a period of rifting during the Cambrian which affected the southern margin of the supercontinent, while at the same time the western margin experienced a compressional setting that saw the accretion of several exotic terranes. It has been hypothesized that following the Cambrian rifting event the Patagonian landmass collided with Antarctica, though evidence for this event is not conclusive.\n\nEarly Cambrian rifting of the southwestern Gondwana margin is evidenced by the presence of granites bearing an extensional geochemical signature in the Sierra de la Ventana fold belt north of the Patagonian limits. The occurrence of this rifting event is also documented in the Ellsworth Mountains of Antarctica, the Cape Fold Belt of South Africa, and the Falkland/Malvinas microplate (present day Falkland Islands), and resulted in the formation of a proto-Pacific passive margin. This rifting stage formed the final outline of southern Gondwana and is thought to have been the beginning of the supercontinent stage in Gondwana. Evidence found in rocks in the Tierra del Fuego region indicates that this Cambrian rifting event might have resulted in the separation of the southern tip of South America from Gondwana.\n\nThis rifting event and the detachment of a portion of Patagonia are agreed upon by the two prominent theories regarding Patagonia's origin; however, they disagree on the extent of the displaced terrane. The theory supporting an allochthonous Patagonia cites the entirety of the region, including the North Patagonian Massif, as being separated from southwestern Gondwana. Comparison of the paleomagnetic poles of Patagonia and Gondwana from the Devonian to Permian periods allows for the separation of the two landmasses by up to 1000 kilometres; however, though such a separation is permitted by the evidence, it is not required in order to explain differences in the pole positions. The autochthonous theory meanwhile states that the North Patagonian Massif was not separated during this event, and suggests that rifting resulted only in the separation of a terrane represented by the Deseado Massif.\n\nThe large, continuous passive margin produced during this rifting event led to the formation of several associated basins. Sediments derived from Gondwana infilled these basins throughout the early Paleozoic until the Devonian period, resulting in the accumulation of thick sedimentary units which later underwent extensive deformation due to the transition to a compressional tectonic regime.\n\nWhile rifting was occurring in the southern portion of Gondwana, the margin further west (along the proto-Andean belt) was experiencing a compressional regime that introduced several allochthonous terranes to the western margin of South America. The first of these, the Pampean orogeny (mentioned above), resulted in the accretion of the Pampia terrane. This was followed by the formation of the Famatina-Eastern Puna magmatic arc during the Famatinian orogeny in the Ordovician period, which culminated in the accretion of the Cuyania (Precordillera) terrane. Paleomagnetic evidence suggests that this Cuyania terrane is of Laurentian origin, and it has been hypothesized that the terrane may have been a plateau attached to Laurentia which was involved in the Cambrian rifting event and later accreted during collision between Laurentia and Gondwana. Geochronological evidence shows that the Famatinian magmatic belt extends south from the Andean margin into the North Patagonian massif, and paleomagnetic studies of these rocks indicate that separation between these bodies has not occurred at least since the Devonian, both lending support to the theory of an autochthonous component of Patagonia. Subduction continued along this margin, and in the late Devonian resulted in the collision and accretion of the Chilenia terrane to the western border of the Precordillera.\n\nWhile collision of Chilenia occurred north of the Huincul lineament south of it the Chaitenia terrane accreted to Patagonia in the Devonian. The metamorphosed rocks of Chaitenia crop out mainly in southern Chile and represent remants of an ancient island arc that existed next to Patagonia. After accretion, accretionary complexes developed west of Chaitenia, meaning Chaitenia constituted a backstop. \n\nFollowing the early Cambrian rifting event, Antarctica underwent a deformational event resulting in uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains in the mid-Cambrian, an event that has been ascribed to the Ross orogeny. It has recently been proposed that during middle to late Cambrian times Patagonia was accreted to East Antarctica, an event that led to the initiation of the Ross orogeny. Following this collision, a transition to extension in the late Ordovician-Silurian resulted in the separation of Patagonia from Antarctica and the formation of a passive margin. Deposition along this passive margin is represented by the Devonian-age lower section of the Beacon Supergroup. Proposed evidence for this connection exists in both the North Patagonian and Deseado Massifs, where remnants of the fossil species of archeocyathids have been discovered, a species preserved in the Shackleton Limestone of the Transantarctic Mountains. Additionally, segments of the Sierra Grande Formation in both massifs show possible correlation with the Beacon Supergroup bearing a common Devonian age. Correlation between granites found in northeastern Patagonia and others involved in the Ross orogeny has also been suggested, but such a connection is lacking geochronological evidence.\n\nLasting throughout the early to middle Paleozoic, rifting in the region was interrupted in the mid-Devonian when the tectonic scheme switched from an extensional to compressional one, a process that resulted in the collision of the Patagonian terrane with the southwestern Gondwanan margin. Subduction-related igneous rocks from beneath the North Patagonian Massif have been dated at 320–330 million years old, indicating that the subduction process initiated in the early Carboniferous. This was relatively short lived (lasting about 20 million years), and initial contact of the two landmasses occurred in the mid-Carboniferous, with broader collision during the early Permian. This collision resulted in the formation of two distinct magmatic and metamorphic belts in the North Patagonian Massif, one in the north and one in the west. Isotopic dating of zircon from the magmatic belts provides evidence that the activity forming the western magmatic arc ceased during the late Carboniferous and may have involved collision of the Antarctic Peninsula with the southwest margin. Deformation and metamorphism resulting from this terrane collision may have begun in the late Carboniferous period and continued into the Permian period. Such deformation is postulated to have had a role in the initiation of the Gondwanide Orogeny and formation of the Gondwanide Fold Belt, which includes the Sierra de la Ventana mountains north of Patagonia and the Cape Fold Belt of South Africa. The collisions in this portion of the southwest margin of Gondwana during this time were likely the precursor to the Terra Australis orogen that later affected this region. Also in the Late Paleozoic the two main landmasses of Patagonia; the North Patagonian Massif and Deseado Massif inferred to have collided following a period of subduction of the plate of Deseado Massif beneath the plate containing the North Patagonian Massif. This subduction is postulated to have eroded the lithospheric mantle beneath the North Patagonian Massif. \n\nAs the prominent tectonic models for Patagonian accretion to Gondwana differ in their interpretation of the extent of the terrane that was detached during the Cambrian rifting, by definition they disagree on the extent of the terrane that was accreted in the Permian.\n\nThe allochthonous theory hypothesizes that the entirety of Patagonia, including both basement massifs were separated from Gondwana during rifting in the Cambrian. One version of this model includes a hypothetical independent collision of the two massifs following rifting in the Cambrian to form the Patagonia terrane prior to its eventual collision with Gondwana. The two magmatic belts found in the North Patagonian Massif are inferred to represent collision of this portion of Patagonia against the margin of Gondwana following the closure of an ocean basin during convergence and subduction. By this model, the western belt in the North Patagonian Massif would have been formed due to subduction of oceanic crust under its southern margin, with termination of subduction resulting from collision of the Antarctic Peninsula during the mid-late Carboniferous. Meanwhile, the northern belt would have been created during subduction of oceanic crust underneath its northern margin. Geophysical studies in the region discovered a large subsurface structure along the northern Patagonian border, which cuts off the suture boundaries between the Rio de la Plata craton and its westward accreted terranes. This feature has been hypothesized as representing the suture zone of Patagonia with Gondwana.\n\nAccording to the autochthonous theory, the North Patagonian Massif is an autochthonous portion of former Gondwana that has been in its current position since at least the Ordovician. The Deseado Massif, however, is believed to be an allochthonous (or parautochthonous) component, detached from Gondwana during the Cambrian rifting episode and accreted again in the Permian. There is evidence that crustal magnetic signatures on either side of the Huincul fault zone are the same, indicating the North Patagonian Massif and southwestern Gondwana may have been one continuous landmass through the Paleozoic. The late Paleozoic collision then is believed to have occurred between the Deseado Massif and the southwestern edge of the North Patagonian Massif, with oceanic crust being subducted below the southern margin of the North Patagonian Massif to form the observed magmatic belts in that region.\n\nLate Permian break off of the subducting slab resulted in upwelling of the mantle and extensive melting of the crust followed by a transition to post-orogenic collapse, an episode which is preserved in the Choiyoi Group volcanic province. There is a possibility that the collision of the Deseado Massif terrane with the Gondwana margin may have produced a tear in the subducting slab, leading to its eventual break-off.\n\nFollowing the period of late Paleozoic convergence that led to the collision of Patagonia with Gondwana, a transition to extensional tectonics in the Triassic period induced rifting within Patagonia. This extension began northwest of Patagonia along the pre-existing suture zone between the Chilenia and Cuyania terranes and led to the formation of the Cuyo basin, among others. More widespread rifting began in the Jurassic, by which time the breakup of Gondwana was underway. This was accompanied by the initiation and evolution of the Southern Atlantic rift system which led to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. The extension led to formation of fault-bounded basins, including the Cañadon Asfalto Basin and Rocas Verdes Basin. Though initially a continental rift basin, the Rocas Verdes Basin transitioned to a back-arc basin with the introduction of proto-oceanic crust, for which evidence is preserved in the Sarmiento and Tortuga ophiolite sequences.\n\nDuring the early breakup of Gondwana and associated continental rifting, the Patagonian landmass underwent large-scale rotations. Paleomagnetic data from late Jurassic-early Cretaceous rocks in the southern portion of the North Patagonian Massif indicate that clockwise rotation of up to 30 degrees occurred in that area during the Early Cretaceous, affecting a crustal block at least tens of kilometers in size. Additional findings from within the Deseado Massif revealed that similar rotations occurred in that area as well, either during the same Early Cretaceous episode or in an earlier deformational event during the Late Jurassic. Similar processes are reported to have affected the Falkland Islands, and may have been operating at the same time as those in Patagonia. The mechanism behind these rotations is unclear, and evidence of associated deformational structures is scarce. It has been proposed that the Gastre Fault System is one such structure that accommodated much of the deformation involved with crustal rotations; however, this hypothesis lacks supporting evidence.\n\nDuring the Cretaceous, accelerating spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as increased subduction below the western margin caused a shift from extensional tectonics towards compression, concurrent with the initiation of the Andean orogeny. This transition resulted in inversion of the Rocas Verdes Basin and ultimately led to its closure in the Late Cretaceous. Associated with closure of the basin was the development of the Andean fold and thrust belt. Deep-water sediment deposition during the Late Cretaceous contractional phase formed the thick Cerro Toro Formation, and subsequent formations record the progressive movement of deposition from deep-water to shallow-water and ultimately deltaic environments.\n\nContinued compression through the Tertiary period and the associated horizontal shortening resulted in uplift and associated deformation of the Andean fold and thrust belt and provided exposure of formations within the Magallanes Basin. Though the sequence of deformational events leading to the present day formation is unclear, observational evidence from the region indicates that there were three notable periods of deformation, occurring in the Late Cretaceous period, the Oligocene epoch, and some time following the Miocene epoch. Reconstructions of the events that resulted in deformation of the basin are complicated by variability in the style and extent of deformation along the Patagonian Andes, ranging from intense folding and steep thrust faulting with accompanying metamorphism to broad fold sequences lacking metamorphism. However, evidence from sedimentary relationships and the absolute dating of igneous rocks cutting across sedimentary layers allow for the inference of the relative ages given above. Additional data from the dating of metamorphosed layers provide bracket ages for the timing of exhumation of the Magallanes Basin, and suggest that this basin, as well as the Andean fold-thrust belt, were exhumed from below the surface between 10 and 4 million years ago.\n\nThe Antarctic Plate started to subduct beneath South American 14 million years ago in the Miocene epoch. At first it subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the Chile Triple Junction lay near the Strait of Magellan. As the southern part of the Nazca Plate and the Chile Rise became consumed by subduction the more northerly regions of the Antarctic Plate began to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile Triple Junction lies at present offshore Taitao Peninsula at 46°15' S.\n\nThe eastern coast of Patagonia has experienced some considerable uplift during the Pleistocene as evidenced by marine terraces and beaches found above sea level. Uplift rates eastern coast of Patagonia exceeds those of the Atlantic coast of South America (except Recife). Uplift in Patagonia contrast starkly with the Río de la Plata which has been a region of subsidence. The causes of the uplift trend have been attributed to a decreased downward drag induced by flow in Earth's mantle beneath Patagonia. This change is in turn derived from the geologically recent subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath South America, which as a new subducting plate with a short subducting slab, would have less capacity to induce flow in Earth's mantle.\n"}

They have a single outrigger.\n\n\"Wa\" are proa — vessels with identical bow and aft, allowing the craft to reverse without turning.\nThey are made from hewn-out hulls, typically breadfruit trunks, with single wide top-strakes, and carved head and stern pieces. Sails are lateen rigged and were traditionally made of pandanus mat sailcloth. Benjamin Morrell recorded in the 1830s that sails were \"made in small pieces of about three feet square, sewed together. In cutting the sail to its proper shape, the pieces which come off one side answer to go on the other; this gives it the proper form, and causes the halliards to be bent on in the middle of the yard.\" After World War II sails switched to canvas, and after 1973 the use of dacron began to increase.\n\nEarly accounts agreed upon \"a lee-platform on the side opposite to the outrigger-frame, which also has a large platform of poles laid athwart its booms, whereon men are stationed to counterbalance any excessive heeling over toward the lee side when the wind increases in force\". The windward float stabilizes the craft. This occurs \"by its weight rather than its buoyancy. When the float becomes submerged in a wave its increased drag swings the canoe slightly around into the wind, thereby relieving some of the wind pressure on the sail. The canoe slows down temporarily and allows the float to rise again.\" This design feature also acts to reduce drift by tending to place the wind toward the beam or side of the craft.\n\nOn Poluwat, the skill of canoe building is called \"héllap\" (\"great rigging\"), and different schools of canoe carpentry include \"hálinruk\" (\"Rope of Truk\") and \"hálinpátu\" (\"Rope of the four Western Islands\").\n\n\"Wa\" may be sailed over long distances, paddled, or moved by punting. One analysis of \"wa\" under sail indicated \"conclusively that these primitive craft are superior to a modern boat on significant points of sailing.\" They were estimated by Anson in 1776 to be able to move at or perhaps beyond wind speed, and to have better windward pointing ability than any craft previously encountered. Several early western observers stated they were \"capable of for sustained periods\". Edwin Doran, author of \"Wangka: Austronesian Canoe Origins\" (1981), cited a average for a \"wa\" traveling from Guam to Manila. Benjamin Morrell reported in 1831 that he had \"seen these boats going at the rate of , within four points of the wind\" and that he had \"no doubt but they will go at the rate of twelve or thirteen [] miles an hour in smooth water\".\n\nIn the past, voyages of across open ocean were commonplace, and a \"brisk trade\" was carried on with the Mariana Islands to the north. Trade items included shells, tapa cloth, wooden vessels, cordage, iron, copper, nails and knives. Rai stones were brought from Palau to Yap. Physical evidence of contact with the Chamorro people of Guam in the far southern Mariana Islands includes pestles, fish hooks, and shell rings from the Caroline Islands.\" The earliest documentary evidence is Friar Juan Cantova's 1721 letter to Friar William D'Aubenton in which he describes the June 19, 1721 landing of canoes from Woleai on Guam. During the same Spanish colonial period, many Chamorro people died due to introduced disease or were forcibly relocated from Saipan to Guam, and Caroline Islanders emigrated to Saipan in their place. By 1788 fleets from the Caroline Islands were sailing to Guam near annually to trade in iron and other goods. In the same year, a canoe from Woleai arrived at Guam and told the Spanish that \"they had always been trading with Guam and had only discontinued their voyaging after witnessing the cruelty of the Europeans.\"\n\nIn 1821, Adelbert von Chamisso recorded a voyage of from Yap to Aur Atoll in the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands. Longer voyages of at least between the Carolines, Philippines and Marianas were frequent. A canoe from Satawal made a voyage to Saipan in 1970. Star courses between islands were known on Puluwat for all major islands from Tobi, south-west of Palau, to Makin in the Gilbert Islands – clear evidence of repeated trips over various parts of this -long region. According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, the Caroline Islands natives \"who are Micronesian hybrids of finer physique than their kinsmen of the Pelew Islands, have a comparatively high mental standard, being careful agriculturists, and peculiarly clever boatbuilders and navigators.\"\n\nThere are a larger number of stars grouped around the east–west axis of this navigation system – since the Caroline Islands are an east–west island chain, most voyages occur in those directions, and for seven to eight months of the year the dominant winds are north easterly. These dominant winds are referred to as \"etiu-mai-rakena-efang\" (or \"a wind coming from north of east\").\n\nAccording to the contentious historian Andrew Sharp, earlier observers Otto von Kotzebue and Louis de Freycinet's information suggests that long distance voyaging was seasonally limited, that \"the seasonal south-west monsoon was feared by the Caroline voyagers\", that normal steady trade winds from the north-east were preferred, and that the boats – once turtled – were troublesome to right.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York holds an artifact – called a \"hos\" that has a stylized human figure attached to Stingray spines (the purported sources of its power) – they describe as being used in \"weather magic, believed to have the ability to prevent or alter the path of approaching storms\", which is tentatively ascribed to Yap.\n\nAfter the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899, inter-island voyaging was discouraged by the German New Guinea and Japanese colonial governments and by the commercial availability of trade goods. This discouragement was, however, not very effective.\n\nA 1966 Peace Corps volunteer reported a fleet of 20 canoes of various sizes, that sailed from five islands within the Woleai atoll to greet an arriving ship, and stated there was only one motorboat at the time. By 1973, only a handful of the canoes were still actively sailed on Woleai, and there were more than 20 motorboats. In 1973 voyaging traditions were reportedly most alive on Satawal, Namonabetiu, and to a lessert extent Nanonuito and Ifalik.\n\n\"Long-distance noninstrument voyaging\" was still practiced in the area in the late 1980s.\n\nIn 2012, the charity Habele and community-based organization Waa'gey were supporting younger outer-islanders from Lamotrek to gain experience in \"wa\" building.\n\nA scale model Poluwat \"wa\" collected by David Lewis and Barry Lewis, father and son, in 1969 is held by the Australian National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour, Sydney, Australia. A further, damaged, small scale model is also in Sydney at the Powerhouse Museum.\n\nTwo additional models of \"wa\" craft from Yap, made before 1909, are held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin in Germany.\n\n"}

Broad distinctions are useful to avoid ambiguity, and disambiguation will be of varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other languages. A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by inland water craft. Maritime shipping routes cross oceans and seas, and some lakes, where navigability is assumed, and no engineering is required, except to provide the draft for deep-sea shipping to approach seaports (channels), or to provide a short cut across an isthmus; this is the function of ship canals. Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways. There is an exception to this initial distinction, essentially for legal purposes, see under international waters.\n\nWhere seaports are located inland, they are approached through a waterway that could be termed \"inland\" but in practice is generally referred to as a \"maritime waterway\" (examples Seine Maritime, Loire Maritime, Seeschiffahrtsstraße Elbe). The term \"inland waterway\" refers to navigable rivers and canals designed to be used by inland waterway craft only, implicitly of much smaller dimensions than seagoing ships.\n\nIn order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria:\n\n\nVessels using waterways vary from small animal-drawn barges to immense ocean tankers and ocean liners, such as cruise ships.\n\nThe European Conference of Ministers of Transport established in 1953 a classification of waterways that was later expanded to take into account the development of push-towing. Europe is a continent with a great variety of waterway characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes of waterway. There is also a remarkable variety of waterway characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.\n\nThe objective of the “Blue Book” is to establish an inventory of existing and envisaged standards and parameters of \"E-waterways\" and ports in Europe and to show, on an internationally comparable basis, the current inland navigation infrastructure parameters prescribed on the Agreement on Main Inland Waterways of International Importance\n"}
{"id": "233654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233654", "title": "World Geodetic System", "text": "World Geodetic System\n\nThe World Geodetic System (WGS) is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. It comprises a standard coordinate system for the Earth, a standard spheroidal reference surface (the \"datum\" or \"reference ellipsoid\") for raw altitude data, and a gravitational equipotential surface (the \"geoid\") that defines the \"nominal sea level\".\n\nThe latest revision is WGS 84 (also known as WGS 1984, EPSG:4326), established in 1984 and last revised in 2004. Earlier schemes included WGS 72, WGS 66, and WGS 60. WGS 84 is the reference coordinate system used by the Global Positioning System.\n\nThe coordinate origin of WGS 84 is meant to be located at the Earth's center of mass; the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2 cm.\n\nThe WGS 84 meridian of zero longitude is the IERS Reference Meridian, 5.3 arc seconds or east of the Greenwich meridian at the latitude of the Royal Observatory.\n\nThe WGS 84 datum surface is an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius \"a\" =  m at the equator and flattening \"f\" = 1/. The polar semi-minor axis \"b\" then equals \"a\" × (1 − \"f\") =  m.\n\nCurrently, WGS 84 uses the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM96) geoid, revised in 2004. This geoid defines the nominal sea level surface by means of a spherical harmonics series of degree 360 (which provides about 100 km latitudinal resolution near the Equator). The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid range from about −105 m to about +85 m. EGM96 differs from the original WGS 84 geoid, referred to as EGM84.\n\nEfforts to supplement the various national surveying systems began in the 19th century with F.R. Helmert's famous book (\"Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy\"). Austria and Germany founded the \"Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung\" (Central Bureau of International Geodesy), and a series of global ellipsoids of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, Hayford 1910/ 1924).\n\nA unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:\n\nIn the late 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, together with scientists of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60). The term \"datum\" as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of latitudes, longitudes, and elevations. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see physical geodesy). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.\n\nIn accomplishing WGS 60, a combination of available surface gravity data, astro-geodetic data and results from HIRAN and Canadian SHORAN surveys were used to define a best-fitting ellipsoid and an earth-centered orientation for each of initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.) The sole contribution of satellite data to the development of WGS 60 was a value for the ellipsoid flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.\n\nPrior to WGS 60, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method. To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic deflections and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and gravimetric geoids. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS 60.\n\nImprovements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of Irene Fischer and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy mapping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface gravity observations, results from the extension of triangulation and trilateration networks, and large amounts of Doppler and optical satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening (1/298.25 determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis (6,378,145 meters determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° × 5° mean free air gravity anomaly field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.\n\nAfter an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale least squares adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.\n\nThe largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was also used which included camera (Baker–Nunn) and some laser ranging.\n\nThe surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° × 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.\n\nThe astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.\n\nThe Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.\n\nThe value for the semimajor axis (a) of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is 6 378 135 meters. The adoption of an a-value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the Committee, an a-value of 6 378 135 meters and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.\n\nIn the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.\n\nIn the early 1980s the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community and also within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. GRS 80 parameters together with available Doppler, satellite laser ranging and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced least squares method called collocation which allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth's gravity field, i.e. geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, dynamic Doppler, etc.\n\nThe new World Geodetic System was called WGS 84. It is the reference system used by the Global Positioning System. It is geocentric and globally consistent within ±1 m. Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) maintained by the IERS are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS 84.\n\nThe WGS 84 originally used the GRS 80 reference ellipsoid, but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication. Most of these refinements are important for high-precision orbital calculations for satellites but have little practical effect on typical topographical uses. The following table lists the primary ellipsoid parameters.\n\nThe very small difference in the flattening thus results in a tiny difference of 0.105 mm in the semi polar axis.\n\nWGS 84 uses the IERS Reference Meridian as defined by the Bureau International de l'Heure, which was defined by compilation of star observations in different countries.\n\nThe longitude positions on WGS 84 agree with those on the older North American Datum 1927 at roughly 85° longitude west, in the east-central United States.\n\nThe latest major revision of WGS 84 is also referred to as \"Earth Gravitational Model 1996\" (EGM96), first published in 1996, with revisions as recent as 2004. This model has the same reference ellipsoid as WGS 84, but has a higher-fidelity geoid (roughly 100 km resolution versus 200 km for the original WGS 84).\n\nMany of the original authors of WGS 84 contributed to a new higher-fidelity model, called EGM2008. This new model will have a geoid with accuracy approaching 10 cm, requiring over 4.6 million terms in the spherical expansion (versus 130,317 in EGM96 and 32,757 in WGS 84).\n\n\n"}
