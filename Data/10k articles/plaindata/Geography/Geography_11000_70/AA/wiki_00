His book was published in more than a hundred editions and was still being reprinted in the 1790s. The work was translated into Latin, German, English, Spanish, French, and Polish. The work unleashed a torrent of 'books of secrets' that continued to be published down through the eighteenth century.\n\nPiemontese was the prototypical 'professor of secrets'. His description of his hunt for secrets in the preface to the \"Secreti\" helped to give rise to a legend of the wandering empiric who dedicated his life to the search for natural and technological secrets. The book contributed to the emergence of the concept of science as a hunt for the secrets of nature, which pervaded experimental science during the period of the Scientific Revolution.\n\nIt is generally assumed that Alessio Piemontese was a pseudonym of Girolamo Ruscelli (Viterbo 1500 — Venice 1566), humanist and cartographer. In a later work, Ruscelli reported that the \"Secreti\" contained the experimental results of an 'Academy of Secrets' that he and a group of humanists and noblemen founded in Naples in the 1540s. Ruscelli's academy is the first recorded example of an experimental scientific society. The academy was later imitated by Giambattista Della Porta, who founded an ‘Accademia dei Secreti’ in Naples in the 1560s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47487", "title": "Azimuth", "text": "Azimuth\n\nAn azimuth () (from the pl. form of the Arabic noun \"السَّمْت\" \"as-samt\", meaning \"the direction\") is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system. The vector from an observer (origin) to a point of interest is projected perpendicularly onto a reference plane; the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.\n\nWhen used as a celestial coordinate, the azimuth is the horizontal direction of a star or other astronomical object in the sky. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area 5 km in radius at sea level) around an observer on Earth's surface, and the reference vector points to true north. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star's vector on the horizontal plane.\n\nAzimuth is usually measured in degrees (°). The concept is used in navigation, astronomy, engineering, mapping, mining, and ballistics.\n\n In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted alpha, \"α\", and defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from a north base line or \"meridian\". \"Azimuth\" has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.\n\nToday, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically true north, measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units (grad, mil) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.\n\nQuite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as \"(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east\" (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated \"S30°E\", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the cardinal points, a different notation, e.g. \"due east\", is used instead.\n\nThe cartographical azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane (cartographical coordinates):\n\nRemark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical polar coordinate system and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.\nThis is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.\nIf the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.\n\nThe formula in radians would be slightly easier:\n\nWhen the coordinates (\"X\", \"Y\") of one point, the distance \"L\", and the azimuth \"α\" to another point (\"X\", \"Y\") are known, one can calculate its coordinates:\n\nThis is typically used in triangulation.\n\nWe are standing at latitude formula_4, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude formula_5, longitude \"L\" (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth \"α\" is given by\n\nA better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an \"oblate spheroid\"); \"azimuth\" then has at least two very slightly different meanings. \"Normal-section azimuth\" is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; \"geodetic azimuth\" is the angle between north and the \"geodesic\"; that is, the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2. The difference is usually immeasurably small; if Point 2 is not more than 100 km away, the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second.\n\nVarious websites will calculate geodetic azimuth; e.g., GeoScience Australia site. Formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the distance article.\n\nNormal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate; Bomford says Cunningham's formula is exact for any distance . If \"f\" is the flattening for the chosen spheroid (e.g., for WGS84) then\n\nIf \"φ\" = 0 then\n\nTo calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace \"φ\" with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).\n\nThere is a wide variety of azimuthal map projections. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.\n\nUsed in celestial navigation, an \"azimuth\" is the direction of a celestial body from the observer. In astronomy, an \"azimuth\" is sometimes referred to as a bearing. In modern astronomy azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.\n(The article on coordinate systems, for example, uses a convention measuring from the south.) In former times, it was common to refer to azimuth from the south, as it was then zero at the same time that the hour angle of a star was zero. This assumes, however, that the star (upper) culminates in the south, which is only true if the star's declination is less than (i.e. further south than) the observer's latitude.\n\nIf, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the celestial equator, the angles are called right ascension if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the celestial meridian.\n\nIn the horizontal coordinate system, used in celestial navigation and satellite dish installation, azimuth is one of the two coordinates. The other is altitude, sometimes called elevation above the horizon. See also: Sat finder.\n\nIn mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in cylindrical coordinates or spherical coordinates is the anticlockwise angle between the positive \"x\"-axis and the projection of the vector onto the \"xy\"-plane. The angle is the same as an angle in polar coordinates of the component of the vector in the \"xy\"-plane and is normally measured in radians rather than degrees. As well as measuring the angle differently, in mathematical applications theta, \"θ\", is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the representation of symbol phi \"φ\".\n\nFor magnetic tape drives, \"azimuth\" refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.\n\nIn sound localization experiments and literature, the \"azimuth\" refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.\n\nAn azimuth thruster in shipbuilding is a propeller that can be rotated horizontally.\n\nThe word azimuth is in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic \"al-sumūt\", pronounced \"as-sumūt\" in Arabic, meaning \"the directions\" (plural of Arabic \"al-samt\" = \"the direction\"). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the Astrolabe astronomy instrument. The word's first record in English is in the 1390s in \"Treatise on the Astrolabe\" by Geoffrey Chaucer. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the \"Libros del saber de astronomía\" commissioned by King Alfonso X of Castile.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2803139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2803139", "title": "Blowout (geomorphology)", "text": "Blowout (geomorphology)\n\nBlowouts are sandy depressions in a sand dune ecosystem (psammosere) caused by the removal of sediments by wind.\n\nCommonly found in coastal settings and arid margins, blowouts tend to form when wind erodes into patches of bare sand on stabilized vegetative dunes. Generally, blowouts don’t form on actively flowing dunes due to the fact that they need to be bound by some extent, such as plant roots. These depressions usually start on the higher parts of the stabilized dunes on the account that desiccation and disturbances are more considerable which allows for greater surface drag and sediment entrainment when sand is bare. Most of the time, exposures become quickly re-vegetative before they could become blowouts and expand; however, when the opportunities are given, wind erosion can lower the exposure surface and create a tunneling affect, which increases the wind speed. The depression may continue until it hits a non-erodible substrate or morphology limits it. The eroded substances climbs the steep slopes of the depression and become deposited on the downwind side of the blowout which can form a dune that covers vegetation and lead to a larger area of depression; a process that helps create parabolic dunes.\n\nAlthough there is a wide variety of vegetation that live in dune environments around the world, most plant species play a key role in determining whether blowouts will form or not by the result of how strong their protective skins can suppress erosion and how capable some pioneer species can repress further erosion if a dune becomes exposed.\n\nProtective Skin\n\nIn the first case, the primary objective for the protective skin is to resist disturbances that will form open exposures and create blowouts. To prevent erosion, vegetation helps reduce shear stress by covering the surface and mechanically binding soil together. The protective skin is composed of vegetation that is above and below ground surface and decomposing plant liter. Additionally, the protective skin can also be composed of a wide variety of species that could constitute environments like grasslands and forest. However, if the climate changes, it can directly influence the health of the vegetation, which can make the skin fragile; nevertheless, the rate of change may take some time and may be different for stabilized dunes in different environments.\n\nPioneer Species\n\nOnce disturbances destroy a portion of the protective skin, the exposure can expand and erode other portions of the skin; however, some vegetation, such as pioneer species, can settle in an opening and prevent any further expansion and deflation. Even though a few plants species can be classed as a colonizer, these plants tend to withstand high rates of sediment deposition and poor nutrient conditions in the blowout. Moreover, if a blowout does form, the deposited material that travels out of the depression can either continue to become deposited at a greater rate than pioneer vegetation can grow or become stabilized again. Mostly due to changes in the climate, colonizer species heavily rely on conditions of the environment, which can change dramatically unlike the vegetation in the protective skin.\n\nCoastal sand dunes are found just inland from a beach, and are formed as the wind blows dry sand inland beyond the beach. It follows that this can only happen when there is an area of reasonably flat land inland from the beach. In time, this rather inhospitable surface will be colonised by pioneer species. These species (e.g. marram grass) will stabilise the dunes and prevent them moving any more. The process of plant succession will eventually see these dunes converted to woodland (depending on the climate) and a mature soil will have formed.\n\nBlowouts provide an important habitat for flora and fauna.\n\nDisturbances are generally phrases to define a cause that creates an exposure in the vegetative skin, which leads to blowout formation. Rather being described as events, disturbances are terms to describe the rate that breaches create an opening and expand, yet there are numerous types of disturbances that can penetrate the protective vegetative skin. Despite the fact that many factors could influence blowout formations, disturbances usually have three characteristics to determine if a depression will form and expand. The first property states that disturbances must have a penetration magnitude greater than the toughness of the protective vegetative skin. Simply if the breach cannot remove the shielding vegetation wind erosion cannot create a depression in stabilized dunes. The second property asserts that sediment transportation in an exposure would be limited if exposure’s spatial coverage is too small. Presuming that the opening is very compacted, the fetch length would also be very cramped which doesn’t allow much sediment particles to be moved out of the exposure. Lastly the third property exclaims that spatial configuration of the disturbed openings greatly influences the fetch length and sediment transportation in the exposure. If there were numerous disturbed patches that borderline each other in a down wind direction, wind erosion may be capable of removing and transporting large amounts of sediment particles, which could create blowouts. Thus, although the scale of the disturbances does assist in blowout formation, these characteristics generally help dictate if Aeolian processes can create a depression or not.\n\nOnce an exposure has been spawned, the morphology of the blowout depends on the interaction of wind speed and direction with the stabilized dune’s vegetation and topography. There is a wide range of blowout types that form depending on these factors; however, the scientific community mostly utilizes two types of blowouts: trough and saucer. Although there is no obvious reason why one type is formed rather another in a particular region, saucer blowouts generally have semicircular and saucer shapes while trough blowouts have more elongated shapes with deep deflation basins and steeper slopes. Nevertheless, both types of blowouts have structures that can affect wind flow within the basin.\n\nIn troughs, the structure’s topography can accelerate flows and form jets that result in maximum erosion along the deflation basin floor and laterally expand the slopes of the blowout. Additionally, when the wind flows on top of the blowout’s lateral walls, sediment transport is at its maximum in the middle axis of the trough depositional lobe, leading to formation of a parabolic dune. Although some studies like Hesp and Prinlge (2001) noted that wind flow that was oblique to blowouts’ orientation became pulled into the depression due to a zone of low pressure at the deflation basin and was steered parallel to the orientation of the trough blowout. However, in Smyth, Jackson, and Cooper’ study (2014), little evidence supported that wind flow was being steered along the axis of the blowout, rather the flow remained constant to the direction that it was flowing before or showed other characteristics like turbulent separated flows.\n\nSaucer blowouts indicate a deceleration of wind flow along the deflation basin as the structure widens over time by reversing flows eroding the sides and expanding upwind. Due to rapid deceleration, saucers tend to form short, wide, radial depositional slopes. When wind flow enters a saucer shape blowout, the wind speed decreases upon entering the blowout and accelerates at the downwind side of the formation. A zone of separation develops along the lee slope as the wind enters the blowout and decrease in speed, yet it accelerates again as it re-attaches at the basin and flow up to the depositional lobe, where sand becomes evacuated.\n\nEven though they’re more influences blowout structures have on their morphology, both types basically tend to have deflation basins eroded until they reach their non-erodible base level. A study conducted by Hesp (1982) indicates that depositional length isn’t correlated with the eroded depth but rather the blowout width. In other words, as the depositional lobe increases, the blowout width also increases by a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 in saucer blowouts and 1:4 in trough blowouts.\n\n\n"}

Because of Finland's northern location, winter is the longest season. Only on the south coast and the southeast is summer as long as winter. On average, winter lasts from early January to late February in the outermost islands in the archipelago and the warmest locations along the southwestern coast – notably in Hanko, and from early October to mid May in the most elevated locations, such as northwestern Lapland and the lowest valleys in northeastern Lapland. This means that southern portions of the country are snow-covered about three to four months of the year, and the northern for about seven months. The long winter causes about half of the annual precipitation in the north to fall as snow. Precipitation in the south amounts to about annually. Like that of the north, it occurs all through the year, though not so much of it is snow. \n\nIn Köppen climate classification Finland belongs to the Df group (continental subarctic or boreal climates). The southern coast is Dfb (humid continental mild summer, wet all year), and the rest of the country is Dfc (subarctic with cool summer, wet all year). \n\nThe climate of Finland has characteristics of both maritime and continental climate. The Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Eurasian continent to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current, play a big role in the climate of Norway, Sweden and Finland which continuously warm the region, if it weren't for these currents the winters in Scandinavia and Fennoscandia would be much colder. Westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the Baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south and southwest in cities like Helsinki and Turku where winter highs tend to be between but a cold snap like the one that occurred in mid-January 2016 can cause temperatures to plunge well below . These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and are high temperatures in the summer.\n\nThe warmest annual average temperature in Southwestern Finland is . From there the temperature decreases gradually towards north and east. Suomenselkä and Maanselkä drainage divides rise higher than the surrounding areas, and the climate is there cooler than at same latitudes elsewhere in Finland. Barents Sea between Finland and North Pole is open even in winter, so northerly airflows are not as cold as in Siberia or Alaska.\nThe highest ever recorded temperature is (Liperi, July 29, 2010). The lowest, (Kittilä, January 28, 1999). The annual average temperature is relatively high in the southwestern part of the country (), with quite mild winters and warm summers, and low in the northeastern part of Lapland ().\n\nTemperature extremes for every month: \n\nThe most common wind direction in Finland is from southwest, but the low pressure areas typical for these latitudes cause great variations in wind speed and direction.\n\nStorm, defined as at least one Finnish coastal station reporting at least 21 m/s as a 10-minutes average wind speed, is observed on Finnish seas in average 19 days a year. Strong winds are most frequent between October and January.\n\nThe first snow cover is observed on average in September in Lapland, and in November in Southern and western areas. Permanent snow cover time starts typically after Christmas in the Southwestern corner, but before mid-November in most of Lapland. The maximum snow depth is usually found around March.\n\nSnow and supercooled droplets can accumulate in tree crowns and cause damage to trees. The trunks of pine trees can break under the weight of a snowloaded crown, and deciduous trees can bend permanently. The snowload of a tree is typically 100–150 kg per one meter tree trunk, but the heaviest measured snowload of a spruce was over 3000 kilograms.\n\nSnowmelt contributes to spring floods. In north, the peak flow of rivers always happens in spring, in the south 70–80% of floods happen in spring. In the south, maximum flow happens in mid-April, in the north, in mid-May.\n"}

Limestone, bauxite and iron ore are found in the Eastern Ghats hill ranges.\n\nThe Eparchaean Unconformity of the Tirumala Hills is a major discontinuity of stratigraphic significance that represents an extensive period of erosion and non-deposition. It is seen at the steep natural slopes, road scars and ravines in the Tirumala ghat roads in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nAs with the Western Ghats, these mountain ranges also have local names along the discontinuous hill ranges.\n\nAt their southern end, the Eastern Ghats form several ranges of low hills. The southernmost of the Eastern Ghats are the low Sirumalai and Karanthamalai Hills of southern Tamil Nadu.\n\nNorth of the Kaveri River are the higher Kollimalai, Pachaimalai, Shevaroy (Servarayan), Kalrayan Hills, Chitteri, Javadhu Hills, Palamalai and Mettur Hills in northern Tamil Nadu state. The climate of the higher hill ranges is generally cooler and wetter than the surrounding plains, and the hills are home to coffee plantations and enclaves of dry forest.\n\nThe hill station of Yercaud is located in the Shevaroy Hills. The Biligiriranga Hills, which run east from the Western Ghats to the River Kaveri, form a forested ecological corridor that connects the Eastern and Western Ghats, and allows the second-largest wild Asian elephant population in India to range between the South Eastern Ghats, the Biligiriranga Hills and Nilgiri Hills, and the South Western Ghats.\n\nThe Male Mahadeshwara Hills Temple is situated in Chamarajanagar district in Karnataka state in the Eastern Ghats.\n\nThe Ponnaiyar and Palar rivers flow from headwaters on the Kolar Plateau eastward through gaps in the Ghats to empty into the Bay of Bengal; the Javadhu Hills lie between the two rivers. There are waterfalls in remote areas, such as the Kiliyur Falls.\n\nNorth of the Palar River in Andhra Pradesh, the central portion of the Eastern Ghats consists of two parallel ranges running approximately north-south. The lower Velikonda Range lies to the east, and the higher Palikonda-Lankamalla-Nallamalai Ranges lie to the west. They run in a nearly north-south alignment, parallel to the Coromandel Coast for close to 430 km between the Krishna and Pennar rivers. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat Palnadu basin, while in the south it merges with the Tirupati hills. An extremely old system, the hills have been extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average elevation today is about 520 m, but reaches 1,100 m at Bhairani Konda and 1,048 m at Gundla Brahmeswara.\n\nThe Tirumala Hills are located along the Seshachalam-Velikonda Range of the Eastern Ghats. The Palar River cuts through the ranges. The Velikonda Range eventually descends to the coastal plain in northern Nellore district, while the Nallamalla Range in Kurnool continues to the River Krishna.\n\nThe Kondapalli Hills are a range of low hills which lie between the Krishna and the Godavari rivers. These hills are located in the Guntur, Krishna, West Godavari and Khammam districts of Andhra Pradesh. The Krishna River bisects these hills of the Eastern Ghats. The main hill range starts from Nandigrama to Vijayawada known as Kondapalli.\n\nThe Papi Hills (Papi Kondalu) are distributed among the Khammam, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh and lie in the Eastern Ghats.\n\nMadhurawada Dome in the Eastern Ghats mobile belt is formed by a tectonic arrangement with the khondalite suite and quartz Archean rocks along the Eastern Ghats north of Visakhapatnam.\n\nThe Maliya Range is located in the northern portion of the Eastern Ghats. The Maliya Range generally ranges between elevations of 900–1200 m, although some of its summits soar higher. The tallest peak in this range is Mahendragiri (1,501 m).\n\nThe Madugula Konda Range is located in the northern portion of the Eastern Ghats. The Madugula Konda range is higher than the Maliyas and generally ranges between elevations of 1100–1400 m. Prominent summits include the highest peak of the Eastern Ghats - Arma Konda (1680 m), Gali Konda (1643 m) and Sinkram Gutta (1620 m).\n\nThe highest mountain peak in the state of Odisha is Deomali (1672 m), which is situated in the Koraput district of southern Odisha. It is part of the Chandragiri-Pottangi mountain system. The region covers about three-fourths of the entire Odisha state. Geologically it is a part of the Indian Peninsula which was a part of the ancient land mass of Gondwanaland. The major rivers of Odisha with their tributaries have cut deep and narrow valleys.\n\nThe Garhjat Range is a northeastern prolongation of the eastern Ghats which rises abruptly and steeply in the east and slopes gently to a dissected plateau in the west running from north-west (Mayurbhanj) to south-west (Malkangiri). The Odisha highlands are also known as the Garhjat Hills. This region is well marked by a number of interfluves or watersheds which interrupt the terrain in the form of broad and narrow river valleys and flood plains. The average height of this region is about 900 metres above mean sea level.\n\nThe Similipal massif is considered the farthest northeast extension of the Eastern Ghats.\n\nThe Eastern Ghats are the source points for many small and medium rivers along the east coastal plains of South India.\n\nRivers flowing through Eastern Ghats include:\n\nRivers originating on the Eastern Ghats include:\n\nThe endemic fauna of the Eastern Ghats are the Jerdon's courser \"(Rhinoptilus bitorquatus)\" and grey slender loris \"(Loris lydekkerianus)\". The rare geckos found here are the Indian golden gecko \"(Calodactylodes aureus)\", rock gecko \"(Hemiphyllodactylus aurantiacus)\", and Sharma's skink (\"Eutropis nagarjuni\").\n\nIndian elephant \"(Elephas maximus indicus)\", blackbuck \"(Antilope cervicapra)\", Asian palm civet \"(Paradoxurus hermaphroditus)\", small Indian civet \"(Viverricula indica)\", Madras treeshrew \"(Anathana ellioti)\", common grey mongoose \"(Herpestes edwardsii)\", sambar deer \"(Rusa unicolor)\", Indian crested porcupine \"(Hystrix indica)\", Indian bison \"(Bos gaurus)\", wild boar \"(Sus scrofa)\", common muntjac \"(Muntiacus muntjak)\", Indian leopard \"(Panthera pardus fusca)\", Bengal tiger \"(Panthera tigris tigris)\", dhole \"(Cuon alpinus)\", golden jackal \"(Canis aureus)\", Indian giant squirrel \"(Ratufa indica)\", Indian hare \"(Lepus nigricollis)\", Asian house shrew \"(Suncus murinus)\", tufted grey langur \"(Semnopithecus priam)\", Indian flying fox \"(Pteropus giganteus)\", bonnet macaque \"(Macaca radiata)\", rhesus macaque \"(Macaca mulatta)\", Bengal fox \"(Vulpes bengalensis)\", smooth-coated otter \"(Lutrogale perspicillata)\", jungle cat \"(Felis chaus)\", cheetal \"(Axis axis)\", striped hyena \"(Hyaena hyaena)\", Indian mole-rat \"(Bandicota bengalensis)\"\n\nGreat Indian bustard \"(Ardeotis nigriceps)\", red-wattled lapwing \"(Vanellus indicus)\", spot-billed pelican \"(Pelecanus philippensis)\", blue peafowl \"(Pavo cristatus)\", Indian pond heron \"(Ardeola grayii)\", hoopoe \"(Upupa epops)\", spotted owlet \"(Athene brama)\", greater coucal \"(Centropus sinensis)\", pied crested cuckoo \"(Clamator jacobinus)\", Oriental white ibis \"(Threskiornis melanocephalus)\", Indian pitta \"(Pitta brachyura)\", Indian paradise flycatcher \"(Terpsiphone paradisi)\", red-vented bulbul \"(Pycnonotus cafer)\", red-whiskered bulbul \"(Pycnonotus jocosus)\", jungle babbler \"(Turdoides striata)\", painted stork \"(Mycteria leucocephala)\", black-rumped flameback \"(Dinopium benghalense)\", brahminy kite \"(Haliastur indus)\", jungle myna \"(Acridotheres fuscus)\", Indian spotted eagle \"(Aquila hastata)\", Indian vulture \"(Gyps indicus)\", Malabar whistling thrush \"(Myophonus horsfieldii)\"\n\nUp to 30 species of amphibians including the Gunther's toad (\"Bufo hololius\"), pond frogs (\"Euphlyctis\"), cricket frog (\"Fejervarya\"), bull frogs (\"Hoplobatrachus\"), burrowing frogs (\"Sphaerotheca\"), balloon frogs (\"Uperodon\"), small-mouthed frogs (\"Microhyla\"), and tree frog (\"Polypedates\") occur here. Endemic ones include the golden-backed frogs \"(Hylarana\" spp.), the bush frog \"Raorchestes terebrans\" and the recently described caecilian \"Gegeneophis orientalis\" and an \"Ichthyophis\" species that is known from old records.\n\nNearly 100 species of reptiles occur in the Eastern Ghats. Many endangered species are also present, including the mugger crocodile \"(Crocodylus palustris)\", Indian black turtle \"(Melanochelys trijuga)\", Indian flapshell turtle \"(Lissemys punctata)\", Indian tent turtle \"(Pangshura tentoria)\", Indian star tortoise \"(Geochelone elegans)\", Leith's softshell turtle \"(Nilssonia leithii)\", many of which are found in the northern rivers and riverine valley tracts.\n\nAmong lizards are the Roux's forest calotes \"Calotes rouxii\", those of the genera (\"Psammophilus \"), (\"Sitana\"), Indian chameleon (\"Chamaeleo zeylanicus\"), Reticulated gecko \"(Hemidactylus reticulatus)\", the rock geckoes \"Hemidactylus giganteus\", \"Hemidactylus graniticolus\", the golden gecko (\"Calodactylodes aureus\"), the slender gecko (\"Hemiphyllodactylus aurantiacus\"), the rare ground geckoes (\"Cyrtodactylus nebulosus\"), (\"Cyrtodactylus collegalensis\"), the recently rediscovered (\"Geckoella jeyporensis\"), Leschenault's snake-eye (\"Ophisops leschenaultii\"), Blinking snake-eye (\"Ophisops minor\"), Ashwamedh's skink (\"Eutropis ashwamedhii\"), Beddome's skink \"Eutropis beddomei\", Nagarjun's skink (\"Eutropis nagarjuni\") and Bengal monitor \"(Varanus bengalensis)\". Noteworthy lizards include the endemic, fossorial genera of leg-less skinks such as Sepsophis punctatus, Barkudia melanosticta and Barkudia insularis that are known only from the northern ranges and along the adjoining Eastern coastal plains in northern Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\n\nAmong snakes are the beaked worm snake (\"Grypotyphlops acutus\"), the endemic shield-tailed snakes like \"Uropeltis ellioti\", \"Uropeltis shorttii\", the recently described \"Rhinophis goweri\", the endangered Indian rock python (\"Python molurus\"), Forsten's cat snake (\"Boiga forsteni\"), yellow-green cat snake (\"Boiga flaviviridis\"), Srilankan flying snake (\"Chrysopelea taprobanica\"), Nagarjun Sagar racer (\"Coluber bholanathi\"), green keelback (\"Macropisthodon plumbicolor\"), Duméril's black-headed snake (\"Sibynophis subpunctatus\"), Indian reed snake (\"Liopeltis calamaria\").

After an education at the Karlsruhe gymnasium, beginning in 1881 he studied meteorology and physics at the University of Dorpat, graduating in 1885. He joined the Deutsche Seewarte (German Hydrographic Office) in Hamburg, then, following studies at Dresden and Munich, he became a professor at the University of Bern in 1888. The same year he married Ernestine Steine. In 1899, he was rector at the university. He moved back to Germany in 1904, becoming a professor at the University of Halle. Two years later in 1906, he was a professor at the University of Vienna. He died in Vienna.\n\nProfessor Brückner was an expert on alpine glaciers and their effect upon the landscape. Between 1901–1909 he collaborated with German geographer and geologist Albrecht Penck to produce a three volume work titled \"Die Alpen im Eiszeitalter\" (\"The Alps in the Ice Age\"). This served as a standard reference on the ice ages for several decades thereafter. Brückner was a proponent of the importance of climate change, including the effects on the economy and social structure of society.

{"id": "27050403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27050403", "title": "Environmental anthropology", "text": "Environmental anthropology\n\nEnvironmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.\n\nThe sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology, with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout. The rudiments of the system theories can be seen in Marcel Mauss' \"Seasonal Variation of Eskimo\", echoed later in Julian Steward's work. Although later, system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static.\n\nThe main focus of system theories in the sixties, as conveyed by Julian Steward, was acknowledgment of recurrence, cultural patterns or \"laws.\" Steward's ecological anthropology was based on topography, climate, and resources and their accessibility to define culture. While Marvin Harris' cultural materialism observed and gauged social units by means of material production. Both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment; a social unit's characteristics (technology, politics, modes of subsistence, to name a few) have adaptive limitations. Importantly, those limitations are not considered determinants.\n\nThe new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity. Such factors like environmental disasters (floods, earthquakes, frost), migrations, cost & benefit ratio, contact/ associations, external ideas (trade/ latent capitalism boom), along with internal, independent logic and inter-connectivity's impact now were observed. Roy A. Rappaport and Hawkes, Hill, and O'Connell's use of Pyke's optimal foraging theory for the latter's work are some examples of this new focus.\n\nThis perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have, such as \"loyalty, solidarity, friendliness, and sanctity\" and possible \"incentives or inhibitors\" in relations to behavior. Rappaport, often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods, acknowledges, \"The social unit is not always well defined\" exhibiting another flaw in this perspective, obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms.\n\nThe contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.\n\nCritiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) influences and effects on social groups is usually that they \"generalize\" and \"obscure\" local discourse and message. Often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats, PR firms, governments, and industry. An example of negative effects can be ascertained in the Malaysian Rainforest, in which NGOs and other outsider activist deflected the issue, ignoring the locality of the problem.\n\nEnvironmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology.\nIt focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems. American anthropologist Julian Steward (1902–1972), is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology. A troubled childhood led to Steward's fascination of the natural world. In 1918 Steward attended a California College, found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies.\nSteward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned.\n\nSteward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950s–60s. The transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists John Bennett, Roy A. Rappaport, Andrew P. Vayda, and others. Two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light. The first of which, was when Marvin Harris actively and systematically worked to develop \"cultural materialism\" as an approach to research. Harris's intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture. The cultural system was split into three parts by Harris; infrastructure, structure and superstructure. Eric Alden Smith and Bruce Winterhalder laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology. This would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation, stressing choice when utilizing natural resources. A further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical, political, and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation.\n\nAnthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world (i.e. the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them). This can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person's particular region and how they can be utilized. Humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse, taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process. So how can people erase the mistakes of the past? How can they bring old, outdated things new life through innovation? These questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology.\n\nEnvironmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism. The main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism. Agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation, and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question. The discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities, hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem. According to the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA),\n\n\"Environmental anthropology is particularly effective in relating to and gaining understanding of cultural diversity in community settings, and intercultural/intersect oral conflict, thus lending itself to applied endeavors that involve collaboration among diverse interest groups for the common good.\"\n\nThis means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology, and although the two groups may not speak the same language, they can both activate to prompt change. Necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy (environmental injustice). Applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection.\n\nEnvironmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems. According to SfAA,\n\n\"Important among them are observation techniques, qualitative and survey interviews, systematic data collection techniques for accessing core values or areas of cultural consensus, ways of identifying and interpreting social networks and a variety of participatory cultural, social and environmental assessment techniques designed to improve intersect oral understanding of demographic composition, social/political dynamics, cultural and other forms of diversity, and capacity for planning and development.\"\n\nEnvironmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as emic (an insider's understanding of the culture in question) a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations. These type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective.\n\n"}
{"id": "15691345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15691345", "title": "FERN", "text": "FERN\n\nFern (also Stichting Fern) is a Dutch foundation created in 1995. It is an international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) set up to keep track of the European Union's involvement in forests and to coordinate NGO activities at the European level. Fern works to protect forests and the rights of people who depend on them.\n\nAlthough Fern is known for its work on forests, since 2000 it has widened its scope to include climate, development aid, trade and consumption as many of the decisions made in these areas have a direct or indirect impact on forests and forest peoples’ rights. In all these areas, Fern works very closely with a large number of environmental groups and social movements across the world.\n\nFern is a non-hierarchical flat organization. Currently, it has two offices (Brussels, Belgium; and Moreton-in-Marsh, UK) and 17 staff.\n\nFern's official mission statement is \"We identify the threats facing the world's forests, and work with affected peoples, social and environmental organisations and policy makers to devise and deliver solutions where the EU can make a difference.\"\n\nFern's origin lies in the World Rainforest Movement meeting in Penang in 1989. At this meeting Southern participants decided they needed closer co-operation with a network of like-minded European organisations to further their objectives. An already existing ad hoc European coalition of NGOs responded and adopted the name European Rainforest Movement. This movement changed its name into Forest Movement Europe in 1994 after linking up with the newly formed Taiga Rescue Network (1992) and widening its focus to all forests, including Russia.\n\nAs most NGOs of the Forest Movement Europe were working at national level, and increasingly trade and aid decisions that impacted on forests were made at EU level, it was felt by most in the movement that more attention should be given to influencing the EU institutions. Hence, in March 1995 Saskia Ozinga (formerly working for Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands) and Sian Pettman (formerly working for the European Commission) created the organisation Fern with a mandate to monitor EU activities in relation to forests, inform and educate the Forest Movement Europe about these activities and facilitate joint advocacy work towards the different EU institutions.\n\nStarting with two part-time people in 1995, Fern has grown to an organisation with sixteen staff and its area of work has widened to include looking at climate change, carbon trading, finance, governance and development aid. Underlying issues such as lack of transparency, insufficient participation of civil society groups in decision-making at EU level and corruption are routinely addressed as part of all its campaigns.\n\nFern's way of working still reflects its origin, as in its activities the organisation aims to create ad hoc or permanent North-South, North-North or South-South NGO coalitions to jointly develop campaigns or activities, mostly –but not always- targeted at the EU institutions. Facilitation of the wider movement and supporting Fern's partners in the South remain Fern core activities.\n\nThe organisation currently actively addresses many areas that have a direct or indirect impact on forests and forest peoples’ rights issues. To achieve its aims, Fern follows many conventional environmental organisation methods, such as lobbying politicians and attendance at meetings. In addition to these activities, Fern supports both Northern and Southern NGOs in putting their case to the EU institutions and, where needed, helps NGOs with fundraising and strengthening its advocacy skills.\n\nFern advocacy activities aim to link different movements and organisations and create effective networks to campaign on issues the organisation believes to be important. Among its advocacy activities FERN links issues, stimulates informed discussion and develops joint strategies in areas that are of critical environmental and social concern, in most cases, but not exclusively, focused on EU institutions. Some of Fern's most outstanding coordination and facilitation work is the organisation of NGO meetings on various issues, such as the annual Forest Movement Europe meeting.\n\nSince 1996, Fern publishes a monthly bulletin entitled \"EU Forest Watch\", specialised briefing notes and reports on selected topics (e.g. illegal logging).\n\nFern currently has six different campaigns. These are: illegal logging; forest certification; climate change; export credit agencies; European forests and biodiversity; and development aid. In all these campaigns, Fern works closely with environmental as well as social NGOs in Europe and the South.\n\nFern’s work on European forests and biodiversity works to ensure that existing EU forest-related and rural development policies are implemented to aid the restoration and protection of biologically diverse, well-managed forests in the EU as well as to ensure that international government policies will positively contribute to halting the forest crisis, by reversing the trend of increasing forest and biodiversity loss and addressing the underlying causes that lead to forest loss.\n\nIn addition to the work on European forests, other Fern campaigns tackle the underlying causes of forest loss outside the EU. The EC development aid campaign aims to improve the quality of EC aid so that it contributes both to the protection and sustainable use of forests and to ensuring respect for forest peoples’ rights. The illegal logging campaign works to ensure that effective measures are developed and implemented so as to allow EU Member States to control the import of illegal timber and to support processes for forest law reform in wood producing countries which will lead to legal and sustainable forest management. Fern’s climate change campaign aims to ensure that climate policies and international climate agreements address the root causes of climate change and deforestation and refuse carbon trading as an unsuitable approach to avert climate chaos and respect the rights of forest peoples affected by carbon trading and carbon 'offset' projects (see FERN's SinksWatch initiative).\n\nOther Fern campaign is the Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) and finance and trade campaign, which aims to secure mandatory procedural environmental and human rights standards for European ECAs, set at a significant level, and drawing upon international 'best practice' standards and relevant EU legislation.\n\nSome of the most visible Fern achievements include the rejection of the scientifically flawed concept of planting trees to reverse climate change (‘carbon sinks’) by the European Parliament; highlighting the undue and unjust influence by large companies on environmental and social laws in host countries when executing large projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon pipeline; improved integration of environmental concerns and demands for recognition of indigenous peoples rights’ into EC aid programmes and policies and the creation of networks of Southern NGOs to improve the quality of EC aid; the presentation by the Commission of an EU Action Plan to combat illegal logging followed by legislation to halt illegal timber imports; and successfully coordinating the European network for reforming export credit agencies leading to the adoption of environmental guidelines for export credit agencies.\n\nAlthough are successes are foremost at policy level, they impact on local people's lives as most policy decisions trickle down. Some of FERN's successes have already reduced threats to local livelihoods as well as contributed to significant positive improvements. For example, Fern's work on highlighting the flaws in carbon sinks and direct correspondence with the CDM board, has led the CDM board to reject all plantation projects put to it, many of which such as V&M in Brazil, would have had serious negative impacts on people. Also, the EU Action Plan to combat illegal logging would not have been drafted without Fern. This Action Plan – if implemented properly - will create a leverage point to get customary rights accepted as 'legal' in countries as Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana and Cameroon: the lack of recognition of these rights is arguably the most significant obstacles to poverty alleviation, justice and even democracy.\n\nMoreover, the campaign on reforming ECAs has led to halting ECA funding and subsequently cancelling some projects, which would have had serious negative consequences for local people, such as in the case of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey which would have led to the replacement of around 80,000 people, with women suffering most. This was a clear success despite current attempts to revive the project.\n\nFern receives its money from private foundations and governments. In order to ensure its independence and impartiality, FERN has committed to not directly participate in the selection, award or administration of a contract when a real or apparent conflict of interest may be involved.\n\nFern's donors during 2014 included: The Ford Foundation, US; Department for International Development, UK; DG Environment of the European Commission; Sigrid Rausing Trust, UK.\n\n"}

Flatirons have wide bases that form the base of a steep, triangular facet that narrows upward into a point at its summit. The dissection of a hogback by regularly spaced streams often resulted in the formation of a series of flatirons along the strike of the rock layer that formed the hogback. As noted in some, but not all definitions, a number of flatirons are perched upon the slope of a larger mountain with the rock layer forming the flatiron inclined in the same direction as, but often at a steeper angle than the associated mountain slope. The name \"flatiron\" refers their resemblance to an upended, household flatiron.\n\nThe Flatirons near Boulder, Colorado, is both an example of these landforms and the source of their name. Other well-developed flatirons are found in the eastern Uinta Mountains in northwestern Colorado, the Waterpocket Fold in Capitol Reef National Park, the Superstition Mountains near Phoenix, Arizona and on the flanks of the Marathon Uplift in west Texas.\n\nThe term \"flatiron\" is also used for very small-scale landforms that are known as pediment flatirons and talus flatirons. These landforms are small knolls with a triangular to trapezoidal-shaped sloping surface with the long side of this surface as their base and a point at their top. Both pediment flatirons and talus flatirons are associated with the scarps of a cuesta, mesa, or butte and with their tips directed towards the scarp. Both types of these flatirons are typically separated from the scarp by well-defined ravines and gullies. These flatirons consist of either talus, in the case of the talus flatirons, or pedisediment and colluvium that cover pediments, in the case of pediment flatirons. Their surfaces are protected by a thin layer of caprock. The caprock commonly consists of caliche, which is about thick and rarely as much as thick, that has developed in either talus, pedisediment, or colluvium. Talus flatirons lie within the scarp slope – and pediment flatirons occur within the transition zone between scarp and foreland. Pediment flatirons can merge downward into a fluvial terrace. Both talus and pediment flatirons are the relict remnants of formerly active slope systems that were once part of the scarp's history.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "69011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69011", "title": "Geography of Bolivia", "text": "Geography of Bolivia\n\nThe geography of Bolivia is unique among the nations of South America. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries on the continent (the other being Paraguay), and Bolivia is more urban (77%) than rural (23%). The main features of Bolivia's geography include the Altiplano, a highland plateau of the Andes, and Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake on Earth, which is shared with Peru.\nThe most prominent feature of the Altiplano is the large lake at its northern end, Lake Titicaca. At above sea level, it is the highest commercially navigable body of water in the world. With a surface area of , it is larger than Puerto Rico and is South America's second largest lake by surface area. Lake Titicaca is also deep, about at its deepest, with an average depth of ; its volume of water is large enough to maintain a constant temperature of . The lake actually moderates the climate for a considerable distance around it, making crops of maize and wheat possible in sheltered areas. \n\nLake Titicaca drains southward through the slow-moving, reed-filled Desaguadero River to Lake Poopó. In contrast to the freshwater Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó is salty and shallow, with depths seldom more than .\nThe Cordillera Occidental is a chain of dormant volcanoes and solfataras, volcanic vents emitting sulfurous gases. Bolivia's highest peak, the snowcapped Nevado Sajama , is located here. The entire cordillera is of volcanic origin and an extension of the volcanic region found in southern Peru. Most of the northern part of this range has an elevation of about ; the southern part is somewhat lower. Rainfall, although scanty everywhere, is greater in the northern half, where the land is covered with scrub vegetation. The southern area receives almost no precipitation, and the landscape consists mostly of barren rocks. All of the Cordillera Occidental region is sparsely populated, and the south is virtually uninhabited. \n\nThe Altiplano, the high plateau between the previous range and the Cordillera Oriental, comprises four major basins formed by mountainous spurs that jut eastward from the Cordillera Occidental about halfway to the Cordillera Oriental. Along the Altiplano's eastern side is a continuous flat area, which has served as Bolivia's principal north-south transport corridor since colonial times. The entire Altiplano was originally a deep rift between the cordilleras that gradually filled with highly porous sedimentary debris washed down from the peaks. This sedimentary origin explains its gradual slope from north to south; greater rainfall in the north has washed a larger quantity of debris onto the platform floor. \n\nRainfall in the Altiplano decreases toward the south, and the scrub vegetation grows more sparse, eventually giving way to barren rocks and dry red clay. The land contains several salt flats, the dried remnants of ancient lakes. The largest of these - and the world's largest salt concentration - is the Uyuni Saltpan, which covers over 9,000 square kilometers. The salt is more than five meters deep in the centre of this flat. In the dry season, the lake bed can be traversed by heavy trucks. Near the Argentine border, the floor of the Altiplano rises again, creating hills and volcanoes that span the gap between the eastern and western cordilleras of the Andes. \n\nThe much older Cordillera Oriental enters Bolivia on the north side of Lake Titicaca, extends southeastward to approximately 17 south latitude, then broadens and stretches south to the Argentine border. The northernmost part of the Cordillera Oriental, the Cordillera Real, is an impressive snow-capped series of granite mountains. Some of these peaks exceed and two - Illimani , which overlooks the city of La Paz, and Illampu - have large glaciers on their upper slopes. South of 17 south latitude, the range changes character. Called the Cordillera Central here, the land is actually a large block of the Earth's crust that has been lifted and tilted eastward. The western edge of this block rises in a series of steep cliffs from the Altiplano. The backbone of the cordillera is a high, rolling plain, with elevations from to , interspersed with irregularly spaced high peaks. Too high to be exploited for large-scale commercial grazing, this area takes its name from the predominant vegetation type, the puna.\n\nThe northeastern flank of the Cordillera Real is known as the Yungas, from the Aymara and Quechua word \"yunka\" meaning \"warm valley.\" The steep, almost inaccessible slopes and peaks of this mainly semitropical valley area northeast of La Paz offer some of the most spectacular scenery in Bolivia. Rainfall is heavy, and lush vegetation clings to the sides of narrow river valleys. The land is among the most fertile in Bolivia, but poor transport has hindered its agricultural development. The government attempted to build a railway through the Yungas in 1917 to connect La Paz with the eastern lowlands. The railway was abandoned, however, after completion of only 150 kilometres. \n\nThe eastern slopes of the Cordillera Central descend gradually in a series of complex north-south ranges and hills. Rivers, draining to the east, have cut long narrow valleys; these valleys and the basins between the ranges are favourable areas for crops and settlement. Rich alluvial soils fill the low areas, but erosion has followed the removal of vegetation in some places. The valley floors range from 2,000 to 3,000 metres above sea level, and this lower elevation means milder temperatures than those of the Altiplano. The cities of Sucre, Tarija and Cochabamba, are located in basins of this vast region.\n\nThe eastern lowlands include all of Bolivia north and east of the Andes. Although comprising over two-thirds of the national territory, the region is sparsely populated and, until recently, has played a minor role in the economy. \n\nDifferences in topography and climate separate the lowlands into three areas. The flat northern area, made up of Beni and Pando Departments and the northern part of Cochabamba Department, consists of rainforest. Because much of the topsoil is underlain by claypan, drainage is poor, and heavy rainfall periodically converts vast parts of the region to swamp. The central area, comprising the northern half of Santa Cruz Department, has gently rolling hills and a drier climate than the north. Forests alternate with savanna, and much of the land has been cleared for cultivation. Santa Cruz, the largest city in the lowlands, is located here, as are most of Bolivia's petroleum and natural gas reserves. The southeastern part of the lowlands is part of the Gran Chaco. Virtually rainless for nine months of the year, this area becomes flooded for the three months of heavy rains. The extreme variation in rainfall supports only thorny scrub vegetation and cattle grazing, although recent discoveries of natural gas and petroleum near the foothills of the Andes have attracted some settlers to the region. \n\nMost of Bolivia's important rivers are found in the water-rich northern parts of the lowlands, particularly in the Alto Beni (Upper Beni), where the land is suitable for crops such as coffee and cacao. The northern lowlands are drained by wide, slow-moving rivers, the three largest of which—the Mamoré, Beni, and Madre de Dios—all flow northward into the Madeira River in Brazil and eventually into the River Amazon. Riverboats along the Beni and the Mamoré carry both passenger and freight traffic; rapids on the Madeira prevent river traffic farther into Brazil. Near the Paraguayan border, shallow sandy streams carry the seasonal runoff into the Pilcomayo or Paraguay rivers. Also, the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland of any kind, has some of its area in Bolivia.\n\nDespite the fact that eastern Bolivia is described a lowland in when seeing the general topography of the country there are mountains and mountain ranges well beyond the Andes. The most notable of these mountains are the forested Serranías Chiquitanas in eastern Santa Cruz Department.\n\nThe climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one ecoregion to the other, from the tropics in the eastern \"llanos\" to polar climates in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, atmospheric pressure and evaporation, giving place to very different climates. When the climatological phenomenon known as\" El Niño\" takes place, it provokes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows around the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more usual. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.\n\n\nGeographic coordinates: \n\nTerrain:\nrugged Andes Mountains with a highland plateau (Altiplano), hills, lowland plains of the Amazon Basin\n\nElevation extremes:\n<br>\"lowest point:\"\nRio Paraguay 90 m\n<br>\"highest point:\"\nNevado Sajama \n\nNatural resources:\ntin, natural gas, petroleum, zinc, tungsten, antimony, silver, iron, lead, gold, timber, hydro-power\n\nLand borders: Argentina (942 km), Brazil (3,403 km), Chile (942 km), Paraguay (753 km), Peru (1,212 km)\n\nLand use:\n<br>\"arable land:\"\n3.97%\n<br>\"permanent crops:\"\n0.20%\n<br>\"other:\"\n95.83% (2012)\n\nIrrigated land:\n1,282 km² (2003)\n\nTotal renewable water resources:\n622.5 cu km (2011)\n\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural:\n<br>\"total:\" 2.64 km³/yr (25%/14%/61%)\n<br>\"per capita:\" 305.8 m³/yr (2005)\n\nNatural hazards:\nflooding in the northeast (March–April)\n\nEnvironment - current issues:\nthe clearing of land for agricultural purposes and the international demand for tropical timber are contributing to deforestation; soil erosion from overgrazing and poor cultivation methods (including slash-and-burn agriculture); desertification; loss of biodiversity; industrial pollution of water supplies used for drinking and irrigation\n\nEnvironment - international agreements:\n<br>\"party to:\"\nBiodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands\n<br>\"signed, but not ratified:\"\nEnvironmental Modification, Marine Life Conservation\n\nGeography - note:\nlandlocked; separated from the Pacific Ocean via Chile.

{"id": "21324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21324", "title": "Geography of Nepal", "text": "Geography of Nepal\n\nNepal measures about along its Himalayan axis by across. Nepal has an area of .\n\nNepal is landlocked by India on three sides and China's Tibet Autonomous Region to the north. West Bengal's narrow \"Siliguri Corridor\" or Chicken's Neck separate Nepal and Bangladesh. To the east are India and Bhutan. Nepal depends on India for goods transport facilities and access to the sea, even for most goods imported from China.\n\nFor a small country, Nepal has tremendous geographic diversity. It rises from as low as elevation in the tropical Terai—the northern rim of the Gangetic Plain, beyond the perpetual snow line to some 90 peaks over including Earth's highest Mount Everest or \"Sagarmatha\". In addition to the continuum from tropical warmth to cold comparable to polar regions, average annual precipitation varies from as little as in the rainshadow north of the Himalaya to as much as on windward slopes.\n\nAlong a south-to-north transect, Nepal can be divided into three belts: Terai, Pahad and Himal. In the other direction, it is divided into three major river systems, from east to west: \"Koshi\", \"Gandaki/Narayani\" and \"Karnali\" (including the \"Mahakali/Sarda\" along the western border), all tributaries of the Ganges. The Ganges-\"Yarlung Zangbo/Brahmaputra\" watershed largely coincides with the Nepal-Tibet border, however several Ganges tributaries rise inside Tibet.\n\nTerai is a low land region containing some hill ranges.The Terai (\"also\" Tarai) \"or\" Madhesh region begins at the Indian border and includes the southernmost part of the flat, intensively farmed Gangetic Plain called the \"Outer Terai\". By the 19th century, timber and other resources were being exported to India. Industrialization based on agricultural products such as jute began in the 1930s and infrastructure such roadways, railways and electricity were extended across the border before it reached Nepal's pahad.\n\nThe Outer Terai is culturally more similar to adjacent parts of India's Bihar and Uttar Pradesh than to the Pahad of Nepal. Nepali is taught in schools and often spoken in government offices, however the local population mostly uses Maithali, Bhojpuri and Tharu languages.\n\nThe Outer Terai ends at the base of the first range of foothills called the \"Siwaliks\" or \"Churia\". This range has a densely forested skirt of coarse alluvium called the \"bhabhar\". Below the bhabhar, finer, less permeable sediments force groundwater to the surface in a zone of springs and marshes. In Persian, \"terai\" refers to wet or marshy ground. Before the use of DDT this was dangerously malarial. Nepal's rulers used this for a defensive frontier called the \"char kose jhadi\" (four \"kos\" forest, one kos equalling about three kilometers or two miles).\n\nAbove the bhabhar belt, the Siwaliks rise to about with peaks as high as , steeper on their southern flanks because of faults known as the \"Main Frontal Thrust\". This range is composed of poorly consolidated, coarse sediments that do not retain water or support soil development so there is virtually no agricultural potential and sparse population.\n\nIn several places beyond the Siwaliks there are \"dūn\" valleys called Inner Terai . These valleys have productive soil but were dangerously malarial except to indigenous \"Tharu people\" who had genetic resistance. In the mid-1950s DDT came into use to suppress mosquitos and the way was open to settlement from the land-poor hills, to the detriment of the Tharu.\n\nThe terai ends and the Pahad begin at a higher range of foothills called the \"Mahabharat Range\".\n\nPahad is a mountain region which doesn't generally contain snow.It is situated south of the Himal, the Pahad is mostly betw altitude. This region begins at the \"Mahabharat Range\" (Lesser Himalaya) where a fault system called the \"Main Boundary Thrust\" creates an escarpment high, to a crest between .\n\nThese steep southern slopes are nearly uninhabited, thus an effective buffer between languages and culture in the Terai and Pahad. Hindu \"Paharis\" mainly populate river and stream bottoms that enable rice cultivation and are warm enough for winter/spring crops of wheat and potato. The increasingly urbanized \"Kathmandu\" and \"Pokhara\" valleys fall within the Hill region. \"Newars\" are an indigenous ethnic group with their own Tibeto-Burman language. The Newar were originally indigenous to the Kathmandu valley but have spread into Pokhara and other towns alongside urbanized Pahari.\n\nOther indigenous \"janajati\" ethnic groups -— natively speaking highly localized Tibeto-Burman languages and dialects -— populate hillsides up to about . This group includes \"Magar\" and \"Kham Magar\" west of Pokhara, \"Gurung\" south of the \"Annapurnas\", \"Tamang\" around the periphery of Kathmandu Valley and \"Rai\", \"Koinch Sunuwar\" and \"Limbu\" further east. Temperate and subtropical fruits are grown as cash crops. Marijuana was grown and processed into \"Charas\" (hashish) until international pressure persuaded the government to outlaw it in 1976. There is increasing reliance on animal husbandry with elevation, using land above for summer grazing and moving herds to lower elevations in winter. Grain production has not kept pace with population growth at elevations above where colder temperatures inhibit double cropping. Food deficits drive emigration out of the pahad in search of employment.\n\nThe Pahad ends where ridges begin substantially rising out of the temperate climate zone into subalpine zone above .\n\nHimal is a mountain region containing snow.\nThe Mountain Region or \"Parbat\" begins where high ridges (Nepali: लेक; lekh) begin substantially rising above into the subalpine and alpine zone which are mainly used for seasonal pasturage. A few tens kilometers further north the high Himalaya abruptly rise along the \"Main Central Thrust\" fault zone above the snow line at . Some 90 of Nepal's peaks exceed and eight exceed including Mount Everest at and Kanchenjunga at .\n\nUnlike the \"Mahabharats\", the Himalaya are not continuous across Nepal. Instead there are some 20 subranges including the \"Kanchenjunga\" massif along the Sikkim border, \"Mahalangur Himal\" around Mt. Everest. \"Langtang\" north of Kathmandu, \"Annapurna\" and \"Manaslu\" north of Pokhara, then \"Dhaulagiri\" further west with \"Kanjiroba\" north of \"Jumla\" and finally \"Gurans Himal\" in the far west.\n\nThe main watershed between the Brahmaputra (called \"Yarlung Tsangpo\" in Tibet) and the Ganges system (including all of Nepal) actually lies north of the highest ranges. Alpine, often semi-arid valleys—including \"Humla\", \"Jumla\", \"Dolpo\", \"Mustang\", \"Manang\" and \"Khumbu\"—cut between Himalayan subranges or lie north of them.\n\nSome of these valleys historically were more accessible from Tibet than Nepal and are populated by people with Tibetan affinities called \"Bhotiya\" or \"Bhutia\" including the famous Sherpas in Kumbu valley near Mount Everest. With Chinese cultural hegemony in Tibet itself, these valleys have become repositories of traditional ways. Valleys with better access from the hill regions to the south are culturally linked to Nepal as well as Tibet, notably the Kali Gandaki Gorge where Thakali culture shows influences in both directions.\n\nPermanent villages in the mountain region stand as high as with summer encampments even higher. Bhotiyas graze yaks, grow cold-tolerant crops such as potatoes, barley, buckwheat and millet. They traditionally traded across the mountains, e.g., Tibetan salt for rice from lowlands in Nepal and India. Since trade was restricted in the 1950s they have found work as high altitude porters, guides, cooks and other accessories to tourism and alpinism.\n\nNepal's latitude is about the same as that of Florida, however with elevations ranging from less than to over and precipitation from to over the country has eight climate zones from tropical to perpetual snow.\n\nThe tropical zone below experiences frost less than once per decade. It can be subdivided into lower tropical (below 300 meters or 1,000 ft.) with 18% of the nation's land area) and upper (18% of land area) tropical zones. The best mangoes and well as papaya and banana are largely confined to the lower zone. Other fruit such as litchee, jackfruit, citrus and mangoes of lower quality grow in the upper tropical zone as well. Winter crops include grains and vegetables typically grown in temperate climates. The Outer Terai is virtually all in the lower tropical zone. Inner Terai valleys span both tropical zones. The Sivalik Hills are mostly upper tropical. Tropical climate zones extend far up river valleys across the Middle Hills and even into the Mountain regions.\n\nThe subtropical climate zone from occupies 22% of Nepal's land area and is the most prevalent climate of the Middle Hills above river valleys. It experiences frost up to 53 days per year, however this varies greatly with elevation, proximity to high mountains and terrain either draining or ponding cold air drainage. Crops include rice, maize, millet, wheat, potato, stone fruits and citrus.\n\nThe great majority of Nepal's population occupies the tropical and subtropical climate zones. In the Middle Hills, upper-caste Hindus are concentrated in tropical valleys which are well suited for rice cultivation while \"Janajati\" ethnic groups mostly live above in the subtropical zone and grow other grains more than rice.\n\nThe Temperate climate zone from occupies 12% of Nepal's land area and has up to 153 annual days of frost. It is encountered in higher parts of the Middle Hills and throughout much of the Mountain region. Crops include cold-tolerant rice, maize, wheat, barley, potato, apple, walnut, peach, various cole, amaranthus and buckwheat.\n\nThe Subalpine zone from occupies 9% of Nepal's land area, mainly in the Mountain and Himalayan regions. It has permanent settlements in the Himalaya, but further south it is only seasonally occupied as pasture for sheep, goats, yak and hybrids in warmer months. There are up to 229 annual days of frost here. Crops include barley, potato, cabbage, cauliflower, amaranthus, buckwheat and apple. Medicinal plants are gathered.\n\nThe Alpine zone from occupies 8% of the country's land area. There are a few permanent settlements above 4,000 meters. There is virtually no plant cultivation although medicinal herbs are gathered. Sheep, goats, yaks and hybrids are pastured in warmer months.\n\nAbove 5,000 meters the climate becomes Nival and there is no human habitation or even seasonal use.\n\nArid and semi-arid land in the rainshadow of high ranges have a Transhimalayan climate. Population density is very low. Cultivation and husbandry conform to subalpine and alpine patterns but depend on snowmelt and streams for irrigation.\n\nPrecipitation generally decreases from east to west with increasing distance from the Bay of Bengal, source of the summer monsoon. Eastern Nepal gets about annually; the Kathmandu area about and western Nepal about . This pattern is modified by adiabatic effects as rising air masses cool and drop their moisture content on windward slopes, then warm up as they descend so relative humidity drops. Annual precipitation reaches on windward slopes in the \"Annapurna\" Himalaya beyond a relatively low stretch of the \"Mahabharat Range\". In rainshadows beyond the high mountains, annual precipitation drops as low as .\n\nThe year is divided into a wet season from June to September—as summer warmth over Inner Asia creates a low pressure zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean—and a dry season from October to June as cold temperatures in the vast interior creates a high pressure zone causing dry air to flow outward. April and May are months of intense water stress when cumulative effects of the long dry season are exacerbated by temperatures rising over in the tropical climate belt. Seasonal drought further intensifies in the \"Siwaliks\" hills consisting of poorly consolidated, coarse, permeable sediments that do not retain water, so hillsides are often covered with drought-tolerant scrub forest. In fact much of Nepal's native vegetation adapted to withstand drought, but less so at higher elevations where cooler temperatures mean less water stress.\n\nThe summer monsoon may be preceded by a buildup of thunderstorm activity that provides water for rice seedbeds. Sustained rain on average arrives in mid-June as rising temperatures over Inner Asia creates a low pressure zone that draws in moist air from the Indian Ocean, but this can vary up to a month. Significant failure of monsoon rains historically meant drought and famine while above-normal rains still cause flooding and landslides with losses in human lives, farmland and buildings.\n\nThe monsoon also complicates transportation with roads and trails washing out while unpaved roads and airstrips may become unusable and cloud cover reduces safety margins for aviation. Rains diminish in September and generally end by mid-October, ushering in generally cool, clear, and dry weather, as well as the most relaxed and jovial period in Nepal. By this time, the harvest is completed and people are in a festive mood. The two biggest and most important Hindu festivals—\"Dashain\" and \"Tihar\" (\"Dipawali\")—arrive during this period, about one month apart. The post monsoon season lasts until about December.\n\nAfter the post monsoon comes the winter monsoon, a strong north easterly flow marked by occasional, short rainfalls in the lowlands and plains and snowfalls in the high-altitude areas. In this season the Himalayas function as a barrier to cold air masses from Inner Asia, so southern Nepal and northern India have warmer winters than would otherwise be the case. April and May are dry and hot, especially below where afternoon temperatures may exceed .\n\nThe dramatic changes in elevation along this transect result in a variety of biomes, from tropical savannas along the Indian border, to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the hills, to temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests on the slopes of the Himalaya, to montane grasslands and shrublands, and finally rock and ice at the highest elevations.\n\nThis corresponds to the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion.\n\nSubtropical forests dominate the lower elevations of the Hill Region. They form a mosaic running east-west across Nepal, with Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests between and Himalayan subtropical pine forests between . At higher elevations, to , are found temperate broadleaf forests: eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests to the east of the Gandaki River and western Himalayan broadleaf forests to the west.\n\nThe native forests of the Mountain Region change from east to west as precipitation decreases. They can be broadly classified by their relation to the Gandaki River. From are the eastern and western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. To are the eastern and western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows.\n\n\nNepal has three categories of rivers. The largest systems -— from east to west \"Koshi\", \"Gandaki/Narayani\", \"Karnali/Goghra\" and \"Mahakali\"—originate in multiple tributaries rising in or beyond the high Himalaya that maintain substantial flows from snowmelt through the hot, droughty spring before the summer monsoon. These tributaries cross the highest mountains in deep gorges, flow south through the Middle Hills, then join in candelabra-like configuration before crossing the Mahabharat Range and emerging onto the plains where they have deposited \"megafans\" exceeding area.\n\nThe Koshi is also called \"Sapta Koshi\" for its seven Himalayan tributaries in eastern Nepal: \"Indrawati\", \"Sun Koshi\", \"Tama Koshi\", \"Dudh Koshi\", \"Liku\", \"Arun\", and \"Tamor\". The Arun rises in Tibet some beyond Nepal's northern border. A tributary of the Sun Koshi, Bhote Koshi also rises in Tibet and is followed by the Arniko Highway connecting Kathmandu and Lhasa.\n\nThe \"Gandaki/Narayani\" has seven Himalayan tributaries in the center of the country: \"Daraudi\", \"Seti Gandaki\", \"Madi\", \"Kali\", \"Marsyandi\", \"Budhi\", and \"Trisuli\" also called \"Sapta Gandaki\". The \"Kali Gandaki\" rises on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and flows through the semi-independent Kingdom of Mustang, then between the 8,000 meter \"Dhaulagiri\" and \"Annapurna\" ranges in the world's deepest valley. The Trisuli rises north of the international border inside Tibet. After the seven upper tributaries join, the river becomes the \"Narayani\" inside Nepal and is joined by the \"(East) Rapti\" from Chitwan Valley. Crossing into India, its name changes to \"Gandak\".\n\nThe \"Karnali\" drains western Nepal, with the \"Bheri\" and \"Seti\" as major tributaries. The upper Bheri drains Dolpo, a remote valley beyond the Dhaulagiri Himalaya with traditional Tibetan cultural affinities. The upper Karnali rises inside Tibet near sacred \"Lake Manasarovar\" and \"Mount Kailash\". The area around these features is the hydrographic nexus of South Asia since it holds the sources of the Indus and its major tributary the \"Sutlej\", the Karnali—a Ganges tributary—and the \"Yarlung Tsangpo\"/\"Brahmaputra\". It is the center of the universe according to traditional cosmography. The \"Mahakali\" or \"Kali\" along the Nepal-India border on the west joins the Karnali in India, where the river is known as \"Goghra\" or \"Ghaghara\".\n\nSecond category rivers rise in the Middle Hills and \"Mahabharat Range\", from east to west the \"Mechi\", \"Kankai\" and \"Kamala\" south of the Kosi; the \"Bagmati\" that drains Kathmandu Valley between the Kosi and Gandaki systems, then the \"West Rapti\" and the \"Babai\" between the Gandaki and Karnali systems. Without glacial sources, annual flow regimes in these rivers are more variable although limited flow persists through the dry season.\n\nThird category rivers rise in the outermost \"Siwalik\" foothills and are mostly seasonal.\n\nNone of these river systems support significant commercial navigation. Instead, deep gorges create obstacles to establishing transport and communication networks and de-fragmenting the economy. Foot-trails are still primary transportation routes in many hill districts.\n\nRivers in all three categories are capable of causing serious floods. Koshi River in the first category caused a major flood in August 2008 in \"Bihar\" state, India after breaking through a poorly maintained embankment just inside Nepal. The West Rapti in the second category is called \"Gorakhpur's Sorrow\" for its history of urban flooding. Third category Terai rivers are associated with flash floods.\n\nSince uplift and erosion are more or less in equilibrium in the Himalaya, at least where the climate is humid, rapid uplift must be balanced out by annual increments of millions tonnes of sediments washing down from the mountains; then on the plains settling out of suspension on vast alluvial fans over which rivers meander and change course at least every few decades, causing some experts to question whether manmade embankments can contain the problem of flooding. Traditional \"Mithila\" culture along the lower Koshi in Nepal and Bihar celebrated the river as the giver of life for its fertile alluvial soil, yet also the taker of life through its catastrophic floods.\n\nLarge reservoirs in the Middle Hills may be able to capture peak flows and mitigate downstream flooding, to store surplus monsoon flows for dry season irrigation and to generate electricity. Water for irrigation is especially compelling because the Indian Terai is suspected to have entered a \"food bubble\" where dry season crops are dependent on water from tubewells that in the aggregate are unsustainably \"mining\" groundwater.\nDepletion of aquifers without building upstream dams as a sustainable alternative water source could precipitate a Malthusian catastrophe in India's food insecure states Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with over 300 million combined population. With India already experiencing a Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in Bihar, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, Nepalese reluctance to agree to water projects could even seem an existential threat to India.\n\nAs Nepal builds barrages to divert more water for irrigation during the dry season preceding the summer monsoon, there is less for downstream users in Bangladesh and India's Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states. The best solution could be building large upstream reservoirs, to capture and store surplus flows during summer monsoon as well as providing flood control benefits to Bangladesh and India. Then water sharing agreements could allocate a portion of the stored water to be left to flow into India during the following dry season.\n\nNevertheless, building dams in Nepal is controversial for several reasons. First, the region is seismically active. Dam failures caused by earthquakes could cause tremendous death and destruction downstream, particularly on the densely populated Gangetic Plain. Second, global warming has led to the formation of glacial lakes dammed by unstable moraines. Sudden failures of these moraines can cause floods with cascading failures of manmade structures downstream.\n\nThird, sedimentation rates in the Himalaya are extremely high, leading to rapid loss of storage capacity as sediments accumulate behind dams. Fourth, there are complicated questions of cross-border equity in how India and Nepal would share costs and benefits that have proven difficult to resolve in the context of frequent acrimony between the two countries.\n\n\n\nICIMOD’s first and most complete national land cover database of Nepal prepared using public domain Landsat TM data of 2010 shows that show that forest is the dominant form of land cover in Nepal covering 57,538 km with a contribution of 39.09% to the total geographical area of the country. Most of this forest cover is broadleaved closed and open forest, which covers 21,200 km2 or 14.4% of the geographical area.\n\nNeedleleaved open forest is the least common of the forest areas covering 8267 km (5.62%). Agriculture area is significant extending over 43,910 km (29.83%). As would be expected, the high mountain area is largely covered by snow and glaciers and barren land.\nThe Hill region constitutes the largest portion of Nepal, covering 29.5% of the geographical area, and has a large area (19,783 km) of cultivated or managed lands, natural and semi natural vegetation (22,621 km) and artificial surfaces (200 km). The Tarai region has more cultivated or managed land (14,104 km) and comparatively less natural and semi natural vegetation (4280 km). The Tarai has only 267 km of natural water bodies. The High mountain region has 12,062 km of natural water bodies, snow/glaciers and 13,105 km barren areas.\n\n25.4% of Nepal's land area, or about is covered with forest according to FAO figures from 2005. FAO estimates that around 9.6% of Nepal's forest cover consists of \"primary forest\" which is relatively intact. About 12.1% Nepal's forest is classified as \"protected\" while about 21.4% is \"conserved\" according to FAO. About 5.1% Nepal's forests are classified as \"production forest\". Between 2000 and 2005, Nepal lost about of forest. Nepal's 2000–2005 total deforestation rate was about 1.4% per year meaning it lost an average of of forest annually. Nepal's total deforestation rate from 1990 to 2000 was or 2.1% per year. The 2000–2005 true deforestation rate in Nepal, defined as the loss of primary forest, is -0.4% or per year. Forest is not changing in the plan land of Nepal, forest fragmenting on the Roof of the World.\n\nAccording to ICIMOD figures from 2010, forest is the dominant form of land cover in Nepal covering 57,538 km with a contribution of 39.09% to the total geographical area of the country. Most of this forest cover is broadleaved closed and open forest, which covers 21,200 km or 14.4% of the geographical area. Needleleaved open forest is the least common of the forest areas covering 8,267 km2 (5.62%). At national level 64.8% area is covered by core forests of > 500 ha size and 23.8% forests belong to patch and edge category forests. The patch forest constituted 748 km at national level, out of which 494 km of patch forests are present in hill regions. Middle mountains, Siwaliks and Terai regions have more than 70% of the forest area under core forest category > 500 ha size. The edge forests constituted around 30% of forest area of High Mountain and Hill regions.\nForest Resource Assessment (FRA) which was conducted between 2010 and 2014 by the Ministry of Forest and Soil conservation with the financial and technical help of Government of Finland shows that 40.36% land of Nepal is forested. And 4.40% land have Shrubs and bushes.\nDeforestation is driven by multiple processes.\nVirtually throughout the nation, over-harvest of firewood remains problematic. Despite the availability of liquefied petroleum gas in towns and cities, firewood is sold more at energy-competitive prices because cutting and selling it is a fallback when better employment opportunities aren't forthcoming. Firewood still supplies 80% of Nepal's energy for heating and cooking. Harvesting construction timber and lopping branches for fodder for cattle and other farm animals are also deforestation/degradation drivers in all geographic zones.\n\nIllegal logging is a problems in the Siwaliks, with sawlogs smuggled into India. Clearing for resettlement and agriculture expansion also causes deforestation as does urban expansion, building infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, electric transmission lines, water tanks, police and army barracks, temples and picnic areas.\n\nIn the Middle Hills road construction, reservoirs, transmission lines and extractive manufacturing such as cement factories cause deforestation. In the mountains building hotels, monasteries and trekking trails cause deforestation while timber-smuggling into the Tibet Autonomous Region and over-grazing cause degradation.\n\nWhile India and Nepal have an open border with no restrictions on movement of their citizens on either side, there are 23 checkpoints for trade purposes. These are listed in counterclockwise order, east to west. The six in italics are also used for entry/exit by third country nationals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58206850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58206850", "title": "Geology of Suriname", "text": "Geology of Suriname\n\nThe geology of Suriname is predominantly formed by the Guyana Shield, which spans 90% of its land area. Coastal plains account for the remaining ten percent. Most rocks in Suriname date to the Precambrian. These crystalline basement rocks consists of granitoid and acid volcanic rocks with enclaves of predominantly low-grade metamorphic, geosynclinal rocks in the Marowijne area and of probably considerably older rocks in the Falawatra group of the Bakhuisgebirge and the Coronie area. There are also small, scattered bodies of gabbro and ultramafitite. These are about the same age as the granite and volcanics. It has been found that the construction of the basement was largely created during the final phase of the Trans-Amazonian Orogeny Cycle, about 1.9 billion years ago. This cycle has had a significant influence on the geology of Suriname, characterized by sedimentation, metamorphosis, corrugation and magmatism. \n\nYoung sediments cover the northern 20% of the country. They exist from south to north and from old to young from the Coesewine, Coropina and Demarara formations. The older Onverdacht formation is only accessible at Moengo. In the coastal area, the three first mentioned formations are accessible in the savannah belt, the old coastal plain and the marshy young coastal plain. They show a slight, northward slope. The late Pleistocene Coropina Formation and the Holocene Demerara Formation consist of clay mud banks set up in a lagoon region with zigzagging complexes (beach walls) formed of sand and shells. The Coesewijne Formation in the savannah belt consists of coarse, unsorted sands with kaolinite clays. These are probably deposited by braided streams and possibly partly in alluvial delta's. The Coesewijne formation is of Pliocene age. The Onverdacht Formation consists of unsorted sands and kaolinite clays and is covered with bauxite on the surface at Moengo, with subordinate bauxites at Onverdacht. This formation forms old hills protected by the bauxite cover against erosion around which the younger formations have been deposited. \n\nThe first known geological survey in Suriname dates back to 1720. Friederich Voltz carried out systematic geological research for the first time in 1853. This research was conducted along the lower reaches of the major rivers. In 1888, the first overview map of Suriname with geological data was published by Karl Martin. Until 1900 the interest was focused on gold. Until the 20th century, interest in the geology of the country usually had a more or less local and incidental character. In 1931 R. IJzerman collected all geological research from the period 1853 - 1930 in his dissertation, it gives a fairly complete picture of the geology of Suriname and is provided with a geological overview. \n\nThe fertile coastal plain consists of marine clay deposits, weathering products from the Andean mountain range that reached the coast of Suriname via the Amazon River and the Guiana Current. The coastline is mobile because land is washed away repeatedly under the influence of storms and currents. \n\nThe knowledge of the geology of the Surinamese coastal plain has increased in the 20th cenutry. In 1931 IJzerman gave a general description of the sediments that occur in the foreland. He distinguished two layers of groups: the fluvio-marine deposits, in which clays and sands occur and the older continental alluvium, for a large part consisting of coarse white, sometimes humus-bearing sands. The fluvio-marine deposits lie in a belt immediately along the coast and the continental alluvium comes to the surface in a belt behind it, wedging against the rocks of the Guiana Shield. The geologist Jan Zonneveld, who worked at the Centraal Bureau Luchtkartering in Paramaribo, around 1950, after studying the use of water level profiles, field research and the interpretation of aerial photographs, was of the opinion that on the surface not two, but three elements should be distinguished, namely from north to south. :\n\n\nSome authorities still distinguish a fourth element, namely \"the domestic remaining highlands\". \n\nThe mountainous region of Suriname forms a 'central core' from which foothills radiate in different directions. In the northern part of the country, the Brownsberg, the Hok A Hingeberg, the Nassau mountain range and the Lely mountain range are striking elements. Outside the actual mountain ranges, the lowlands, there are various isolated mountains. Some of these are: the Tebu, the Roosevelt peak and the Voltzberg. Some of these mountains have flat shapes, for example Table Mountain in the Tafelberg Nature Reserve. Table Mountain consists of a plate of Roraima sandstone. The Roraima Formation only occurs on Table Mountain and in the Emmaketen. The Brownsberg, the Bakhuis, Hok A Hin-, Nassau and Lely Mountains are characterized by plateaus that consist of laterite and local bauxite crusts. \n\nThe low terrains between the mountains show a \"multi-convex\" relief over large expanses, which consists of countless low bulging hills. The hills have a striking similarity in top height. The different top levels are arranged in a stepwise manner and can be followed along the river in an upstream direction. They are believed to be remnants of earlier flattening. This stepwise succession of plains must have been achieved because the interior has undergone a tectonic upheaval from time to time, which forced the rivers to cut downward, after which surface formation could occur again. A large part of the erosion material was deposited in the falling coastal area. The fragmentation of the stepped relief into a \"multiconvex\" hill landscape must have taken place during the last part of the Pleistocene. \n\nIn Suriname, savanna areas occur both in the northern lowlands and in the more hilly areas of the interior. The savannas of Suriname probably owe their origin to the savanna climate that dominated 10,000 years ago. The current ecosystem of the savanna changes through human activities such as sand excavations. \n\nThere are three areas that are characterized by the presence of savannas:\n\n\nOn sandstone, granite and laterite caps, there are smaller, more or less individually occurring savannahs here and there. \n\nThe savannas cover about one percent of the Surinamese landscape. Approximately one fifth of the known plant species of Suriname occur in these areas. Savannas can be classified on the basis of the vegetation. There are bush and grass savannas and savanna forest, the latter is distinguished by the higher and denser vegetation. \nThe Suriname Planatlas of 1988 mentions the following mineral resources:\n\nIn Suriname, research into the soil and geology is mainly conducted by the Geological Mining Service. Geological research is often not easy because a large part of the country is difficult to reach and is covered with dense forests. This service is also responsible for stimulating mining in general. \nIn 2013, Surinamese institutions in collaboration with Brazil worked on a mapping project at the southern border of the country in the Sipaliwini district. The project will lead to the implementation of new topographic, hydrographic, geological, geophysical and structural maps. The new maps will be composed with the most modern tools that Brazil has. The project is being carried out by the Suriname Environmental and Mining Foundation together with the Geological Mining Service (GMD), the Anton de Kom University of Suriname and the Geological Service of Brazil. \n"}
{"id": "37966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37966", "title": "Himalayas", "text": "Himalayas\n\nThe Himalayas, or Himalaya (), form a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nThe Himalayan range has many of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest. The Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding in elevation, including ten of the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is tall.\n\nLifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of Indus river. Its eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, is just west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River (upper stream of the Brahmaputra River). The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges, to the north, the chain is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by a wide tectonic valley called the Indus-Tsangpo Suture. Towards the south the arc of the Himalaya is ringed by the very low Indo-Gangetic Plain. The range varies in width from in the west (Pakistan) to in the east (Arunachal Pradesh). The Himalayas are distinct from the other great ranges of central Asia, although sometimes the term Himalaya (or Greater Himalaya) is loosely used to include the Karakoram and some of the other ranges.\n\nThe Himalayas are inhabited by 52.7 million people and are spread across five countries: Nepal, India, Bhutan, China and Pakistan. Some of the world's major rivers — the Indus, the Ganges and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra — rise in the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to roughly 600 million people. The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the region, helping to keep the monsoon rains on the Indian plain and limiting rainfall on the Tibetan plateau. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of the Indian subcontinent; many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nThe name of the range derives from the Sanskrit \"Himā-laya\" (, \"Abode of Snow\"), from \"himá\" (, \"snow\") and \"ā-laya\" (, \"receptacle, dwelling\"). They are now known as the \"\", usually shortened to the \"Himalayas\". Formerly, they were described in the singular as the \"Himalaya\". This was also previously transcribed \"Himmaleh\", as in Emily Dickinson's poetry and Henry David Thoreau's essays.\n\nThe mountains are known as the \"Himālaya\" in Nepali and Hindi (both written ), the \"Himalaya\" () or 'The Land of Snow' () in Tibetan, the \"Hamaleh\" Mountain Range () in Urdu and the \"Ximalaya\" Mountain Range in Chinese.\n\nIn the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the 8000m peaks of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna in Nepal, separated by the Kali Gandaki Gorge. The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically – the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki, the Kora La is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and K2. To the east of Annapurna are the 8000 m peaks of Manaslu and across the border in Tibet, Shishapangma. To the south of these lies Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the Kathmandu Valley lies valley of the Bhote/Sun Kosi river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China – the Araniko Highway/China National Highway 318. Further east is the Mahalangur Himal with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: Cho Oyu, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu. The Khumbu region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The Arun river drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing through the range to the east of Makalu.\n\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the Kanchenjunga massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly 8000 m summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of Sikkim. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to Lhasa, Tibet, which passes over the Nathu La pass into Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan. The highest mountain in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum, which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of Namche Barwa, situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the Yarlang Tsangpo river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the Kangri Garpo mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including Gyala Peri, however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.\n\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to Rara Lake, the largest lake in Nepal. The Karnali River rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with India follows the Sarda River and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of Gurla Mandhata. Just across Lake Manasarovar from this lies the sacred Mount Kailash, which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of Uttarkhand, the Himalayas rise again as the Garwhal Himalayas with the high peaks of Nanda Devi and Kamet. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri, and the temples at Badrinath and Kedarnath. \nThe next Himalayan Indian state, Himachal Pradesh, it is noted for its hill stations, particularly Shimla, the summer capital of the British Raj, and Dharmasala, the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the Sutlej river, the most easterly of the five tributaries of the Indus, cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the Indian State of Jammu & Kashmir. The twin peaks of Nun Kun are the only mountains over 7000 m in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown Kashmir Valley and the town and lakes of Srinagar. Finally, the Himalayas cross the Line of Control into Pakistan and reach their western end in the dramatic 8000 m peak of Nanga Parbat, which rises over 7000 m above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000 m summits.\n\nThe Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, its formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Arakan Yoma highlands in Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal were also formed as a result of this collision.\n\nDuring the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate) was moving at about 15 cm per year. About 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density continental crust, they were thrust faulted and folded into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the mantle along an oceanic trench. An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone from this ancient ocean.\n\nToday, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards. The Indian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 km into Asia. About 20  mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5  mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\n\nDuring the last ice age, there was a connected ice stream of glaciers between Kangchenjunga in the east and Nanga Parbat in the west. In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the Karakoram, and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice. To the south, outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of . While the current valley glaciers of the Himalaya reach at most in length, several of the main valley glaciers were long during the ice age. The glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and ablation of a glacier are balanced) was about lower than it is today. Thus, the climate was at least colder than it is today.\n\nDespite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major watershed, and a number of rivers cut through the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:\n\nThe northern slopes of Gyala Peri and the peaks beyond the Tsangpo, sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the Irrawaddy River, which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the Andaman Sea. The Salween, Mekong, Yangtze and Yellow River all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the \"circum-Himalayan rivers\".\n\nThe great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic. The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about 12,000 km (3,000 cubic miles) of fresh water. Its glaciers include the Gangotri and Yamunotri (Uttarakhand) and Khumbu glaciers (Mount Everest region), Langtang glacier (Langtang region) and Zemu (Sikkim).\n\nOwing to the mountains' latitude near the Tropic of Cancer, the permanent snow line is among the highest in the world at typically around . In contrast, equatorial mountains in New Guinea, the Rwenzoris and Colombia have a snow line some lower. The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large perennial rivers.\n\nIn recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of glacier retreat across the region as a result of global climate change. For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons.\n\nThe Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most of the larger lakes are on the northern side of the main range. The most famous is the sacred freshwater Lake Manasarovar, near to Mount Kailas with an area of 410 km² and an altitude of 4590m. It drains into the nearby Lake Rakshastal with an area of 250 km² and slightly lower at 4575m. Pangong Tso, which is spread across the border between India and China, at far western end of Tibet, and Yamdrok Tso, located in south central Tibet, are among the largest with surface areas of 700 km², and 638 km², respectively. Lake Puma Yumco is one of the highest of the larger lakes at an elevation of 5030m.\n\nSouth of the main range, the lakes are smaller. Tilicho Lake in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world. Other notable lakes include Rara Lake in western Nepal, She-Phoksundo Lake in the Shey Phoksundo National Park of Nepal, Gurudongmar Lake, in North Sikkim, Gokyo Lakes in Solukhumbu district of Nepal and Lake Tsongmo, near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.\n\nSome of the lakes present a danger of a glacial lake outburst flood. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake in the Rowaling Valley, in the Dolakha District of Nepal, is rated as the most dangerous. The lake, which is located at an altitude of has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting. The mountain lakes are known to geographers as \"tarns\" if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.\n\nThe vast size, huge altitude range and complex topography of the Himalayas mean they experience a wide range of climates, from humid subtropical in the foothills to cold, dry desert conditions on the Tibetan side of the range.\n\nFor much of Himalayas – that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the monsoon. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism – the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.\n\nUsing the Köppen climate classification, the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as Cwa, Humid subtropical climate with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a subtropical highland climate (Cwb).\n\nIn the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.\n\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a cold desert climate. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.\n\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by for every 1000m rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra and permanent snow and ice. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the rain shadow of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the Upper Mustang which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri massifs and has annual precipitation of around 300mm, while Pokhara on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall (3,900mm/year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.\n\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the Taklamakan and Gobi.\n\nThe flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor extremophile organisms.\n\nThe unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to climate change. \"Hydrangea hirta\" is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially rhododendron, apple and \"box myrtle\". The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is \"Juniperus tibetica\" located at in Southeastern Tibet.\n\nThe Himalayan population belongs to four distinct cultural groups, who throughout history have systematically penetrated the isolated indigenous Himalayan population. Those migrating cultures – Hindu (Indian), Buddhist (Tibetan), Islamic (Afghanistan–Iran) and Animist (Burmese and south-eastern Asian) – without any doubt have created here their own individual and unique place. Their current arrangement, though with a few exceptions, is linked to specific geographical regions, and the relative altitude at which they occur.\n\nThere are many cultural aspects of the Himalayas. In Jainism, Mount Ashtapad in Himalayas is a sacred place where the first Jain Tirthankara, Rishabhdeva attained moksha. It is believed that after Rishabhdeva attained nirvana, his son emperor Bharata Chakravartin had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 Tirthankaras with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it \"Sinhnishdha\". For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavath, the father of the goddess Parvati. The Himalayas is also considered to be the father of the river Ganges. The Mountain Kailash is a sacred peak to the Hindus and is where the Lord Shiva is believed to live. Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus is the temple complex in Pashupatinath and Muktinath, also known as Saligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called saligrams.\n\nThe Buddhists also lay a great deal of importance on the mountains of the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where Buddhism started in Bhutan. The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or \"mahasiddhas\". They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa.\n\nThe Himalayan people’s diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing. The shapes and materials of the people’s homes reflect their practical needs and the beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place a great importance on jewellery. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewellery.\n\nSeveral places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. A notable example of a religious site is Paro Taktsang, where Padmasambhava is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan. Padmasambhava is also worshipped as the patron saint of Sikkim. There are also Muslim and Hindhu Shaivite Kashmiri Pandit in the area of Kashmir.\n\nIn Hinduism, the Himalayas have been personified as the king of all Mountain – \"Giriraj Himavat\", father of Ganga and Parvati (form of Adi Shakti Durga).\n\nA number of Vajrayana Buddhist sites are situated in the Himalayas, in Tibet, Bhutan and in the Indian regions of Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Spiti and Darjeeling. There were over 6,000 monasteries in Tibet, including the residence of the Dalai Lama. Bhutan, Sikkim and Ladakh are also dotted with numerous monasteries. The Tibetan Muslims have their own mosques in Lhasa and Shigatse.\n\nThe Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites.\nDifferent parts of the plants – root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark – are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an \"abies pindrow\" tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an \"arachne cordifolia\" is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a \"callicarpa arborea\" is used for skin ailments. Nearly a fifth of the gymnosperms, angiosperms and pteridophytes in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.\n\nMost of the population in some Asian and African countries depend on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such. Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region. The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally. This means that the number of medicinal plants is declining and that some of them might become rarer or, in some cases, go extinct.\n\nAlthough locals are clearing out portions of the forests in the Himalayas, there is still a large amount of greenery ranging from the tropical forests to the Alpine forests. These forests provide wood for fuel and other raw materials for use by industries. There are also many pastures for animals to graze upon. The many varieties of animals that live in these mountains do so based on the elevation. For example, elephants and rhinoceros live in the lower elevations of the Himalayas, also called the Terai region. Also, found in these mountains are the Kashmiri stag, black bears, musk deer, langur, and snow leopards. The Tibetan yak are also found on these mountains and are often used by the people for transportation. However, the populations of many of these animals and still others are declining and are on the verge of going extinct.\n\nThe Himalayas are also a source of many minerals and precious stones. Amongst the tertiary rocks, are vast potentials of mineral oil. There is coal located in Kashmir, and precious stones located in the Himalayas. There is also gold, silver, copper, zinc, and many other such minerals and metals located in at least 100 different places in these mountains.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45795", "title": "Natural capital", "text": "Natural capital\n\nNatural capital is the world's stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called ecosystem services. Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.\n\nIt is an extension of the economic notion of capital (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment. For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. Natural capital also provides people with essential services, like water catchment, erosion control and crop pollination by insects, which in turn ensure the long-term viability of other natural resources. Since the continuous supply of services from the available natural capital assets is dependent upon a healthy, functioning environment, the structure and diversity of habitats and ecosystems are important components of natural capital. Methods, called 'natural capital asset checks', help decision-makers understand how changes in the current and future performance of natural capital assets will impact on human well-being and the economy.\n\nNatural capital is one approach to ecosystem valuation which revolves around the idea, in contrast to traditional economics, that non-human life produces essential resources. Thus, ecological health is essential to the sustainability of the economy. In \"\" the author claims that the global economy is within a larger economy of natural resources and ecosystem services that sustain us. In order to continue to reap the benefits of our natural environment, we need to recognize the importance of natural capital within the economy. According to the authors, the \"next industrial revolution\" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: \"the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources.\"\n\nIn a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be classified as \"land\" distinct from traditional \"capital\". The historical distinction between \"land\" and \"capital\" defined “land” as naturally occurring with a fixed supply, whereas “capital”, as originally defined referred only to man-made goods. (e.g., Georgism) It is however, misleading to view \"land\" as if its productive capacity is fixed, because natural capital can be improved or degraded by the actions of man over time (see Tragedy of the Commons). Moreover, natural capital yields benefits and goods, such as timber or food, which can be harvested by humans. These benefits are similar to those realized by owners of infrastructural capital which yields more goods, such as a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.\n\nThe term 'natural capital' was first used in 1973 by E.F. Schumacher in his book \"Small Is Beautiful\" and is closely identified with Herman Daly, Robert Costanza, the Biosphere 2 project, and the Natural Capitalism economic model of Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins. Recently, it has begun to be used by politicians, notably Ralph Nader, Paul Martin Jr., and agencies of the UK government, including its Natural Capital Committee and the London Health Observatory. All users of the term currently differentiate natural from man-made or infrastructural capital in some way. Indicators adopted by United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure natural biodiversity use the term in a slightly more specific way. According to the OECD, natural capital is “natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production” and is “generally considered to comprise three principal categories: natural resources stocks, land, and ecosystems.”\n\nWithin the international community the basic principle is not controversial, although much uncertainty exists over how best to value different aspects of ecological health, natural capital and ecosystem services. Full-cost accounting, triple bottom line, measuring well-being and other proposals for accounting reform often include suggestions to measure an \"ecological deficit\" or \"natural deficit\" alongside a social and financial deficit. It is difficult to measure such a deficit without some agreement on methods of valuation and auditing of at least the global forms of natural capital (e.g. value of air, water, soil).\n\nEcologists are teaming up with economists to measure and express values of the wealth of ecosystems as a way of finding solutions to the biodiversity crisis. Some researchers have attempted to place a dollar figure on ecosystem services such as the value that the Canadian boreal forest's contribution to global ecosystem services. If ecologically intact, the boreal forest has an estimated value of US$3.7 trillion. The boreal forest ecosystem is one of the planet's great atmospheric regulators and it stores more carbon than any other biome on the planet. The annual value for ecological services of the Boreal Forest is estimated at US$93.2 billion, or 2.5 greater than the annual value of resource extraction. The economic value of 17 ecosystem services for the entire biosphere (calculated in 1997) has an estimated average value of US$33 trillion per year. These ecological economic values are not currently included in calculations of national income accounts, the GDP and they have no price attributes because they exist mostly outside of the global markets. The loss of natural capital continues to accelerate and goes undetected or ignored by mainstream monetary analysis.\n\nIn June 2012 a 'natural capital declaration' (NCD) was launched at the Rio+20 summit held in Brazil. An initiative of the global finance sector, it was signed by 40 CEOs to 'integrate natural capital considerations into loans, equity, fixed income and insurance products, as well as in accounting, disclosure and reporting frameworks.' They worked with supporting organisations to develop tools and metrics to integrate natural capital factors into existing business structures. In summary, its four key aims are to:\n\nIn July 2016, the Natural Capital Coalition released the Natural Capital Protocol. The Protocol provides a standardised framework for organisations to identify, measure and value their direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on natural capital. The Protocol harmonises existing tools and methodologies, and guides organisations towards the information they need to make strategic and operational decisions that include impacts and dependencies on natural capital.\n\nThe Protocol was developed in a unique collaboration between 38 organisations who signed voluntary, pre-competitive contracts.\n\nThe Protocol is available on a creative commons license and is free for organisations to apply.\n\nEnvironmental-economic accounts provide the conceptual framework for integrated statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy, including the impacts of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy. A coherent set of indicators and descriptive statistics can be derived from the accounts that inform a wide range of policies, including, but not limited to, green economy/green growth, natural resource management and sustainable development. The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) contains the internationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables for producing internationally comparable statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. The SEEA is a flexible system in the sense that its implementation can be adapted to countries' specific situations and priorities. Coordination of the implementation of the SEEA and on-going work on new methodological developments is managed and supervised by the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The final, official version of the SEEA Central Framework was published in February 2014.\n\nWhilst measuring the components of natural capital in any region is a relatively straightforward process, both the task and the rationale of putting a monetary valuation on them, or on the value of the goods and services they freely give us, has proved more contentious.\nWithin the UK, Guardian columnist, George Monbiot, has been critical of the work of the government's Natural Capital Committee and of other attempts to place any sort of monetary value on natural capital assets, or on the free ecosystem services they provide us with. In a speech referring to a report to government which suggested that better protection of the UK's freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of £700m, he derided attempts 'to compare things which cannot be directly compared'. He went on to say:\n\nOthers have defended efforts to integrate the valuation of natural capital into local and national economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more balanced footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that 'valuation' of those assets is not the same as monetisation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45252073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45252073", "title": "Offshore Indus Basin", "text": "Offshore Indus Basin\n\nThe offshore Indus Basin is one of the two basins in offshore Pakistan, the other one being the offshore Makran Basin. The Murray Ridge separates the two basins. The offshore Indus basin is approximately 120 to 140 kilometers wide and has an areal extent of ~20,000 square km.\n\nThe offshore Indus basin is a rift and passive margin basin which developed following the separation of the Indian Plate from Africa in the late Jurassic. During the Late Cretaceous, the separation of Madagascar from India occurred and was followed by rapid northward movement of the Indian plate. In the early Paleocene, the Indian plate passed over the Reunion hotspot. This event also led to the extrusion of large volcanic rocks, known as the Deccan Traps. During the Eocene, the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, uplifting the Himalayas. Presence of the Middle Eocene sandstones in the distal Indus fan, which contain feldspar grains with an origin in or north of the Indus suture zone, is an evidence to the occurrence of this event. The Indian plate continues to collide with the Eurasian plate as shown by earthquakes in and around the Himalayas.\n\nSeismic data in the offshore Indus basin show evidence of an early rift geometry below the Deccan volcanics. Imaging is hampered by the presence of volcanics, which partly infill the rifts and by the thick overlying Indus Fan section of Oligocene to Recent age. The precise age of the rifts is unknown but is interpreted as most likely a mid-Cretaceous to Paleocene age and associated with the break up of the Madagascar/Seychelles/Indo-Pakistan plate.\n\nDuring the early post-rift phase, attached carbonate platforms of Paleocene and early Eocene age formed along the continental margin and detached platforms on volcanic seamounts within the basin. Between the carbonate banks, coeval pelagic sediment was deposited in the intervening structural lows. As the Indian plate drifted northwards away from the Reunion mantle hotspot, the basin subsided rapidly. This was accompanied by major clastic influx from the Indus river and leading to deposition of up to 9 km of Oligocene to Recent sediments.\n\nSeismic and gravity data suggest that the underlying crust in the offshore Indus basin is of three types: continental, transitional and oceanic. Continental crust is interpreted for the area below the shelf and upper slope based on the presence of deep rift geometries on seismic lines. Transitional crust occurs on the slope in water depths of 1500–3000 m and is characterized by a prominent gravity low and a northeast-southwest-trending chain of seamounts of Late Cretaceous-Paleocene age. Crust in this region is interpreted to represent thinned continental crust which has been subsequently thickened by the intrusion of thick volcanic rocks by the process of igneous underplating. Further basinwards, the transitional crust is replaced by the oceanic crust characterized by a prominent gravity high and a well-imaged Moho reflection on seismic lines.\n\nThe northwest of the Murray ridge is a major plate boundary transform fault which formed in the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene in response to plate reorganization following the opening of the Gulf of Aden. Onlap of the Miocene and younger stratigraphy on the southeast side of the ridge confirms the age of the ridge and resultant hanging wall uplift. Motion along the Murray ridge bounding fault has resulted in the development of northwest-southeast-trending faults, folds and shale diapirs in the hanging wall. The Makran accretionary wedge, north of the Murray ridge, developed in response to the subduction of the Gulf of Oman oceanic crust beneath Eurasia from about 14 Ma onwards. The southern boundary of the offshore Indus basin is marked by the Saurashtra Arch. It is a volcanic high which extends eastwards into onshore India, coinciding with large outcrop of Deccan volcanics. In the offshore, the arch is cut by steep vertical faults interpreted as extensional faults associated with strike-slip movement along an east-west-trending transform fault marking the northern edge of the Arabian Sea oceanic crust. Two other features have been identified southeast of the Saurashtra Arch, the Laxmi Ridge and the Laxmi Basin. The Laxmi Ridge is interpreted as continental fragment and the Laxmi Basin is considered to be an area of extended continental crust respectively. The gravity and seismic data suggest that the Laxmi Ridge may represent an area of thinned continental crust which has been subsequently thickened by igneous underplating and the intrusion of thick volcanics similar to the transitional area in the offshore Indus basin.\n\nWells drilled on the continental shelf of the offshore Indus basin have been drilled down to Cretaceous rocks. The oldest formation penetrated is the Sembar Formation of Early Cretaceous. It is composed of shales. Onshore Sembar Formation is the major source rock, responsible for charging the sands of the Goru Formation. Sembar is overlain by Goru Formation. Goru is subdivided into Lower and Upper Goru. Lower Goru is sandy onshore and a proven reservoir. Offshore, however, it shales out. Upper Goru is a massive shale and was deposited during Late Cretaceous. It is overlain by Parh Limestone, Mughalkot (limestone interbedded with shale) and Pab Sandstone Formations, deposited during Late Cretaceous.\nDeccan volcanics of the Paleocene overlie the Cretaceous Pab Sandstone. These are overlain by Ranikot Formation (majorly sandstone), also Paleocene in age. Eocene carbonates, Ghazij/Kirthar lie on top of the Paleocene Ranikot Formation. Nari (Oligocene in age), Gaj (Miocene) and recent sediments, were brought down by the Indus river after the Himalayan uplift and deposited over the Eocene carbonates.\n\nOne of the most significant depositional feature of the offshore Indus basin is the Indus fan. It is the second largest fan system in the world after the Bengal fan between India, Bangladesh and the Andaman Islands. The Indus fan was deposited in an unconfined setting on the continental slope, rise and basin floor, covering much of the Arabian Sea. The entire fan extends over an area of 110,000 square kilometers with greater than 9 km of sediment accumulating near the toe-of-slope.\n\nFan sedimentation is estimated to have begun at the end of the Oligocene or beginning of the Miocene, during a period of faster Himalayan exhumation, possibly linked to Monsoon intensification.\nThe upper Indus Fan, both ancient and recent, consists some of the largest channel-levee systems (CLS). These channel-levee systems act as conduits for carrying and depositing sediments into the deeper part of the basin. The coarser grained sediments are deposited in the channel belts whereas the finer grained silts and clays are deposited along the levees. This arrangement of sediments is ideal for stratigraphic plays and that's why these channel-levee systems are of utmost importance to the petroleum industry.\n\nThe offshore Indus basin is significantly under-explored. To-date only 12 wells have been drilled in the offshore Indus basin, out of which only 3 were drilled in the deep sea. All of these have been unsuccessful attempts. Some of these wells encountered high pressures in the Miocene section. Gas shows and non-commercial gas quantities were also reported in the Miocene strata of most wells.\n\nAs far as the petroleum system is concerned, presence and effectiveness of the reservoir and trap are of low risk. The channel and sheet sandstones of Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene are good potential reservoirs. Oligocene clastic rocks can also act as reservoir rocks in distal fan facies. Four types of traps have been identified in offshore Indus: an extensional rollover anticline trend in the upper slope, drape structures over the Eocene carbonate banks and seamounts, stratigraphic traps formed by sands pinching out against the Murray Ridge and folds associated with the Murray Ridge shear faults and shale diapirs.\n\nPresence of seal may be an issue in some areas due to erosional channels. The source rock is questionable, as Sembar Formation, which is a proven source onshore, is too deep offshore and most likely overmature to charge the reservoirs. Paleocene-Eocene carbonates can be the potential source rocks in the offshore Indus basin. However, this needs to be proved in terms of both quality and quantity.\n"}
{"id": "25147432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25147432", "title": "Olfactory navigation", "text": "Olfactory navigation\n\nOlfactory navigation is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and homing of pigeons, in particular the homing pigeon.\n\nThere are two principal versions. Papi’s mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home is not conclusive.\n\nHoming can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth’s surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar. There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a compass sense (a sense of direction) and a map sense (a sense of location). It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information. It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. Magnetic orientation as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century. Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home. In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that anosmic pigeons (\"Columbia livia\") were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance. On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‘olfactory navigation’ was proposed.\n\nTwo models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi’s ‘mosaic’ model and Wallraff’s ‘gradient’ model. Papi’s mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres.\n\nFrom this information, it is possible to derive the ‘home’ direction when encountering these odours at a release site. An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities. It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights. This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours. Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues, although Papi (1990), argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey.\n\nWallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means. It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity. Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft. This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration. However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients. Meteorologists deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature.\n\nThe olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the home loft with the directions from which they are carried by winds. Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants. The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.\n\nSuch an experiment was conducted, where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical aviaries composed of bamboo. Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine. This was reversed for group two. The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil. Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south. Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures. Nevertheless, further experiments applied two different methods – namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90°. Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours. Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90° error, known as the ‘deflector loft effect’. The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site.\n\nIn replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced, though when anosmic pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed. Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect. Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection. Researchers support these suggestions by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons. It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.\n\nConflicting evidence, however, was produced when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of benzaldehyde. When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented. Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction.\n\nA consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected. Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance.\n\nThe Earth’s magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth’s surface Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although Keeton (1971) and Ioalé (1984) did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast. This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies, which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated coils. Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current. Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms. In magnetic anomalies too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions.\n\nThe predictable 15° movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass. This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock. Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory European starling, indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun. This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons.\n\nThe fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‘can they smell?’ Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions – yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment. However, the variability in the effects of olfactory manipulations indicates that odours are not the sole cues on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues. Odour may still, however, be one of many navigational factors playing a highly variable role, though physical limitations and inconsistent findings render the olfactory hypothesis questionable.\n\n"}
{"id": "166459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166459", "title": "Park", "text": "Park\n\nA park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as association football, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less and is ideally within a 10-Minute Walk of its residents. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \"dog parks\", permit dogs to run off-leash.\n\nThe largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of seventy meters (thousands of square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance/skill. Amusement parks are the largest types of park in the world. In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g., rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger or a park warden. Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months.\n\nThe first parks were English deer parks, land set aside for hunting by royalty and the aristocracy in medieval times. They had walls or thick hedges around them to keep game animals (e.g., stags) in and people out. It was strictly forbidden for commoners to hunt animals in these deer parks.\n\nThese game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around mansions and country houses from the sixteenth century onwards. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also proclaimed the owner's wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these stately home parks where the natural landscape was enhanced by landscape architects such as Capability Brown. As cities became crowded, the private hunting grounds became places for the public.\n\nWith the Industrial revolution parks took on a new meaning as areas set aside to preserve a sense of nature in the cities and towns. Sporting activity came to be a major use for these urban parks. Areas of outstanding natural beauty were also set aside as national parks to prevent their being spoiled by uncontrolled development.\n\nPark design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience, as well as by the available land features. A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a playground. A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping. Specific features, such as riding trails, may be included to support specific activities.\n\nThe design of a park may determine who is willing to use it. Walkers may feel unsafe on a mixed-use path that is dominated by fast-moving cyclists or horses. Different landscaping and infrastructure may even affect children's rates of use of parks according to sex. Redesigns of two parks in Vienna suggested that the creation of multiple semi-enclosed play areas in a park could encourage equal use by boys and girls.\n\nParks are part of the urban infrastructure: for physical activity, for families and communities to gather and socialize, or for a simple respite. Research reveals that people who exercise outdoors in green-space derive greater mental health benefits. Providing activities for all ages, abilities and income levels is important for the physical and mental well-being of the public.\n\nParks can also benefit pollinators, and some parks (such as Saltdean Oval) have been redesigned to accommodate them better. Some organisations, such as Xerces Society are also promoting this idea.\n\nCity parks play a role in improving cities and improving the futures for residents and visitors - for example, Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois or the Mill River Park and Green way in Stamford, CT. One group that is a strong proponent of parks for cities is The American Society of Landscape Architects . They argue that parks are important to the fabric of the community on an individual scale and broader scales such as entire neighborhoods, city districts or city park systems.\n\nParks need to feel safe for people to use them. Research shows that perception of safety can be more significant in influencing human behavior than actual crime statistics. If citizens perceive a park as unsafe, they might not make use of it at all.\n\nA study done in four cities; Albuquerque, NM, Chapel Hill/Durham, NC, Columbus, OH, and Philadelphia, PA, with 3815 survey participants who lived within a half mile of a park indicated that in addition to safety that park facilities also played a significant role in park utilization and that increasing facilities instead of creating an image of a safe park would increase utilization of the park.\n\nThere are a number of features that contribute to whether or not a park feels safe. Elements in the physical design of a park, such as an open and welcoming entry, good visibility (sight lines), and appropriate lighting and signage can all make a difference. Regular park maintenance, as well as programming and community involvement can also contribute to a feeling of safety.\n\nWhile Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) has been widely used in facility design, use of CPTED in parks has not been. Iqbal and Ceccato performed a study in Stockholm, Sweden to determine if it would be useful to apply to parks. Their study indicated that while CPTED could be useful, due to the nature of a park, increasing the look of safety can also have unintended consequences on the aesthetics of the park. Creating secure areas with bars and locks and lower the beauty of the park, as well as the nature of who is in charge of observing the public space and the feeling of being observed.\n\nIn the United States, the standard for safety in parks is increasingly measured by whether women feel safe in that particular location. This was originally identified by the urban sociologist William H. Whyte in his 1988 studies in New York. Research reveals that women have a different sense of safety compared to men, whether they are walking in their neighborhood or in a park. Dan Biederman, President of the Bryant Park Corp. stated \"Women pick up on visual cues of disorder better than men do... And if women don't see other women, they tend to leave.\" Whether or not a woman feels safe can determine how much physical activity she has and if it will reach the recommended level for good health and disease prevention. Park designers and planners can take several steps to increase safety from assault, including providing sufficient lighting, having patrols by police officers or other safety officials, and providing emergency buttons for summoning assistance.\n\nParks can be divided into active and passive recreation areas. Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and skateparks. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called \"low intensity recreation\" is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails.\n\nMany smaller \"neighborhood parks\" are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining together to support local parks that have suffered from urban decay and government neglect.\n\nPassive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure. Many ski resorts combine active recreation facilities (ski lifts, gondolas, terrain parks, downhill runs, and lodges) with passive recreation facilities (cross-country ski trails).\n\nA national park is a reserve of land, usually, but not always declared and owned by a national government, protected from most human development and pollution. Although this may be so, it is not likely that the government of a specific area owns it, rather the community itself. National parks are a protected area of International Union for Conservation of Nature Category II. This implies that they are wilderness areas, but unlike pure nature reserves, they are established with the expectation of a certain degree of human visitation and supporting infrastructure.\n\nWhile this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first \"public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\", Yellowstone National Park, in 1872, although Yellowstone was not gazetted as a national park. The first officially designated national park was Mackinac Island, gazetted in 1875. Australia's Royal National Park, established in 1879, was the world's second officially established national park.\n\nThe largest national park in the world is the Northeast Greenland National Park, which was established in 1974 and currently protects \n\nIn some Federal systems, many parks are managed by the sub-national levels of government. In Brazil, the United States, and some states in Mexico, as well as in the Australian state of Victoria, these are known as state parks, whereas in Argentina, Canada and South Korea, they are known as provincial or territorial parks. In the United States, it is also common for individual counties to run parks, these are known as county parks.\n\nA park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Parks commonly resemble savannas or open woodlands, the types of landscape that human beings find most relaxing. Grass is typically kept short to discourage insect pests and to allow for the enjoyment of picnics and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide shade.\n\nSome early parks include the la Alameda de Hércules, in Seville, a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville; the City Park, in Budapest, Hungary, which was property of the Batthyány family and was later made public.\n\nAn early purpose built public park was Derby Arboretum which was opened in 1840 by Joseph Strutt for the mill workers and people of the city. This was closely followed by Princes Park in the Liverpool suburb of Toxteth, laid out to the designs of Joseph Paxton from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the Princes park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for £50,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile, an idea pioneered by John Nash at Regent's Park, and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash's remodeling of St James's Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent's Park completely transformed the appearance of London's West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile contingent. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence on the scene of global maritime trade before 1800 and during the Victorian era its wealth rivalled that of London itself.\n\nThe form and layout of Paxton's ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much imitated design for Birkenhead Park. The latter was commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas he pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. Frederick Law Olmsted visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert's design for New York's Central Park of 1857.\n\nAnother early public park is the Peel Park, Salford, England opened on August 22, 1846. Another possible claimant for status as the world's first public park is Boston Common (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), set aside in 1634, whose first recreational promenade, Tremont Mall, dates from 1728. True park status for the entire common seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed (renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Street in 1808 already acknowledged the reality).\n\nA linear park is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a rail trail or greenway (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a greenbelt.\n\nIn some countries, especially the United Kingdom, \"country parks\" are areas designated for recreation, and managed by local authorities. They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.\n\nPrivate parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner. There are a few types of private parks, and some which once were privately maintained and used have now been made open to the public.\n\n\"Hunting parks\" were originally areas maintained as open space where residences, industry and farming were not allowed, often originally so that nobility might have a place to hunt – see medieval deer park. These were known for instance, as \"deer parks\" (deer being originally a term meaning any wild animal). Many country houses in Great Britain and Ireland still have parks of this sort, which since the 18th century have often been landscaped for aesthetic effect. They are usually a mixture of open grassland with scattered trees and sections of woodland, and are often enclosed by a high wall. The area immediately around the house is the garden. In some cases this will also feature sweeping lawns and scattered trees; the basic difference between a \"country house's park\" and its garden is that the park is grazed by animals, but they are excluded from the garden.\n"}

Within sea ice expanses, pressure ridges originate from the interaction between floes, as they collide with each other. Currents and winds are the main driving forces, but the latter are particularly effective when they have a predominant direction. Pressure ridges are made up of angular ice blocks of various sizes that pile up on the floes. The part of the ridge that is above the water surface is known as the \"sail\"; that below it as the \"keel\". Pressure ridges are the thickest sea ice features and account for about one-half of the total sea ice volume. Stamukhi are pressure ridges that are grounded and that result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice.\n\nThe blocks making up pressure ridges are mostly from the thinner ice floe involved in the interaction, but it can also include pieces from the other floe if it is not too thick. In the summer, the ridge can undergo a significant amount of weathering, which turns it into a smooth hill. During this process, the ice loses its salinity (as a result of brine drainage). This is known as an \"aged ridge\". A \"consolidated ridge\" is one whose base has undergone complete freezing. The term \"consolidated layer\" is used to designate freezing up of the rubble just below the water line. The existence of a \"consolidated layer\" depends on air temperature — in this layer, the water between individual blocks is frozen, with a resulting reduction in porosity and an increase in mechanical strength. A keel's depth of an ice ridge is much higher than its sail's height - typically about four times. The keel is also 2-3 times wider than the sail.\n\nOne of the largest pressure ridges on record had a sail extending above the water surface, and a keel depth of . The total thickness for a multiyear ridge was reported to be . On average, total thickness ranges between and , with a mean sail height that remains below .\n\nThe physical characterization of pressure ridges can be done using the following methods: \n\nFrom an offshore engineering and naval perspective, there are three reasons why pressure ridges are a subject of investigation. Firstly, because the highest loads applied on offshore structures operating in cold oceans by drift ice are associated with these features. Secondly, when pressure ridges drift into shallower areas, their keel may come into contact with the seabed, thereby representing a risk for subsea pipelines (see Seabed gouging by ice) and other seabed installations. Thirdly, they have a significant impact on navigation. In the Arctic, ridged ice makes up about 40% of the overall mass of sea ice.\n\n"}

He was the first person to descend the Tuolumne River (using a raft).\n\nNash received his Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University in 1960 and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1965. He is the author of several books and many essays. His dissertation, \"Wilderness and the American Mind,\" done under the supervision of Merle Curti, became what has come to be seen as one of the foundational texts of the field of environmental history. After teaching for two years at Dartmouth College, he was called to the growing History Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara where he joined distinguished historians such as Wilbur Jacobs, Robert O. Collins, Frank J. Frost, C. Warren Hollister, Leonard Marsak, and Joachim Remak. After witnessing a massive oil spill in Santa Barbara in 1969 he and a number of other faculty members became active within the University and founded an environmental studies program there in 1970. Since the initial 12 graduates in 1972, there have been 4,000 graduates within 300 separate majors. Nash is a firm believer in environmental education and is also an avid white-water river rafter.\n\nNash's study in this book concerns the attitude of Americans' toward the idea of wilderness. He discusses the different attitudes that American's have had toward nature since colonization and the changing uses and definitions of 'wilderness'in that context. Specifically, Nash describes the evolution of American wilderness conception through Transcendentalism, Primitivism, Preservationism, to Conservationism. Nash states that if wilderness is to survive, we must, paradoxically, manage wilderness – at the very least, our behavior towards the wilderness must be managed.\n\nNash presents America's anthropocentric view as the main enemy to all wilderness preservation. He argues that an ecocentric view is ideal and may work in the long run, but perhaps the preservation of nature and wilderness for the sake of holding resources out for the preservation of our own species would be more salient. Yet, even this strategy is hard for people to grasp, because it requires us to reach outside the present and look to the future. Still, Nash suggests that maybe the simple preservation of the environment for the sake of our own generation's recreation and health (oxygen sinks, etc.) could provide the impetus to slow some profiteering.\n\nNash also talks of how wilderness teaches us the value of humility. The problem is that humanity does not want to be humbled. Humans are a proud species who will do anything to avoid being humbled. To this end, we have ripped the wildness from the wilderness and removed all that causes any threat to our existence.\n\nNash believes that humankind has two choices in the next 1,000 years. We can \"trash the planet into a wasteland\" or adopt a plan to distill the world's population in 500 \"islands\" while allowing wilderness to flourish around us.\n\n\nAlso by Nash, Roderick:\n\n"}
