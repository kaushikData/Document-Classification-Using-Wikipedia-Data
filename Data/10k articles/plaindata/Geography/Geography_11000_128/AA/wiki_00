The road is (mostly grade separated) dual carriageway for from the M180 to Grimsby, and is a single carriageway road for between Grimsby and central Cleethorpes.\n\nThe A180 begins at junction 5 of the M180 in North Lincolnshire, where it picks up traffic from the motorway and the A15 road heading towards the ports of Grimsby and Immingham. The road crosses the border into North East Lincolnshire and has a junction with the A160 road to Immingham Dock. It bypasses the town of Immingham and Habrough before meeting the A1173 road (linking to the A46 road to Lincoln). The road then has a junction with the A1136 road prior to having two roundabout junctions with local roads. In central Grimsby, the A180 meets the A16 road (to Louth and Boston) at a roundabout, and continues along the front into Cleethorpes. In central Cleethopes the A180 terminates at a roundabout with the A46 road and the A1098 road.\n\nThe A180 was opened in 1983 as an extension to the M180.\n\nIts ribbed concrete surface makes it the noisiest road in the United Kingdom.

It enables local stakeholders to share best practices and to consult each other when they face common issues, especially in the maritime area. This network is also a means to support large scale bi-national projects that may benefit from European funds, such as CAMIS.\n\nThe Channel Arc Assembly is currently chaired by the Haute-Normandie region.\n\nThe English Channel is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, primarily because of its strategic location as the entry/exit door to the European Union. It links the Atlantic Ocean with the North Sea, which generates considerable flows in people and goods, and makes it one of the main exchange zones in Europe.\n\nIt engenders a concentration of maritime opportunities, but also risks, which explains the co-operation between French and British local authorities in areas like maritime security, marine pollution prevention or the preservation of biodiversity.\n\nThis area is 112,519 sqm. Large, including the 530 islands it encompasses.\n\nThe area's total population was 17,503,211 inhabitants in 2002, of which 5,445,000 resided in the United Kingdom and 12,058,211 in France.\n\nTotal GDP (1998–2000) : 364,829 million Euros\n\nGDP per capita (1998–2000) : 20,395 Euros\n\nThe economic structure of the area is heterogeneous. The North of France is a highly industrialised area, whereas the rich South East of England mostly relies on high tech services and the tourism sector. In France and Great Britain, the most western part of the area has a more rural economy relying on agriculture and tourism: Brittany, Lower Normandy, Cornwall. Fishing is also, in some parts of the area, an important activity. There are 18 maritime quarters and 50 important fishing ports in the area.\n\nTourism is a structuring activity for the area : in 2004, about 84 million tourists have travelled within the Channel area. 32 sites are listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites, like the Jurassic Coast, the Mont Saint-Michel, Stonehenge or the city of Le Havre.\n\nThe promotion of the Channel Arc Manche co-operation network originates from two main concerns :\n\n\nIt entails interventions at the national and European levels, the reinforcement of a common strategic vision to be able to have influence on the European regional policy, and for the specificities of this maritime space to be taken into account.\n\n\nBy constituting a stakeholders' network on coastal and maritime issues, by encouraging co-operation in areas of common interest, by supporting exchanges in economic, social, cultural and administrative realms.\n\n2001–2002 : consultation of local executives concerning the revival of the Channel Arc Manche.\n\n20 March 2003 : Common declaration, signed by the 5 French Regions bordering the Channel and 5 Southern England local authorities.\n2005 : Creation of the Channel Arc Manche Assembly : Alain Le Vern, President of the Haute-Normandie Region, is elected chairman and Brad Watson becomes vice-chairman.\n2004 : Espace Manche Development Initiative project, which was elaborated within the framework of the Interreg European programme.\n\n2006 – Following the lobbying efforts of the Channel Arc Manche Assembly towards the European Union, the French and British territories bordering the Channel become fully eligible to the cross-border cooperation programmes.

Its yearly meeting takes place during the first week of July, and all members can exchange good practices and identify potential co-operation areas.\n\nIt consists of all the full members and takes the decisions necessary to the achievements of the Channel Arc Manche Assembly's objectives. It gathers at least twice a year and decisions are taken through consensus.\n\nIt deals with day-to-day running, the preparation and the follow up of the executive committee's and the annual Conference's work, as well as the website.\n\nThe Channel Arc Manche does not have a budget in itself. The means dedicated by its members to the co-operation network mostly consist of working time and limited logistic expenses. European structural funds are often requested to finance co-operation projects within the Channel area.\n\nEuropean funding, in particular the European Regional Development Fund, enables the Interreg co-operation programmes to support Franco-British co-operation projects of different scales. 173 million Euros have been allocated to Franco-British co-operation in the Channel between 2007 and 2013. Along with all other projects, the Channel Arc Manche partnership supports more particularly large and structuring projects for the area such as EMDI or CAMIS.\n\nThe EMDI project, which gathered 22 partners between 2004 and 2008, aimed to develop and reinforce Franco-British co-operation within the Channel area. 48% of its budget was co-funded by the Interreg IIIB co-operation programme.

A winterbourne is a stream or river that is dry through the summer months.\n\nBourne is used as a place name or as a part of a place name, usually in chalk downland countryside. Alternative forms are bourn or borne or born. The apparent variant, borne found in the placename: Camborne, arises from the Cornish language and is in fact a false friend: it refers to a hill (Cornish: \"bronn\", from Common Brythonic \"*brunda\"; compare Irish \"bruinn\"). Born/borne in German also means fount, or spring, and is related to the Indo-European root, *bhreu. That born/borne appears throughout Europe as a placename is also an important clue that this spelling is an etymological precursor to the Middle English bourne/burn.\n\nCf.

Observations of an area of interest can be repeated several times a day in all-weather conditions.\nThe imagery will be applied to defense and security assurance in Italy and other countries, seismic hazard analysis, environmental disaster monitoring, and agricultural mapping.\n\nThe four satellites are in sun-synchronous polar orbits with a 97.9° inclination at a nominal altitude of 619 km and an orbital period of 97.2 minutes. The local time ascending node at the equator is 06:00. The expected operating life of each satellite is estimated to be 5 years. Each satellite repeats the same ground track every 16 days, and all of the satellites follow the same ground track. They cross the equator at 06:00 and 18:00 local-time each day. The satellites are phased in the same orbital plane, with COSMO-SkyMed's 1, 2 and 4 at 90° to each other and COSMO-SkyMed 3 at 67.5° from COSMO-SkyMed 2. This results in varied intervals between the satellites along the same ground track of between 1 and 15 days. The sun-synchronous orbit is used to keep the solar cells illuminated at all times.\n\nThe satellites' main components are:\n\nThe radar antenna is a phased array that is 1.4 m wide x 5.7 m long. The system is capable of both single- and dual-polarization collection. The center frequency is 9.6 GHz with a maximum radar bandwidth of 400 MHz.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance is providing launch services for the first three satellites. Satellite processing for the first two satellites was handled by the Astrotech Space Operations subsidiary of SPACEHAB. The first satellite was launched at 22:34 GMT, on 8 June 2007, aboard a Delta II 7420-10 rocket from Vandenberg AFB.

{"id": "29565262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29565262", "title": "Cut flowers", "text": "Cut flowers\n\nCut flowers are flowers or flower buds (often with some stem and leaf) that have been cut from the plant bearing it. It is usually removed from the plant for decorative use. Typical uses are in vase displays, wreaths and garlands. Many gardeners harvest their own cut flowers from domestic gardens, but there is a significant floral industry for cut flowers in most countries. The plants cropped vary by climate, culture and the level of wealth locally. Often the plants are raised specifically for the purpose, in field or glasshouse growing conditions. Cut flowers can also be harvested from the wild.\n\nThe cultivation and trade of flowers is a specialization in horticulture, specifically floriculture.\n\nA common use is for floristry, usually for decoration inside a house or building. Typically the cut flowers are placed in a vase. A number of similar types of decorations are used, especially in larger buildings and at events such as weddings. These are often decorated with additional foliage.\nIn some cultures, a major use of cut flowers is for worship; this can be seen especially in south and southeast Asia.\n\nSometimes the flowers are picked rather than cut, without any significant leaf or stem. Such flowers may be used for wearing in hair, or in a button-hole. Masses of flowers may be used for sprinkling, in a similar way to confetti.\n\nGarlands, wreaths and bouquets are major derived and value added products.\n\nOnce flowers are removed from the plant they continue to grow slowly, but have a diminished capability of receiving the nutrients that are vital for their survival. In most countries, cut flowers are a local crop because of their perishable nature. In India, much of the product has a shelf life of only a day. Among these are marigold flowers for garlands and temples, which are typically harvested before dawn, and discarded after use the same day.\n\nThe majority of cut flowers can be expected to last several days with proper care. This generally requires standing them in water in shade. They can be treated in various ways to increase their life. According to James C. Schmidt, a horticulturist at the University of Illinois, originally putting cut flowers in a sterilized vase is important to extending the life of the flowers. Vases can be cleaned using a household dish detergent or a combination of water and bleach. Using these disinfectants ensures that there will be less bacteria growing within the vase that could potentially cause the plant to wilt and die at a faster rate. Schmidt also claims that cutting the flowers diagonally with a sharp knife under running water ensures that they can immediately take up fresh and clean water. Re-cutting the stems periodically will ensure that there is a fresh surface from which the stems can take up water. This will allow the flowers to last even longer. Other ways to care for vase flowers includes keeping flowers away from ceiling fans and air-conditioning vents as this can lead to dehydration, keeping flowers away from fresh fruit of vegetables, using filtered water rather than tap water so as to avoid both chlorine and fluoride, and keeping flowers away from your television.\n\nThere is also a market for 'everlasting' or dried flowers, which include species such as Xerochrysum bracteatum. These can have a very long shelf life.\n\nAccording to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, different additives can be used to prolong the lives of fresh cut flowers. Experiments were performed with various substances mixed with water, including aspirin, vitamin pills, vinegar, pennies, and flower food to test their effect on cut flowers' lifespans. Each plant was placed in the same environment and the same type of plant was used in each vase.\n\nThis research found that the best additive for flowers was the retailer-provided \"flower food\" that is usually given with a bouquet. Plants are known to thrive in an environment where there are few bacteria, plenty of food for energy, and water uptake is encouraged. Flower foods contain an acidifier that helps to adjust the water's pH. With a lower pH the water and food conducting system within the flower can work at maximum efficiency. The sugar in the food will be used by the plant as an energy source, which had been lost when the flower was cut away from its root. With these nutrients the plant will be able to fully develop. Finally, there are stem unpluggers that will make sure that the flower can easily take up water and nutrients that can later be used to take care of the needs of the rest of the plant. This combination gives the fresh cut flowers everything that they need to survive longer. When tests were carried out in St. Mary's College C.S.S.p, Rathmines, Dublin, however, results showed that glucose was more effective at prolonging the life of cut flowers than the commercial plant food. The experiment was carried out as part of the Junior Certificate Science Examination set by the Irish State Examinations Commission 2008.\n\nThe largest producers are, in order of cultivated area, China, India, and the United States. The largest importer and exporter by value is the Netherlands, which is both a grower and a redistributor of crops imported from other countries. Most of its exports go to its European neighbours.\n\nIn recent decades, with the increasing use of air freight, it has become economic for high value crops to be grown far from their point of sale; the market is usually in industrialised countries. Typical of these is the production of roses in Ecuador and Colombia, mainly for the US market, and production in Kenya and Uganda for the European market. Some countries specialise in especially high value products, such as orchids from Singapore and Thailand.\n\nAs with the production of fruit and vegetables, the industry depends on significant amounts of water, which may be collected and stored by the farm owners. The Patel Dam failure in May 2018, associated with a large Kenyan rose farm, killed dozens of people. \n\nThe total market value in most countries is considerable. It has been estimated at approximately GBP 2 billion in the United Kingdom, of the same order as that of music sales.\n\n\n"}

He created the first accurate map of a large part of the Alaskan arctic coastline. He was the first to scientifically describe permafrost and to pose theories about permafrost which have largely proven true. He accurately identified the oil potential of the North Slope region of Alaska.\n\nErnest de Koven Leffingwell was born January 13, 1875, in Knoxville, Illinois, to Charles and Elizabeth (née Francis) Leffingwell. He attended the grammar school at Racine College, then attended Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, where he was captain of the track team his senior year, graduated with the AB degree in 1895 and was awarded a MA in 1900. He studied physics and geology at the University of Chicago 1896 to 1898 and 1900 to 1906. He played on the Chicago Maroons football team. Leffingwell had passed his preliminary examination and was a doctoral candidate when he left for Alaska in 1906, but apparently did not complete the degree. He taught science at St Alban's school in Knoxville, Illinois in 1895–96 and 1903–04, in the latter period also serving as Superintendent. During the Spanish–American War he served as a Seaman on the US battleship \"Oregon\" during its celebrated dash around Cape Horn and in the Battle of Santiago.\n\nHe led the science staff in the 1901 Baldwin-Ziegler Polar Expedition, which failed in its attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land. On this expedition, he became friends with Danish explorer Ejnar Mikkelsen. Subsequently, the two raised funds for their own expedition. Leffingwell's father, who had become wealthy from his ownership of a fruit ranch in California, contributed $5000, and Mikkelsen raised a comparable amount in England and New York. Their venture became the Anglo-American Polar Expedition of 1906–1908 which aimed to explore the Beaufort Sea. At that time, many experts believed than an undiscovered land mass lay in this region, since such a mass could account for observed patterns of arctic currents and tides. The underfunded expedition fared badly but achieved some positive results. No new land was discovered, but they delineated part of the continental shelf and Leffingwell began his mapping efforts. Their ship, the \"Duchess of Bedford\", was locked in pack ice and destroyed, but they salvaged the wood to build a cabin which Leffingwell used intermittently through 1914. Mikkelsen returned to the US in 1907, but Leffingwell remained on the arctic coast for another year. He returned to the North Slope 1909–1912 and 1913–1914, working with one assistant to map 250 km of the arctic coast, and the Canning River valley .\n\nAfter spending a year and a half writing up his results at the United States Geological Survey in Washington, Leffingwell retired to Whittier, California, listing his occupation in 1917 as citriculturist. He moved to Carmel, California about 20 years later. When he died in 1971, he was believed to have been the oldest surviving polar explorer.\n\nThe Leffingwell Camp Site located on a remote barrier island off Alaska, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978.\n\nLeffingwell was awarded the Patron's Medal by the Royal Geographical Society and the Charles P. Daly Medal by the American Geographical Society, both in 1922. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Trinity College in 1923. Leffingwell Fork, a stream on Alaska's North Slope, Leffingwell Ridge (Brooks Range) in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Leffingwell Glacier in the Romanzoff Mountains of the Brooks Range, Leffingwell Crags in Canada's Northwest Territories, and Leffingwell Nunatak in Greenland are named for him.\n\n\n\n"}

He took over as proprietor and editor of \"The Lantern\", a satirical weekly, with Alfred Clint, scenic artist of the Theatre Royal, his cartoonist. He published an atlas of South Australia late in this same year (see Bibliography below).\n\nHe was elected to one of three seats for the district of Light in the House of Assembly in April 1878, despite public accusations that he had spent time in Pentridge prison, which he strenuously denied. It turned out the accusations were \"straw men\" set up by himself or a friend: he had not used the alias \"O'Sullivan\" in New Zealand, and had not been sent to Pentridge, but he had called himself \"O'Reilly\" in Tasmania, and had been sent to Melbourne Gaol. After the \"Register\" revealed that Carroll had been sentenced to two years' in Darlinghurst Gaol for uttering a valueless cheque, citing the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" of 22 August 1871, Carroll was forced to resign his seat in May 1878.\n\nHe was tried by Judge Boucaut and jury for malicious libel in \"The Lantern\" of 23 August 1879 against James Hurst and the Mutual Trade Protection Association.

Later in his career Loudon accepted several other ways of making planting recognizable as art (1) by removing surrounding plants so that a perfect form of the plant was grown (2) by 'high keeping' (intensive maintenance) in a garden (3) by planting in geometrical beds. Though Loudon was clear about his reasons for introducing the gardenesque he gave varied accounts of how the principle could he satisfied. This has given the word a modern English usage which conforms with the etymology of the word ('like a garden') but differs from Loudon's uses of the word.

{"id": "21967601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21967601", "title": "Gehenna", "text": "Gehenna\n\nGehenna is a small valley in Jerusalem. In the Hebrew Bible, Gehenna was initially where some of the kings of Judah sacrificed their children by fire. Thereafter, it was deemed to be cursed (, ).\n\nIn rabbinic literature and Christian and Islamic scripture, Gehenna is a destination of the wicked. This is different from the more neutral Sheol/Hades, the abode of the dead, although the King James Version of the Bible usually translates both with the Anglo-Saxon word Hell.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible, the term appears 13 times in 11 different verses as Valley of Hinnom, Valley of the son of Hinnom or Valley of the children of Hinnom.\n\nThe Valley of Hinnom is the modern name for the valley surrounding Jerusalem's Old City, including Mount Zion, from the west and south. It meets and merges with the Kidron Valley, the other principal valley around the Old City, near the southeastern corner of the city.\n\nGehenna ; from , \"Geenna\" from , also ; Mishnaic Hebrew: /, \"Gehinnam\"/\"Gehinnom\"\n\nEnglish \"Gehenna\" represents the Greek \"Geenna\" () found in the New Testament, a phonetic transcription of Aramaic \"Gēhannā\" (ܓܝܗܢܐ), equivalent to the Hebrew \"Ge Hinnom\", literally \"Valley of Hinnom\".\n\nThis was known in the Old Testament as \"Gei Ben-Hinnom\", literally the \"Valley of the son of Hinnom\", and in the Talmud as \"Gehinnam\" or \"Gehinnom\".\n\nThe exact location of the Valley of Hinnom is disputed. Older commentaries give the location as below the southern wall of ancient Jerusalem, stretching from the foot of Mount Zion eastward past the Tyropoeon to the Kidron Valley. However the Tyropoeon Valley is usually no longer associated with the Valley of Hinnom because during the period of Ahaz and Manasseh, the Tyropoeon lay within the city walls and child sacrifice would have been practiced outside the walls of the city. Smith (1907), Dalman (1930), Bailey (1986) and Watson (1992) identify the Wadi ar-Rababi, which fits the data of Joshua that Hinnom valley ran east to west and lay outside the city walls. According to Joshua, the valley began at En-rogel. If the modern Bir Ayyub is En-rogel, then Wadi ar-Rababi, which begins there, is Hinnom.\n\nChild sacrifice at other Tophets contemporary with the Bible accounts (700–600 BC) of the reigns of Ahaz and Manasseh have been established, such as the bones of children sacrificed at the Tophet to the goddess Tank in Phoenician Carthage, and also child sacrifice in ancient Syria-Palestine. Scholars such as Mosca (1975) have concluded that the sacrifice recorded in the Hebrew Bible, such as Jeremiah's comment that the worshippers of Baal had \"filled this place with the blood of innocents\", is literal, while Mark Smith has stated that in the seventh century child sacrifice was a Judean practice performed in the name of Yahweh. Yet, the biblical words in the Book of Jeremiah describe events taking place in the seventh century in the place of Ben-hinnom: “Because they [the Israelites] have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods, that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it ever enter My mind; therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter\". J. Day, Heider, and Mosca believe that the Molech cult took place in the valley of Hinnom at the Topheth. No archaeological evidence such as mass children's graves has been found; however, it has been suggested that such a find may be compromised by the heavy population history of the Jerusalem area compared to the Tophet found in Tunisia. The site would also have been disrupted by the actions of Josiah \"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.\" (2 Kings 23). A minority of scholars have attempted to argue that the Bible does not portray actual child sacrifice, but only dedication to the god by fire; however, they are judged to have been \"convincingly disproved\" (Hay, 2011).\n\nThe oldest historical reference to the valley is found in , which describe tribal boundaries. The next chronological reference to the valley is at the time of King Ahaz of Judah who sacrificed his sons there according to . Since Hezekiah, his legitimate son by the daughter of the High Priest, succeeded him as king, this, if literal, is assumed to mean children by unrecorded pagan wives or concubines. The same is recorded of Ahaz' grandson Manasseh in . There remains debate about whether the phrase \"cause his children to pass through the fire\" meant a religious ceremony or literally child sacrifice.\nThe Book of Isaiah does not mention Gehenna by name, but the \"burning place\" in which the Assyrian army is to be destroyed, may be read \"Topheth\", and the final verse of Isaiah which concerns of those that have rebelled against God, .\n\nIn the reign of Josiah a call came from Jeremiah to destroy the shrines in Topheth and to end the practice , . It is recorded that Josiah destroyed the shrine of Molech on Topheth to prevent anyone sacrificing children there in . Despite Josiah's ending of the practice, Jeremiah also included a prophecy that Jerusalem itself would be made like Gehenna and Topheth (, ).\n\nA final purely geographical reference is found in to the exiles returning from Babylon camping from Beersheba to Hinnom.\n\nThe ancient Aramaic paraphrase-translations of the Hebrew Bible known as Targums supply the term \"Gehinnom\" frequently to verses touching upon resurrection, judgment, and the fate of the wicked. This may also include addition of the phrase \"second death\", as in the final chapter of the Book of Isaiah, where the Hebrew version does not mention either Gehinnom or the Second Death, whereas the Targums add both. In this the Targums are parallel to the Gospel of Mark addition of \"Gehenna\" to the quotation of the Isaiah verses describing the corpses \"where their worm does not die\".\n\nThe picture of Gehenna as the place of punishment or destruction of the wicked occurs frequently in the Mishnah in Kiddushin 4.14, Avot 1.5; 5.19, 20, Tosefta t. Bereshith 6.15, and Babylonian Talmud b.Rosh Hashanah 16b:7a; b. Bereshith 28b. Gehenna is considered a Purgatory-like place where the wicked go to suffer until they have atoned for their sins. It is stated that the maximum amount of time a sinner can spend in Gehenna is one year. There are also four people who do not get a share in Olam Ha-Ba. Those people are Doeg the Edomite, Ahitophel, Balaam, and Gehazi.\n\nThe traditional explanation that a burning rubbish heap in the Valley of Hinnom south of Jerusalem gave rise to the idea of a fiery Gehenna of judgment is attributed to Rabbi David Kimhi's commentary on (ca. 1200 AD). He maintained that in this loathsome valley fires were kept burning perpetually to consume the filth and cadavers thrown into it. However, Hermann Strack and Paul Billerbeck state that there is neither archaeological nor literary evidence in support of this claim, in either the earlier intertestamental or the later rabbinic sources. Also, Lloyd R. Bailey's \"Gehenna: The Topography of Hell\" from 1986 holds a similar view.\n\nThere is evidence however that the southwest shoulder of this valley (Ketef Hinnom) was a burial location with numerous burial chambers that were reused by generations of families from as early as the seventh until the fifth century BC. The use of this area for tombs continued into the first centuries BC and AD. By 70 AD, the area was not only a burial site but also a place for cremation of the dead with the arrival of the Tenth Roman Legion, who were the only group known to practice cremation in this region.\n\nIn time it became deemed to be accursed and an image of the place of destruction in Jewish folklore. \n\nEventually the Hebrew term Gehinnom became a figurative name for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism. According to most Jewish sources, the period of purification or punishment is limited to only 12 months and every Sabbath day is excluded from punishment. After this the soul will ascend to Olam Ha-Ba (the world to come), be destroyed, or continue to exist in a state of consciousness of remorse. Gehenna became a metonym for \"Hell\" due to its morbid prominence in Jewish religious texts.\n\nIn the synoptic Gospels Jesus uses the word \"Gehenna\" to describe the opposite to life in the Kingdom (). It is used 11 times in these accounts. In certain usage, it is a place where both soul (Greek: ψυχή) and body could be destroyed () in \"unquenchable fire\" ().\n\n\nJames is the only other writer to use the word \"Gehenna\" in the New Testament:\n\nThe New Testament also refers to Hades as a place distinct from Gehenna. Unlike Gehenna, Hades typically conveys neither fire nor punishment but forgetfulness. The Book of Revelation describes Hades being cast into the lake of fire (). The King James Version is the only English translation in modern use to translate Sheol, Hades, Tartarus (Greek ταρταρώσας; lemma: ταρταρόω \"tartaroō\"), and Gehenna as Hell. In the New Testament, the New International Version, New Living Translation, New American Standard Bible (among others) all reserve the term \"hell\" for the translation of Gehenna or Tartarus (see above), transliterating Hades as a term directly from the equivalent Greek term.\n\nTreatment of Gehenna in Christianity is significantly affected by whether the distinction in Hebrew and Greek between Gehenna and Hades was maintained:\n\nTranslations with a distinction:\n\nTranslations without a distinction:\n\nMany modern Christians understand Gehenna to be a place of eternal punishment called hell. Most Annihilationists understand Gehenna to be a place where sinners are eventually utterly destroyed, not tormented with literal pain forever. Some scholars, however, have suggested that Gehenna may \"not\" be synonymous with the Lake of Fire, but a metaphor for the horrible fate that awaited those killed in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.\n\nThe name given to Hell in Islam, \"Jahannam\", directly derives from Gehenna. The Quran contains 77 references to Gehenna (جهنم), but no references to Hades (هيدز).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6188016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6188016", "title": "Har HaMenuchot", "text": "Har HaMenuchot\n\nHar HaMenuchot (, Ashkenazi pronunciation, Har HaMenuchos, lit. \"Mount of Those who are Resting\", also known as Givat Shaul Cemetery) is the largest cemetery in Jerusalem, Israel. The hilltop burial ground lies at the western edge of the city adjacent to the neighborhood of Givat Shaul, with commanding views of Mevaseret Zion to the north, Motza to the west, and Har Nof to the south. Opened in 1951 on of land, it has continually expanded into new sections on the northern and western slopes of the hill. As of 2008, the cemetery encompasses in which over 150,000 people are buried.\n\nUntil 1948, Jewish burials in Jerusalem were conducted in the centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. In 1948, the Arab siege of Jerusalem cut off access to the Mount of Olives, and this remained the status quo after the 1949 Armistice Agreements. In 1948 several temporary cemeteries opened to handle wartime deaths in Jerusalem, including the Sanhedria cemetery, Sheikh Badr Cemetery, and the Shaare Zedek Cemetery (on the grounds of the old Shaare Zedek Hospital on Jaffa Road). After the establishment of the state, however, these were deemed inadequate for the needs of a growing city.\n\nIn late summer 1948, developers identified a hilltop located between Givat Shaul and Motza and overlooking Highway 1. It was outside the boundaries of Jerusalem at that time, yet accessible to the city, and it had soft rock for grave-digging. They calculated that each dunam would accommodate 200 graves and estimated a need for 1,000 graves per year. At the time, the city of Jerusalem had 150,000 Jewish residents with a mortality rate of 1,000 annually; at that rate, the new cemetery was expected to suffice for the next 40 years.\n\nThe developers received permission to build the cemetery a month later, but disagreements between the various burial societies delayed the first burial until the fall of 1951. With the opening of the new cemetery, civilian graves were transferred here from the temporary cemeteries at Sheikh Badr and the old Shaare Zedek Hospital.\n\nIn 1951 a new cemetery was established at Mount Herzl, dedicated by government decision as Israel's national cemetery, where national leaders and fallen soldiers would be interred.\n\nBy 1988 Har HaMenuchot had about 50,000 graves. In the 1990s developers began expanding the cemetery onto the northern and western slopes of the hill. By 2008 the cemetery spanned in which more than 150,000 people are interred.\n\nIn November 2012 the Jerusalem municipality approved a plan to shield the view of the cemetery from Highway 1, the main entryway to Jerusalem, by planting cypress trees and erecting a stone wall. The plan would allow for continued expansion of the cemetery to the north and west.\n\nThe graves on Har HaMenuchot are divided into sections operated by various \"chevrei kadisha\" (burial societies). The Kehillat Yerushalayim burial society was allotted more than 50% of the land when the cemetery opened. Other sections were apportioned to burial societies serving the Ashkenazim (also known as Perushim), Sephardim, and Hasidic communities of Jerusalem. In the late 1990s other \"chevrei kadisha\" opened, serving the Kurdish, Georgian, Yemenite, and Bukharan Jewish communities. The Kehillat Yerushalayim burial society also operates a special section reserved for those whose Jewish identity is questionable, such as non-Jewish immigrants and atheists. (Bona fide Christians and Muslims are not buried here, but in their own cemeteries.) Both the Kehillat Yerushalayim and the Sephardi burial societies maintain an on-site funeral parlor.\n\nAs the official municipal burial ground, Har HaMenuchot accommodates free burials for Israeli citizens and tourists who die while in Israel; the cost of the plot and funeral services is paid for by Bituah Leumi, the National Insurance Institute. However, the choice of plot is left to the burial society, and if a spouse wishes to be buried in the adjacent plot, he or she must pay for the second plot. According to the law, the burial society must reserve the plots on both sides of a newly-dug grave for 90 days in order to give the spouse and relatives of the deceased the option to purchase them. According to the Kehillat Yerushalayim burial society, 90 percent of the burials at Har HaMenuchot involve couples. Stone monuments must be paid for by the family of the deceased. The burial societies recoup their development costs and make their profit on the sale of plots to Jews living abroad, with the price of the plot, burial costs, and transportation of the body by airline exceeding US$11,000. Burials from abroad constitute an estimated one-fifth to one-third of all burials.\n\nLike other Jewish cemeteries in Jerusalem, the plots on Har HaMenuchot consist of an underground grave topped by a rectangular platform of poured concrete, faced with stone tiles, that rises or more above-ground. The name, date and praises of the deceased are inscribed on the top panel and occasionally on the sides. The writing is either engraved and filled in with black lead, or simply painted on. In some cases, names of family members of the deceased who died in the Holocaust are engraved on the sides of the gravestone. Many graves include a small cavity hollowed out of the box, where memorial candles are placed. The graves are generally positioned less than apart.\n\nThe sections run by the Kehillat Yerushalayim and Perushim burial societies differ in appearance. The former is divided into color-coded sections that are easily reached by roadways, and has trees and bushes planted alongside the sections to provide shade for visitors on hot summer days. The Perushim section, on the other hand, abides by customs maintained in Jewish cemeteries for centuries, including the complete absence of trees or vegetation near the graves or even bordering the road.\n\nKohanim are interred in a separate section just outside the main entrance, so that their family members who are not allowed to enter cemeteries to avoid \"tumas meis\" (ritual impurity caused by the dead) may stand by the side of the road and pray at their ancestors' graves.\n\nThe cemetery contains a genizah (sacred texts repository) where kvitlach (prayer notes) from the Western Wall are buried.\n\nIn addition to visitor parking, the cemetery is serviced by Egged bus number 54, which has its terminus opposite the Jerusalem Central Bus Station.\n\nNear the main entrance lies the original \"Chelkat Harabbonim\" (, \"Rabbis' Section\") operated by the Ashkenazi (Perushim) burial society, which includes the graves of many gedolim of the past 60 years from around the world. The largest grave in this section is that of Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, the fourth Belzer Rebbe, which has become a shrine for thousands of visitors annually. An area of \"dalet amos\" (four cubits) surrounds this grave. An iron parapet constructed nearby allows Kohanim to pray near the rabbinical graves without exposing themselves to \"tumah\" (ritual impurity). Another \"Chelkas Harabbonim\" is located on the north slope of the hill; this is the resting place for Rabbis Shlomo Wolbe, Nosson Meir Wachtfogel, and Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, among others.\n\nA grave known as a \"segula\" (propitious remedy) for childless women is that of Miriam ha-Koveset (, Miriam the Laundress), who only worked in the homes of Torah scholars, including Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and the Zvhiller Rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Goldman. Once Miriam asked the Zvhiller Rebbe for a blessing for children, but he blessed her that in her merit, others would merit to have children. Twenty-nine years after her death in 1964, one of her neighbors had a dream in which Miriam appeared to her, told her of the Zvhiller Rebbe's promise, and gave her directions to her grave. On her yahrzeit that year, busloads of women came to pray at the grave while a Torah scholar recited prayers for the elevation of her soul. There were 32 known cases of women who prayed at Miriam's grave and gave birth to children that year. Since then, her grave, located near the main parking lot, has been renovated and enlarged to accommodate women year-round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6246670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6246670", "title": "Landscape urbanism", "text": "Landscape urbanism\n\nLandscape urbanism is a theory of urban planning arguing that the best way to organize cities is through the design of the city's landscape, rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase 'landscape urbanism' first appeared in the mid 1990s. Since this time, the phrase 'landscape urbanism' has taken on many different uses, but is most often cited as a postmodernist or post-postmodernist response to the \"failings\" of New Urbanism and the shift away from the comprehensive visions, and demands, for modern architecture and urban planning.\n\nThe phrase 'landscape urbanism' first appeared in the work of Peter Connolly, a Masters of Urban Design student from RMIT Melbourne. In 1994, Connolly used the phrase in the title for his Masters of Urban Design proposal at RMIT Melbourne. Here, he suggested that 'a language of \"landscape urbanism\" barely exists and needs articulating', and that 'existing urbanisms ... are limited in the exploration of the landscape'. He also used the term 'landscape as urbanism' in his 1994 essay, '101 Ideas About Big Parks'. In 1996 Tom Turner wrote that The city of the future will be an infinite series of landscapes: psychological and physical, urban and rural, flowing apart and together. They will be mapped and planned for special purposes, with the results recorded in geographical information systems (GIS), which have the power to construct and retrieve innumerable plans, images and other records. Christopher Alexander was right: a city is not a tree. It is a landscape.From the late 1990s, the phrase 'landscape urbanism' was used by landscape architects in the United States to refer to the re-organisation of declining post-industrial cities, such as Detroit. From the 2000s, it was used in Europe by architects to mean a highly flexible way of integrating large-scale infrastructure, housing and open space. By the late 2000s, the phrase became associated with highly commercialized, multi-phase urban parks, such as Olympic park design.\n\nThe first major event to do with 'landscape urbanism' was the Landscape Urbanism conference sponsored by the Graham Foundation in Chicago in April 1997. Speakers included Charles Waldheim, Mohsen Mostafavi, James Corner of James Corner/Field Operations, Alex Wall, and Adriaan Geuze of the firm West 8, among others. The formative period of Landscape Urbanism can be traced back to RMIT University and University of Pennsylvania in the late 1980s, at a time when Peter Connolly, Richard Weller, James Corner, Mohsen Mostafavi, and others were exploring the artificial boundaries of Landscape Architecture, Urban Design and Architecture, searching for better ways to deal with complex urban projects. However, their texts cite and synthesize the ideas of influential modernist methods, programmes and manifestoes that appeared in the early twentieth century. Charles Waldheim, Anu Mathur, Alan Berger, Chris Reed, amongst others, were students at the University of Pennsylvania during this formative period for Landscape Urbanism. After the Chicago conference, European design schools and North American design institutions formed academic programs and began to formalize a field of Landscape Urbanism studies, including the University of Toronto, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Oslo School of Architecture , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium , the University of Illinois at Chicago and London's Architectural Association.\n\nThe development of an actual operative response to the broad and often vague concepts surrounding landscape urbanism was largely developed at the Architectural Association in London. Prior to this period of design exploration, landscape urbanism had never been clearly developed as an actual design practice. Today, much of the design culture that has come to be associated with landscape urbanism was initiated and developed in the AA Landscape Urbanism program during its early formative period and its influence persists in many educational institutions. A number of practices that have chosen to adopt the design and conceptual approach towards urbanism have also adopted many of these design strategies. \n\nJames Corner is the author of an essay entitled \"Terra Fluxus.\" He has identified four general ideas that are important for use in Landscape Urbanism. They are as follows:\n\n1 Process over time - Understanding the fluid or changing nature of any environment and the processes that affect change over time. A respect for natural processes (Ecology) - the idea that our lives intertwine with the environment around us, and we should therefore respect this when creating an urban environment. Landscape Urbanism is concerned with a working surface over time – a type of urbanism that anticipates change, open endedness and negotiation.\n\n2 Horizontality - The use of horizontal alignment in landscaping, rather than relying on vertical structuring.\n\n3 Working Methods /Techniques - Those who practice the idea of landscape urbanism should be able to adapt their techniques to the environment that they are in.\n\n4 The imaginary - That in many ways the failing of twentieth century planning can be attributed to the absolute impoverishment of the imagination to extend new relationships and sets of possibilities\nTom Turner summarized the ten characteristics of landscape urbanism in the book \"Landscape design history and theory: landscape architecture and garden design origins\":\n\n1-Broad scale context: Landscape urbanism does not belong to a specific scale. It can be considered in small or large-scale projects.\n\n2-Landscape is a context which contains architecture and civil engineering.\n\n3-Landscape is seen as a third machinery arm that makes a connection between its components. Mohsen Mostafavi, the author of \"Landscape Urbanism : A Manual for the Machinic Landscape\" used the same phrase.\n\n4-LU projects can provide the opportunity of increasing the social interactions. Also, Emily Talen, one of the writers of \"Landscape Urbanism and its Discontentes\" talks about social aspects of a LU project \"by forming three theoretical alliances: one with post-structuralism, one with ecology, and one --peculiarly-- with Marxism.\"\n\n5-Function is the most significant concern in LU machine, which gives the appearance of a project less importance.\n\n6-LU discovers the potentials and opportunities in landscapes.\n\n7-The infrastructure are highlighted in LU projects.\n\n8-LU projects will develop the interrelationship between natural and engineered systems.\n\n9-LU will break the boundary between the landscape and the city and will organize them as one.\n\n10-The answer to the projects which are complex or have ecological concentrations, is landscape urbanism\n\nThe following are Landscape Urbanism projects that are available that can provide more information about the theory in practice:\n\nLandscape urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is only loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis. Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.\n\nOne opponent to Landscape Urbanism is New Urbanism, led by Andres Duany, which promotes walkable communities and smart growth with its Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Traditional Neighborhood Design (TND). In response to landscape urbanism’s focus on expansive green space in urban development, Duany stated that “density and urbanism are not the same.” Further, “unless there is tremendous density, human beings will not walk.” The result is patches of green sprawl that lose connectivity to the greater network.\n\nEmo Urbanism is another philosophy critical of Landscape Urbanism. The movement contends that Landscape Urbanism views ecology as an aesthetic element of style and not urban ecology. The artificial ecology replaces the entropic state to re-create a landscape that fits a particular brand or aesthetic. The loss is a dynamic, adaptive, and certainly essential urban system. Emo urbanism differs by making evolving \"nature\" a key component of the design process. The realization of this process is called “Urbanature\" and \"Big Nature.\" As an evolving urban ecology, Charles Morris Anderson has described this connection as the “thinness.” It is the simultaneous perception and implicit understanding of the past, present, and future. Emo Urbanist projects include the built work of Charles Anderson at the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, WA; The Anchorage Museum Common in Anchorage, AK; the yet to be constructed Project Phoenix in Haiti and Hellinikon's Metropolitan Park in Athens, Greece.\n\nIan Thompson has published a critical review of landscape urbanism in which he identifies its ten tenets and asks six critical questions. His conclusions are: \n... there are ideas with the Landscape Urbanism discourse which have great merit, among which I would include the breaking down of professional distinctions, the integration of ecological thinking, the foregrounding of infrastructure, the interest in the positive use of waste materials and the emphasis upon functionality rather than mere appearance. There is also a quantity of dubious philosophy, unhelpful imagery and obscurantist language that Landscape Urbanism ought to dump. ... Larding the case for Landscape Urbanim with Deleuzian and Derridean references was a mistake, since it was done principally to impress an academic elite, and it has even left large sections of its intended audience bemused'.\n\n\n\n"}

In its first ten days of operation it generated approximately as much revenue as a typical retail location's daily sales.\n\nSecond Life protesters (aka. Second Life Liberation Army) held a virtual protest opposing the company’s real world use of sexually suggestive imagery in advertising campaigns.

{"id": "447445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447445", "title": "Niger Delta Basin (geology)", "text": "Niger Delta Basin (geology)\n\nThe Niger Delta Basin, also referred to as the Niger Delta province, is an extensional rift basin located in the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea on the passive continental margin near the western coast of Nigeria with suspected or proven access to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe. This basin is very complex, and it carries high economic value as it contains a very productive petroleum system. The Niger delta basin is one of the largest subaerial basins in Africa. It has a subaerial area of about 75,000 km, a total area of 300,000 km, and a sediment fill of 500,000 km. The sediment fill has a depth between 9–12 km. It is composed of several different geologic formations that indicate how this basin could have formed, as well as the regional and large scale tectonics of the area. The Niger Delta Basin is an extensional basin surrounded by many other basins in the area that all formed from similar processes. The Niger Delta Basin lies in the south westernmost part of a larger tectonic structure, the Benue Trough. The other side of the basin is bounded by the Cameroon Volcanic Line and the transform passive continental margin.\n\nThe Niger Delta Basin was formed by a failed rift junction during separation of the South American plate and the African plate, as well as the opening of the South Atlantic. Rifting in this basin started in the late Jurassic and ended in the mid Cretaceous. As rifting continued, several faults formed, many of them thrust faults. Also at this time we have the deposition of the syn-rift sands and then shales in the late cretaceous. This shows that there was a regression in the early basin. By this time the basin has been undergoing extension by high angle normal faults and fault block rotation. Then at beginning of the Paleocene there was a large transgression. Then in the Paleocene the Akata Formation was deposited. In the Eocene the Agbada Formation was deposited. This caused the underlying shale Akata Formation to be squeezed into shale diapirs. Then in the Oligocene the Benin formation was deposited and it still being deposited today. The overall basin is divided into a few different zones due to its tectonic structure. There is an extensional zone, which lies on the continental shelf, that is caused by the thickened crust. There is a transition zone, and then there is a contraction zone, which lies in the deep sea part of the basin.\n\nThe sediment fill in the Niger Delta basin is characterized by three major depobelts. These three cycles show that the basin experienced an overall regression throughout time as the sediments go from deep sea mud sized grains to fluvial denser sand sized grains. The lithologies of the area experience changes due to several factors. One factor would be the types of sediment coming through the delta, which could be influenced by sea level, or maybe volcanic activity in the area. The type of environment of deposition will also change the sediment type. The early Cretaceous sediments were thought to be from a tide dominated system that were deposited on a concave shoreline, and throughout time the shoreline has become convexed and it is currently a wave dominated system.\n\nThe oceanic basement rock is the oldest rock in the basin and is basaltic in composition. It is of the pre-rift time period. Also closer to the coast you have precambrian continental basement.\n\nThere is a section of rock in this basin from the middle to late cretaceous that there is not much information on due to extreme depth. It is believed to be composed of sediments from a tide dominated coastline, and there are believed to be several layers of shales, although there distribution is not known.\n\nThe Akata Formation is Paleocene in age. It is composed of thick shales, turbidite sands, and small amounts of silt and clay. It is the mobile formation that is squeezed into shale diapirs in the basin that are formed form being over pressured and not being dehydrated properly. The Akata Formation formed during lowstands in sealevel and in oxygen deficient conditions. This formation is estimated to be up to 7000 meters thick.\n\nThe Agbada Formation dates back to Eocene in age. It is a marine facies defined by both freshwater and deep sea characteristics. This is the major oil and natural gas bearing facies in the basin. The hydrocarbons in this layer formed when this layer of rock became subaerial and was covered in a swamp type of environment that contained lots of organics. It is estimated to be 3700 meters thick.\n\nThe Benin Formation is Oligocene and younger in age. It is composed of continental flood plain sands and alluvial deposits. It is estimated to be up to 2000 meters thick.\n\nThe tectonic structures in the Niger Delta Basin are very typical of an extensional rift system, but the added shale diapirism due to compression makes this basin different. The main method of deformation is due to gravitational collapse of the basin, although the older faulting and deformation in the basin are related to the continental breakup and rifting of the African plate and South American plates. The overall basin is divided into a few different zones due to its tectonic structure. There is an extensional zone, which lies on the continental shelf, that is caused by the thickened crust. There is a transition zone, and then there is a contraction zone, which lies in the deep sea part of the basin.\n\nBasin inversion is caused by uplift and/or compression in this basin. The compression is caused by the toe detachment of the shale diapirs. Basin inversion forms anticline structures, which serve as a great oil trap. Clay smears in the sediments seal the formations so oil does not escape out. \n\nBasinward dipping reflectors are a common feature of extensional type rift basins. As fault blocks extend they rotate to dip towards the center of the basin. At the top of these fault blocks sub basins can form.\n\nThe shale diapirs are from the Akata Formation. This structure is formed due to the improper dehydration of the formation and the over pressuring by the overlying and denser Agbada Formation.\n\nHigh-angle normal faulting is a feature of the extensional portion of the rifting in this basin. It is considered a growth fault and the feature lies closer towards the basins edge and transitions to the toe detachment faulting as you continue down the basin.\n\nThe Niger Delta Basin produces around 2 million barrels of oil per day. The entire system is predicted to contain 34.5 billion barrels of oil and 94 trillion feet of natural gas.This area is still very heavily explored by oil companies today. It is one of the largest oil producers in the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10943769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10943769", "title": "Place identity", "text": "Place identity\n\nPlace identity or place-based identity refers to a cluster of ideas about place and identity in the fields of geography, urban planning, urban design, landscape architecture, environmental psychology, ecocriticism and urban sociology/ecological sociology. Place identity is sometimes called urban character, neighbourhood character or local character. Place identity has become a significant issue in the last 25 years in urban planning and design. Place identity concerns the meaning and significance of places for their inhabitants and users, and how these meanings contribute to individuals' conceptualizations of self. Place identity also relates to the context of modernity, history and the politics of representation. In other words, historical determinism, which intersects historical events, social spaces and groups by gender, class, ethnicity. In this way, it explores how spaces have evolved over time by exploring the social constructs through time and the development of space, place and power. To the same extent, the politics of representation is brought into context, as the making of place identity in a community also relates to the exclusion or inclusion in a community. Through this, some have argued that place identity has become an area for social change because it gives marginalized communities agency over their own spaces. In the same respect, it is argued that place identity has also been used to intervene social change and perpetuate oppression from a top-down approach by creating segregated spaces for marginalized communities.\n\nIn some ways it is related to the concepts of place attachment and sense of place. Place identity is largely related to the concepts of community formation because it recognizes that geographical spaces do not solely bond a community together but rather there are social bonds that account for community formation. Those social forces often are feelings of belonging and security, which involve theoretical formations of community. Theoretical formations of community, which were identified in \"Community: Seeking Safety in an Insecure World\" (Bauman, 2001) as bonds formed by similar locality, culture, language, kinship and/or experiences. In addition, identity also conceives feelings of security and freedom as one is able to self-identify and especially, when it comes to being able to foster agency over community formation. In addition, the similar and shared experiences of culture, language and locality foster the sense of community. This fostering of community is largely seen as an extension of agency because when a community is able to achieve a sense of place and place attachment, this allows for individuals to reinforce their own identities and strengthen their bonds within their community.\n\nMethodologies for understanding place identity primarily involve qualitative techniques, such as interviewing, participant observation, discourse analysis and mapping a range of physical elements. Some urban planners, urban designers and landscape architects use forms of deliberative planning, design charettes and participatory design with local communities as a way of working with place identity to transform existing places as well as create new ones. This kind of planning and design process is sometimes referred to as placemaking.\n\nThe following case studies are examples of how place identity is researched on the field.\n\nIn a study by Lee Cuba and David M. Hummon (1993), they focus on Cape Cod, Massachusetts residents and how social and environmental factors are associated with place identity. Place identity in regards to \"at-homeness\" was defined by existence, affiliations, and locus. Community members were asked if they feel at home in Cape Cod to measure the positive responses for existence. The open-ended responses to why community members feel at home were used to measure place affiliation. A close-ended question, \"Do you associate feeling at home with living in this particular house or apartment, with living in this community, or with living on the Cape, in general?\" was used to measure locus. Most respondents reported they did feel \"at home\".\n\nMichigan and the Great Lakes are analyzed to see the values and connections shared within the residents of Michigan. A questionnaire was given to Michigan residents to see how attached the residents are. The questionnaire consisted of statements and the statements were evaluated through the five-point Likert scale. As a result, the data revealed \"Michigan's voters have developed a strong sense of place regarding the state\".\n\nThese two case studies shows that place has a lot more to offer than just a physical location. Understanding how to measure a sense of place assist policy makers in decision making and creating potential policy implementation. They will take the community's issues into consideration during the planning process once they understand the values of a community.\n\nCuba, L. & Hummon, D.M. (1993).

{"id": "2252626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252626", "title": "Páramo", "text": "Páramo\n\nPáramo can refer to a variety of alpine tundra ecosystems. Some ecologists describe the páramo broadly as \"all high, tropical, montane vegetation above the continuous timberline\". A more narrow term classifies the páramo according to its regional placement in the northern Andes of South America and adjacent southern Central America. The páramo is the ecosystem of the regions above the continuous forest line, yet below the permanent snowline. It is a \"Neotropical high mountain biome with a vegetation composed mainly of giant rosette plants, shrubs and grasses\". According to scientists, páramos may be \"evolutionary hot spots\" and among the fastest evolving regions on Earth.\n\nThe Northern Andean Paramo global ecoregion includes the Cordillera Central páramo (Ecuador, Peru), Santa Marta páramo (Colombia), Cordillera de Merida páramo (Venezuela) and Northern Andean páramo (Colombia, Ecuador) terrestrial ecoregions.\nThe Costa Rican páramo in Costa Rica and Panama is another páramo ecoregion.\nIn the strictest sense of the term, all páramo ecosystems are located in the Neotropics, specifically South and Central America. Scattered throughout the regions between 11°N and 8°S latitudes, these ecosystems are located mainly in the northwest corner of South America, in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.\n\nIn Venezuela, the páramo occurs in the Cordillera de Mérida. Páramo ecosystems are also found in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, and in the regions of Huehuetenango and El Quiché of Guatemala in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The Cordillera de Talamanca of Costa Rica and the westernmost part of Panama has páramo. In northern Ecuador, the Guandera Biological Station is a fairly undisturbed páramo ecosystem.\n\nThe majority of the páramo ecosystems occur in the Colombian Andes. The Sumapaz Páramo, south of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes (about south of Bogotá), is the largest páramo in the world. This region was declared a National Park of Colombia in 1977 because of its importance as a biodiversity hotspot and main source of water for the most densely populated area of the country, the Bogotá Savannah.\nThe Páramo Wildlife Refuge Park in the San José Province of Costa Rica \"protects tropical forest areas in the high elevations of the Talamanca Mountains\".\n\nCotopaxi National Park contains of protected land in the Cotopaxi Province of Ecuador. Much of this park is páramo. Its flora includes gentians, clubmosses, valerians, and asters such as \"Loricaria\" and \"Chuquiraga\" species.\n\nPáramo climates differ slightly depending on the specific location. In Colombia and northern Ecuador, air masses from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) have a substantial effect on the climate, and these regions tend to be consistently humid (approx. 70-85%) throughout the year. The Andes also play a key role in the climate of these regions as they cause an orographic uplift in which moist air rises. This creates continuous moisture via rain, clouds, and fog, with many of them receiving over of rain annually.\n\nThe páramos of the northern-most Andes of Venezuela, northern Colombia, and Costa Rica experience a different climate due to the dry season, which is caused by northeasterly trade winds. Southern Ecuador and northern Peru experience the most severe dryness as they are influenced by an air mass from the Amazon Basin, which releases its moisture on the eastern slopes, as well as another air mass from the west that is influenced by the Humboldt Current.\n\nOverall, páramo climates are known for their daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity. While they are generally cold and humid ecosystems, they often undergo a sudden and drastic change in weather in which they fluctuate between temperatures from below freezing to as high as . This oscillation often results in a daily freeze-and-thaw cycle, sometimes described as \"summer every day and winter every night.\" Mean annual temperatures of páramo ecosystems range from to , with increasingly colder temperatures at higher latitudes.\n\nSoils in páramo ecosystems vary, but most are young and partially weathered. The soil has a relatively low pH because of an abundance of moisture and organic content. Organic content, even within disturbed sites averages very high which contributes to water retention in the soil. During cold and wet weather, there are few nutrients available and productivity is very low in páramo soils. Soils in páramo ecosystems have changed because of human activity, especially due to burning vegetation to clear land for grazing.\n\nSoils in the south Ecuadorian páramo are characterized broadly into Andisols, Inceptisols, Histosols, Entisols, and Mollisols. Recently, there has been an increase in Andisol soils, largely due to more volcanic activity These soils have a very high water retention rate, which contributes to the rise in cultivation and differential land use. This water supply stored in the soil in the higher elevation páramo in the Andes becomes the water supply for Andean settlements in lower altitudes.\nPáramos are divided into separate zones based on altitude and vegetation structure, with the three main types of páramo vegetation unequally distributed throughout the different zones. \nSuperpáramo is at the highest elevation and is usually considered to be the transition zone between the higher, permanent snow region and the lower grass páramo zone. The superpáramo zone is generally narrow and exists atop loose stones and sandy soils at about . It has the lowest air temperature, precipitation level, soil water-holding capacity, and nutrient content of all the zones. Being the highest in altitude, it also has the highest levels of solar radiation and night frost. For this reason, vegetation in the superpáramo must be highly resistant to such severe fluctuations in weather. Air temperatures are low - cold at night and cool during the day with daily oscillations greater than the oscillations of monthly averages. Due to its localization on high mountains, this area is the least disturbed by humans and contains the most endemic species of all the zones. Flora includes \"Azorella pedunculata\" of the Apiaceae family and species from the Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Ericaceae families.\n\nThe most broadly described zone is the grass páramo. Grass páramos cover large areas of mountain ranges, while others are limited to small areas on slopes and summits of very high mountains. The term \"páramo\" is sometimes used to refer to this specific type. It has continuous vegetation and plant cover with a \"yellowish to olive–brown\" look due to the combination of dead and living grasses. The grass páramo extends from approximately , and is composed of mostly tussock-grasses and bunch-grasses. Grasses of the \"Calamagrostis\" and \"Festuca\" genera tend to dominate this zone. Other common vegetation includes large and small shrubs, stunted trees, cushion plants, herbs, and rosette plants. While these are the dominant species, grass páramos can also contain tall- and short-grass communities, including herbaceous and woody vegetation. Due to its easier access and high levels of grass, this zone is more impacted by humans and suffers from both burning and grazing activities.\n\nSubpáramo is the lowest and most diverse zone. At , it is a shrub-dominated zone that combines aspects of both the grass páramo above and the forest below. Along with shrubs, this zone also contains small, scattered trees which gradually transition into the grasses and herbs of the grass páramo above. Plant communities in this vegetation zone are also known to include thickets that are mainly composed of shrubby or woody vegetation, including species from the \"Ilex\", \"Ageratina\", and \"Baccharis\" genera. Fragmented forests can appear in the subpáramo due to microclimatic or edaphic conditions, yet the more abrupt changes are generally due to anthropogenic disruption such as cutting, burning, and grazing activities. Because of these high levels of disruption, it is believed that subpáramos are made up of largely secondary-growth communities. The high levels of disruption also make this zone particularly difficult to define, as humans typically extend and expand the zone for their own purposes, sometimes over hundreds or thousands of years. This has altered forest lines, often lowering them by several hundred meters, which has also affected the zoning habitats for many animals.\n\nThe vegetation of the páramo provides shelter and habitat for a variety of mammals, birds, insects, amphibians, and reptiles. Some animals commonly found in páramo ecosystems include the Culpeo (sometimes called the páramo wolf), the white-tailed deer, and the spectacled bear which occasionally forages in the high páramo for its favored food, \"Puya\" bromeliads. Invertebrates such as grasshoppers, cockroaches, beetles, and flies are found in the subpáramo. Amphibians have been well documented in páramo ecosystems, including salamanders such as \"Bolitoglossa\" species and frogs such as \"Eleutherodactylus\" species. Reptiles include lizards of the genera \"Stenocercus\", \"Phenacosaurus\", and \"Proctoporus\".\n\nSixty-nine species of birds are considered to be \"total users\" of páramo habitats, with \"41 species making it their primary habitat and 16 as indicator species\". The Andean condor, also called \"king of the Andes\", is known for its wide wingspan, but is no longer frequently seen. The most numerous bird families in the páramo include eagles, hummingbirds, ovenbirds, thraupid \"finches\", and tyrant flycatchers. Some hummingbirds tolerate the cold climate by going into \"a kind of nightly hibernation.\"\n\nHummingbirds, bees and flies are all important pollinators in the páramo, while birds and smaller mammals such as rabbits and guinea pigs are important seed dispersers. Many of the larger mammals of the páramo are rare due to hunting.\n\nHumans have inhabited the páramo of the Andes for approximately the past 15,000 years. Deforestation has been extensive and in some cases, like the northern Andes, 90-95% of forests have been cleared. Other sites in Venezuela and Colombia show evidence that humans settled there at least 800 years ago and used the land for agriculture and hunting.\n\nWhen Europeans came to the Americas they introduced exotic plants and animals that greatly affected the land, especially cattle, which were introduced to the páramos in the early 18th century. By the 20th century the growing population of settlers led to an increased demand for land, and páramo ecosystems suffered accordingly. As more land was needed for cattle, fire was used to clear land, and eventually páramos became excessively burned and overgrazed. Both burning and grazing have damaged vegetation, soils, species diversity, and water storage capacity of the páramos. In burned and disturbed sites that were studied in the Andes the pH and phosphorus concentration in the soil are higher than in non-burned sites.\n\nClimate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue for páramo ecosystems.\nGrowing populations in Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador have forced settlements in higher elevations covering more páramo. Recent developments such as construction of aqueducts, drainage systems, and roads, mining, and afforestation have been a huge additional páramo disturbance. Increases in temperature extremes are forcing many fauna and flora species to higher grounds, and eventually they could face extinction. The flora of páramos is adapted to specific conditions and is thus vulnerable to even small climatic change. Climate change in the Andes is causing glaciers in the páramo to disappear and a drop in rainfall, virtually drying up páramo and in turn, drying up the water supply for cities such as Quito, Ecuador and Bogotá, Colombia.\n\nOn 8 February 2016, the Constitutional Court of Colombia banned all mining operations in the paramos, prioritising the protection of the environment, and terminating 347 mining licenses that had operational rights in the ecosystem.\n\n"}

SAC-D was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 10 June 2011, with a planned mission life of five years. Due to a power system failure, the mission was ended on 8 June 2015.\n\nSAC-D was an international collaboration between the space agencies of Argentina and the United States, CONAE and NASA, with participation from Brazil (INPE), Canada (CSA), France (CNES) and Italy (ASI). It carried five Earth observation instruments (NASA, CONAE, CSA, ASI), two space science instruments (CNES), a data collection instrument (CONAE), and a technology demonstration system (CONAE).\n\nThe spacecraft's main instrument, Aquarius, was built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center. It collected data from 25 August 2011 to 7 June 2015, exceeding its intended three year primary mission. Aquarius' mission was to demonstrate that accurate measurements of salinity could be made from space, and was the first spaceborne instrument to use both passive radiometers and active radar in the L band. By measuring ocean salinity, scientists are better able to understand the Earth's water cycle and ocean circulation. Project scientists later derived a method of pulling soil moisture data from Aquarius' radiometer.\n\nNASA launched SAC-D from Vandenberg Air Force Base's Space Launch Complex 2W aboard a Delta II 7320-10C on 10 June 2011 at 14:20:13 UTC. The launch was delayed from May 2010 because development of the spacecraft was taking longer than expected.\n\nThe Aquarius instrument's surface salinity measurements contributed to a better understanding of ocean dynamics and advancing climate and ocean models, both from season to season and year to year. The models still are improving El Niño prediction. Aquarius global salinity maps show how freshwater plumes coming from the mouth of large rivers and the precipitation and evaporation over the oceans affect the salinity structure of the ocean.\n\n“The Aquarius sensor collected three years and nine months of valuable data. It was truly a pioneering effort to determine how accurately we could measure ocean salinity from space and for the first time study large and small-scale interactions of the global water cycle.” Aquarius principal investigator Gary Lagerloef of Earth & Space Research, Seattle.\n\nAquarius provided information into the natural exchange of freshwater between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice, which influences ocean circulation, weather and climate.\n\nData from Aquarius showed how extreme floods affect the seas and how low-salinity river plumes affect hurricane intensity. Aquarius data was important to the Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study (SPURS), a year-long international field study of the oceanographic processes that sustain the maximum surface salinities in the central subtropical North Atlantic, and influence global ocean circulation.\n\nThe Aquarius instrument successfully achieved its science objectives and completed its primary three-year mission in November 2014.\n\nOn 7 June 2015 at 12:53:17 UTC, telemetry indicated a failure of the spacecraft's Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), causing loss of onboard power regulation and attitude stabilization. While efforts were made to recover the spacecraft, the mission was declared over on 8 June.\n\n\n"}

The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 UN member states, 165 are governed as unitary states.\n\nIn a unitary state, sub-national units are created and abolished (an example being the 22 mainland regions of France being merged into 13), and their powers may be broadened and narrowed, by the central government. Although political power may be delegated through devolution to local governments by statute, the central government remains supreme; it may abrogate the acts of devolved governments or curtail their powers.\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is an example of a unitary state. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a degree of autonomous devolved power, but such power is delegated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which may enact laws unilaterally altering or abolishing devolution (England does not have any devolved power). Many unitary states have no areas possessing a degree of autonomy. In such countries, sub-national regions cannot decide their own laws. Examples are the Republic of Ireland and the Kingdom of Norway. \n\nUnitary states are contrasted with federations, or federal states. In such states, the sub-national governments share powers with the central government as equal actors through a written constitution, to which the consent of both is required to make amendments. This means that the sub-national units have a right of existence and powers that cannot be unilaterally changed by the central government.\n\n\"Italics\": States with limited recognition \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
