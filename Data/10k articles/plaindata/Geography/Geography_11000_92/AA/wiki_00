By communication with GPS satellites, detailed real-time data on flight variables can be passed to a server on the ground. This server stores the flight data, which can then be transmitted via telecommunications networks to organisations wishing to interpret it.\n\nThe different kinds of telecommunication networks used are:\n\nSome devices are avionics components like ACARS and ADS-B. In these cases the receiving and transmitting antenna are usually located outside of the airframe.\n\nWhen devices are not installed as avionics components they have to be completely independent from the aircraft. They are typically placed inside of the airframe in a location where the GPS and communication satellites are directly visible to the device, for example through the cockpit window. The output signal must also be able to penetrate the aircraft - most civil aviation authorities require compliance with DO-160 for audio frequency conducted susceptibility and induced signal susceptibility.\n\nAuthorities classify non-installed components as \"transmitting portable electronic devices\" (T-PEDS) and as such require them to be switched off during the critical phases of flight.\n\nAccurate real-time data provided by GPS aircraft tracking may be offered to air traffic control using ADS-B technology. This can safely reduce airspace separation of aircraft. GPS aircraft tracking also enables airlines to track their fleet of aircraft over the ACARS system, and allows aircraft to be more easily located in the event of an accident. The data is processed to gather \"OOOI\" information about movements within the airport and to compute flight time. Finally, GPS aircraft tracking permits a flight school to track a trainee pilot and debrief his/her flight path afterwards.\n\nThere are several active aircraft tracking systems available on the market that use the \"bread-crumb approach\" to SAR. Rather than relying on an emergency locator transmitter to transmit upon impact, the next generation of emergency locating devices are active tracking devices that send position reports at regular time intervals. If the unit stops transmitting upon impact, the historical transmissions will give the last known location of the aircraft, its speed, direction and altitude. Tracking as an alternative or complement to current technology has recently been encouraged by the Coroner in New Zealand.\n\n"}

It lies between the Sahara desert and the Gulf of Guinea, south of the loop of the Niger River, mostly between latitudes 9° and 15°N (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes 6°W and 3°E. The land is green in the south, with forests and fruit trees, and desert in the north. Most of central Burkina Faso lies on a savanna plateau, above sea level, with fields, brush, and scattered trees. Burkina Faso's game preserves—the most important of which are Arly, Nazinga, and W National Park—contain lions, elephants, hippopotamus, monkeys, common warthogs, and antelopes. Previously the endangered painted hunting dog, \"Lycaon pictus\" occurred in Burkina Faso, but, although the last sightings were made in Arli National Park, the species is considered extirpated from Burkina Faso. Tourism is not well developed.\n\nBurkina Faso has a total area of 274,200 km, of which 273,800 km is land and 400 km water. Comparatively, it is slightly larger than New Zealand and Colorado. Its borders total 3,611 km: Benin 386 km, Ivory Coast 545 km, Ghana 602 km, Mali 1,325 km, Niger 622 km, and Togo 131 km. It has no coastline or maritime claims.\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Burkina Faso, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n\nIt is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a peneplain, which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of . The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than . Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country. Its elevation extremes are a lowest point at the Mouhoun (Black Volta) River (200 m) and highest point at Tena Kourou (749 m).\n\nThe country is divided into 13 administrative regions. These regions encompass 45 provinces and 351 departments.\n\nThe country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the Black Volta (or Mouhoun), the White Volta (Nakambé) and the Red Volta (Nazinon). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the Komoé, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the Niger River also drains 27% of the country's surface.\n\nThe Niger's tributaries – the Béli, the Gorouol, the Goudébo and the Dargol – are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large floods. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli and Markoye. Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.\n\nBurkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 millimetres (23.6 and 35.4 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the harmattan – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than [13] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, .\n\nA relatively dry tropical savanna, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north latitude, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than [13] of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.\n\nBurkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt and small deposits of gold. 21.93% of its land is arable, and 0.26% has permanent crops as of 2012. As of 2003, 250 km were irrigated. Its total renewable water resources as of 2011 were 12.5 m, with a total freshwater withdrawal of 0.72 km/yr (46% domestic, 3% industrial, 51% agricultural; this amounts to a per-capita withdrawal of 54.99 m/yr.\n\nBurkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see List of national parks in Africa, Nature reserves of Burkina Faso.\n\nRecurring droughts and floods are a significant natural hazard. Current environmental issues include: recent droughts and desertification severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy; overgrazing; soil degradation; deforestation.\n\nBurkina Faso is party to the following international environmental agreements: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands. It has signed, but not ratified, the Law of the Sea and the Nuclear Test Ban.\n\n\n"}

The coastal region is noted for active seismicity.\n\nMontenegro's section of the karst lies generally at elevations of above sea level-although some areas rise to . The lowest segment is in the valley of the Zeta River, which flows at an elevation of . The river occupies the centre of Nikšić field, a flat-floored, elongated depression typical of karstic regions. The underlying rock is predominantly limestone, which dissolves to form sinkholes and underground caves. The longest cave in Montenegro is Vražji firovi - 10,5 km long cave north-east from Berane, and the deepest sinkhole is Željezna jama -1027 m on mount Maganik.\n\nThe Zeta River Valley, or Bjelopavlići plain, merges in the southeast with the second significant flat lowland in Montenegro, the Zeta plain. Zeta plain stretches north of the Lake Scutari at elevation of . The two plains are today the most densely populated areas of Montenegro, housing the two biggest Montenegrin cities, Podgorica and Nikšić.\n\nThe high mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe. They average more than in elevation. Among notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountain, which reaches . The Montenegrin mountains were the most ice-eroded section of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.\n\nThe coast of Montenegro is long. Unlike its northern neighbour Croatia, Montenegro has no large inhabited islands along the coast. A notable feature of the Montenegrin coast is Bay of Kotor, a fjord-like gulf, which is in fact a submerged river canyon. The Bay of Kotor is surrounded by mountains up to high, which plunge almost vertically into the sea.\n\nTo the south of the Bay of Kotor, there is a narrow coastal plain, no more than 4 km wide, which is guarded from the north by high mountains. The plain provided space for numerous small coastal settlements.\n\nMontenegro's surface runoff in the north is carried away by the Lim and Tara river systems, which enter the Danube via the Drina River of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In southern Montenegro, streams flow toward the Adriatic Sea. Much of the drainage of the karstic region is not on the surface but travels in underground channels.\n\nThe largest lake in Montenegro and the Balkans is Lake Scutari. Known in Montenegro as \"Skadarsko Jezero\", it lies near the coast and extends across the international border into northern Albania. It is long and wide, with a total surface area of . Some 60 percent lies within Montenegrin territory.

However, it was not until relatively recent history that the term \"landscape architecture\" or even \"landscape architect\" came into common use.\n\"Landscape architecture\" was first used by Gilbert Laing Meason in his book \"On The Landscape Architecture of the Great Painters of Italy\" (London, 1828). Meason was born in Scotland and did not have the opportunity to visit Italy. But he admired the relationship between architecture and landscape in the great landscape paintings and drew upon Vitruvius' Ten books of architecture to find principles undere relationship between built form and natural form.\n\n'Landscape architecture' was then taken up by John Claudius Loudon and used to describe a specific type of architecture, suited to being placed in designed landscapes. Loudon was admired by the American designer and theorist Andrew Jackson Downing and 'landscape architecture' was the subject of a chapter in Downing's book \"A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America\" (1841).\n\nThis led to its adoption by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Frederick and a man named George Oskar gave a different slant to the meaning of 'landscape architecture', using the term to describe the whole professional task of designing a composition of planting, landform, water, paving and other structures. Their first use of this term was in the winning entry for the design of Central Park in New York City. Olmsted and Vaux then in 1863 adopted 'landscape architect' as a professional title and used it to describe their work for the planning of urban park systems. Olmsted's project for the Emerald Necklace in Boston was widely admired and led to the use of 'landscape architecture' as a professional title in Europe, initially by Patrick Geddes and Thomas Mawson. Frederick Law Olmsted and Beatrix Farrand, with eight other leading practitioners\n\nLandscape architecture has since become a worldwide profession, submitted for recognition by the International Labour Organization and represented on a world-wide basis by the International Federation of Landscape Architects. \n\nGarrett Eckbo and Dan Kiley were prominent modernist landscape architects in the mid-20th century. Their work is represented by a shift away from what might be termed the \"Wild Garden\" aesthetic of earlier landscape architects influenced by Romantic Naturalism, and toward a more spare and rectilinear aesthetic. Both studied under Warren Manning at Harvard, who in turn had studied under Frederick Law Olmsted. \n\nSeveral landscape architects practicing in the 1980s and 1990s moved the discipline beyond its roots in High Modernism. These include Martha Schwartz, Peter Walker, and Michael Van Valkenburgh. Starting in the mid-1990s, a new disciplinary shift occurred toward what has been called Landscape urbanism, a term that attempts to merge urban design, infrastructure design and landscape.\n\nThree remarkable histories of the landscape architecture profession were published in the 1970s.\n\nA first comprehensive history of landscape architecture, as distinct from the history of gardening was written by Norman T Newton with the title \"Design on the land: the development of landscape architecture\" (Belknap/Harvard 1971). The book has 42 chapters. The first three chapters are on Ancient Times, The Middle Ages, and The World of Islam. The last three chapters are on Urban Open-Space Systems, Variations in Professional Practice and the Conservation of Natural Resources. This reflects the development of landscape architecture from a focus on private gardens, in the ancient world, to a focus on the planning and design of public open space in the modern world. Since kings used to be responsible for the provision of public goods (irrigation, streets, town walls, parks and other environmental goods) the distinction between public and private was not quite the same in the ancient world as it is in the modern world.\n\nA second comprehensive history of landscape architecture was published, in 1973, by George B Tobey, with the title \"History of Landscape Architecture\". It extends from 5000 BC, through the development of agriculture and towns to the design of gardens, parks and garden cities. This represents a broader view of landscape architecture than that of Newton and would have been well suited to Newton's title 'Design on the land'.\n\nA third comprehensive history of landscape architecture was published by Geoffrey and Susan Jellicoe in 1975 with the title \"The landscape of man: shaping the environment from prehistory to the present day\" (Thames and Hudson, 1975). The book has 27 chapters and is more comprehensive than its predecessors, geographically, artistically and philosophically. Like Bannister Fletcher's \"History of Architecture\", the book has introductory sections (e.g. on environment, social history, philosophy, expression, architecture, landscape) and then a series of examples with plans and photographs. Many of the examples are parks and gardens but the book also includes the layout of temples, towns, forests and other projects concerned with 'shaping the environment'.\n\nThe fine arts and landscape architecture have been interwoven in the outstanding professionals' methods. A history of landscape architecture, including the natural and designed the landscape and of public and private gardens: also includes the crucial professional component of artistic and technical representation which have always been responsible for visualizing and communicating - the creative concepts, ideas, designs, options, 'manifested theories', and guiding aesthetic principles - between the landscape architect and the clients, builders, and interested parties. A few of the media and methods are unchanged, while most have evolved over the centuries to reflect new artistic methods and graphic supplies. Almost timeless are the fine arts media of charcoal sketch, oil paint, watercolor, pen and ink drawing, sculpture, and etching. Those were joined by: print-making; by film photography for prints, slides, and movies; collage and built up layered images; model making, and other techniques. Since the late 20th century the introduction of computers, numerous formatting uses for scanning and printing, the wide array of options with digital technology for drawing, images and site videos; and the nearly infinite reach of the internet have revolutionized how to explore and interact to share creative intent. These have also facilitated effective communicating collaboratively within the project team, clients, and involved people the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Insular Islands were surrounded by two prehistoric oceans, the Panthalassa Ocean to the west and the Bridge River Ocean to the east. About 115 million years ago, these islands collided with the North American continent, fusing onto the North American Plate and closing the Bridge River Ocean during the Mid-Cretaceous time.\n\nThe Insular Islands formed at least 210 million years before the collision. Like the earlier Intermontane Islands, the large size of the islands prevented them from being pushed under the North American Plate. Instead, the Insular Islands were crumpled and crushed along the shoreline of North America to become part of the continent. The Insular Plate stopped subducting under North America; the subduction zone moved to the Farallon Trench further westward. The rocks that comprised the Insular Islands now form a large geologic feature along the coast of North America known as the Insular Belt.\n\n"}

His main contributions to human geography were in the sub-fields of urban, political, economic, historical and regional geography. His regional specializations ranged from France and the Mediterranean to the United States, Israel, and Japan.\n\nGottmann was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, Russian Empire. He was the only child of prosperous Jewish parents, Elie Gottmann and Sonia-Fanny Ettinger, who were killed in February 1918, following the Russian Revolution of 1917. He was de facto adopted by his aunt, Emily Gottmann and uncle, Michel Berchin, and escaped with them to Paris in 1921 via Constantinople.\n\nGottmann started out as a research assistant in economic geography at the Sorbonne (1937–41) under the guidance of Albert Demangeon, but was forced to leave his post with the Nazi invasion of France and the 1940 Statute of Jews which banned him from public employment. He found refuge in the United States, where he received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to attend the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in the seminar of Edward M. Earle. During the war, he contributed also to the U.S. effort by consulting for the Board of Economic Warfare in Washington and other agencies; he also joined La France Libre and the exiled French academic community teaching at the New School for Social Research. Isaiah Bowman hired him as a non-tenured professor at his new institute of geography of the Johns Hopkins University (1943–48). In 1945 he returned to France to work for the French Ministry of the Economy, and he also spent two years as director of research at the United Nations (1946–47).\n\nAfter the war, he started to commute between France and the United States in an effort to explain America's human geography to the French public and Europe's to the American. His multicultural perspective allowed him to get a grant from Paul Mellon to produce the first regional study of Virginia (1953–55) and financial support from The Century Foundation to study the megalopolis of the North-Eastern seaboard of the United States, which soon became a paradigm in urban geography and planning to define polynuclear global city-regions.\n\nIn 1957 he married Bernice Adelson. In 1961, he was invited to join the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris by Fernand Braudel, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Alexandre Koyré and in 1968 became Professor of Geography and Head of Department at the School of Geography at the University of Oxford (1968–1983). After retiring as emeritus professor he remained in Oxford until the end of his life.\n\nBeyond his contribution to the study of megalopolis and to urban geography, his theoretical work on the political partitioning of geographical space as a result of the interplay between movement flows and symbolic systems (iconographies) has been rediscovered after his death.\n\nGottmann was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the American Geographical Society in 1956, and its Charles P. Daly Medal in 1964. In 1980 he received the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. He also was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the British Academy.\n\nJean Gottmann's bibliography lists about 400 references. The following list is a selection of some of his most relevant books and papers:\n\n\n\n"}

It is a length of cord with knots at regular intervals. They were eventually replaced by surveyor's chains, which being made of metal were less prone to stretching and thus were more accurate and consistent.\n\nKnotted cords were used by many ancient cultures. The Greek schoenus is referred to as a rope used to measure land. Ropes generally became cables and chains with Pythagoras making the Greek agros a chain of 10 stadia equal to a nautical mile c 540 BC. The Romans used a waxed cord for measuring distances. \n\nA knotted cord 12 lengths long (the units do not matter) closed into a loop can be used to lay out a right angle by forming the loop of cord into a 3–4–5 triangle. This could be used for laying out the corner of a field or a building foundation, for instance.\n\nKnotted cords were used by rope stretchers, royal surveyors who measured out the sides of fields (Egyptian \"3ht\"). The knotted cords (Egyptian \"ht\") were 100 royal cubits in length, with a knot every \"hayt\" or 10 royal cubits. The rope stretchers stretched the rope in order to take the sag out it, as well as to keep the measures uniform.\n\nSince land in ancient Egypt was measured using several different units, there would have been knotted cords with the knots spaced in each unit. Among these were the \"mh t3\" or land cubits, remen royal cubits, rods or \"ha3t\", generally the lengths in multiples of 100 units. The longest measured length listed in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a circumference of about a Roman mile with a diameter of 9 khet.\n\nDespite many popular claims, there is no reliable evidence that the 3-4-5 triangle, and by implication the Pythagoras' theorem, was used in Ancient Egypt to lay out right angles, such as for the pyramids. The historian Moritz Cantor first made the conjecture in 1882. Right angles were certainly laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt; their surveyors did use knotted cords for measurement; Plutarch recorded in \"Isis and Osiris\" (around 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3-4-5 triangle; and the Berlin Papyrus 6619 from the Middle Kingdom (before 1700 BC) made statements that suggest knowledge of Pythagoras' theorem. However, no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle's sides, and the historian of mathematics Roger Cooke notes that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. He guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but concludes that \"there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles\".\n\n"}

Within the zone one can find the biggest cities, industrial and commercial centres of the region: Poznań, Szczecin, Gorzów Wielkopolski and Zielona Góra.\n\nCreated in 1997, the Kostrzyn–Slubice SEZ is one of the fastest developing special economic zone in Poland, because of its high rate of tax exemption, nowadays one of the highest in Poland, and its greenfields.\n\nKostrzyn nad Odrą,\nSłubice,\nGorzów Wielkopolski,\nMiedzyrzecz,\nRzepin,\nZielona Góra,\nGubin,\nNowa Sól,\nBytom Odrzański,\nCzerwieńsk,\nLubsko,\nSulęcin,\nStrzelce Krajeńskie.\n\n\nChodzież,\nPoznań,\nSwarzędz.\n\nThe location of the Kostrzyn–Słubice Special Economic Zone, situated in the very heart of Europe, is right next to the German border and the Zone has passenger and commercial transportation links to the west.\n\nThe Zone is situated near main roads including the international E30 (A2), E65 (A3) and E28 motorways and near to the Paris – Berlin – Warsaw – Moscow international railway line. Some of the subzones, the ones located on the Odra and Warta Rivers, have access to seaports in Szczecin, Swinoujscie and Police, as well as the German ports of Berlin and Hamburg. All the subzones are close to airports with passenger and cargo facilities in the cities of Babimost, Goleniów and the German capital, Berlin as well as being close to trade and manufacturing centres that are located in the largest cities of the surrounding regions: Gorzów Wlkp, Zielona Góra, Poznań, Szczecin and Koszalin.\n\nThe dominant types of manufactures of the different investors in the SEZ are chemicals, mechanical engineering, textiles, wood, paper, machinery, construction materials and grocery.\n\nThe zone has delivered over 140 permits to conduct a business activity, for example to Volkswagen, Faurecia, Funai Electrics, Arctic Paper, ICT, AB Foods, Podravka, Wendre, Teleskop, BEE, TPV and many more...\n\nThere is a strong growth in the economic cooperation with Germany. Other partners of the zone can also be found in France, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the UK, Belgium, Spain, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, India, the US and many more.\n\nCompanies operating a business activity in the Kostrzyn–Słubice Special Economic Zone are entitled to regional support in receiving exemptions from the CIT tax for one of the following categories: investment costs or the creation of new work places.\n\nIn the subzones located in the Lubuskie Voivodeship, the companies deciding to conduct a business activity in the Kostrzyn–Słubice Special Economic Zone, benefit from CIT taxe exemption of their initial investment costs or of 2 years of employment costs, after receiving from the SEZ a permit to conduct a business activity, which amounts to 70% of exemption for small companies, medium-sized companies benefit from 60% of exemption and large companies benefit from 50% of exemption.\n\nIn the subzones located in the Wielkopolskie and Zachodniopomorskie Voivodeship, these allowances are decreased by 10%, this amounts to 60% for small companies, 50% for medium-sized companies and 40% for large companies.\n\n"}

It is one of six lakes in Djurgården, the others being: Lillsjön, Uggleviken, Isbladskärret, Laduviken, and Spegeldammen.\n\nThrough its location in the Royal National City Park, it is considered as a lake of great recreational value, especially popular among ornithologists and frequently used in classes at the University of Stockholm located nearby. As the name implies, it used to be a marsh until construction works for the student apartments at Lappkärrsberget punctured a subsoil spring in the 1960s. Today, the lake empties into the strait Lilla Värtan through a culvert and forms part of a proposed nature reserve in Norra Djurgården.\n\nMost of the catchment area is composed of open fields and areas of spruce and deciduous forest, with a single trafficked road passing west of the lake. Next to a group of nearby allotment-gardens is a 4-H farmyard with horses and sheep.\n\nMost of the inflow is believed to come from subsoil water with some contribution from stormwater and snow-melting. Local land usage produces small amounts of nutrients and no conduits guides surface water to the lake. The lake is alkali and saliferous with high levels of oxygen, phosphorus, and phosphate, but low levels of inorganic nitrogen. Notwithstanding various levels of chlorophyll, water transparency exceeds the depth of the lake and pH is reported as constant.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, isolated occurrences of rigid hornwort had established in the lake, and, by the mid-1990s, abundant quantities of other aquatic plants such as ivy duckweed and the liverwort \"Riccia fluitans\", were reported along open edges of the lake. During that decade, submarine vegetation covered the entire lake bed which greatly cleared up the lake. In the mid-1980s, the only fauna reported was sparse occurrences of larvae and non-biting midges. Within ten years, however, the fauna had evolved considerably, probably due to the rich vegetation, to include Oligochaeta, gasteropods, and dragonfly larvae and today also the dragonfly species Aeshna osiliensis, common winter damselfly, and several others.\n\nThe only fish in the lake is crucian carp, probably introduced in the early 1980s. Attempts have been made to reduce the population with various results. In the mid-1970 a colony of black-headed gulls together with Slavonian grebe, mallard, little grebe, and gadwall. The black-headed gull is a key species, offering protection to other species, and has now abandoned the lake which is, however, still considered as of great importance to bird life with several species still breeding there. Several protected species of amphibians can be seen by the lake, including common frog, common toad, moor frog, and smooth newt.\n\nBoth the lake and the surrounding national park is easily accessible by metro, bus, bicycle, or by foot. The nearest metro station is Universitetet and bus 50 stops nearby.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23979", "title": "Ptolemy", "text": "Ptolemy\n\nClaudius Ptolemy (; , \"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\" ; ; ) was a Greco-Roman mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. The 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes gave his birthplace as the prominent Greek city Ptolemais Hermiou () in the Thebaid (). This attestation is quite late, however, and, according to Gerald Toomer, the translator of his \"Almagest\" into English, there is no reason to suppose he ever lived anywhere other than Alexandria. He died there around AD 168.\n\nPtolemy wrote several scientific treatises, three of which were of importance to later Byzantine, Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the \"Almagest\", although it was originally entitled the \"Mathematical Treatise\" (, \"Mathēmatikē Syntaxis\") and then known as the \"Great Treatise\" (, \"Hē Megálē Syntaxis\"). The second is the \"Geography\", which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the Greco-Roman world. The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt horoscopic astrology to the Aristotelian natural philosophy of his day. This is sometimes known as the \"Apotelesmatika\" () but more commonly known as the \"Tetrabiblos\" from the Greek () meaning \"Four Books\" or by the Latin \"Quadripartitum\".\n\n\"Ptolemaeus\" ( \"Ptolemaios\") is a Greek name. It occurs once in Greek mythology, and is of Homeric form. It was common among the Macedonian upper class at the time of Alexander the Great, and there were several of this name among Alexander's army, one of whom made himself pharaoh in 323 BC: Ptolemy I Soter, the first king of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. All male pharaohs after him, until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC, were also Ptolemies.\n\nThe name \"Claudius\" is a Roman \"nomen\"; the fact that Ptolemy bore it indicates he lived under the Roman rule of Egypt with the privileges and political rights of Roman citizenship. It would have suited custom if the first of Ptolemy's family to become a citizen (whether he or an ancestor) took the \"nomen\" from a Roman called Claudius who was responsible for granting citizenship. If, as was common, this was the emperor, citizenship would have been granted between AD 41 and 68 (when Claudius, and then Nero, were Roman emperors). The astronomer would also have had a \"praenomen\", which remains unknown.\n\nThe ninth-century Persian astronomer Abu Maʿshar presents Ptolemy as a member of Egypt's royal lineage, stating that the ten kings of Egypt who followed Alexander were wise \"and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of the \"Almagest\"\". Abu Maʿshar recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line \"composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy\". We can evidence historical confusion on this point from Abu Maʿshar subsequent remark “It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the \"Almagest\". The correct answer is not known”. There is little evidence on the subject of Ptolemy's ancestry, apart from what can be drawn from the details of his name (see above); however, modern scholars refer to Abu Ma’shar’s account as erroneous, and it is no longer doubted that the astronomer who wrote the \"Almagest\" also wrote the \"Tetrabiblos\" as its astrological counterpart.\n\nPtolemy wrote in Koine Greek and can be shown to have utilized Babylonian astronomical data. He was a Roman citizen, but was ethnically either a Greek or a Hellenized Egyptian. He was often known in later Arabic sources as \"the Upper Egyptian\", suggesting he may have had origins in southern Egypt. Later Arabic astronomers, geographers and physicists referred to him by his name in \"Baṭlumyus\".\n\nPtolemy's \"Almagest\" is the only surviving comprehensive ancient treatise on astronomy. Babylonian astronomers had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating astronomical phenomena; Greek astronomers such as Hipparchus had produced geometric models for calculating celestial motions. Ptolemy, however, claimed to have derived his geometrical models from selected astronomical observations by his predecessors spanning more than 800 years, though astronomers have for centuries suspected that his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations. Ptolemy presented his astronomical models in convenient tables, which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets. The \"Almagest\" also contains a star catalogue, which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight constellations is ancestral to the modern system of constellations, but unlike the modern system they did not cover the whole sky (only the sky Hipparchus could see). Across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in the Medieval period, it was the authoritative text on astronomy, with its author becoming an almost mythical figure, called Ptolemy, King of Alexandria. The \"Almagest\" was preserved, like most of extant Classical Greek science, in Arabic manuscripts (hence its familiar name). Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and was translated twice into Latin in the 12th century, once in Sicily and again in Spain. Ptolemy's model, like those of his predecessors, was geocentric and was almost universally accepted until the appearance of simpler heliocentric models during the scientific revolution.\n\nHis \"Planetary Hypotheses\" went beyond the mathematical model of the \"Almagest\" to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres, in which he used the epicycles of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii, while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth.\n\nPtolemy presented a useful tool for astronomical calculations in his \"Handy Tables\", which tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Ptolemy's \"Handy Tables\" provided the model for later astronomical tables or \"zījes\". In the \"Phaseis\" (\"Risings of the Fixed Stars\"), Ptolemy gave a \"parapegma\", a star calendar or almanac, based on the appearances and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year.\n\nPtolemy's other main work is his \"Geography\" (also called the \"Geographia\"), a compilation of geographical coordinates of the part of the world known to the Roman Empire during his time. He relied somewhat on the work of an earlier geographer, Marinos of Tyre, and on gazetteers of the Roman and ancient Persian Empire. He also acknowledged ancient astronomer Hipparchus for having provided the elevation of the north celestial pole for a few cities.\n\nThe first part of the \"Geography\" is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the \"Almagest\", Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. Following Marinos, he assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe. Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as \"climata\", the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc: the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as one goes from the equator to the polar circle. In books 2 through 7, he used degrees and put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the \"Blessed Islands\", often identified as the Canary Islands, as suggested by the location of the six dots labelled the \"FORTUNATA\" islands near the left extreme of the blue sea of Ptolemy's map here reproduced.\n\nPtolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (\"oikoumenè\") and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the \"Geography\", he provided the necessary topographic lists, and captions for the maps. His \"oikoumenè\" spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to the middle of China, and about 80 degrees of latitude from Shetland to anti-Meroe (east coast of Africa); Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe maps in surviving manuscripts of Ptolemy's \"Geography\", however, only date from about 1300, after the text was rediscovered by Maximus Planudes. It seems likely that the topographical tables in books 2–7 are cumulative texts – texts which were altered and added to as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy. This means that information contained in different parts of the Geography is likely to be of different dates.\nMaps based on scientific principles had been made since the time of Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, but Ptolemy improved map projections. It is known from a speech by Eumenius that a world map, an \"orbis pictus\", doubtless based on the \"Geography\", was on display in a school in Augustodunum, Gaul in the third century. In the 15th century, Ptolemy's \"Geography\" began to be printed with engraved maps; the earliest printed edition with engraved maps was produced in Bologna in 1477, followed quickly by a Roman edition in 1478 (Campbell, 1987). An edition printed at Ulm in 1482, including woodcut maps, was the first one printed north of the Alps. The maps look distorted when compared to modern maps, because Ptolemy's data were inaccurate. One reason is that Ptolemy estimated the size of the Earth as too small: while Eratosthenes found 700 \"stadia\" for a great circle degree on the globe, Ptolemy uses 500 \"stadia\" in the \"Geography\". It is highly probable that these were the same \"stadion\", since Ptolemy switched from the former scale to the latter between the \"Syntaxis\" and the \"Geography\", and severely readjusted longitude degrees accordingly. See also Ancient Greek units of measurement and History of geodesy.\n\nBecause Ptolemy derived many of his key latitudes from crude longest day values, his latitudes are erroneous on average by roughly a degree (2 degrees for Byzantium, 4 degrees for Carthage), though capable ancient astronomers knew their latitudes to more like a minute. (Ptolemy's own latitude was in error by 14'.) He agreed (\"Geography\" 1.4) that longitude was best determined by simultaneous observation of lunar eclipses, yet he was so out of touch with the scientists of his day that he knew of no such data more recent than 500 years before (Arbela eclipse). When switching from 700 stadia per degree to 500, he (or Marinos) expanded longitude differences between cities accordingly (a point first realized by P. Gosselin in 1790), resulting in serious over-stretching of the Earth's east-west scale in degrees, though not distance. Achieving highly precise longitude remained a problem in geography until the application of Galileo's Jovian moon method in the 18th century. It must be added that his original topographic list cannot be reconstructed: the long tables with numbers were transmitted to posterity through copies containing many scribal errors, and people have always been adding or improving the topographic data: this is a testimony to the persistent popularity of this influential work in the history of cartography.\n\nPtolemy has been referred to as “a pro-astrological authority of the highest magnitude”. His astrological treatise, a work in four parts, is known by the Greek term \"Tetrabiblos\", or the Latin equivalent \"Quadripartitum\": ‘Four Books’. Ptolemy's own title is unknown, but may have been the term found in some Greek manuscripts: \"Apotelesmatika\", roughly meaning 'Astrological Outcomes,' 'Effects' or ‘Prognostics’.\n\nAs a source of reference, the \"Tetrabiblos\" is said to have \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\". It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus) in 1138, while he was in Spain. The \"Tetrabiblos\" is an extensive and continually reprinted treatise on the ancient principles of horoscopic astrology. That it did not quite attain the unrivaled status of the \"Almagest\" was, perhaps, because it did not cover some popular areas of the subject, particularly electional astrology (interpreting astrological charts for a particular moment to determine the outcome of a course of action to be initiated at that time), and medical astrology, which were later adoptions.\n\nThe great popularity that the \"Tetrabiblos\" did possess might be attributed to its nature as an exposition of the art of astrology, and as a compendium of astrological lore, rather than as a manual. It speaks in general terms, avoiding illustrations and details of practice. Ptolemy was concerned to defend astrology by defining its limits, compiling astronomical data that he believed was reliable and dismissing practices (such as considering the numerological significance of names) that he believed to be without sound basis.\n\nMuch of the content of the \"Tetrabiblos\" was collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy's achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized. It is, indeed, presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the \"Almagest\" was the first, concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the sublunary sphere. Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the planets, based upon their combined effects of heating, cooling, moistening, and drying.\n\nPtolemy's astrological outlook was quite practical: he thought that astrology was like medicine, that is \"conjectural\", because of the many variable factors to be taken into account: the race, country, and upbringing of a person affects an individual's personality as much as, if not more than, the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the precise moment of their birth, so Ptolemy saw astrology as something to be used in life but in no way relied on entirely.\n\nA collection of one hundred aphorisms about astrology called the \"Centiloquium\", ascribed to Ptolemy, was widely reproduced and commented on by Arabic, Latin and Hebrew scholars, and often bound together in medieval manuscripts after the \"Tetrabiblos\" as a kind of summation. It is now believed to be a much later pseudepigraphical composition. The identity and date of the actual author of the work, referred to now as Pseudo-Ptolemy, remains the subject of conjecture.\n\nPtolemy also wrote an influential work, \"Harmonics\", on music theory and the mathematics of music. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus and in agreement with the followers of Pythagoras), backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the overly theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans). Ptolemy wrote about how musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations and vice versa in \"Harmonics\". This is called Pythagorean tuning because it was first discovered by Pythagoras. However, Pythagoras believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the specific ratio of 3:2, whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve tetrachords and octaves. He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. His \"Harmonics\" never had the influence of his \"Almagest\" or \"Planetary Hypotheses\", but a part of it (Book III) did encourage Kepler in his own musings on the harmony of the world (Kepler, \"Harmonice Mundi\", Appendix to Book V). Ptolemy's astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the \"music of the spheres\". See: Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale.\n\nHis \"Optics\" is a work that survives only in a poor Arabic translation and in about twenty manuscripts of a Latin version of the Arabic, which was translated by Eugene of Palermo (c. 1154). In it, Ptolemy writes about properties of light, including reflection, refraction, and colour. The work is a significant part of the early history of optics\nand influenced the more famous 11th-century \"Book of Optics\" by Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham). It contains the earliest surviving table of refraction from air to water, for which the values (with the exception of the 60° angle of incidence), although historically praised as experimentally derived, appear to have been obtained from an arithmetic progression.\n\nThe work is also important for the early history of perception. Ptolemy combined the mathematical, philosophical and physiological traditions. He held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation. This was one of the early statements of size-distance invariance as a cause of perceptual size and shape constancy, a view supported by the Stoics. Ptolemy offered explanations for many phenomena concerning illumination and colour, size, shape, movement and binocular vision. He also divided illusions into those caused by physical or optical factors and those caused by judgmental factors. He offered an obscure explanation of the sun or moon illusion (the enlarged apparent size on the horizon) based on the difficulty of looking upwards.\n\nThere are several characters or items named after Ptolemy, including:\n\n\n[[File:Ptolemaeus - Quadripartitum, 1622 - 4658973.tif|thumb|\"Quadripartitum\", 1622]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Ptolemy| ]]\n\n[[Category:100 births]]\n[[Category:170 deaths]]\n[[Category:1st-century Romans]]\n[[Category:2nd-century Romans]]\n[[Category:2nd-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:2nd-century poets]]\n[[Category:Egyptian calendar]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek astrologers]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek astronomers]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek music theorists]]\n[[Category:Astrological writers]]\n[[Category:Claudii]]\n[[Category:Egyptian astronomers]]\n[[Category:Egyptian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Epigrammatists of the Greek Anthology]]\n[[Category:2nd-century people of Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek geographers]]\n[[Category:Roman-era geographers]]\n[[Category:Giftedness]]"}

{"id": "6525796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6525796", "title": "Street system of Denver", "text": "Street system of Denver\n\nThe street system of Denver, Colorado reflects the early history and original geography and present day layout of the City and County of Denver, Colorado. \n\nThe oldest part of Denver, now the neighborhoods of Auraria Campus, LoDo, much of downtown, and Five Points, is laid out on a grid plan that is oriented diagonal to the four cardinal directions. The rest of the city, including the eastern part of downtown, is laid out primarily on a grid oriented to the cardinal directions. In this larger grid, from east to west, there are generally 16 city blocks per mile, except between Zuni Street and Lowell Boulevard in west Denver. From north to south, there are typically eight blocks per mile, although there are many areas with more blocks per mile. Addresses follow a decimal system, with addresses advancing by one hundred at each cross street.\n\nSome major arterial roads, such as Leetsdale Drive and South Santa Fe Drive, fall outside this pattern and run diagonally through the city. These roads generally originated as county roads or other major routes used by early settlers. The names of many of these roads change as they wind through the grid, following the name officially designated for a road in that area. Interstate highways do not follow the grid plan.\n\nModern Denver has two grids. One is laid out diagonal with respect to the four cardinal directions and is found on Auraria Campus, downtown, and northeast of downtown into the Five Points neighborhood. Most of the rest of the city's streets, as well as many of those of the surrounding suburbs, are laid out in an east–west/north–south pattern. These two grids result from early land development in the area.\n\nThe first streets in Denver were platted in what was then the town of Auraria, founded in 1858; it was the first permanent settlement of Europeans in Colorado, which was then part of the Kansas Territory. The streets were laid out parallel to the south bank of Cherry Creek near its confluence with the South Platte River, with perpendicular cross streets. Because they followed the path of a natural body of water, these streets were diagonal to the four cardinal directions.\n\nThe town of St. Charles, later named Denver, was founded later in 1858, located across Cherry Creek from Auraria. Its founder, General William Larimer, and William McGaa, an early settler, collaborated to plot and name the streets of the new town. These were laid out parallel not to Cherry Creek, but to the South Platte River with perpendicular cross streets. Because Cherry Creek and the South Platte meet at nearly a 90° angle, the cross streets of Auraria were nearly parallel to the streets of Denver and vice versa.\n\nIn 1864, developer Henry C. Brown laid out the first streets in Denver parallel to the cardinal directions, with streets running directly north–south and east–west. His grid was located directly east of Denver (which had absorbed Auraria in 1860), from what is now Broadway to the alley between Grant and Logan Streets and from 11th to 20th Avenues. This layout followed federal land policy.\n\nAbout the same time, territorial governor John Evans laid out streets on an east–west/north–south grid south of the original Denver plat, southeast of the modern intersection between Broadway and Colfax Avenue.\n\nDenver grew rapidly in its first thirty years. Areas were developed with little direction from the government of the young city, with each developer platting streets largely independently of others. As a result, where original developments meet, many streets do not line up with one another; for example, there are many displacements on East Colfax Avenue in streets running north and south. In fact, while there are 40 city blocks between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard south of East Colfax Avenue, there are only 39 blocks in the same stretch on the north side.\n\nStreet names reflected this bottom-up emergence, and street names were not coordinated from development to development, even for along the same north-south or east-west line. Some names were used more than once, by different streets across various Denver neighborhoods and surrounding towns. There was no universal system for the use of terms like \"street\", \"avenue\", etc. Later, these terms were defined such that \"street\" designated roads running north and south and aligned with the 100s of the numbering system, with \"court\" for intermediate (non-100s) north-south roads and \"way\" for roads which start north-south but curve to intersect with another north-south road; \"avenue\", \"place\", and \"drive\" (respectively) are the corresponding terms for roads running east and west. Major arterials in both directions, however, are often called \"boulevards\", and \"road\" and \"parkway\" also make appearances.\n\nAttempts to rationalize the street system began early. In 1873, the diagonal streets of Auraria and original Denver were renamed, with the zero point at the original southwest corner of Denver, the intersection of West Colfax Avenue and Zuni Street, near the South Platte River. According to this system, still in place in modern Denver, streets running from northwest to southeast are designated as heading north from the zero point and are numbered, while streets running from northeast to southwest are designated as heading east from the zero point and are named. A notable exception came when 23rd Street, which had been treated like any other numbered streets in downtown Denver, was renamed Park Avenue West and designated as running west rather than north, in order to match up with its eastern continuation, Park Avenue, which extends diagonally south-east into the otherwise compass-oriented grid east of Broadway.\n\nThe east-west avenues, originally named, were first numbered in 1871, with modern East 35th Avenue designated First Avenue; however, this system was abandoned in 1886, when the city passed an ordinance linking avenue numbers to the street numbers of the diagonal grid. Where a numbered street met an avenue at Broadway, the avenue was given the number of the connecting street; thus 16th Street provided the number for 16th Avenue, and so forth. An exception was Colfax Avenue, which meets 15th Street and is the equivalent of 15th Avenue, but retained its original name.\n\nThe avenues were then numbered consecutively to the north, even where they began to deviate from the diagonal grid, so that 27th Street meets 26th Avenue in the Five Points intersection. They are also extrapolated north of the grid, beyond Denver's main northern border at 52nd Avenue to 168th Avenue at the border between Adams and Weld Counties. Avenue numbers are also extrapolated south from Colfax to First Avenue. Ellsworth Ave is the 00 point, and south of here avenues are named.\n\nIn 1887, a decimal grid was imposed. Instead of counting addresses up arbitrarily along a direction, this system specified a \"hundred block\" for each street. For example, First Street is the 100 block, with all addresses on any named street between First and Second Streets ascending from 100 (nearest First Street) to 199 (nearest Second Street). Named streets also follow this pattern, with Cheyenne Place designated the 100 block and numbers increasing toward the northwest. In the diagonal grid, even-numbered addresses are on the west (i.e. southwest) sides of numbered streets and the east (i.e. northeast) side of named streets. \n\nIn the rest of the grid, even numbers are on the east sides of streets and the south sides of avenues, while odd numbers are on the west sides of streets and north sides of avenues. This decimal system forms a Cartesian coordinate system whose axes are Broadway (north−south) and Ellsworth Avenue (east−west). For numbered avenues, the hundred block corresponds to the number of the avenue (e.g. 17th Avenue designates the 1700 block North). Avenues south of Ellsworth are named, as are all streets running north−south, and have hundred-block numbers extending from the axes. Strictly speaking, only the portions of streets south of Ellsworth need be designated \"South\" and the portions of avenues west of Broadway need be designated \"West.\" Without a directional designation, streets are automatically assumed to be north of Ellsworth and avenues assumed to be east of Broadway, although it is common to refer to these avenues are \"East\".\n\nStreet names were originally applied with no consistency; the same road designation might have as many as ten different names in different parts of the city, and many different roads might share the same name. This inconsistency created significant problems for the Denver Union Water Company, which had difficulties both providing service and billing because of the chaotic street system. A bookkeeper, Howard Maloney, collaborated with the city to impose an orderly set of names to the roads, with each unique name designating exactly one road. In most areas, these streets are named in alphabetical order. The first set of changes took place in 1897, with further renaming in 1904. In 1906, many adjacent communities adopted Denver's system.\n\nThe City and County of Denver's zoning board classifies streets into three types based on functionality. \"Arterials\" are major \nroutes, arranged in a network to provide mobility around the city. \"Collector streets\" move traffic from arterials into neighborhoods and business districts. All other streets are \"local streets\", which provide access to individual lots.\n\n\nHighways that have portions running in or near Denver include:\n"}

The term is mostly of relevance in a historical context as political systems with ruling classes that would migrate to a summer capital, making them less prevalent in modern times. The ubiquity of air-conditioning systems also reduces the imperative to periodically relocate to summer capitals.\n\nShangdu (Xanadu) was an \"Upper Capital\" during Kublai Khan's reign in the 13th century.\n\nIn India, the government of the British Raj was annually transferred to Shimla during the summer months. This practice was stopped due to the difficulty of transporting officialdom, and the negative perceptions of the public about politicians and public servants making such a move. Srinagar is the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe hill station of Baguio in the northern mountains of Luzon was selected as the summer capital of the Philippines during the American Occupation in the early 20th century. Its cool climate was a preferred alternative to the sweltering, humid summers in the \"de facto\" capital, Manila. While the present sovereign government has long stopped transferring there \"en masse\", the city still hosts the official summer residence of the President of the Philippines, and the Supreme Court of the Philippines still maintains its \"Summer Sessions\" in the city, and it remains a popular holiday spot especially around Christmas season, when temperatures are considerably lower than in the rest of the archipelago.\n\nFollowing Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the Crimea (transferred away from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.\n\nThe Saudi royal family relocates to the mountainous city of Taif, near Mecca, which is far cooler in the summer months than the official capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh. But nowadays, it relocates mostly in Jeddah.\n\nThe location of San Sebastián in the cooler, northern part of Spain close to the French border ideally placed it as a summer capital alternative to Madrid.\n\n"}
{"id": "3544390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3544390", "title": "Tacheometry", "text": "Tacheometry\n\nTacheometry (; from Greek for \"quick measure\"), is a system of rapid surveying, by which the horizontal and vertical positions of points on the earth's surface relative to one another are determined without using a chain or tape, or a separate levelling instrument.\nInstead of the pole formerly employed to mark a point, a staff similar to a level staff is used. This is marked with heights from the base or foot, and is graduated according to the form of tacheometer in use. \n\nThe horizontal distance is inferred from the vertical angle included between two well-defined points on the staff and the known vertical distance between them. Alternatively, also by readings of the staff indicated by two fixed stadia wires in the diaphragm (reticle) of the telescope. The difference of height is computed from the angle of depression or elevation of a fixed point on the staff and the horizontal distance already obtained. \nThe azimuth angle is determined as formerly. Thus all the measurements requisite to locate a point both vertically and horizontally with reference to the point where the tacheometer is centred are determined by an observer at the instrument without any assistance beyond that of a man to hold the staff.\n\nThe ordinary methods of surveying with a theodolite, chain, and levelling instrument are fairly satisfactory when the ground is relatively clear of obstructions and not very precipitous, but it becomes extremely cumbersome when the ground is covered with bush, or broken up by ravines. Chain measurements then become slow and liable to considerable error; the levelling, too, is carried on at great disadvantage in point of speed, though without serious loss of accuracy. These difficulties led to the introduction of tacheometry.\n\nIn western countries, tacheometry is primarily of historical interest in surveying, as professional measurement nowadays is usually carried out using total stations and recorded using data collectors. Location positions are also determined using GNSS. Traditional methods and instruments are still in use in many areas of the world and by users who are not primarily surveyors.\n\nA \"tachymeter\" or \"tacheometer\" is a type of theodolite used for rapid measurements and determines, electronically or electro-optically, the distance to target. The principles of action are similar to those of rangefinders.\n\nOther forms of tacheometry in surveying include the use of stadia rods with theodolites or plane-table alidades. These use stadia marks on the instrument's reticle to measure the distance between two points on the stadia rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the \"stadia interval factor\". If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod.\n\nThe formula most widely used for finding the distances is:\n\nformula_1\n\nHere, formula_2 is the stadia interval (top intercept minus bottom intercept); formula_3 and formula_4 are multiplicative and additive constants. Generally, the instrument is made so that formula_5 and formula_6 exactly, to simplify calculations.\n\nAnother device used in tacheometry is the \"subtense bar\". This is a rigid rod, usually of a material insensitive to change in temperature such as invar, of fixed length (typically two metres). The subtense bar is mounted on a tripod over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a small telescope on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular to the line of sight to the angle measuring station.\n\nA theodolite is used to measure the angle between indicators on the two ends of the subtense bar. The distance from the telescope to the subtense bar is the height of an isosceles triangle formed with the theodolite at the upper vertex and the subtense bar length at its base, determined by trigonometry.\n"}

Further 3.71% of the land is situated at above sea level, and only 0.15% of Croatia's territory lies at elevations greater than above sea level. The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in Lika and Gorski Kotar areas in the Dinaric Alps, but such areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent. The Pannonian Basin and the Dinaric Alps, along with the Adriatic Basin represent major geomorphological parts of Croatia.\n\nCroatia's Adriatic Sea mainland coast is long, while its 1,246 islands and islets encompass further of coastline. The distance between the extreme points of Croatia's coastline is . The number of islands includes all islands, islets, and rocks of all sizes, including ones emerging at ebb tide only. The islands include the largest ones in the Adriatic—Cres and Krk, each covering , and the tallest—Brač, whose peak reaches above sea level. The islands include 48 permanently inhabited ones, the most populous among them being Krk and Korčula.\n\nThe shore is the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean. The majority of the coast is characterised by a karst topography, developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform. Karstification there largely began after the final uplift of the Dinarides in the Oligocene and the Miocene, when carbonate deposits were exposed to atmospheric effects, extending to the level of below present sea level, exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum. It is estimated that some karst formations are related to earlier immersions, most notably the Messinian salinity crisis. The largest part of the eastern coast consists of carbonate rocks, while flysch is significantly represented in the Gulf of Trieste coast, on the Kvarner Gulf coast opposite Krk, and in Dalmatia north of Split. There are comparably small alluvial areas of the Adriatic coast in Croatia—most notably the Neretva Delta. The western Istria is gradually subsiding, having sunk about in the past two thousand years. In the Middle Adriatic Basin, there is evidence of Permian volcanism observed in area of Komiža on the island of Vis and as volcanic islands of Jabuka and Brusnik.\n\nFormation of the Dinaric Alps is linked to a Late Jurassic to recent fold and thrust belt, itself a part of Alpine orogeny, extending southeast from the southern Alps. The Dinaric Alps in Croatia encompass the entire Gorski Kotar and Lika regions, as well as considerable parts of Dalmatia, with their northeastern edge running from Žumberak to Banovina region, along the Sava River, and their westernmost landforms being Ćićarija and Učka mountains in Istria.

The longest cave in Croatia, Kita Gaćešina, is at the same time the longest cave in the Dinaric Alps at .\n\nThe Pannonian Basin took shape through Miocenian thinning and subsidence of crust structures formed during Late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny. The Paleozoic and Mesozoic structures are visible in Papuk and other Slavonian mountains. The processes also led to formation of a stratovolcanic chain in the basin 17 – 12 Mya and intensified subsidence observed until 5 Mya as well as flood basalts about 7.5 Mya. Contemporary uplift of the Carpathian Mountains severed water flow to the Black Sea and Pannonian Sea formed in the basin. Sediment were transported to the basin from uplifting Carpathian and Dinaric mountains, with particularly deep fluvial sediments being deposited in the Pleistocene during uplift of the Transdanubian Mountains. Ultimately, up to of the sediment was deposited in the basin, and the sea eventually drained through the Iron Gate gorge.\n\nThe results of those processes are large plains in the eastern Slavonia, Baranya and Syrmia, as well as in river valleys, especially along Sava, Drava and Kupa. The plains are interspersed by the horst and graben structures, believed to break the Pannonian Sea surface as islands. The tallest among such landforms are Ivanšćica and Medvednica north of Zagreb and in Hrvatsko Zagorje as well as Psunj and Papuk which are the tallest among the Slavonian mountains surrounding Požega. Psunj, Papuk and adjacent Krndija consist mostly of Paleozoic rocks which are 350 – 300 million years old.

Tourism occurs in places, it involves movement and activities between places and it is an activity in which both place characteristics and personal self-identities are formed, through the relationships that are created among places, landscapes and people.

Much tourism management literature remains quantitative in methodology and considers tourism as consisting of the places of tourist origin (or tourist generating areas), tourist destinations (or places of tourism supply) and the relationship (connections) between origin and destination places, which includes transportation routes, business relationships and traveler motivations. Recent developments in human geography have resulted in approaches such as those from cultural geography, which take more theoretically diverse approaches to tourism, including a sociology of tourism, which extends beyond tourism as an isolated, exceptional activity and considering how travel fits into the everyday lives and how tourism is not only a consumptive of places, but also produces the sense of place at a destination. \"The Tourist\" by Dean MacCannell and \"The Tourist Gaze\" by John Urry are classics in this field.\n\n\n"}

It is also used in geodesy. Traverse networks involve placing survey stations along a line or path of travel, and then using the previously surveyed points as a base for observing the next point. Traverse networks have many advantages, including:\n\n\nThe traverse is more accurate than triangulateration (a combined function of the triangulation and trilateration practice).\n\nFrequently in surveying engineering and geodetic science, control points (CP) are setting/observing distance and direction (bearings, angles, azimuths, and elevation). The CP throughout the control network may consist of monuments, benchmarks, vertical control, etc.There are mainly two types of traverse.Traverse may be either a closed traverse or an open traverse.\n1.Closed traverse: the traverse which either originates from a station and returns to the same station completing a circuit or runs between two known stations,is called a closed traverse.\nA compound traverse is where an open traverse is linked at its ends to an existing traverse to form a closed traverse. The closing line may be defined by coordinates at the end points which have been determined by previous survey. The difficulty is, where there is linear misclosure, it is not known whether the error is in the new survey or the previous survey.\n\n\n"}
