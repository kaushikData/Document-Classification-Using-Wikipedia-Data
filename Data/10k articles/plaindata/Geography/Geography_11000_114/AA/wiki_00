The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. \n\nThe capital of an Algerian Province is called a chef-lieu. The capital of a district, the next largest division, is also called a chef-lieu. While the capital of the lowest division, the municipalities, is called agglomeration de chef-lieu (chef-lieu agglomeration) and is abbreviated as A.C.L.\n\nThe chef-lieu in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten Provinces of Belgium. Three of these cities also give their name to their province (Antwerp, Liège and Namur).\n\nLuxembourg is divided into two judicial arrondissements (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve cantons and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: \"Gemengen\").\n\nArrondissements, districts and cantons have each a chef-lieu and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.\n\nThe chef-lieu of a département is known as the \"préfecture\". This is the town or city where the prefect of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the prefecture. In every French region, one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of \"Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…\" and the city where the regional prefect is found is known as \"chef-lieu of the region\" or, more commonly, \"Regional prefecture\". The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment. \n\nThe chef-lieu of an arrondissement, commonly known as the \"sous-préfecture\" is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the sub-prefecture. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the \"Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture\", who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement. \n\nThe chef-lieu of a canton is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it. In past decades, there was always a Gendarmerie, a treasurer and a justice of the peace. \n\nThe chef-lieu of a commune is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.\n\nIn the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the administrative centres are known as \"chief towns\" or \"nahias\". Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (\"qda\"), a district (\"liwa\"), or a governorate (\"muhafazah\").\n\nThe chef-lieu indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So Nouméa is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So Wé is part of the town of Lifou, but is the chef-lieu of Lifou. In the Loyalty Islands and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.\n\nMany of the West African states which gained independence from France in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a \"Chief-Lieu\". States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include Senegal, Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, and Nigerl. \n\nTaking Niger and Mali as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu. The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of French West Africa, and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories. With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, Cercles of Mali/Departments of Niger, and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies. The \"chefs-lieux\" of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a \"High Council of Collectivites\" seated at the nation's capital. Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a \"Place\"/\"Site\" (\"Site\" in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the \"Chief-Place\" even at the lowest level.\n\nIn Russia, the term is applied to the inhabited localities, which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the republics, for which the term \"capital\" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term \"administrative centre\" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in Ukraine.\n\nThe term chef-lieu is applied to the capital of each Swiss canton. In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.\n\nThe term chef-lieu is used to designate the capital of each gouvernorat (department). Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into delegations (districts) which each have a central city as chef-lieu of delegation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom it is the centre of a local authority, which is distinct from a historic county with a county town.\n\n\n"}

It is used primarily for transportation and fishing, and it has unspoiled natural beaches that are visited by tourists. An initial area of the canal in Toamasina (unofficially and in French referred to as Tamatave) is straight, while subsequent areas have curves, lagoons, connected lakes and swamps. Construction efforts began during the era of the Merina monarchy, with major expansion during the French colonial period between 1896 and 1904, and additional expansion during 1949–1957. Construction has included the manual cutting and removal of outcrops to connect previously unconnected areas.\n\nInitial expansion and maintenance of Canal des Pangalanes during the time of the Merina monarchy (c. 1540–1897), involved cutting through outcrops to connect areas. Significant expansions of the canal were undertaken by France with the support of Joseph Gallieni during the French colonial period between 1896 and 1904 to increase trade, provide a means to supply troops that were located inland, and to provide a safe route for cargo boats destined for Toamasina compared to traveling along the coast of the Indian Ocean. By 1901, an uninterrupted canal existed between Toamasina and Andevoranto, which extended .\n\nAdditional construction from 1949 to 1957, cost over 800 million CFA francs to complete. Part of this project included the 570 million CFA franc construction of a river port at Toamasina and improvements to the canal for from Toamasina to south of Ivondro, which was completed in 1953.\n\nFurther work after World War II enabled 30-ton barges to travel between Tamatave and Vatomandry, a distance of .\n\nA study in the 1950s regarding extending the canal for an additional from Ivondro to Manakara found that the cost would have been at least 1,400 million CFA francs. This proposal was shelved, due to concerns about the high construction costs when the trade between the two areas was low relative to these costs. Population growth not attaining expected numbers in the areas during this time was a factor in the rejection of this extension. Additional objections to this expansion came from businesspeople in Toamasina and Manakara, who voiced concerns about the potential to lose trade at the port of Toamasina. Large navigation companies opposed this extension, to protect the high fees they imposed for cargo loading and unloading at auxiliary ports on the east coast.\n\nCanal des Pangalanes is used by local people: Some of them use canoes for travel and make their homes along its banks. Ferries run up and down navigable areas transporting items such as wood, charcoal, dried fish and other produce. Many local people rely upon the canal for and, for some of them, it is their only means of travel. The canal provides fish for the locals, and cassava is grown along its banks. Coffee factories exist along the canal. Some areas have white, sandy beaches.\n\nA floating museum comprising a library was established in 1999 with the University of Toamasina and the University of Fianarantsoa with the collaboration of the University of Madagascar's Museum of Art and Archaeology operated by the University of Antananarivo.\n\nAfter use of the canal decreased, a large project in the 1980s restored and renovated it. The rehabilitation project included dredging areas overrun with silt, the operation of a cargo service enabled by the purchase of a fleet of tug barges, and the construction of warehouses. By 2011 the tug barges were observed to be no longer in use and the warehouses were empty. The tug barges are stored near the pier in Toamasina, where they are rotting.\n\nAn oil refinery south of Toamasina contributes to pollution in that area of the canal, as evidenced by hyacinths covered with grey-colored slime.\n\n\n"}

The long-standing paradox was resolved when novel proxy derived temperatures showed significantly warmer tropics during past greenhouse climates. The low-gradient problem, i.e. the very warm polar regions with respect to present day, is still an issue for state-of-the-art climate models.\n\nProxy-based reconstructions of paleotemperature appeared to predict a low temperature gradient between the tropics and poles. Data from surface-dwelling foramanifera suggested that during the late Cretaceous, an unusually warm period, sea surface temperatures were cooler than today's. The term was later applied to similar situations, for example during the Eocene.\n\nClimate models which worked during the Tertiary failed to produce this low temperature gradient; in order to match the observed data, they predicted that the tropics should be 40 °C or more - much hotter than the proxies said they were, and much hotter than the tropical surface temperatures observed today, which average around 25 °C (77 °F). To attempt to match the data, bizarre models involving unreasonable eddies were required.\n\nModels were developed to predict and explain the lack of ice during the warm periods of the Cretaceous and Eocene. Models are developed according to the fundamental principle that they should be kept as simple as possible. Consequently, the first models attempted to explain the lack of ice using solely the different continental configuration. These could not produce an ice-free state without using an increased atmospheric concentration of ; this assumption was checked against the evidence and found to be valid. This introduced a new difficulty: more would produce warmer tropical sea temperatures, and the evidence suggested they were the same or even colder than today's.\n\nForaminiferal data, suggesting tropical temperatures cooler than today's, disagreed with terrestrial proxies, which spoke of warmer temperatures - although most of the terrestrial figures are based on extrapolation of data from outside the tropics.\n\nAnalytical error is around 2−3 °C for individual specimens, but this drops to 0.5−1.0 °C when a sample is analysed - not enough to explain the discrepancy. Other factors mean that any pristine sample can be considered to have an associated error of up to 3 °C. Changes in salinity, kinetic and diagenesis, can also confound analysis: the latter two are each estimated to reduce estimated temperatures by 1−2 °C, and are difficult to quantify.\n\nTaking the data to be true, how could they be reconciled with the predictions of the model? The only way the model could be \"tweaked\" was by fiddling with the parameterisation of clouds, one of the most unpredictable aspects of any model. The model was adjusted to assume that the higher levels produced more tropical cloud, shielding these regions from the sun's heat. However, there was no evidence for this behaviour, and still left problems. The poles were still \"warmer\" than the models predicted. Further feedbacks, including increased poleward heat transport by the oceans, and vegetational responses at high latitudes, were proposed, but these didn't fully explain behaviour in the southern hemisphere, and winter, respectively.\n\nData from terrestrial proxies suggested that the equator may have reached 30 °C - however, this figure is based upon extrapolation of data found outside the tropics. This would imply that the foramaniferal proxies were wrong - the tests may perhaps have been overprinted by diagenesis. Researchers turned to shallow marine molluscs as it is easy to determine whether their shells had been altered by diagenesis.\n\nMany mollusc shells are constructed from aragonite, a mineral that is quickly replaced by calcite by diagenetic alteration. Also, near-shore molluscs preserve seasonal variability in their shells, a feature that would be lost in the presence of a diagenetic signal. This removes ambiguity about whether or not a shell has been affected by post-deposition processes.\n\nEvidence from the molluscs suggested a cooling between the Eocene and Oligocene. Taken from the Mississippi embayment, they recorded temperatures of around 26 °C in the Eocene, and 22 °C in the Oligocene; this cooling was markedly seasonal, with reconstructed water temperatures being 5° cooler in the summer, but just 3° cooler in winter. This trend fits best if was the dominant force for cooling.\n\nThe winter temperatures of molluscs match well with the foramaniferal temperatures, suggesting that foramanifera predominantly grew during the winter months. The overall temperatures corresponded well with terrestrial and modelled estimates of a sea surface temperature around 4–5° warmer than today's.\n\nThe magnesium/calcium paleothermometer is a recently developed alternative to the δO method, and avoids many of the uncertainties inherent in the latter method. Use of this technique generates results more consistent with those expected, in contrast to the original δO records from the same sites. Further painstaking studies targeted solely those foraminifera which could be demonstrated not to have undergone any diagenesis in fact give a δO signature similar to that expected, suggesting that poor preservation was responsible for the original confusion.\n"}

This task, which could seem trivial, is made hugely complex by the number of countries in the world having names which begin with the letter codice_1. In September 2006, the proposal of the Serbian government to obtain the code codice_2 (Republic of Serbia) was accepted by ISO.\n\nThis code, used also as Internet TLD, was a major problem with the ISO's assignment of country codes to Serbia. All combinations of codice_1 as a first letter and any other letter in word Serbia, or even \"\" (in Serbian), are already taken by other states:\n\nThe Government of Serbia made an official request that the alpha-2 code for Serbia should be codice_2 (Republic of Serbia), but there is an ISO recommendation against any reference to the form of government in these codes. codice_2 could also be an abbreviation for the historical name of today's Serbia, Raška or Rascia which would be in full compliance with this rule (\"see .ch\"). The proposal, after an initial rejection by ISO, was accepted in September 2006.\n\nThere are at least four examples where the rule against inclusion of government form was broken (Democratic Republic of the Congo has the code codice_6, Federated States of Micronesia has the code codice_7, Switzerland has the code codice_8 that stems from country's official Latin name ', and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has the code codice_9, despite the fact that the codes codice_10 and codice_11 are available), and Serbia had good arguments for the use of the codice_2 code, because not a single one of the free codes beginning with codice_1 can be associated with it. codice_2 is also frequently used as an acronym for ', an entity of nearby Bosnia and Herzegovina; this is not a conflict but adds the potential for confusion. Other solutions could have been \"generic\" codice_15 or codice_16, although codice_15 was likely to be avoided for its association with the Nazi \"\".\n\nAs this code is also to be used as Internet top-level domain for the country, there had been rumours of approaching either International Organization for Standardization, United Nations or one of the countries in the list in order to switch the codes.\n\nNegotiating the purchase or usage of the .sj Internet domain reserved for Svalbard and Jan Mayen was not a plausible option as Norway, which administers this (through UNINETT Norid), has a policy of not commercializing or disposing of this domain.\n\nAlso, as codice_18 is a historic code for Serbia, it was hinted that the country could pursue talks with Solomon Islands, the current owner of that code. However, it is worth noting that since ISO 3166-1 requires that a code is unused for five years before it can be re-used, this may not be possible even with the consent of the ISO and the previous holder, as users of the standard may object.\n\nA choice between the English mnemonic codice_19 or the Serbian codice_20 was the main issue with the alpha-3 code. A possible compromise between the two, codice_21, was also mentioned. (codice_20 should be immediately recognizable by speakers of most European languages, including English, though.)\n\nThe Institute for Standardization of Serbia, in line with the proposed alpha-2 code (codice_23), decided that codice_24 should be the alpha-3 code for Serbia. The logic of this proposal was unclear, since this decision had not been elaborated by the Institute. However, the decision resulted in a public outcry and was amended by the Government of Serbia, which proposed codice_20 for the alpha-3 code. This was accepted by the ISO in September 2006.\n\nAlthough one would presume that countries take on the shortest code possible (by rule the same as their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), that is not the case. Thus, the \"attractive\" codice_26 and codice_18 are available for Serbia, as Suriname uses codice_28, while the Solomon Islands are identified by codice_29.\n\nIronically, codice_20 had been advertised by the press as the likely solution — even though the Kingdom of Serbia used codice_18 from 1911 to 1919, when it was replaced by codice_32, followed by codice_33, codice_34 and codice_35. Abbreviation codice_1 was taken by Sweden the same year, making it unavailable for Serbia, despite being one of the first 17 countries in the world to be assigned this code.\n\nDespite that codice_18 and codice_26 are available for this purpose, official government bodies and the media are still maintaining the claim that the international license plate code for Serbia should (and could only) be its ISO-3166-1 alpha-3 code, codice_20.\n\nSerbia will keep the telephone country calling code previously assigned to Serbia and Montenegro, +381. Following the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the country code +38 was divided amongst the newly independent states:\n\nTwo other codes from the 38 sequence have also been assigned:\n\nMontenegro was assigned +382 on 6 September 2006. The new code was phased in during 2007.\n\nThis code is used for national currency, in this case the Serbian dinar. This three-letter code is composed of, by rule, first two letters of the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and a third letter is initial of the currency itself: codice_40. Exceptions from the rule are made only in the third letter, if that suits the country better — however that is not the case here.\n\n"}

The type locality are the famous \"Flaming Cliffs\", locally known as \"Bayanzag\" (\"rich in \"Haloxylon\"\") or \"Ulaan-Ereg\" (\"red cliffs\").\n\nIt preserves an arid habitat of sand dunes, with little freshwater apart from oases and arroyos. In fact, the present-day climate at most Djadochta Formation sites differs little from what it was some 80 mya, except by being somewhat warmer and perhaps a bit less arid then. This is testimony to the fact that the location has long been so far from any major source of evaporation that little rainfall reached it, even before the Himalayas were uplifted which bar clouds from reaching today's Gobi desert.\n\nMost notable fossil discoveries have been the first confirmed dinosaur eggs (a clutch, probably of \"Oviraptor\") and several dinosaur finds, \"Protoceratops\", \"Pinacosaurus\" and \"Velociraptor\" being the most prominent.\nThe fauna of the Djadochta Formation is very similar in composition to the nearby Bayan Mandahu Formation.

{"id": "656700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=656700", "title": "Grossglockner", "text": "Grossglockner\n\nThe Grossglockner (; or just \"Glockner\" is, at 3,798 metres above the Adriatic (12,461 ft), the highest mountain in Austria and the highest mountain in the Alps east of the Brenner Pass. It is part of the larger Glockner Group of the Hohe Tauern range, situated along the main ridge of the Central Eastern Alps and the Alpine divide. The Pasterze, Austria's most extended glacier, lies on the Grossglockner's eastern slope.\n\nThe characteristic pyramid-shaped peak actually consists of two pinnacles, the \"Grossglockner\" and the Kleinglockner (, from German: \"groß\", \"big\", \"klein\", \"small\"), separated by the \"Glocknerscharte\" col.\n\nThe name \"Glocknerer\" is first documented in a 1561 map designed by the Viennese cartographer Wolfgang Lazius. The denotation \"Glogger\" is mentioned a 1583 description of the Tyrolean Kals legal district, then referring to the whole ridge south of the Alpine main chain. In the 1760s, the \"Atlas Tyrolensis\" listed a \"Glockner Berg\", the prefix \"Gross-\" (\"great\") is not mentioned before the first expedition in 1799.\n\nAccording to the scholar Belsazar Hacquet (1735–1815), \"Glockner\" is possibly derived from German: \"Glocke\" (\"bell\"), referring to the mountain's characteristic shape. It may also be a Germanised version of the Alpine Slavic word \"Klek\" (\"mountain\"), as maintained in the Slovene name \"Veliki Klek\".\n\nThe Grossglockner lies on the border between the Austrian states of Carinthia and Tyrol (East Tyrol). The peak is part of the \"Glocknerkamm\" ridge in the Glockner Group that branches off the main chain of the Alps at Mt. Eiskögele, heading in a southeasterly direction and forming the boundary between the East Tyrolean municipality of Kals am Großglockner, about in the southwest at , and Carinthian Heiligenblut, about in the northeast at . This boundary is also the watershed between the Kals Valley and its Teischnitz and Ködnitz side valleys on the Tyrolean side and the Möll Valley with the Pasterze glacier on the Carinthian side. The region around the mountain has formed part of the Grossglockner-Pasterze special protected area within the High Tauern National Park since 1986.\n\nThe Glockner is the highest mountain in the Alps east of the Ortler range, about away, and, after Mont Blanc, has the second greatest topographic isolation of all mountains in the Alps. Even its topographic prominence, at , is the second highest after Mont Blanc in the entire Alps (see the list of Alpine peaks by prominence). That makes it one of the most independent peaks in the Alps. The view from the Grossglockner summit is one of the farthest of all mountains in the Eastern Alps. It ranges out to or, taking account of atmospheric refraction, almost . Its view over more than of the earth's surface reaches as far as the Upper Swabian Plateau in the northwest, to Regensburg and the peaks of the Bohemian Forest in the north, to Mt. Ortler in the west, to the Padan Plain in the south, and to Mt. Triglav and the Totes Gebirge range in the east.\n\nThe Grossglockner rock summit, due to its high Alpine, heavily glaciated appearance, is often compared to the mountains of the Western Alps. Together with the Kleinglockner to the southeast it forms a distinctive double peak. There are differing views in the literature as to whether the Kleinglockner is a subpeak or a separate main summit. Due to its low topographic prominence and isolation as well as its close links in climbing history, it is counted as part of that of the Grossglockner in historic publications; however, in view of its separate climbing routes it is counted as an independent peak in mountaineering literature.\n\nThe \"Obere Glocknerscharte\" between the two peaks, at , is the highest col in Austria, from which a couloir up to 55° in gradient and in altitude descends down to the \"Glocknerkees\" glacier, called \"Pallavicinirinne\" after the Austrian mountaineer Alfred von Pallavicini (1848–1886). It runs northeastwards and borders on the Northeast and North Faces of the Grossglockner. The latter faces are bounded by the Northwest Ridge, part of the main Glockner crest, which runs over the \"Grögerschneid\", , and the ridge elevations of Glocknerhorn, , and Teufelshorn, , to the \"Untere Glocknerscharte\", , which connects to the high Glocknerwand.\n\nA prominent ridge, the \"Stüdlgrat\", named after the Prague Alpinist Johann Stüdl (1839–1925), runs from the Grossglockner away to the southwest. Together with its extension, the \"Luisengrat\", it separates the West Face and the \"Teischnitzkees\" glacier at its foot from the South Face and its \"Ködnitzkees\" glacier. A couloir known as the \"Pillwaxrinne\" crosses the South Face below the Obere Glocknerscharte; most of the South Face lies east of this gully below the Kleinglockner. The east side of the Kleinglockner, the \"Glocknerleitl\", is glaciated to just below the summit and is continued by the \"Kleinglocknerkees\" and \"Hofmannskees\" before reaching the Pasterze.\n\nThe history of the climbs started with French-born natural scientist Belsazar Hacquet, from 1773 professor of anatomy at the Academy of Ljubljana. He travelled the Eastern Alps from 1779 to 1781 and published an itinerary in 1783, describing the \"Glokner\" mountain and stating that it had not been climbed yet. He estimated the mountain's height with converted and left an engraving illustrating Grossglockner and Pasterze, the first known depiction of the mountain.\n\nInspired by Hacquet's book and the first ascent of the Mont Blanc in 1786, the Gurk prince-bishop Count Franz Xaver of Salm (1749–1822) together with his vicar general Sigismund Ernst Hohenwart (1745–1825) and Baron Franz Xaver von Wulfen (1728–1805) started efforts for a Grossglockner expedition. They engaged two peasants from Heiligenblut as mountain guides to do the first explorations for an ascent through the Leitertal valley, which is the side of Grossglockner with the least ice (people feared glaciers in these times). These valiant men, called \"Glockners\" in the records, did more than they were ordered to do - and probably reached the Kleinglockner summit on 23 July 1799.\n\nOne month later the bishop's expedition started: a mountain hut (the first Salm Hut) had been built and the path in the Leitertal valley was prepared so that the bishop could use a horse to reach it. 30 people, among them Salm, Hohenwart and Wulfen, were part of the expedition. They suffered with bad weather and a first effort failed, but on 25 August 1799 Hohenwart and at least four other people, including the two \"Glockners\", reached - again - the Kleinglockner, where they installed one of the first summit crosses (one of the main goals of the church expedition). Hohenwart's reports did not tell clearly that they had not touched the highest point but Bishop Salm (who had reached the \"Adlersruhe\" rock at ) was informed. Dissatisfied, he invited another, even bigger expedition the next year.\n\nOn 28 July 1800, 62 people, among them the pedagogue Franz Michael Vierthaler and the botanist David Heinrich Hoppe, started again into the Leitertal valley. Four peasants and carpenters (the \"Glockners\" and two others who are not known) did a track in the snow, had installed fixed ropes at some steeper sections up to the end of the Glocknerleitl, and even built a second refuge, called Hohenwarte Hut. The vanguard reached the Kleinglockner peak, however, according to the expedition records by the Dellach priest Franz Joseph Horasch (Orasch), only the four guides and Mathias Hautzendorfer, the local priest of the Rangersdorf parish, were able to cross the \"Obere Glocknerscharte\" and climb the Grossglockner summit. Hautzendorfer had to be persuaded to venture the step and administered the last rites in advance. \n\nThe two \"Glockners\" are usually identified as the brothers Joseph (\"Sepp\") and Martin Klotz, however, this surname is not listed in the Heiligenblut parish register. A local peasant named Sepp Hoysen is documented as a member of the second Grossglockner expedition in 1802, and the surveyor Ulrich Schiegg mentioned one Martin Reicher as \"Glockner\" guide. The peasants and several other members of the expedition (among them Schiegg and his young apprentice Valentin Stanič, who climbed Mt. Watzmann for the first time some weeks later) did the ascent again the next day and finally installed the summit cross and a barometer on the Grossglockner summit.\n\nBishop Salm undertook two more ascents in 1802 (with Hohenwart reaching the summit) and in 1806, however, he himself never climbed beyond the \"Adlersruhe\" rock. The climbing of the Grossglockner was also described by the botanist Josef August Schultes, who explored the massif together with Count Apponyi in 1802. No further ascents were made during the Napoleonic Wars, the huts decayed and were plundered by locals. In the following \"Vormärz\" era, however, the mountain became a popular venue for Alpinists like Hermann and Adolf Schlagintweit, who all followed the route of the first ascent.\n\nBy the mid 19th century, the developing Alpine tourism began to alter the traditional agriculture economy in the Heiligenblut area. Therefore, the people of Kals tried to lay out a straight ascent from the western side, which however was not reached until Julius von Payer explored the ridge between \"Glöcknerleitl\" and \"Ködnitzkees\" in 1863. Johann Stüdl had a via ferrata erected along the southwestern ridge the next year and the \"Stüdlhütte\" erected at its foot in 1868. Already in 1869, most expeditions to the summit started in Kals. The first winter ascent of the Grossglockner was made on January 2, 1875 by William Adolf Baillie Grohman, a member of the Alpine Club. In 1876 Count Pallavicini and his guide Hans Tribusser undertook the first expedition up the steep glaciated Northeast Face, chopping 2,500 steps into the \"Pallavicinirinne\" in an ice climbing master stroke not repeated for 23 years.\n\nIn 1879 Count Pallavicini dedicated a new iron summit cross on the occasion of the silver wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and Empress Elisabeth; both had visited Heiligenblut and walked to the present-day \"Franz-Josefs-Höhe\" viewpoint in 1865. The cross was installed on 2 October 1880. Pallavicini also had the Archduke John Hut erected at the former \"Adlersruhe\" resting place of Bishop Salm, today the highest situated mountain hut in Austria. The Austrian Alpine Club built the new \"Salmhütte\" and the \"Glocknerhaus\" along the alpine route from Heiligenblut.\n\nA first ascent by skiing was made in 1909 and the circumnavigation of the massif soon became a popular ski mountaineering tour. The Grossglockner became Austria's highest mountain, when the South Tyrolean Ortler region had to be ceded to the Kingdom of Italy according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, which promoted its reputation as a tourist attraction.\n\nMass tourism was decisively promoted by the scenic High Alpine Road (\"Großglockner-Hochalpenstraße\") running from Heiligenblut to Bruck in Salzburg with a branch-off to the \"Franz-Josefs-Höhe\" viewpoint. It was built across the historic Hochtor Pass of the Alpine divide between 1930 and 1935 according to plans designed by engineer Franz Wallack. The pass road, Austria's highest, reaches , and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country (second after Schönbrunn Palace) with about 270,000 vehicles and 900,000 visitors every year, about 50 million since its opening.\n\n\nComputer-generated virtual panoramas\n"}
{"id": "2220844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220844", "title": "Hide (unit)", "text": "Hide (unit)\n\nThe hide was an English unit of land measurement originally intended to represent the amount of land sufficient to support a household. It was traditionally taken to be , but was in fact a measure of value and tax assessment, including obligations for food-rent ('), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army ('), and (eventually) the \"\" land tax. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the Norman Conquest of England, the hidage assessments were recorded in the Domesday Book and there was a tendency for land producing £1 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe hide was divided into 4 yardlands or virgates. It was hence nominally equivalent in area to a carucate, a unit used in the Danelaw.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon word for a hide was \"hid\" (or its synonym \"hiwisc\"). Both words are believed to be derived from the same root \"hiwan\", which meant \"family\".\n\nBede in his Ecclesiastical History (c.731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, \"terra x familiarum\" meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work \"hid\" or \"hiwan\" is used in place of \"terra ... familiarum\". Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his household or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.\n\nCharles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman, to whom Stenton referred as \"the independent master of a peasant household\".\n\nHides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (\"miles\") of the empire. In 807 it was specified that in the region west of the Seine, for example, a vassal who held four or five hides was responsible for showing up to a muster in person, fully equipped for war. Three men who each possessed one hide, though, merely were grouped such that two of them were responsible for equipping the third, who would go to war in their name. Those holding half-hides were responsible for readying one man for every group of six. This came about as a way of ensuring that the liege took to the field with a fully equipped and provisioned force.\n\nIn early Anglo-Saxon England, the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of food rent (known as \"feorm\") due from a village or estate and it became the unit on which all public obligations were assessed, including in particular the maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications and the provision of troops for manning the defences of a town or for the defence force known as the 'fyrd'. For instance, at one period, five hides were expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep.\n\nA land tax known as geld was first levied in 990 and this became known as the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already existing system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the geld, which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the geld was raised as required.\n\nThe hide was a measure of value rather than a measurement of area, but the logic of its assessment is not easy to understand, especially as assessments were changed from time to time and not always consistently. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was a measure of 'the taxable worth of an area of land', but it had no fixed relationship to its area, the number of ploughteams working on it, or its population; nor was it limited to the arable land on an estate. According to Bailey, \"It is a commonplace that the hide in 1086 had a very variable extent on the ground; the old concept of 120 acres cannot be sustained.\" Many details of the development of the system during the 350 years which elapsed between the time of Bede and the Domesday Book remain obscure. According to Sir Frank Stenton, \"Despite the work of many great scholars the hide of early English texts remains a term of elusive meaning.\" The fact that assessments consistently tended to be made in units of 5 hides or multiples of 5 hides goes to show that we are not speaking of fixed or even approximate acreages and this applies not only to the 11th century but to charters of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\nNevertheless, the hide became the basis of an artificial system of assessment of land for purposes of taxation, which lasted for a long period. The most consistent aspect of the hide is described as follows by Dr Sally Harvey (referring particularly to Domesday Book): \"Both Maitland and Vinogradoff long ago noticed that there was a general tendency throughout Domesday for a hide of land to be worth £1, or, put another way,for land producing £1 of income to be assessed at one hide.\"\n\nA number of early documents referring to hides have survived, but these can only be seen as steps in the development of the concept of the hide and do not enable us to see the full story.\n\nThe document known as the Tribal Hidage is a very early list thought to date possibly from the 7th century, but known only from a later and unreliable manuscript. It is a list of tribes and small kingdoms owing tribute to an overlord and of the proportionate liability or quota imposed on each of them. This is expressed in terms of hides, though we have no details as to how these were arrived at nor how they were converted into a cash liability.\n\nThe Burghal Hidage (early 10th century) is a list of boroughs giving the hide assessments of neighbouring districts which were liable to contribute to the defence of the borough, each contributing to the maintenance and manning of the fortifications in proportion to the number of hides for which they answered.\n\nThe County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each county was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, Northamptonshire was assigned 3,200 hides, while Staffordshire was assigned only 500. This number was then divided up between the hundreds in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown.\n\nThe hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or manors, usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.\n\nAs each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible.\n\nThe Norman kings, after the Conquest, continued to use the system which they found in place. Geld was levied at intervals on the existing hidage assessments. In 1084, William I laid an exceptionally heavy geld of six shillings upon every hide. At the time the value of the hide was approximating twenty shillings a year, and the price of an ox was two shillings. Thus the holder of a hide had a tax burden equivalent to three of his oxen and close upon one-third of the annual value of his land. A more normal rate was 2 shillings on each hide.\n\nDomesday Book, recording the results of the survey made on the orders of William I in 1086, states in hides (or carucates or sulungs as the case might be) the assessed values of estates throughout the area covered by the survey. Usually it gives this information for 1086 and 1066, but some counties were different and only showed this information for one of those dates. By that time the assessments showed many anomalies. Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066 and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.\n\nSometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the demesne land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it. Dr Sally Harvey has suggested that the ploughland data in Domesday Book was intended to be used for a complete re-assessment but, if so, it was never actually made. The Pipe Rolls, where they are available, show that levies were based largely on the old assessments, though with some amendments and exemptions.\n\nThe last recorded levy was for 1162-3 during the reign of Henry II, but the tax was not formally abolished and Henry II thought of using it again between 1173 and 1175. The old assessments were used for a tax on land in 1193-4 to raise money for King Richard's ransom.\n\nA hide was usually made up of four virgates although exceptionally Sussex had eight virgates to the hide. A similar measure was used in the northern Danelaw, known as a carucate, consisting of eight bovates, and Kent used a system based on a \"sulung\", consisting of four yokes, which was larger than the hide and on occasion treated as equivalent to two hides. These measures had a different origin, signifying the amount of land which could be cultivated by one plough team as opposed to a family holding, but all later became artificial fiscal assessments.\n\nIn some counties in Domesday Book (e.g. Cambridgeshire), the hide is sometimes shown as consisting of 120 acres (30 acres to the virgate), but as Darby explains: \"The acres are, of course, not units of area, but geld acres, i.e. units of assessment\". In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one-third () of 2 shillings—that is, 8 pence—though his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.\n\n\nMuch work has been done investigating the hidation of various counties and also in attempts to discover more about the origin and development of the hide and the purposes for which it was used, but without producing many clear conclusions which would help the general reader.

The Shatt al-Arab is now the point where the rivers drain out, east of the Khawr Abd Allah. As it extends northwestward into Iraq, it changes its name to Khawr az-Zubayr, at the location of Umm Qasr. From this point it links by canal again to the northwest and into the Tigris and Euphrates proper. It forms the northeast coastline of Jazirat Bubiyan and the north coastline of Jazirat Warbah. Both of these islands are officially Kuwait, however Iraq does claim them.\n\nIt has also lent its name to the maritime Khawr Abd Allah Protocols, Kor Abd Allah or KAA Interoperability Protocols first developed by the British Royal Navy between March and June 2008 during the British command of Combined Task Force 158 in close co-operation with Kuwaiti and Iraqi senior naval personnel and government advisers.\n\nThe non-legally binding KAA Interoperability Protocols were developed and mediated between the heads of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies by then, Major David Hammond Royal Marines, the British naval barrister and legal advisor to CTF 158. David Hammond is now the CEO of the UK charity Human Rights at Sea and separately independently practices law as an English barrister.\n\nThe Protocols included the production of the KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart by Major Hammond and which was subsequently distributed to both countries, having been produced by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. On November 11, 2008, the KAA Protocols were historically signed at Kuwait Naval Base having been verbally agreed on board on 8 May 2008. The signing meeting saw the first formal meeting of the heads of respective navies since before the 1991 Gulf War. Subsequently, the success of the non-legally binding protocols was reported to the US Congress on January 9, 2009 in the Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq Report. The detail of the text of the KAA Interoperability Protocols has now been made available open source over the internet from leaked US diplomatic documents.\n\nMore recently the former Head of the Kuwaiti Navy, Major-General Ahmad Yousef Al-Mulla, was invited to speak at the United Kingdom's Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) in London on February 1, 2012 on the topic of the Khor Abdallah waterway as part of a lecture covering Kuwaiti-Iraqi maritime boundary interactions and future relations. The lecture was introduced by Lord Astor of Hever John Astor, 3rd Baron Astor of Hever, the United Kingdom government's Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Ministry of Defense) and the Commandant Royal College of Defence Studies Vice Admiral Charles Style. It was also attended by representatives of the Iraqi embassy in London.\n\n"}

He had no deep bond with Querétaro other than that he married Maria Dolores Najera who had spent much part of his childhood in Querétaro. He was a journalist, editor, playwright and poet Imperial, Ex-Prefect of Querétaro. He died in Mexico on October 20, 1889.\n\nManuel Gutiérrez de Salcedo y Gomez was born in Mexico City in 1818 and had no deep bond with deep bond with Querétaro, except, perhaps, having married Dona Maria Dolores Najera, who had spent much of his childhood in the Estado. Nevertheless, Don Manuel peacefully ruled the Department for nearly two years.Se was a quiet season: all allowed to assume that the Empire would be strengthened, since the resistance of the Republicans had been relegated to distant regions north of the country. Almost nothing disturbed the peaceful bucolic living queretanos. to the extent that one of the main events of those years was nothing more than a gossip of the court.\n\nAs in any monarchy, the offspring that the emperors could have was a constant concern. Since Maximilian and Carlota had no children, the Emperor decided to consolidate his dynasty through the adoption of a Mexican prince and, with curious logically chose Agustin de Iturbide and Green, grandson of the first Emperor of Mexico. He was son of Don Angel de Iturbide, that child still had taken refuge in Philadelphia after the shooting of his father and an Anglo-Saxon commoner, Alice Green. The only condition put Maximilian for adoption was that the new prince agreed to remove his name that second name, and thereafter the child Iturbide became heir to the throne.\n\nThe queretana society seems to have accepted without too much trouble its new status as imperial subject: his daily life continued without major setbacks, the same as its distractions. The famous diva Angela Peralta debuted with great success at the Teatro Iturbide, a function dedicated to Emperador. At the same time, the French officers gave a resounding Spanish dance at the Casino, that would be remembered for many years. Even tranquility became such that queretanos found commenting, as the main event in many months, the fire at the house of Don Timoteo Fernández de Jáuregui, who burned furiously for several hours; the site where he was met since as the Portal Quemado. A most moving event was the execution of General José María Ateaga in Uruapan, on 21 October 1865. The news deeply affected the queretanos, who view it as their lucky paper as governor of his state, and sadness the news deeply affected the queretanos, who view it as their lucky role as governor of his state, and sadness said despite the general died as a guerrilla, pawning their stubborn fight against the Empire.\n\nDuring the government of Manuel Gutierrez Queretana Society of Geography and Statistics, she was founded on April 23, 1865, with the aim that it studies related to agriculture and the environment in the region were made. This society was, of course, a subsidiary of the Society of Geography and Statistics that worked in Mexico City.\n\nHowever, the idyllic life of society queretana soon came to an end. Instead of consolidating, the Empire became weaker every day and could not overcome the many problems that acosaban. When the withdrawal of French troops was announced was evident to all that the day was clear to everyone that the days of Maximiliano were contados. Manuel Gutierrez resigned on 3 September 1866 and left the government in charge of his secretary, Jose Antonio Septién and Villaseñor. Years later, his son Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera become famous as one of the leading modernist poets. Shortly after, 1889 died in Mexico City; his son six years later in 1895 also in Mexico City.\n"}

{"id": "432174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=432174", "title": "Mulch", "text": "Mulch\n\nA mulch is a layer of material applied to the surface of soil. Reasons for applying mulch include conservation of soil moisture, improving fertility and health of the soil, reducing weed growth and enhancing the visual appeal of the area.\n\nA mulch is usually, but not exclusively, organic in nature. It may be permanent (e.g. plastic sheeting) or temporary (e.g. bark chips). It may be applied to bare soil or around existing plants. Mulches of manure or compost will be incorporated naturally into the soil by the activity of worms and other organisms. The process is used both in commercial crop production and in gardening, and when applied correctly, can dramatically improve soil productivity.\n\nMany materials are used as mulches, which are used to retain soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and for aesthetics. They are applied to the soil surface, around trees, paths, flower beds, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, and in production areas for flower and vegetable crops. Mulch layers are normally or more deep when applied.\n\nThey are applied at various times of the year depending on the purpose. Towards the beginning of the growing season, mulches serve initially to warm the soil by helping it retain heat which is lost during the night. This allows early seeding and transplanting of certain crops, and encourages faster growth. As the season progresses, mulch stabilizes the soil temperature and moisture, and prevents the growing of weeds from seeds. In temperate climates, the effect of mulch is dependent upon the time of year they are applied and when applied in fall and winter, are used to delay the growth of perennial plants in the spring or prevent growth in winter during warm spells, which limits freeze thaw damage.\n\nThe effect of mulch upon soil moisture content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between the soil and the atmosphere preventing sunlight from reaching the soil surface, thus reducing evaporation. However, mulch can also prevent water from reaching the soil by absorbing or blocking water from light rains.\n\nIn order to maximise the benefits of mulch, while minimizing its negative influences, it is often applied in late spring/early summer when soil temperatures have risen sufficiently, but soil moisture content is still relatively high. However, permanent mulch is also widely used and valued for its simplicity, as popularized by author Ruth Stout, who said, \"My way is simply to keep a thick mulch of any vegetable matter that rots on both sides of my vegetable and flower garden all year long. As it decays and enriches the soils, I add more.\"\n\nPlastic mulch used in large-scale commercial production is laid down with a tractor-drawn or standalone layer of plastic mulch. This is usually part of a sophisticated mechanical process, where raised beds are formed, plastic is rolled out on top, and seedlings are transplanted through it. Drip irrigation is often required, with drip tape laid under the plastic, as plastic mulch is impermeable to water.\n\nMaterials used as mulches vary and depend on a number of factors. Use takes into consideration availability, cost, appearance, the effect it has on the soil—including chemical reactions and pH, durability, combustibility, rate of decomposition, how clean it is—some can contain weed seeds or plant pathogens.\n\nA variety of materials are used as mulch:\n\nIn some areas of the United States, such as central Pennsylvania and northern California, mulch is often referred to as \"tanbark\", even by manufacturers and distributors. In these areas, the word \"mulch\" is used specifically to refer to very fine tanbark or peat moss.\n\nOrganic mulches decay over time and are temporary. The way a particular organic mulch decomposes and reacts to wetting by rain and dew affects its usefulness.\n\nSome mulches such as straw, peat, sawdust and other wood products may for a while negatively affect plant growth because of their wide carbon to nitrogen ratio, because bacteria and fungi that decompose the materials remove nitrogen from the surrounding soil for growth. However, whether this effect has any practical impact on gardens is disputed by researchers and the experience of gardeners. Organic mulches can mat down, forming a barrier that blocks water and air flow between the soil and the atmosphere. Vertically applied organic mulches can wick water from the soil to the surface, which can dry out the soil. Mulch made with wood can contain or feed termites, so care must be taken about not placing mulch too close to houses or building that can be damaged by those insects. Some mulch manufacturers recommend putting mulch several inches away from buildings.\n\nCommonly available organic mulches include:\n\n\n\nHowever peat bogs are a valuable wildlife habitat, and peat is also one of the largest stores of carbon (in Britain, out of a total estimated 9952 million tonnes of carbon in British vegetation and soils, 6948 million tonnes carbon are estimated to be in Scottish, mostly peatland, soils), so gardeners who wish to protect the environment will choose more sustainable alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome organic mulches are colored red, brown, black, and other colors. Isopropanolamine, specifically 1-Amino-2-propanol or DOW™ monoisopropanolamine, may be used as a pigment dispersant and color fastener in these mulches. Types of mulch which can be dyed include: wood chips, bark chips (barkdust) and pine straw. Colored mulch is made by dyeing the mulch in a water-based solution of colorant and chemical binder. When colored mulch first entered the market, most formulas were suspected to contain toxic, heavy metals and other contaminates. Today, “current investigations indicate that mulch colorants pose no threat to people, pets or the environment. The dyes currently used by the mulch and soil industry are similar to those used in the cosmetic and other manufacturing industries (i.e., iron oxide),” as stated by the Mulch and Soil Council. Colored mulch can be applied anywhere non-colored mulch is used (such as large bedded areas or around plants) and features many of the same gardening benefits as traditional mulch, such as improving soil productivity and retaining moisture. As mulch decomposes, just as with non-colored mulch, more mulch may need to be added to continue providing benefits to the soil and plants. However, if mulch is faded, spraying dye to previously spread mulch in order to restore color is an option.\n\nMulch normally smells like freshly cut wood, but sometimes develops a toxicity that causes it to smell like vinegar, ammonia, sulfur or silage. This happens when material with ample nitrogen content is not rotated often enough and it forms pockets of increased decomposition. When this occurs, the process may become anaerobic and produce these phytotoxic materials in small quantities. Once exposed to the air, the process quickly reverts to an aerobic process, but these toxic materials may be present for a period of time. If the mulch is placed around plants before the toxicity has had a chance to dissipate, then the plants could very likely be damaged or killed depending on their hardiness. Plants that are predominantly low to the ground or freshly planted are the most susceptible, and the phytotoxicity may prevent germination of some seeds.\n\nIf sour mulch is applied and there is plant kill, the best thing to do is to water the mulch heavily. Water dissipates the chemicals faster and refreshes the plants. Removing the offending mulch may have little effect, because by the time plant kill is noticed, most of the toxicity is already dissipated. While testing after plant kill will not likely turn up anything, a simple pH check may reveal high acidity, in the range of 3.8 to 5.6 instead of the normal range of 6.0 to 7.2. Finally, placing a bit of the offending mulch around another plant to check for plant kill will verify if the toxicity has departed. If the new plant is also killed, then sour mulch is probably not the problem.\n\nGroundcovers are plants which grow close to the ground, under the main crop, to slow the development of weeds and provide other benefits of mulch. They are usually fast-growing plants that continue growing with the main crops. By contrast, cover crops are incorporated into the soil or killed with herbicides. However, live mulches also may need to be mechanically or chemically killed eventually to prevent competition with the main crop.\n\nSome groundcovers can perform additional roles in the garden such as nitrogen fixation in the case of clovers, dynamic accumulation of nutrients from the subsoil in the case of creeping comfrey (\"Symphytum ibericum\"), and even food production in the case of \"Rubus tricolor\".\n\nOwing to the great bulk of mulch which is often required on a site, it is often impractical and expensive to source and import sufficient mulch materials. An alternative to importing mulch materials is to grow them on site in a \"mulch garden\" - an area of the site dedicated entirely to the production of mulch which is then transferred to the growing area. Mulch gardens should be sited as close as possible to the growing area so as to facilitate transfer of mulch materials.\n\nSufficient mulch over plants will destroy them, and may be more advantageous than using herbicide, cutting, mowing, pulling, raking, or tilling. The higher the temperature that this \"mulch\" is composted, the quicker the reduction of undesirable materials. \"Undesirable materials\" may include living seed, plant \"trash\", as well as pathogens such as from animal feces, urine (e.g. hantavirus), fleas, lice, ticks, etc.\n\nIn some ways this improves the soil by attracting and feeding earthworms, and adding humus. Earthworms \"till\" the soil, and their feces are among the best fertilizers and soil conditioners.\n\nUrine may be toxic to plants if applied to growing areas undiluted. See Compost ingredients: Human Waste.\n\nPolypropylene mulch is made up of polypropylene polymers where polyethylene mulch is made up of polyethylene polymers. These mulches are commonly used in many plastics. Polyethylene is used mainly for weed reduction, where polypropylene is used mainly on perennials. This mulch is placed on top of the soil and can be done by machine or hand with pegs to keep the mulch tight against the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil. Ultimately this can reduce the amount of work a farmer may have to do, and the amount of herbicides applied during the growing period. The black and clear mulches capture sunlight and warm the soil increasing the growth rate. White and other reflective colours will also warm the soil, but they do not suppress weeds as well. This mulch may require other sources of obtaining water such as drip irrigation since it can reduce the amount of water that reaches the soil. This mulch needs to be manually removed at the end of the season since when it starts to break down it breaks down into smaller pieces. If the mulch is not removed before it starts to break down eventually it will break down into ketones and aldehydes polluting the soil. This mulch is technically biodegradable but does not break down into the same materials the more natural biodegradable mulch does.\n\nQuality biodegradable mulches are made out of plant starches and sugars or polyester fibers. These starches can come from plants such as wheat and corn. These mulch films may be a bit more permeable allowing more water into the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil. Ultimately this can reduce the amount of herbicides used and manual labor farmers may have to do throughout the growing season. At the end of the season these mulches will start to break down from heat. Microorganisms in the soil break down the mulch into two components, water and CO2, leaving no toxic residues behind. This source of mulch is even less manual labor since it does not need to be removed at the end of the season and can actually be tilled into the soil. With this mulch it is important to take into consideration that it's much more delicate than other kinds. It should be placed on a day which is not too hot and with less tension than other synthetic mulches. These also can be placed by machine or hand but it is ideal to have a more starchy mulch that will allow it to stick to the soil better.\n\n\n"}

While Western gardeners enjoy experimenting with a wide range of different plants, Japanese gardeners achieve variety through training and shaping a relatively limited set of plants.\n\nTrees play a key role in the gardens and landscapes of Japan as well as being of important spiritual and cultural significance to its people.

When the Federal Government made a Proclamation of Emergency in response to the unrest, it unilaterally limited the territorial waters of the Borneo states to three nautical miles. The ownership of the remaining territorial waters were transferred to the Federal Government. In 1974, the Federal Government transferred its territorial waters ownership to Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) through the enactment of the Petroleum Development Act 1974. The then chief minister of Sarawak, Abdul Rahman Ya'kub was one of the signatories of this agreement. Among others, the act allowed PETRONAS to regulate the oil and gas industry in Malaysia, and explore mineral resources in both the states. Petronas also gain control over the oil and gas reserves in Sarawak. The revenues from oil and gas will be divided among oil-producing states (5 percent), federal government (5 percent), producer company (41 percent), and Petronas (49 percent).\n\nIn 2011, the 1969 Proclamation of Emergency (along with the 1966 & 1977 Proclamations of Emergency) proclamation was lifted which nullified Emergency Ordinances and measures authorised by these proclamations, including the three nautical miles limitation. The Territorial Sea Act 2012 was introduced to limit the territorial waters to three nautical miles limit through an Act of Parliament. Zainnal Ajamain, a political analyst, claimed that the payment of oil royalty to Sarawak is limited to 10 percent according to the Federal Constitution. However, it was argued that the article stipulated in the Federal Constitution only deals with the eligibility of the state of charging duty exports if the state oil royalty is less than 10 percent.\n\nIn 2008, the federal government of Malaysia announced that it had no plans of revising oil royalty rates for Sabah and Sarawak. In 2012, chief minister of Sarawak Abdul Taib Mahmud started a private negotiation with federal government regarding the Sarawak oil royalty. In 2014, Sarawak State Legislative Assembly passed a motion to ask for 20% oil royalty from the federal government. Since then, subsequent chief ministers of Sarawak had been trying to gain more autonomy for oil and gas rights in Sarawak. In May 2015, Petronas agreed to supply cheaper natural gas to Sarawak Energy for power generation. In December 2015, Sarawak state assembly passed another motion that rejects the 2012 Territorial Sea Act; because according to Article 2 of the Constitution of Malaysia, the federal government of Malaysia has no rights to change the state boundaries without the consent of the respective state governments.\n\nIn August 2016, following a retrenchment exercise by Petronas on Sarawakian workers, the Sarawak chief minister Adenan Satem had threatened to freeze the work permits of non-Sarawakians Petronas workers in the state. However, soon after that, the issue was resolved after Petronas agreed to offer more jobs for the Sarawak people. As of May 2017, Sarawak was still negotiating with Petronas for an increase in oil royalty to 20%.\n\nIn June 2017, the Chief Minister of Sarawak, Abang Johari Openg, announced that Sarawak will establish a state-owned oil and gas exploration company. On 4 July 2017, Abang Johari announced that the petroleum company would be 100 percent owned by Sarawak and will work with Petronas on an equal basis. It was eventually formed in August 2017. The Sarawak government aimed to have Petros in operation by the first quarter of 2018 and become an active player in the oil & gas industry by 2020. Sarawak government then sent a legal team to the United Kingdom to search for additional supporting documents regarding the rights of Sarawak in the Malaysian agreement. Among them are Sarawak (Alteration of Boundaries) Order 1954 by the Queen in Council, which stated that Sarawak boundary covers way beyond the three nautical miles. In November 2017, Sarawak has formed a special task force to negotiate with Petronas regarding the return of Sarawak oil and gas rights. Sarawak was unwilling to resort to court action to nullify the Territorial Sea Act and Petronas dominance on Sarawak waters so as to preserve the good relationship between the federal and state government.\n\nIn February 2018, Abang Johari questioned the validity of the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. This was because the Act was passed during the Emergency Proclamation period from 1969 to 2011. The Emergency Proclamation was abolished in 2011. This raises questions that whether the Petroleum Development Act would cease to become effective after 2011. He also stated that the Petroleum Development Act does not exclude laws such as Sarawak Oil Mining Ordinance 1958 which stated that only Sarawak has the right to issue mining licenses for oil production. In April 2018, the chief minister also announced that under Oil Mining Ordinance 1958 and Gas Distribution Ordinance 2016, Petronas would need to apply mining license from Petros to operate in Sarawak waters by 1 July 2018. Abang Johari also claimed that under the Item 2(c) of the State List, Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution, Petros is able to exercise its rights on Sarawak waters. Petronas had welcomed Petros into the oil and gas mining scene as long as Petros acted within the framework of Malaysian Petroleum Development Act, 1974. However, the opposition politicians in Sarawak casted doubts on whether Sarawak has truly regained its oil and gas rights without making any amendments to the existing laws in the country. In April 2018, the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan offered a 20% oil royalty deal for Sarawak government if the former wins the federal power in 2018 Malaysian general election, however, Sarawak refused to sign it because it has no legal standing.\n\nAfter 2018 Malaysian general election, Malaysian federal government changed hands. On 22 May 2018, Petronas responded to Sarawak state attorney-general that it disagrees that Petronas need to apply license from Petros to operate in Sarawak waters. On 4 June 2018, Petronas filed a suit in the Federal Court of Malaysia in order to assert its position as the exclusive owner of Malaysian oil resources (including Sarawak) and the 1974 Petroleum Development Act is still valid. On 22 June 2018, the federal court of Malaysia denied Petronas application to start legal proceedings against Sarawak because the case is not within the jurisdiction of the federal court. On 10 July 2018, Sarawak state assembly passed the Oil Mining (Amendment) Bill (2018) in order to regulate oil and gas activities in the state. All oil and gas companies operating in Sarawak waters would be given grace period until the end of 2019 to comply with Oil Mining Ordinance (OMO) 1958.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, the Chief Minister's Office announced the five members of the inaugural Board of Directors:-\n\nOn 21 September 2017 PETROS launched an advertisement to hire a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for itself, after announcing earlier that month that they wanted to hire a local CEO. PETROS' chairperson announced that the oil & gas company received over 40 applications from Sarawakians to fill the vacancy. As at 17 January 2018, the position is yet to be filled. On 8 March 2018, Chief Minister Abang Johari announced that Saau Kakok will be appointed as PETROS' first CEO. This followed months of speculation and search.\n\nBy 8 November 2017, advertisements to hire Human Resource Manager (HRM), Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) started appearing on job boards.\n\nIn January 2018, PETROS signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Petrotel Energy Oman LLC to \"explore the possibility of co-operation to develop the downstream sector of oil and gas industries in Sarawak”.\n"}

Then later he fixed it with the approval of Russian Tzar.\n\nStrahlenberg was born in Stralsund, which then belonged to Sweden, and his original name was Philip Johan Tabbert. He joined the Swedish army in 1694 and was promoted captain in 1703. In 1707, he was ennobled and took the name von Strahlenberg. \n\nTaking part in the Great Northern War, he was captured by the victorious Russian forces during the Battle of Poltava in 1709. As a prisoner of war, he was sent to Tobolsk, where he lived from 1711 to 1721. During this time, he studied the geography of Siberia and the anthropology, languages and customs of its native tribes. After returning to Stockholm in 1730, he published his book \"Das Nord- und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia\" (\"North and Eastern Parts of Europe and Asia\") with the results of his studies. The book was well received and soon translated into English, French and Spanish.\n\nAs part of his book, Strahlenberg and Johan Anton von Matérn drew new maps of all of Russia - a formidable task in itself. He also suggested a new border between the continents of Europe and Asia in Russian territory. This border follows the peaks of the Urals, then branches off westwards along a minor mountain range, follows the hilly west bank of Volga river downstream to the 49th degree of latitude and Don river thereon to the Black Sea. Vasily Tatischev claimed that it was at his suggestion that Strahlenberg adopted the idea. See Boundaries between continents for the current political and geographical debates about the Europe-Asia border.\n\nStrahlenberg's book also extensively deals with the languages and customs of the Tatars, Yakuts, Chuvash, Crimean Tatars, Uzbeks, Bashkirs, Kyrgyz, Turkmen Tatars and Mongols. He also compiled and published a Kalmyk-German dictionary, subsequently issued with French and English translations. In writing about the shamanic rituals of the indigenous peoples of Siberia, he noted their use of the fly agaric mushroom (\"Amanita muscaria\").\n\nIn his later years, Strahlenberg wrote an extensive two-volume treatise on the history of Russia, which was published in French translation as \"Description Historique de l'Empire Russien\" (\"Historical Description of the Russian Empire\") in 1757.\n\nThe asteroid (15766) Strahlenberg is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

The denomination fruticulture—introduced from Romance languages (from Latin \"fructus\" and \"cultura\")—is also used.\n\nPomological research is mainly focused on the development, enhancement, cultivation and physiological studies of fruit trees. The goals of fruit tree improvement include enhancement of fruit quality, regulation of production periods, and reduction of production cost. One involved in the science of pomology is called a pomologist.\n\nPomology has been an important area of research for centuries.\n\nDuring the mid-19th century in the United States, farmers were expanding fruit orchard programs in response to growing markets. At the same time, horticulturists from the USDA and agricultural colleges were bringing new varieties to the United States from foreign expeditions, and developing experimental lots for these fruits. In response to this increased interest and activity, USDA established the Division of Pomology in 1886 and named Henry E. Van Deman as chief pomologist. An important focus of the division was to publish illustrated accounts of new varieties and to disseminate research findings to fruit growers and breeders through special publications and annual reports. During this period Andrew Jackson Downing and his brother Charles were prominent in Pomology and Horticulture, producing \"The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America\" (1845).\n\nThe introduction of new varieties required exact depiction of the fruit so that plant breeders could accurately document and disseminate their research results. Since the use of scientific photography was not widespread in the late 19th Century, USDA commissioned artists to create watercolor illustrations of newly introduced cultivars. Many of the watercolors were used for lithographic reproductions in USDA publications, such as the \"Report of the Pomologist\" and the \"Yearbook of Agriculture\".\n\nToday, the collection of approximately 7,700 watercolors is preserved in the National Agricultural Library's Special Collections, where it serves as a major historic and botanic resource to a variety of researchers, including horticulturists, historians, artists, and publishers..\n\nThe study of pomology has somewhat dwindled over the past century..\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27556949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27556949", "title": "Portuguese India Armadas", "text": "Portuguese India Armadas\n\nThe Portuguese India Armadas (\"Armadas da Índia\") were the fleets of ships, organized by the crown of the Kingdom of Portugal and dispatched on an annual basis from Portugal to India, principally Goa. These armadas undertook the Carreira da Índia (\"India Run\"), following the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope first opened up by Vasco da Gama in 1497–1499.\n\nFor a long time after its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the sea route to India via the Cape of Good Hope was dominated by the Portuguese India armada – the annual fleet dispatched from Portugal to India. Between 1497 and 1650, there were 1033 departures of ships at Lisbon for the \"Carreira da Índia\" (\"India Run\").\n\nThe India armada typically left Lisbon and each leg of the voyage took approximately six months. The critical determinant of the timing was the monsoon winds of the Indian Ocean. The monsoon was a southwesterly wind (i.e. blew from East Africa to India) in the summer (between May and September) and then abruptly reversed itself and became a northeasterly (from India to Africa) in the winter (between October and April). The ideal timing was to pass the Cape of Good Hope around June–July and get to the East African middle coast by August, just in time to catch the summer monsoon winds to India, arriving around early September. The return trip from India would typically begin in January, taking the winter monsoon back to Lisbon along a similar route, arriving by the summer (June–August). Overall, the round trip took a little over a year, minimizing the time at sea.\n\nThe critical step was ensuring the armada reached East Africa on time. Ships that failed to reach the equator latitude on the East African coast by late August would be stuck in Africa and have to wait until next Spring to undertake an Indian Ocean crossing. And then they would have to wait in India until the Winter to begin their return. So any delay in East Africa during those critical few weeks of August could end up adding an entire extra year to a ship's journey.\n\nThe circumnavigation of Madagascar opened an alternative route to get to India, which gave more flexibility in timing. The rule that quickly emerged was that if an outbound armada doubled the Cape of Good Hope before mid-July, then it should follow the old \"inner route\" – that is, sail into the Mozambique Channel, up the East African coast until the equator latitude (around Malindi, Seychelles), then take the southwesterly monsoon across the ocean to India. If, however, the armada doubled the Cape after mid-July, then it was obliged to sail the \"outer route\" – that is, strike out straight east from South Africa, go under the southern tip of Madagascar, and then turn up from there, taking a northerly path through the Mascarenes islands, across the open ocean to India. While the outer route did not have the support of African staging posts and important watering stops, it sidestepped sailing directly against the post-summer monsoon.\n\nReturn fleets were a different story. The principal worry of the return fleets was the fast dangerous waters of the inner Mozambican channel, which was particularly precarious for heavily loaded and less maneuverable ships. In the initial decades, the return fleet usually set out from Cochin in December, although that was eventually pushed forward to January. January 20 was the critical date, after which all return fleets were obliged to follow the outer route (east of Madagascar) which was deemed calmer and safer for their precious cargo. That meant they missed the important watering stop on Mozambique island on the return leg and had to put in elsewhere later, such as Mossel Bay or St. Helena. Between 1525 and 1579, \"all\" return fleets were ordered to follow the outer route. This rule was temporarily suspended between the 1570s and 1590s. From 1615, a new rule was introduced whereby return fleets from Goa were allowed to use the inner route, but return fleets from Cochin still had to use the outer route. With the entry of Dutch and English competition in the 1590s, the start of the return legs were delayed until February and March, with the predictable upsurge in lost and weather-delayed ships.\n\nArrival times in Portugal varied, usually between mid-June and late August. It was customary for return fleets to send their fastest ship ahead to announce the results in Lisbon, before the rest of the fleet arrived later that summer.\n\nBecause of the timing, an armada had to leave Lisbon (February–April) before the previous year's armada returned (June–August). To get news of the latest developments in India, the outgoing armada relied on notes and reports left along the way at various African staging posts by the returning fleet.\n\nPortuguese India armadas tended to follow the same outward route. There were several staging posts along the route of India Run that were repeatedly used.\n\nSetting out from Lisbon (February–April), India-bound naus took the easy Canary Current straight southwest to the Canary Islands. The islands were owned by Castile and so this was not a usual watering stop for the Portuguese India naus, except in emergencies.\n\nThe first real obstacle on the route was the Cape Verde peninsula (Cap-Vert, Senegal), around which the Canary Current ends and the equatorial drift begins. Although not difficult to double, it was a concentration point of sudden storms and tropical cyclones, so ships were frequently damaged. (see Cape Verde-type hurricane)\n\nThe Cape Verde islands, to the west of Cape Verde peninsula was the usual first stop for India ships. Relative scarcity of water and supplies on the islands made this a suboptimal stop. Nonetheless, the islands (esp. Santiago) served as a harbor against storms and was frequently a pre-arranged point for the collection and repair of tempest-tossed ships.\n\nThe \"Angra de Bezeguiche\" (Bay of Dakar, Senegal) was a common watering stop for ships after doubling Cape Verde. The shores were controlled by Wolof and Serer kingdoms, whose relations with the Portuguese were ambivalent, so a warm reception on the mainland could not always be counted on. In the middle of the bay was the island of Gorée (\"ilha de Bezeguiche\"), a safe anchoring spot, but the island itself lacked drinkable water. As a result, ships frequently watered and repaired at certain mainland points along the Petite Côte of Senegal shore such as \"Rio Fresco\" (now Rufisque) and \"Porto de Ale\" (now Saly-Portudal). It was not unheard of for India naus to water much further south, e.g. among the many inlets and islands (e.g. Bissagos) along the African coast to \"Serra Leoa\" (Sierra Leone).\n\nBelow Cape Verde, around the latitudes of Sierra Leone, begin the Atlantic doldrums – that is a calm low pressure region on either side of the equator with little or no winds. At this time of year, the doldrums belt usually ranged between 5° N and 5° S. In the southern hemisphere, below the doldrums, was the counter-clockwise gyre of the South Atlantic and the southeasterly trade winds, which prevented sailing directly southeast to the Cape.\n\nPassing the doldrums was a navigational challenge, and pilots had to avail themselves deftly of the currents and every little breeze they could get to stay on course. The usual tactic was to proceed south or even southeast along the West African coast as long as possible, until the doldrums hit (usually around Sierra Leone), then to strike southwest sharply, drift over the doldrums and then catch the South Equatorial Current (top arm of the South Atlantic gyre) towards the coast of Brazil. This was usually referred to as following the \"volta do mar\" (literally, 'turn of the sea', i.e. the South Atlantic gyre).\n[The \"volta do mar\" was usually contrasted to the \"rota da Mina\" (Mina route). The latter meant striking \"southeast\" in the doldrums to catch the Equatorial Counter Current (or 'Guinea Current') east into the Gulf of Guinea. This was the usual route to the fort of São Jorge da Mina on the Portuguese Gold Coast. This was \"not\" part of the India run. The route from Mina down to South Africa involved tacking \"against\" the southeasterly trade winds and the contrary Benguela Current, a particularly tiresome task for heavy square rigged carracks. However, it sometimes happened that by poor piloting, India naus would be inadvertently caught by the Guinea counter-current and forced to take that route, but such ships would not be likely to reach India that year.]\n\nAssuming the India armada successfully caught the south equatorial current of the \"volta do mar\", the armada would drift southwest through the doldrums and reach the southbound Brazil Current off the coast of Brazil (around Pernambuco). Although India naus did not usually stop in Brazil, it was not unheard of to put in a brief watering stop at Cape Santo Agostinho (Pernambuco, Brazil), especially if the southeasterly trade winds were particularly strong (pilots had to be careful not to allow themselves to be caught and driven backwards).\n\nFrom the environs of Pernambuco, the India naus sailed straight south along the Brazil Current, until about the latitude of the Tropic of Capricorn, visibly the Abrolhos islands or the Trindade and Martim Vaz islands, where they began to catch more favorable prevailing westerlies. These would take them quickly straight east, across the South Atlantic, to South Africa.\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope – once aptly named the 'cape of storms' – was a very challenging headland on the India Run. The outbound crossing was always difficult, and many a ship was lost here. Larger armadas often broke up into smaller squadrons to attempt the crossing, and would re-collect only on the other side – indeed quite far on the other side. There was usually no stop or collection point after the Cape crossing until well inside the Mozambique Channel. The reason for this is that outbound ships tried to steer clear from the South African coast, to avoid the rushing waters of the contrary Agulhas Current.\n\nThe exception was the \"Agoada de São Brás\" (Mossel Bay, South Africa), a watering stop after the Cape. It was not always used on the outbound journey since individual ships often charted wide routes around the Cape, and sighted coast again only well after this point. However, ships damaged during the crossing frequently had no choice but to put in there for emergency repairs. Trade for food supplies with the pastoral Khoikhoi peoples that lived in the area was frequent (although there were also occasional skirmishes). São Brás was a more frequent stop on the return journey, as a place to repair the ships to tip-top shape before doubling the Cape the other way. As a result, particularly in early years, São Brás was used as a postal station, where messages from the returning armadas would be left for the outward armadas, reporting on the latest conditions in India.\n\nIf the armada went by the 'inner route', then the next daunting obstacle was Cape Correntes, at the entrance of the Mozambique Channel. Treacherously fast waters, light winds alternating with unpredictably violent gusts, and treacherous shoals and rocks made this cape particularly dangerous. It is estimated that nearly 30% of all ships lost on the India Run, capsized or ran aground around here, more than any other place.\n\nThe ideal passage through the Mozambique Channel would be to sail straight north through the middle of the channel, where a steady favorable wind could be relied upon at this season. But this was a particularly hard task in an era where longitude was determined largely by dead reckoning. If a pilot miscalculated and charted a course too close to the African coast, the current ran south, the winds were light or non-existent, subject to arbitrary gusts from strange directions and the coasts littered with shoals. Into this dreaded mix, Cape Correntes added its own special terror to the experience. The Cape was not only a confluence point of opposing winds, creating unpredictable whirlwinds, it also produced a strange and extraordinarily fast southerly current, violent enough to break a badly-sewn ship, and confusing enough to throw all reckoning out the window and lure pilots into grievous errors.\n\nThe temptation would be to err in the opposite direction, and keep on pushing east until the island of Madagascar was sighted, then move up the channel (the current here ran north), keeping the Madagascar coast in sight at all times. Although a Madagascar-hugging route cleared up the longitude problem, it was also abundant in fearful obstacles – coral islets, atolls, shoals, protruding rocks, submerged reefs, made for a particularly nerve-wracking experience to navigate, especially at night or in bad weather.\n\nTo avoid the worst consequences of doubling Cape Correntes, India ships stayed as far from the African coast as possible but not so close to Madagascar to run into its traps. To find the ideal middle route through the channel, pilots tended to rely on two dangerous longitude markers – the Bassas da India and the Europa rocks. Although conveniently situated in the middle of the channel, they were not always visible above the waves, so sailors often watched for hovering clusters of seabirds, which colonized these rocks, as an indicator of their location. Unfortunately, this was not a reliable method, and many an India ship ended up crashing on those rocks.\n\nIf they succeeded sailing up the middle channel, the India naus usually saw African coast again only around the bend of Angoche. If the ships were in a bad shape, they could stop at the Primeiras Islands (off Angoche) for urgent repairs. The Primeiras are a long row of uninhabited low coral islets – not much more than mounds above the waves – but they form a channel of calm waters between themselves and the mainland, a useful shelter for troubled ships.\nThe scheduled stop was a little further north on Mozambique Island, a coral island off the coast, with two outlying smaller islands (\"São Jorge\" and \"Sant' Iago\"). Mozambique's main attribute was its splendid harbor, that served as the usual first stop and collection point of Portuguese India armadas after the crossing of the Cape of Good Hope. The island had a town and a fortress, so some stock of supplies was usually at hand.\n\nThe conditions of the ships by the time they reached Mozambique was often quite woeful. Notice that with the occasional exception of Cape Santo Agostinho and Mossel Bay, there are no stops between Cape Verde and Mozambique Island, an extraordinarily long time for 16th-century ships to remain at sea without repairs, watering or resupply. Already before the Cape, provisions had grown stale, scurvy and dysentery had often set in, and deaths of crews and passengers from disease had begun. The ship itself, so long at sea without re-caulking or re-painting, was in a fragile state. To then force the miserable ship through the mast-cracking tempests of Cape of Good Hope, the seam-ripping violent waters of Cape Correntes and the treacherous rocks of the channel, turned this final stage into a veritable hell for all aboard.\n\nMozambique Island was originally an outpost of the Kilwa Sultanate, a collection of Muslim Swahili cities along the East African coast, centered at Kilwa, that formed a Medieval commercial empire from Cape Correntes in the south to the Somali borderlands in the north, what is sometimes called the \"Swahili Coast\". The Kilwa Sultanate began disintegrating into independent city-states around the time of the Portuguese arrival (1500), a process speeded along by the intrigues and interventions of Portuguese captains.\n\nThe original object of Portuguese attentions had been the southerly Swahili city of Sofala, the main outlet of the Monomatapa gold trade, and the first Portuguese fortress in East Africa was erected there in 1505 (Fort São Caetano de Sofala). But Sofala's harbor was marred by a long moving sandbank and hazardous shoals, making it quite unsuitable as a stop for the India armadas. So in 1507, the 9th Portuguese India Armada (Mello, 1507) seized Mozambique Island and erected a fortress there (Fort São Gabriel, later replaced by Fort São Sebastião in 1558), simply because its spacious and well-sheltered harbor was so much more preferable.\nThe principal drawback was that Mozambique Island was parched and infertile. It produced practically nothing locally, it even had to ferry drinkable water by boat from elsewhere. Replenishing the islands was not a simple matter. Although Mozambique islanders had established watering holes, gardens and coconut palm groves (essential for timber) just across on the mainland (at \"Cabaceira\" inlet), the Bantu inhabitants of the area were generally hostile to both the Swahili and the Portuguese, and often prevented the collection of supplies. So ensuring Mozambique had sufficient supplies presented its own challenges. The Portuguese factors in Mozambique had to ensure enough supplies were shipped in from other points on the East African coast to Mozambique Island before the armada's scheduled arrival. The Mozambican factor also collected East African trade goods that could be picked up by the armadas and sold profitably in Indian markets – notably gold, ivory, copper, pearls and coral.\n\nAfter Mozambique, the rule for the India armadas was generally to continue sailing north until they reached the equator latitude (the Seychelles islands, at 4ºS, were a common reference point). It was around here that the all-important southwesterly monsoon winds began to pick up. The armada would then just sail east, and let the monsoon carry them headlong across the Indian Ocean until India. That is presuming the armada arrived at the equator sometime in August.\n\nIn Pimentel's (1746) estimation, ships \"must\" leave Mozambique before August 25 to avail themselves of the summer monsoon. If, however, the armada arrived in the latter part of the season, say September, turning at the equator was a risky route. The southwesterly monsoon may be blowing in the right direction at the moment, but the ship ran the risk of not reaching a safe Indian port before the monsoon reversed direction (usually around late September to early October, when it became a northeasterly). So a late season ship was usually stuck in Africa until next April.\n\nNotice that the trajectory, as described, skips over nearly all the towns on the East African coast north of Mozambique – Kilwa (\"Quíloa\"), Zanzibar, Mombasa (\"Mombaça\"), Malindi (\"Melinde\"), Barawa (\"Brava\"), Mogadishu (\"Magadoxo\"), etc. This is not to say Portuguese did not visit those locations – indeed, some even had Portuguese factories and forts (e.g. Fort Santiago in Kilwa, held from 1505 to 1512). But Portuguese armadas on their way to India did not have to stop at those locations, and so usually did not. The stop on Mozambique island was usually the only necessary one.\nNonetheless, if it had time, or got into trouble for some reason, the stopping choice was Malindi. A Portuguese ally from the earliest trip of Vasco da Gama in 1498, Malindi could usually be counted on to give a warm reception and had plenty of supplies. Unlike most other Swahili towns, Malindi was on the mainland and had an ample hinterlands with fertile cultivated fields, including groves of oranges and lemons (critical to combat scurvy). The problem was that Malindi didn't really have a suitable harbor. Although waters were kept calm by an offshore reef, the anchorage area was littered with shoals. It did, however, have a peculiar protruding rock that served as a decent natural pier for loading and unloading goods.\n\nMalindi's other advantage was that, at 3º15'S, it was practically at exactly the right latitude to catch the southwesterly monsoon for an Indian Ocean crossing. Plenty of experienced Indian Ocean pilots – Swahili, Arab or Gujurati – could be found in the city, and Malindi was likely to have the latest news from across the sea. So it was a very convenient stop for the Portuguese before a crossing. However, stops take time. Given the imminent monsoon reversal, that was a scarce commodity. So if the armada had been decently equipped enough at Mozambique island, a stop at Malindi, however delightful or useful, was a rather unnecessary and risky expenditure of time.\n\nWith the monsoon, Portuguese India armadas usually arrived in India in early September (sometimes late August). Because of the wind pattern, they usually made landfall around Anjediva island (\"Angediva\"). From there, the armada furled their square sails and proceed with lateen sails south along the Malabar coast of India to the city of Cochin (\"Cochim\", Kochi) in Kerala. Cochin was the principal spice port accessible to the Portuguese, it had the earliest Portuguese factory and fort in India, and served as the headquarters of Portuguese government and operations in India for the first decades. However, this changed after the Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510. The capture of Goa had been largely motivated by the desire to find a replacement for Anjediva as the first anchoring point for the armadas. Anjediva had proven itself to be far from ideal. The island was generally undersupplied – it contained only a few fishing villages – but the armada ships were often forced to sojourn there for long periods, usually for repair or to await for better winds to carry them down to Cochin. Anjediva island also lay in precarious pirate-infested waters, on the warring frontier between Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijaynagar, which frequently threatened it. The same winds which carried the armada down to Cochin prevented Portuguese squads from Cochin racing up to rescue it. The Portuguese had tried setting up a fort in Anjediva, but it was captured and dismantled by forces on behalf of Bijapur. As a result, the Portuguese governor Afonso de Albuquerque decided the nearby island-city of Goa was preferable and forcibly seized it in 1510. Thereafter Goa, with its better harbor and greater supply base, served as the first anchorage point of Portuguese armadas upon arriving in India. Although Cochin, with its important spice markets, remained the ultimate destination, and was still the official Portuguese headquarters in India until the 1530s, Goa was more favorably located relative to Indian Ocean wind patterns and served as its military-naval center. The docks of Goa were soon producing their own carracks for the India run back to Portugal and for runs to further points east.\n\nThe return voyage was shorter than the outbound. The fleet left India in December, picking up the northeast monsoon towards the African coast. Passing through the Mozambique Channel, the fleet kept close to land to avoid the westerlies and catch the Agulhas Current to round the Cape of Good Hope. Once in the Atlantic, it caught the southeast trade winds and sailed to the west of Ascension and Saint Helena as far as the doldrums. The fleet then sailed almost straight north to the Azores, where it caught the prevailing westerlies and sailed due west into Lisbon.\n\nThe size of the armada varied, from enormous fleets of twenty-something ships, to small fleets of only four or five. This changed over time. In the first decade (1500–1510), when the Portuguese were establishing themselves in India, the armadas averaged around 15 ships per year. This declined to around 9–10 ships in 1510–1525. From 1526 to the 1540s, the armadas declined further to 7–8 ships per year, with a few exceptional cases of large armadas (e.g. 1533, 1537, 1547) brought about by military exigency, but also several years of exceptionally small fleets. In the second half of the 16th century, the Portuguese India armada stabilized at 5–6 ships annually, with very few exceptions (rose above seven only in 1551 e 1590 and below 4 only in 1594 and 1597).\n\nOrganization was principally in the hands of the \"Casa da Índia\", the royal trading house established around 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal. The Casa was in charge of monitoring the crown monopoly on India trade – receiving goods, collecting duties, assembling, maintaining and scheduling the fleets, contracting private merchants, correspondence with the \"feitorias\" (overseas factories), drafting documents and handling legal matters.\n\nSeparately from the \"Casa\", but working in coordination with it, was the \"Armazém das Índias\", the royal agency in charge of nautical outfitting, that oversaw the Lisbon docks and naval arsenal. The Armazém was responsible for the training of pilots and sailors, ship construction and repair, and the procurement and provision of naval equipment – sails, ropes, guns, instruments and, most importantly, maps. The \"piloto-mor\" ('chief pilot') of the Armazém, in charge of pilot-training, was, up until 1548, also the keeper of the \"Padrão Real\", the secret royal master map, incorporating all the cartographic details reported by Portuguese captains and explorers, and upon which all official nautical charts were based. The screening and hiring of crews was the function of the \"provedor\" of the Armazém.\nFrom at least 1511 (perhaps earlier), the offices of the Casa da India were based in the ground floor of the royal Ribeira Palace, by the Terreiro do Paço in Lisbon, with the Armazém nearby. (Neither the Casa nor the Armazem should be confused with the \"Estado da Índia\", the Portuguese colonial government in India, which was separate and reported directly to the monarch.)\n\nShips could be and sometimes were owned and outfitted by private merchants, and these were incorporated into the India armada. However, the expenses of outfitting a ship were immense, and few native Portuguese merchants had the wherewithal to finance one, despite eager government encouragement. In the early India runs, there are several ships organized by private consortiums, often with foreign capital provided by wealthy Italian and German trading houses. This fluctuated over time, as the royal duties, costs of outfitting and rate of attrition and risk of loss on India runs were sometimes too high for private houses to bear. Private Portuguese merchants did, however, routinely contract for cargo, carried aboard crown ships for freight charges.\n\nMarine insurance was still underdeveloped, although the Portuguese had helped pioneer its development and its practice seemed already customary. \n\nThe ships of an India armada were typically carracks (\"naus\"), with sizes that grew over time. The first carracks were modest ships, rarely exceeding 100-tonnes, carrying only up to 40–60 men, e.g. the \"São Gabriel\" of Gama's 1497 fleet, one of the largest of the time, was only 120t. But this was quickly increased as the India run got underway. In the 1500 Cabral armada, the largest carracks, Cabral's flagship and the \"El-Rei\", are reported to have been somewhere between 240t and 300t. The \"Flor de la Mar\", built in 1502, was a 400t nau, while at least one of the naus of the Albuquerque armada of 1503 is reported to have been as large as 600t. The rapid doubling and tripling of the size of Portuguese carracks in a few years reflected the needs of the India runs. The rate of increase tapered off thereafter. For much of the remainder of the 16th century, the average carrack on the India run was probably around 400t.\n\nIn the 1550s, during the reign of John III, a few 900t behemoths were built for India runs, in the hope that larger ships would provide economies of scale. The experiment turned out poorly. Not only was the cost of outfitting such a large ship disproportionately high, they proved unmaneouverable and unseaworthy, particularly in the treacherous waters of the Mozambique Channel. Three of the new behemoths were quickly lost on the southern African coast – the \"São João\" (900t, built 1550, wrecked 1552), the \"São Bento\" (900t, built 1551, wrecked 1554) and the largest of them all, the \"Nossa Senhora da Graça\" (1,000t, built 1556, wrecked 1559).\n\nThese kind of losses prompted King Sebastian to issue an ordinance in 1570 setting the upper limit to the size of India naus at 450t. Nonetheless, after the Iberian Union of 1580, this regulation would be ignored and shipbuilders, probably urged on by merchants hoping to turn around more cargo on every trip, pushed for larger ships. The size of India naus accelerated again, averaging 600t in the 1580–1600 period, with several spectacularly large naus of 1500t or greater making their appearance in the 1590s.\n\nIf the lesson was not quite learned then, it was certainly learned in August, 1592, when English privateer Sir John Burroughs (alt. Burrows, Burgh) captured the \"Madre de Deus\" in the waters around the Azores islands. The \"Madre de Deus\", built in 1589, was a 1600t carrack, with seven decks and a crew of around 600. It was the largest Portuguese ship to go on an India run. The great carrack, under the command of Fernão de Mendonça Furtado, was returning from Cochin with a full cargo when it was captured by Burrough. The value of the treasure and cargo taken on this single ship is estimated to have been equivalent to half the entire treasury of the English crown. The loss of so much cargo in one swoop confirmed, once again, the folly of building such gigantic ships. The carracks built for the India run returned to their smaller ideal size after the turn of the century.\nIn the early \"Carreira da India\", the carracks were usually accompanied by smaller caravels (\"caravelas\"), averaging 50t–70t (rarely reaching 100t), and capable of holding 20–30 men at most. Whether lateen-rigged (\"\") or square-rigged (\"redonda\"), these shallow-drafted, nimble vessels had a myriad of uses. Caravels served as forward lamp, scouts and fighting ships of the convoy. Caravels on the India run were often destined to remain overseas for coastal patrol duty, rather than return with the main fleet.\n\nIn the course of the 16th century, caravels were gradually phased out in favor of a new escort/fighting ship, the galleon (\"galeão\"), which could range anywhere between 100t and 1000t. Based on the design of the carrack, but slenderer and lower, with forecastle diminished or removed to make way for its famous 'beak', the galleon became the principal fighting ship of the India fleet. It was not as nimble as the caravel, but could be mounted with much more cannon, thus packing a bigger punch. With the introduction of the galleon, carracks became almost exclusively cargo ships (which is why they were pushed to such large sizes), leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons. One of the largest and most famous of Portuguese galleons was the \"São João Baptista\" (nicknamed \"Botafogo\", 'spitfire'), a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534, said to have carried 366 guns.\n\nMany fleets also brought small supply ships on outward voyage. These were destined to be scuttled along the way once the supplies were consumed. The crews were redistributed and the abandoned ships usually burned to recover their iron nails and fittings.\n\nAverage speed of an India Armada was around 2.5 knots, but some ships could achieve speeds of between 8 and 10 for some stretches.\n\nPortuguese India ships distinguished themselves from the ships of other navies (especially those of rival powers in the Indian Ocean) on two principal accounts: their seaworthiness (durability at sea) and their artillery.\n\nWith a few exceptions (e.g. \"Flor de la Mar\", \"Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai\"), Portuguese India naus were not typically built to last longer than four or five years of useful service. That a nau managed to survive a single India run was already an achievement, given that few ships of any nation at the time were able to stay at sea for even a quarter as long without breaking apart at the seams.\n\nThe success of the India nau depended on 15th-century innovations in Portuguese shipbuilding that greatly improved the seaworthiness and longevity of the ship. Notable among these were the use of iron nails (rather than wooden pegs) to hold planks, the mixing of lead in the seams, and a caulking technique that improved upon traditional oakum with 'galagala' paste (a mixture of oakum, lime and olive oil, producing a kind of putty that could be pressed between the planks). Hulls were amply coated in pitch and pine tar (imported in bulk amounts from northern Germany), giving the India naus their famous (and, to some observers, sinister) dark tone.\n\nNaval artillery was the single greatest advantage the Portuguese held over their rivals in the Indian Ocean – indeed over most other navies – and the Portuguese crown spared no expense in procuring and producing the best naval guns European technology permitted.\n\nKing John II of Portugal, while still a prince in 1474, is often credited for pioneering the introduction of a reinforced deck on the old Henry-era caravel to allow the mounting of heavy guns. In 1489, he introduced the first standardized teams of trained naval gunners (\"bombardeiros\") on every ship, and development of naval tactics that maximized broadside cannonades rather than the rush-and-grapple of Medieval galleys.\n\nThe Portuguese crown appropriated the best cannon technology available in Europe, particularly the new, more durable and far more accurate bronze cannon developed in Central Europe, replacing the older, less accurate wrought-iron cannon. By 1500, Portugal was importing vast volumes of copper and cannon from northern Europe, and had established itself as the leading producer of advanced naval artillery in its own right. Being a crown industry, cost considerations did not curb the pursuit of the best quality, best innovations and best training. The crown paid wage premiums and bonuses to lure the best European artisans and gunners (mostly German) to advance the industry in Portugal. Every cutting-edge innovation introduced elsewhere was immediately appropriated into Portuguese naval artillery – that includes bronze cannon (Flemish/German), breech-loading swivel-guns (prob. German origin), truck carriages (possibly English), and the idea (originally French, c. 1501) of cutting square gun ports (\"portinhola\") in the hull to allow heavy cannon to be mounted below deck.\n\nIn this respect, the Portuguese spearheaded the evolution of modern naval warfare, moving away from the Medieval warship, a carrier of armed men, aiming for the grapple, towards the modern idea of a floating artillery piece dedicated to resolving battles by gunnery alone.\n\nAccording to Gaspar Correia, the typical fighting caravel of Gama's 4th Armada (1502) carried 30 men, four heavy guns below, six falconets (\"falconete\") above (two fixed astern) and ten swivel-guns (\"canhão de berço\") on the quarter-deck and bow.\n\nAn armed carrack, by contrast, had six heavy guns below, eight falconets above and several swivel-guns, and two fixed forward-firing guns before the mast. Although an armed carrack carried more firepower than a caravel, it was much less swift and less manoeuvrable, especially when loaded with cargo. A carrack's guns were primarily defensive, or for shore bombardments, whenever their heavier firepower was necessary. But by and large, fighting at sea was usually left to the armed caravels. The development of the heavy galleon removed even the necessity of bringing carrack firepower to bear in most circumstances.\n\nAccording to historian Oliveira Martins, of the 806 naus sent on the India Run between 1497 and 1612, 425 returned safely to Portugal, 20 returned prematurely (i.e. without reaching India), 66 were lost, 4 were captured by the enemy, 6 were scuttled and burnt, and 285 remained in India (which went on to meet various fates of their own in the East.)\n\nThe loss rate was higher in certain periods than others, reflecting greater or lesser attention and standards of shipbuilding, organization, supervision, training, etc. which reveals itself in shoddily-built ships, overloaded cargo, incompetent officers, as well as the expected higher dangers of wartime. The rates fluctuated dramatically. By one estimate, in 1571–1575, 90% of India ships returned safely; by 1586–1590, the success rate fell to less than 40%; between 1596 and 1605, the rate climbed above 50% again, but in the subsequent years fell back to around 20%.\n\nThat only four ships on India runs were known to be captured by the enemy seems quite astonishing. These were:\n\n\nThis does not count, of course, ships that were attacked by enemy action and subsequently capsized or destroyed. It also does not count ships that were captured later in the East Indies (i.e. not on the India route at the time). The most famous of these was probably the mighty Portuguese carrack \"Santa Catarina\" (not to be confused with its earlier \"Mount Sinai\" namesake), captured in 1603, by Dutch captain Jacob van Heemskerk. The \"Santa Catarina\" was on a Portuguese Macau to Portuguese Malacca run with a substantial cargo of Sino-Japanese wares, most notably a small fortune in musk, when it was captured by Heemskerk in Singapore. The captured cargo nearly doubled the capital of the fledgling Dutch VOC.\n\nShips losses should not be confused with crew losses from disease, deprivation, accident, combat and desertion. These tended to be horrifically high – one third, or even as much as one half, even in good years.\n\nThe admiral of an armada, necessarily a nobleman of some degree, was known as the \"capitão-mor\" (captain-major), with full jurisdiction over the fleet. There was also usually a designated \"soto-capitão\" (vice-admiral), with a commission to assume command should tragedy befall the captain-major. The vice-admirals were also useful if a particular armada needed to be split into separate squadrons. If an armada carried a viceroy or governor of the Indies, he typically assumed the senior position (although in practice many delegated the decision-making during the journey to their flagship's captain).\n\nEach India ship had a \"capitão\" (captain). As the position of captain could be quite profitable, it became quite attractive to lesser nobles and men of ambition hoping for a quick and easy fortune. The crown was often happy to 'sell' captain positions on India runs as a form of royal patronage to candidates with little or no experience at sea. Nonetheless, the captain was formally the king's representative and highest authority on his ship. Everyone, even noble passengers of greater formal rank, were under his jurisdiction. The supremacy of a captain's authority was curtailed only if the captain-major came aboard his ship, and when he docked in Goa (jurisdiction passed to the Vice-Roy or Governor).\n\nAnother important figure on an India ship was the \"escrivão\" (clerk), the \"de facto\" royal agent. The clerk was in charge of the written record of everything on the ship, especially the cargo inventory, which he tracked with meticulous precision. The clerk was carefully screened by the Casa da Índia, and was the crown's most trusted agent on board ship, and expected to keep an eye for crown interests. This gave him, in practice, a greater authority on the ship than his formal title suggests. At departure, the clerk was presented with the keys to the \"porão\" (hold) and a royal signet to seal the cargo. Nobody, not even the captain, was allowed to visit the cargo hold without the clerk present. It is said that rations could not be distributed, nor even a cup of water drawn from a barrel, without notifying the clerk. Upon the capture of an enemy ship, the clerk was immediately escorted aboard the captured vessel to seal the holds, cabins and chests, and take inventory of the loot.\n\nTechnical command of the ship was in the hands of the \"piloto\" (who combined the roles of pilot and navigator) and his assistant, the \"soto-piloto\" (second or under-pilot). The pilot and his assistant not merely steered the ship, but were responsible for all navigational matters – charts, instruments, plotting the course, etc. As captains were often quite inexperienced, the pilot was usually the highest trained naval officer aboard. Captains frequently deferred to them on the running of the ship.\n\nLacking a formal navigation school, early pilots were trained by apprenticeship. New pilots received their instruction, both practical and theoretical, first-hand from master pilots aboard ship and kept a tight lid on their professional secrets. This changed in the late 1550s or early 1560s, with the establishment of formal courses of instruction for India pilots in Lisbon by the \"cosmógrafo-mor\" Pedro Nunes, which included a final examination and formal certification.\nDespite their general secretiveness, several early India pilots compiled written navigation manuals, probably initially merely as notes for themselves, but eventually passed on and copied by others. These included general instructions on how to read, plot and follow routes by nautical chart, how to use the principal nautical instruments of the day – the mariner's compass, the quadrant, the astrolabe, the nocturlabe and the \"balestilha\" (cross-staff) – and astronomical tables (notably that of solar declination, derived from Abraham Zacuto and later Pedro Nunes's own) to correctly account for \"compass error\" (the deviation of the magnetic north from the true north) by recourse to the Pole Star, Sun and Southern Cross, the flux and reflux of tides, etc. These manuals often contained a \"roteiro\" (rutter), giving the detailed instructions (by geographical coordinates and physical description) of the routes to India. Two of the few which have survived were Duarte Pacheco Pereira's \"Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis\" (c. 1509) and João de Lisboa's \"Livro da Marinharia\" (c. 1514).\n\nRelative to the ships of other nations (e.g. French, Dutch), clerks and pilots on Portuguese vessels held an unusually high degree of authority.\n\nNext in a ship's hierarchy was the \"mestre\" (master). The ship's master was the officer in charge of all sailors, ship's boys and the rest of the crew. His primary job at sea was to ensure the crew implemented the technical manoeuvre orders of the pilot – raising and lowering sails, etc. As such, the master required a good degree of sailing knowledge – knowing how to translate the pilot's instructions into sail & crew instructions. He was often sufficiently trained in navigation to take over pilot's duties if the pilot and under-pilot were incapacitated. But a ship which lost all three officers would usually be in serious trouble.\nAssisting the master, was the \"contramestre\" (or \"soto-mestre\", boatswain). The boatswain was the crew enforcer – he ensured the master's orders were implemented by the crew. In practice, they usually partitioned the deck between them, with the master in charge of implementation in the stern, and the boatswain in the bow. The boatswain was also in charge of the maintenance of rigging, anchors and supervising the loading and unloading of cargo, etc. The boatswain had his own assistant, the \"guardião\" (boatswain's mate).\n\nThe bulk of the crew were all-purpose sailors – usually half of them \"marinheiros\" (seamen), the other half \"grumetes\" (ship-boys). The partition between the two classes was akin to the modern distinction between able seaman and ordinary seamen, e.g. ship-boys were assigned the drudgery duties, swabbing and scrubbing, moving cargo, etc., while seamen would be given 'higher' responsibilities, e.g. assigned to hold the wheel on the \"tolda\" (quarterdeck). The boatswain was considered the head of the seamen, and served as the intermediary between the seamen and the higher officers (master, pilot, etc.). The boatswain's mate had authority only over the ship-boys; seamen would not obey a boatswain's mate's order.\n\nThen there were the specialized crew. A Portuguese India nau usually had two \"estrinqueiros\", skilled sailors in charge of the windlass that operated the round sails (one for the main mast, another for the fore mast). The \"meirinho\" (bailiff), a judicial officer, was in charge of dispensing punishment and supervising on-board dangers (fires, gunpowder stores, weapon caches). The \"capelão\" (chaplain) was in charge of saving souls, the \"barbeiro\" (barber surgeon) in charge of saving lives. A large nau usually had a number of \"pagens\" (pages), who not only attended upon the officers and the cabins, but also served as runners delivering orders across the deck.\n\nThe \"despenseiro\" (purser/steward) was in charge of food stores and rations. Unlike ships of other nations, Portuguese vessels did not usually have a cook aboard, sailors were expected to cook their own meals themselves at the ship's ovens. Rations were composed primarily of ship biscuit (the main staple, rationed at 2 lb per person per day). Other provisions included wine, salt, olive oil, salted cod, sardines, pork, cheese, rice, and the like, with fresh fruits and vegetables available on the initial part of the journey. Rations were suspended if the ship was at dock and the men ashore. On the return journey, the crown would only supply enough biscuit and water for a ship to reach the Cape of Good Hope; the ship's crew would have to find its own provisions thereafter.\n\nPerhaps the most valued of the specialized positions was the repair crew. This was usually composed of two \"carpinteiros\" (carpenters ) and two \"calafate\" (caulkers) that fixed anything that was broken, plus the \"tanoeiro\" (cooper), who ensured the cargo and water stores remained preserved. A nau might also have \"mergulhadores\" (divers), crew specially trained to go down the outside of the ship to check and help repair hull damage below the water level.\n\nMilitary personnel aboard a nau varied with the mission. Except for some specialists and passengers, most of the crew was armed before encounters and expected to fight. But every nau also had, at the very least, a small specialized artillery crew of around ten \"bombardeiros\" (gunners), under the command of a \"condestável\" (constable). As naval artillery was the single most important advantage the Portuguese had over rival powers in the Indian Ocean, gunners were highly trained and enjoyed a bit of an elite status on the ship. (Indeed, many gunners on Portuguese India ships were highly skilled foreigners, principally Germans, lured into Portuguese service with premium wages and bonuses offered by crown agents.)\n\nShips that expected more military encounters might also carry \"homens d'armas\" (men-at-arms), \"espingardeiros\" (arquebusiers/musketeers) and \"besteiros\" (crossbowmen). But, except for the gunners, soldiers aboard ship were not regarded as an integral part of the naval crew, but rather just as passengers.\n\nThe following is a sample composition of a typical 16th-century Portuguese India nau (carrack):\n\nTotal = 127 crew\n\nPlus any soldiers and passengers that might be taken aboard.\n\nIn addition to the cash salaries paid by the Casa da Índia, captains and crew members were allowed to engage in trade on their own account (up to a certain amount). That is, they were authorized to import into Portugal a pre-specified volume of pepper and a certain number of boxes of assorted goods (\"caixas forras de fretes e direitos\", or \"caixas de liberdades\", \"liberty chests\"). These were to be purchased in India out of their own pockets, of course, but the crown would allow these cargoes to be brought back on crown ships free of freight charge and duties, and sold in Lisbon markets (at pre-set prices), for their own personal profit. Liberty chests had standard dimensions 4' × 3' × 2.5' \nIn the early armadas, the captain-major and captains of the carracks were obliged, by King Manuel I of Portugal, to pay the \"vintena de Belém\", a 5% duty of the earnings from the private sales of imported goods for the construction and maintenance of the Jerónimos Monastery in Belém. This rule was introduced in 1502 and continued until about 1522.\n\nThe following compensation schedule is taken from the Second India Armada of 1500\n\n\nThe \"Casa da India\" allowed the captain-major to draw as much as 5,000 cruzados of his salary in advance, a captain 1,000. Any married crewman could draw up to one year in salary in advance, while a single man could draw up to six months.\n\nOfficers, soldiers and officials that were to remain in India in some capacity (patrol ship captains, factors, clerks, magistrates (\"alcaide-mor\"), etc.) typically signed employment contracts of three years duration. Soldiers who signed an overseas service contract received a bonus of 800 \"reais\" per month en route, bumped up to 1200 per month in India (to pay for living expenses), and the right to ship back an additional 2.5 quintals of pepper per year (in addition to the quintals they were already authorized to send back according to the standard pay scale).\n\nEven if not formally authorized, captains sometimes supplemented their earnings by undertaking a bit of piracy and extortion on the side. Although it did not necessarily encourage India armadas to pursue activities that might endanger their ships and cargoes, rules were still set out for the partition of the spoils of captured ships and extortion of tribute from 'unfriendly' ports.\n\nThe rules of plunder were as follows: first of all, the captain-major has the 'right to a jewel', i.e. he is allowed to pick one item from the spoils for himself, provided it is worth no more than 500 cruzados. Then one-fifth is set aside for the crown. The remainder is subsequently divided into three parts: 2/3 for the crown again (albeit to be expended on the armada itself in the form of equipment, supplies and ammunition), and the remaining third distributed among the crew for private taking. The partition of this last third worked out as follows:\n\n\nOnce again, the captain-major and captains of large carracks had to contribute 10% of their part to the Jerónimos Monastery of Belém (although that does not seem to apply to the others).\n\nWhile the India armadas were used to ferry troops, officials, missionaries and colonists between Europe and Asia, their primary objective was commercial. They were engaged in the spice trade, importing Asian spices to sell in European markets, especially the five \"glorious spices\" – pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and mace.\n\nBlack Pepper, grown locally in Kerala, composed as much as 90% of the return cargo of the early armadas. But the other glorious spices could also be found in Calicut, Cochin and other major markets on the Malabar coast of India – cinnamon was imported in large amounts from Ceylon, while, from further east, via Malacca, came long pepper (from Java), cloves (grown exclusively in the Moluccan islands of Ternate and Tidore) and, in smaller amounts, highly valued nutmeg and mace (grown only in the Banda Islands).\n\nThe armadas also loaded less glorious spices found in Indian markets, notably locally-grown ginger (the principal 'filler' cargo), cardamom and tamarind, balms and aromatics like \"Artemisia indica\" (wormwood), Socotra aloe, galbanum, camphor and myrrh. Also brought back from India were dyes like lac, indigo and dyewood and precious ornamental objects and materials like ivory, ebony and pearls.\n\nIt is estimated that the average India carrack brought back between 6,100 and 6,800 quintals of imported spices and goods – or, around 25,000 to 30,000 quintals for the average yearly India armada (4–5 ships). Exceptionally large armadas and/or behemoth ships could push it up to 40,000 in some years. It is estimated that around 15% of the cargo was lost at sea, spoilage, etc. over the long run.\n\nA greater difficulty involved determining the cargo on the outgoing journey. The following list, from the Fourth Armada of 1502, gives an idea of the kind of European items brought by the Portuguese to sell in India: \"cut and branch coral, copper in pigs and sheets, quicksilver, vermilion, rugs, Flanders brass basins, coloured cloths, knives, red barret-caps, mirrors and coloured silks.\" But, by and large, European products did not sell well in Asia, which meant that ship holds were frequently empty, or nearly so, on the outward leg. In other words, outbound ships carried little more than the metal bullion – principally silver, but also copper and lead – needed to purchase spices in Asian markets.\n\nHowever, if they stopped by Mozambique Island on the outward leg (as almost all India armadas did), they could expect the local Portuguese factors to have a stockpile of East African trade goods – gold, ivory, coral, pearls, acquired during the year at several points along the Swahili Coast – ready to be picked up by the armadas for sale in India.\n\nOf course, an armada could not just sail into an Indian city and expect to find enough supplies at hand in the city's spice markets to load up five or ten large ships at once. Should it even try, it would likely provoke an instant scarcity and quickly drive up the prices of spices astronomically.\n\nInstead, the Portuguese relied on the ancient 'factory' system. That is, in every major market, the Portuguese erected a warehouse ('factory', \"feitoria\") and left behind a purchasing agent ('factor', \"feitor\"). The factor and his assistants would remain in the city and buy spices from the markets slowly over the course of the year, and deposit them into the warehouse. When the next armada arrived, it would simply load up the accumulated spices from the warehouse and set sail out at once.\nThe first Portuguese factory in Asia was set up in Calicut (\"Calecute\", Kozhikode), the principal spice entrepot on the Malabar Coast of India in September 1500, but it was overrun in a riot a couple of months later. Consequently, the first lasting factory was set up in the nearby smaller city of Cochin (\"Cochim\", Kochi) in late 1500. This was followed up by factories in Cannanore (\"Canonor\", Kannur) (1502) and Quilon (\"Coulão\", Kollam) (1503).\n\nAlthough some Portuguese factories were defended by palisades that eventually evolved into Portuguese forts garrisoned by Portuguese troops (e.g. Fort Manuel was erected around the Cochin factory in 1503, Fort Sant' Angelo around the Cannanore factory in 1505), not all did. The two concepts are distinct. Factories were commercial outposts, not political, administrative or military. The factor was formally an employee of the \"Casa da Índia\" (the trading house), not an officer of the \"Estado da Índia\" (the colonial government).\n\nWhile Lisbon was the offloading point of the India armada, it was not the endpoint of the Portuguese spice trade. There remained the matter of distribution of the spices in Europe.\n\nUntil the Portuguese breakthrough into the Indian Ocean, the supply of eastern spices to European consumers had been largely in the hands of Republic of Venice. Arab and Gujarati merchants ferried spices from Indian ports like Calicut, across the Arabian Sea and into the Red Sea ports like Jeddah. From there, they would be carried overland to ports in the eastern Mediterranean, such as Alexandria, where they would be picked by Venetian merchants and then sold on European markets.\n\nThe Portuguese India armadas challenged this old spice route, for a brief period disrupted it, but they did not eliminate it. Despite Portuguese efforts to secure monopolies at the source, enough spices still slipped through the old Venetian-Arab route and forced competition on the sale end in Europe.\nRealizing that the Mediterranean was saturated with spices supplied by Venetian merchants, the Portuguese decided to avoid head-to-head competition that might cut into their profits there, and focused on selling their spices in northern Europe, a market the Venetians had barely touched. To this end, the Casa da Índia set up a factory (\"feitoria de Flandres\") in the Brabantine town of Antwerp in 1508. The factory had two purposes: firstly, to serve as a distribution center of the Portuguese spices to the rest of northern Europe; secondly, to acquire the silver bullion needed by the Portuguese India armadas to buy spices in Asia.\n\nIt is in the silver trade that Portugal and Venice competed directly. Both needed large volumes of European silver to buy spices in Asia, yet the only significant silver source was in Central Europe, dominated by major German trading families like the Welsers, the Hochstetters and the Fuggers of Augsburg. To get their hands on this silver, the Portuguese and Venetians offered gold, not only from their revenues of spice sales, but also from overseas sources: the Portuguese had access to gold from the Akan fields on the Gold Coast of west Africa, while the Venetians had access to the gold mines of the Sudan (which was freighted up the Nile to Alexandria). Via river routes, the German silver merchants directed silver bullion supplies up to the Portuguese factory in Antwerp, from where ships would carry them to Lisbon, to be loaded onto the India armadas.\n\nThe intercontinental streams of spices, gold and silver flowing in and out of the Portuguese factory transformed Antwerp overnight from a sleepy town into arguably the leading commercial and financial center of Europe in the 16th century, a position it would enjoy until its sack by mutinous Spanish soldiers in 1576.\n\nRecent research has shown that, after 1505, most of the trade that moved between Lisbon and Antwerp sidestepped the Portuguese royal \"factory of Flanders\". Most of the European leg of the trade was directly contracted between the \"Casa da Índia\" in Lisbon and private foreign consortiums (usually Italian and German) in Antwerp and freighted largely by Dutch, Hanseatic and Breton ships. As a result, the bulk of the profits of the Portuguese spice trade accrued not to the Portuguese crown, but to the private consortiums (Smith calculates that, in 1517–1519, as much as half the price difference for spices between Indian and European markets was pocketed by private European merchants on this leg; by 1585, the share reaped by the Portuguese crown had fallen to a mere 15%).\n\nDue to a series of costly losses in the 1550s, the \"Casa da Índia\" fell into severe financial straits and was basically bankrupt by 1560. In 1570, King Sebastian of Portugal issued a decree revoking the royal monopoly, and opening up trade with India to any private Portuguese merchant. As few took up the offer, the free trade decree was replaced in 1578 by a new system of annual monopolies, whereby the \"Casa\" sold the rights of the India trade to a private merchant consortium, guaranteeing them a monopoly for one year. The annual monopoly system was abandoned in 1597, and the royal monopoly resumed. But by that time, everything had changed.\n\nFor an entire century, the Portuguese had managed to monopolize the India run. The spice trade itself was not monopolized – through the 16th century, the Republic of Venice had kept up its competition through its overland Levantine routes – but the sea route by the Cape remained exclusively Portuguese. Despite occasional leaks (e.g. the Cantino planisphere of 1502), details of the Portuguese \"Carreira da Índia\" had been largely kept secret, or at least was not exploited by competitors. But this changed in the 1590s.\n\nThe capture of the Portuguese ship \"São Filipe\" by the English privateer Sir Francis Drake in 1587, with its rutter and detailed maps, prompted the first English attempt to sail to the East Indies, a private three-ship fleet organized by London merchants, and led by Sir James Lancaster. It was a disaster – most of the ships and crews were lost, and Lancaster had to resort to piracy to fill his hold – but it opened the way.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the preacher and cartographer Petrus Plancius had long been urging his countrymen to set out on their own route, rather than relying on the Portuguese hauls. The Dutch effort received an injection from the information provided by Cornelis de Houtman, a Dutch spy dispatched to Lisbon in 1592 to scout the spice trade, and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, a Dutch sailor who had served on many Portuguese India armadas from the 1580s. With this information in hand, the Dutch finally made their move in 1595, when a group of Amsterdam merchants formed the \"Compagnie van Verre\" and sent out their first expedition, under de Houtman, to the East Indies, aiming for the market port of Bantam. That same year, Linschoten published a little tract in Amsterdam entitled \"Reysgheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten\" (Travel Account of the Voyages of the Portuguese in the Orient), a rutter giving the details of the sailing directions of the Portuguese India Run. It was republished in 1596, as part of a larger book, the \"Itinerario\", where Linschoten gave the details of the trade and the condition of Portuguese defenses in Asia. It was an explosive sensation. It was immediately translated into English, German, Latin and soon French.\n\n1597 was the bellwether year – the year of Houtman's successful return, and the spread of Linschoten's tracts. A slate of new Dutch companies (\"voorcompagnie\") to trade with the East Indies were immediately erected by various competing merchant consortiums in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg and elsewhere – often with the help of exiled Antwerp merchants ('Brabantsche'), who had long been involved on the distribution end of the Portuguese spice trade, but expelled due to the Dutch-Spanish conflict. At least fifteen separate Dutch expeditions to the East Indies, each involving enormous numbers of men, ships, and amounts of treasure, were sent out by the \"voorcompanies\" in 1598–1601. From this enthusiastic anarchic beginning, the Dutch trade got organized in 1601, when the Dutch government forced the voorcompagnie to fold under a single monopoly company, the \"Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie\" (VOC).\n\nFearful of being left behind, the English had founded their own East India Company (EIC) in 1600, and managed to organize a small English expedition to Bantam in 1601, but enthusiasm was weaker and the EIC had problems competing with the better-organized and better-financed Dutch.\n\nThe vigorous Dutch VOC and English EIC encroachments on the Portuguese empire and trade in Asia, prompted the monarchy (then in Iberian Union with Spain) to experiment with different arrangements. In 1624, Philip III of Portugal granted a monopoly charter to a Portuguese \"Companhia do commércio da Índia\", a private joint-stock company organized on the same lines as the Dutch and English companies. The \"Companhia\" was to take over all the responsibilities of the \"Casa da Índia\", including the annual India armada. It proved to be a fiasco. The Anglo-Dutch breach of the Portuguese East Indies trade was irreparable by this time, squeezing profit margins and rendering the \"Companhia\" unprofitable. It was liquidated in 1633, and what remained of the dwindling Portuguese India trade was brought back under the royal \"Casa da Índia\".\n\nWhat seems like the first chronology of the Portuguese India armadas can be found in the magnificently illustrated codex known as the \"Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu\" (\"Book of Lisuarte de Abreu\", named after the man who ordered the compilation). It covers the period from Vasco da Gama's first trip (1497–99) to the end of 1563. It is conserved at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City (ms. 525).\n\nAnother codex of the same nature is the \"Memória das Armadas que de Portugal passaram à Índia\" (\"Memory of the Armadas that from Portugal passed to India\") or \"Livro das Armadas\", held by the Academia das Ciências in Lisbon. It covers the period from 1497 to 1567 (although missing the armada of 1517).\n\nThe first Portuguese chronicler to attempt a systematic chronology of the India Armadas seems to have been Diogo do Couto, in his appendix to João de Barros's \"Décadas da Ásia\" (\"Decades of Asia\"), entitled \" \"De todas as Armadas que os Reys de Portugal mandáram à Índia, até que El-Rey D. Filippe succedeo nestes Reynos\", de 1497 a 1581\" (Dec X, Pt.1, Bk. 1, c.16).\n\nOther codices include \"Relação das Náos e Armadas da India com os Sucessos dellas que se puderam Saber, para Noticia e Instrucção dos Curiozos, e Amantes da Historia da India\" (\"Relation of the Ships and Armadas of India\") (Codex Add. 20902 of the British Library), covering the period from 1497 to 1653. It was compiled on the order of D. António de Ataíde, who was himself responsible for a good part of its extensive marginal annotations. Other annotations were added by later unidentified writers.\n\nOne of the more exhaustive chronologies, at least up to 1640, was compiled by Manuel de Faria e Sousa in his \"Ásia Portugueza\" (part III, end of volume), published posthumously in 1675. Faria e Sousa includes not only the India Armadas, but all the Portuguese fleets from 1412, including those dispatched to Africa under Prince Henry the Navigator.\n\nThere are several chronicles of Portuguese India written by contemporaries and historians, which provide substantive descriptions of the various armadas. João de Barros's \"Décadas da Ásia\" and Damião de Góis's royal chronicles (\"Crónica do Felicíssimo Rei D. Manuel\", 1566–67 and \"Crónica do Principe D. João\", 1567) were official chronicles. As a result, while comprehensive, they have the drawbacks of being carefully censored and consciously propagandistic. Both Barros and Gois constructed their accounts primarily from archives in Lisbon although Barros's vast work was far more comprehensive and more conscientiously faithful to accuracy (Góis's was an unabashed hagiography, whereas Barros frequently updated his account on the discovery of any new scrap of information). Barros's work was supplemented later by several additional volumes written by Diogo do Couto, who had spent most of his career in India.\n\nOf the unofficial accounts, Jerónimo Osório's \"De rebus Emmanuelis\", is essentially a Latin restatement of the earlier chronicles, hoping for a wider European audience, and provides little that we don't already know. Fernão Lopes de Castanheda's \"História do descobrimento e conquista da Índia pelos portugueses\" (\"History of the Discovery and Conquest of the East Indies by the Portuguese\", 1554–59), although unofficial, is generally regarded as 'respectable' and reliable. Unlike Barros, Góis or Osório, Castanheda actually visited the East, spending ten years in India, and supplemented the archival material with independent interviews he conducted there and back in Coimbra.\n\nDistinct from all the others is Gaspar Correia's \"Lendas da Índia\" (\"Legends of India\", written c. 1556, manuscript found and published only in 1885). This is almost entirely original material, his facts and names are often at variance with the official chronicles. Correia spent nearly his entire life in India, and drew primarily from materials available there. His style of writing is also much more entertaining, intense and replete with 'gossipy' details. Although not regarded as reliable, Correia's account supplies a lot of information that the others miss or prefer to remain silent on.\n\nBesides these comprehensive chronicles, there are many accounts of particular armadas – on-board diaries, accounts, memoirs and letters written by their passengers.\n\nThere is quite some conflict between the various sources over the exact composition of the various India Armadas, particularly in the names of the captains of the vessels. Attempts have been made to reconcile the differences between the sources (e.g. Quintella's \"Annaes da Marinha Portugueza\"), although these inevitably involve some degree of conjecture, dispute and revision.\n\nOther 1500 events\n\n\nOther 1501 events\n\n\nOther 1502 events\n\n\nOther 1503 events\n\n\nNote: In some lists, Pêro Dinis (or Dias) de Setúbal is substituted with two small ships, one under Simão de Alcáçova, another under Cristóvão de Távora, bringing the total to fourteen.

The organization uses marketing techniques and technical interventions to address threats like overfishing, deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practices. Rare's work is founded on the belief that most of the threats faced by the environment are the result of human behavior, and that changing human behavior requires appealing to people using both rational and emotional arguments and removing any barriers that might prevent change.\n\nRare was founded on January 1, 1973 by David Hill. The organization was originally headquartered at the offices of the National Audubon Society in New York before joining the World Wildlife Fund in the 1980s. In 1987, Rare returned to being an independent entity.\n\nCurrently headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, in the United States, Rare also has offices in the Philippines, Indonesia, China, Brazil, Mozambique, Mexico and Micronesia. Rare has worked with communities and local partners in over 55 countries. Rare receives four stars, on a four-star scale from Charity Navigator.\n\nSocial marketing: Rare uses social marketing to achieve its mission. Each marketing concept is applied to motivate communities to take pride in their surrounding environment and wildlife. The tools Rare uses include: animal mascots, puppet shows, religious sermons, radio spots, billboards, art contests, community theater events, festivals, murals, songs and school visits.\n\nRare's campaign approach originated on the Eastern Caribbean island of St. Lucia in 1977, with the work of Paul Butler, now Rare's senior vice president. Butler was hired by St. Lucia's Forestry Department in an effort to save the declining, endemic St. Lucia Parrot. Hunting, habitat destruction and the bird trade had caused the species to decline from 1000 birds in the mid-1950s to less than 150 by 1977.\n\nWorking with Gabriel Charles (Former Chief Forest Officer) and a team of forest officers, he created an outreach campaign that aimed to build community pride in the parrot and its forest habitat. Butler and his forestry department colleagues leveraged marketing materials that mirrored those used by the private sector, including campaign songs, mascots, and poster art depicting the parrot alongside a targeted call to action: \"Take Pride in St. Lucia! Report illegal hunting of wildlife and clearing of land!\"\n\nIn 1979, the government of St. Lucia declared the parrot its national bird, established a parrot sanctuary, and updated and enforced laws to protect the species and its habitat. The parrot population steadily recovered, and today population estimates for the species exceed 2,000. Butler's campaign and marketing tactics formed the foundation of Rare's social marketing strategy.\n\nRare works with coastal communities to restore small-scale fisheries in the Philippines, Belize, Brazil, Indonesia and Mozambique. Through the Fish Forever partnership between Rare, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Sustainable Fisheries Group at the University of California Santa Barbara, the organization expands and implements sustainable fisheries management solutions worldwide.\n\nThe Fish Forever program pilots and implements TURF+Reserves, (territorial user rights for fishing) a pairing of exclusive fishing access and marine reserves that allows fisheries restoration and marine conservation to work together. Marine reserves (specifically in the form of no-take areas) are designated alongside or within the exclusive fishing areas, or TURFs, with the aim of giving fish populations the chance to thrive and spill over into the fishing areas.\n\nRare works with local communities throughout Latin America to implement reciprocal water agreements for upstream habitat protection. The agreements incentivize upstream landowners to conserve watershed habitat, with downstream water users (both entities and individuals) financing such incentives.\n\nSolution Search is a crowdsourcing online contest platform designed to source, reward and disseminate proven solutions in conservation and development. Past competition themes have sought out fisheries restoration solutions and climate adaptation approaches worldwide. The 2015 Solution Search contest recognized solutions in U.S. weather-related disaster risk management. The contest has identified more than 240 solutions from 65 countries across the various topics.\n\nRare works with farmers in China to adopt sustainable agriculture practices—in particular the shift from conventional cotton to organic cotton. The program seeks to reduce pesticides and other contaminants entering the waters and threatened wetland habitats of China.\n\nBrett Jenks, CEO: Brett Jenks joined Rare in 1995. Jenks attended the University of Massachusetts and received an M.B.A from Georgetown University. Brett has worked in the field of tropical conservation and rural education since 1992.\n\n"}
{"id": "83109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83109", "title": "Sail plan", "text": "Sail plan\n\nA sail plan is a set of drawings, usually prepared by a naval architect which shows the various combinations of sail proposed for a sailing ship. Alternatively, as a term of art, it refers to the way such vessels are rigged as discussed below.\n\nThe combinations shown in a sail plan almost always include three configurations:\nIn all sail plans, the architect attempts to balance the force of the sails against the drag of the underwater keel in such a way that the vessel naturally points into the wind. In this way, if control is lost, the vessel will avoid broaching (turning edge-to-the wind), and being beaten by breaking waves. Broaching always causes uncomfortable motion, and in a storm, the breaking waves can destroy a lightly built boat. The architect also tries to balance the wind force on each sail plan against a range of loads and ballast. The calculation assures that the sail will not knock the vessel sideways with its mast in the water, capsizing and perhaps sinking it.\n\n\nEach form of rig requires its own type of sails. Among them are:\n\nThe standard terminology assumes three masts, from front to back, the foremast, mainmast and mizzenmast. On ships with fewer than three masts, the tallest is the mainmast. Ships with more masts number them.\n\nFrom bottom to top, the sails of each mast are named by the mast and position on the mast, e.g. for the mainmast, from lowest to highest: main course, main topsail, main topgallant (\"t'gallant\"), main royal, main skysail, and main moonraker. Since the early nineteenth century, the topsails and topgallants are often split into a lower and an upper sail to allow them to be more easily handled. This makes the mast appear to have more \"sails\" than it officially has.\n\nOn many warships, sails above the fighting top (a platform just above the lowest sail) were mounted on separate masts (\"topmasts\" or \"topgallant masts\") held in wooden sockets called \"tabernacles\". These masts and their stays could be rigged or struck as the weather and tactical situation demanded.\n\nIn light breezes, the working square sails would be supplemented by \"studding sails\" (\"stuns'l\") out on the ends of the yardarms. These were called as a regular sail, with the addition of \"studding\". For example, the \"main top studding sail\".\n\nBetween the main mast and mizzen as well as between main mast and foremast, the staysails between the masts are named from the sail immediately \"below\" the highest attachment point of the stay holding up that staysail. Thus, the mizzen topgallant staysail can be found dangling from the stay leading from \"above\" the \"mizzen\" (third) mast's \"topgallant\" sail (i.e., from the mizzen topgallant yard) to at least one and usually two sails down from that on the \"main\" mast (the slope of the top edge of all staysail lines runs from a higher point nearer the stern to a lower point towards the bow).\n\nThe jibs --staysails between the first mast and the \"bowsprit\"-- are named (from inner to outer most) fore topmast staysail (or foretop stay), inner jib, outer jib and flying jib. Many of the jibs' stays meet the foremast just above the fore topgallant. A fore royal staysail may also be set.\n\nIn the age of sail, lines were made of manila, cotton, hemp, or jute. Modern lines are made of polyester (Dacron), polyamides (nylon), and sometimes crystallized hydrocarbons (Kevlar and Spectra). Standing rigging may include wire rope made of stainless or galvanized steel. Other older, or less common materials include papyrus in ancient Egypt and coir.\n\n\n\nThe stays on a ship roughly form hoops of tension holding the masts up against the wind. Many ships have been \"tuned\" by tightening the rigging in one area, and loosening it in others. The tuning can create most of the stress on the stays in some ships.\n\nSailing vessels may be distinguished by:\n\nAll of these sails may have a boom along the bottom, or they may have none. A boom-footed sail gives better control of the sail shape and thus makes the sail more efficient, especially upwind. One of the advantages of loose-footed sails is that there is no boom to hit one's head or knock one into the water. Boats without booms are also lighter and cheaper to make.\n\nSome gaff and some junk rigs get in the way of shroud lines strung between the mast and hull. If the mast cannot be held up by shrouds, it must stand up by itself, which makes it heavier, especially on a large boat.\n\nA gunter rig is often used for smaller boats where the mast is frequently taken down; the mast is made short enough to be stored flat inside the boat. The popular Mirror class of racing dinghy is gunter-rigged for this reason.\n\nLug, lateen and settee sails have an efficient tack and an inefficient tack, in which the sail presses against the mast, spoiling its aerodynamics. Some swing their yards around the mast to make both tacks efficient, but this is difficult with larger sails.\n\nCrab-claws are easily to construct, as they work well when cut from a single flat sheet (they don't need multiple shaped pieces to create their 3-D draft). On a small boat like the Sunfish, their rigging can also be limited to one sheet and one halyard.\n\nJunk rigs, like crab-claws, place no extreme loads anywhere on the sail or rigging, so they can be built using light-weight, weaker, less-expensive materials. The subdivided sails make them easy for a small crew to handle, and they are easy to reef. Junks also customarily have internal water-tight bulkheads, as do modern ships.\n\nThe sails above vary in shape from square to triangular. A triangular sail has half the surface area of a squarish sail of the same height. For the sails to have the same surface area, the triangular sail must be twice as tall.\n\nThere are several disadvantages to a tall rig. Firstly, it makes the boat less stable. If the sails are tall, the wind tends to push the boat over (the center of effort of the sail pushes sideways higher on the mast). A boat is also more tippy if it has a taller mast or heavy spars high up (such as the gaff on a gaff rig). An outrigger, ballast, and/or a long keel is needed to keep the boat upright. Secondly, a taller rig makes it harder to hold the mast onto the boat (with the standing rigging). Generally, taller rigs are more highly stressed structures than shorter rigs. This makes them more expensive and more fragile for a given strength of material. Stronger, cheaper modern materials are one reason why shorter, squarer rigs are becoming rare.\n\nWhy, then, use a tall triangular sail? Because it is more aerodynamic than a squarish one. Downwind, a sail acts like a windsock; the wind just hits and bounces, pushing the boat downwind. But at right angles to the wind, the sail catches the wind and \"redirects\" it, letting it sail faster than the wind. Pushing the wind around to a different direction pushes the sailboat off in the opposite direction (modified by the forces from the hull, which are all that stop the boat from blowing away). A sailboat can't sail directly upwind, but by redirecting the wind it can sail nearly upwind. It can then tack in a zigzag to move directly upwind.\n\nA tall, thin sail redirects the wind more smoothly, so it can sail more nearly upwind than a wide sail (it is more weatherly). Sailing a race in a circle, everyone has to go upwind. So other things (like sail area) being equal, the most weatherly boat will win. This is why almost all racing boats have tall, thin sails. They also have deep, heavy keels, or are multihulls, so that they don't tip over, and strong standing rigging, so their masts don't blow off.\n\nBoats with shorter, wider sails have lighter, shallower hulls. They may wait for a favorable wind to avoid sailing upwind. They may go faster than a high-aspect-ratio sailboat when not going upwind; for instance, crab-claws sail extremely well on a beam reach.\n\nEuropean, and especially English, watercraft terminology draws a strong distinction between square-rigged vessels (with square sails hung from yards mounted centrally and horizontally from masts) and fore-and-aft rigged ones (everything else). It is important to note that any other sail (such as a lug or spritsail), \"even if it is geometrically square\", is not a square sail in the technical sense used in European sail terminology. It is merely a quadrilateral fore-and-aft sail. Vessels are named by the number of square-rigged masts that they have. This is because square-rigged vessels used to be the fastest rig, and more masts were faster.\n\nAny traditional European vessel that really needed speed was square-rigged. Navy sailing vessels, pirates, merchants that needed to escape pirates, and merchant vessels that just needed speed, such as tea clippers, all had towering stacks of smallish square sails. Given a huge crew to control all the sails, they could often outrace the fore-and-aft rigged vessels of the day, even upwind. They needed more tacks, so they had to go further, but they had nearly twice the sail area, so they went more quickly and still got there sooner. A fore-and-aft rigged vessel, with its less sub-divided sails, would break its masts and rigging if it tried to carry the same area of sail and go equally fast. Stronger materials (and winch technology to control large sails) now let fore-and-aft rigged vessels outrace square-rigged ones.\nJunk rigs essentially have the stack of sails, but without all the gaps between them. Where the yards controlled the towers of square sails, the battens controlled the junk sail. In East Asia, the largest and the smallest boats traditionally use junk sails, and vessels are not named by sail type, but by region, function, and other characteristics.\n\nLikewise, in the Pacific both large and small sailing vessels traditionally use what are generally called crabclaw sails, although they are of many different types. Other sails are also traditionally used.\n\nIn the Middle East, on the east coast of Africa, and as far east as India, lateens and settees were in common use. Ships were named more with regard to purpose than number of masts or type of sail. For instance, feluccas and sambuks were mostly used for fishing and ferrying, dhows are heavy cargo vessels. Xebecs, which also had oars, were used by corsairs to outpace merchant vessels, which were also often xebecs.\n\nAttempts to blend nomenclature, as in the junk diagram to the left above, occur. A ship can be rigged with one of its sails as a junk sail and another as a Bermuda rig without being considered a junk vessel.\n\nA catboat is a sailboat with a single mast and single sail; for examples of the variety of catboats, see the section above. This is the easiest sail plan to sail, and is used on the smallest and simplest boats. The catboat is a classic fishing boat. A popular movement for home-built boats uses this simple rig to make \"folk-boats\".\n\nThe term \"catboat\" is usually qualified by the type of sail, for example, \"a gaff catboat\".\n\nA proa has one sail, and is thus a catboat, though it is rarely called a catboat. Both ends are alike, and the boat is sailed in either direction, but it has a fixed leeward side and a windward side. The boat is shunted from beam reach to beam reach to change direction, with the wind over the side, a low-force procedure. The bottom corner of the crabclaw sail is moved to the other end, which becomes the bow as the boat sets off back the way it came. The mast usually hinges, adjusting its rake (mast). The proa is a low-stress rig, which can be built with simple tools and low-tech materials, but it is extremely fast. On a beam reach, it may be the fastest simple rig.\n\nIn a traditional Pacific proa, the outrigger (ama) lies on the \"windward\" side of the main hull (vaka), with its weight helping keep the proa upright. The ama is very thin, to punch through waves, smoothing the ride. The first Europeans, building proas from travelers' reports, built Atlantic proas, with the outrigger on the leeward side, with its buoyancy keeping the proa upright.\n\n\"To be clear, we can blame Richard C. Newick for the debate\" (about racing proas), \"since it was he who came up with the Atlantic proa in the first place, with his groundbreaking Cheers - the “giant killer” that came in third in the 1968 OSTAR. Unlike all proas until Cheers, Newick placed the ama to lee and the rig to windward, concentrating all the ballast to windward and thus multiplying the righting moment.\"\n\nA Bermuda or gaff mainsail lifted by a single mast with a single jib attached to a bowsprit, bent onto the forestay, held taut with a backstay. The mainsail is usually managed with a spar on the underside called a \"boom\".\n\nA Bermuda-rigged sloop is one of the best racing rigs per square foot of sail area as is it very weatherly, making it faster on upwind passages. This rig is the most popular for recreational boating because of its potential for high performance. On small boats, it can be a simple rig. On larger sloops, the large sails have high loads, and one must manage them with winches or multiple purchase block-and-tackle devices.\nA small single-masted ship with three or more sails. A common rig is a gaff-rigged mainsail, multiple headsails, and, often, a gaff- or square-rigged topsail above. Sometimes cutters also had an additional square-rigged mainsail when traveling downwind. The mast was normally set amidships, and two or more headsails were set from the mast to the running bowsprit. Considered better than a sloop for light winds; it is also easier to manage, as the sail area is more subdivided.\n\nA lugger is a two-masted vessel, with for each mast a sail plan similar to a gaff rig. The lug sails it uses, however, do not have gaffs, that attach directly to its masts. Instead, the spars are allowed to move forward and aft of the mast and are managed through a series of lines that attach to the \"yards\" and to the corners of the sails. Each sail may or may not have a boom along its foot. In Scotland, when constructed with a main \"dipping\" lug sail and a mizzen \"standing\" lug sail, such vessels are known as fifies, \"sailing fifies\", or \"herring drifters\"; they were often used for herring fishing.\nA small ship, fore-and-aft rigged on its two masts, with its mainmast much taller than its mizzen and with or without headsails. The mizzen mast is located aft of the rudderpost, sometimes directly on the transom, and is intended to help provide helm balance.\nA small ship with two masts, both fore-and-aft rigged, with the mizzen located well forward of the rudder post and of only slightly smaller size than the mainmast (if the height of the masts were reversed—the taller in the back and the shorter in the front—it would be considered a schooner). If square-rigged on her mainmast above the course, it is called a \"square topsail ketch\". Historically the mainmast was square-rigged instead of fore-and-aft, but in modern usage only the latter is called a ketch. The purpose of the mizzen sail in a ketch rig, unlike the mizzen on a yawl rig, is to provide drive to the hull. A ketch rig allows for shorter sails than a sloop with the same sail area, resulting in a lower center of sail and less overturning moment. The shorter masts, therefore, reduce the amount of ballast and stress on the rigging needed to keep the boat upright. Generally the rig is safer and less prone to broaching or capsize than a comparable sloop, and has more flexibility in sail plan when reducing sail under strong crosswind conditions—the mainsail can be brought down entirely (not requiring reefing) and the remaining rig will be both balanced on the helm and capable of driving the boat. The ketch is a classic small cargo boat.\n\nA fore-and-aft rig having at least two masts, with a foremast that is usually smaller than the other masts. Schooners have traditionally been gaff-rigged and in small craft are generally two-masted, however many have been built with marconi rigs (and even junk rigs) rather than gaffs and in the golden age of sail, vessels were built with as many as seven masts. One of the easiest types to sail, but performs poorly to windward without gaff topsails. The extra sails and ease of the gaff sails make the rig easier to operate, though not necessarily faster, than a sloop on all points of sail other than up-wind. Schooners were more popular than sloops prior to the upsurge in recreational boating. The better performance of the sloop upwind was outweighed for most sailors by the better performance of the schooner at all other, more comfortable, points of sail. Advances in design and equipment over the last hundred years have diminished the advantages of the schooner rig. Many schooners sailing today are either reproductions or replicas of famous schooners of old.\n\nThis type of vessel has two masts, each made of two spars. The mainmast is rigged exactly like the mainmast of any other schooner (i.e., fore and aft mainsail and gaff rigged topsail) but the foremast, though having the typical schooner's fore and aft rigged mainsail, has above it one or more square-rigged topsails. The arrangement requires the ship to have a foremast yard (the lowest) from which no sail hangs. The foremast and all of its sails are comparable to that of a brigantine (see below). If there are square-rigged topsails on both masts, then it is called a two topsail schooner or double topsail schooner.\nThe bilander is a two-masted vessel, the foremast carrying square rigs on all of its yards and its taller mainmast having a long lateen mainsail yard with corresponding trapezoidal sail and rig inclined at about 45° with square rigs on the yards above that, the lowermost secured at the corners by a crossjack. The design was popular in the Mediterranean Sea as well as around New England in the first half of the 18th century but was soon surpassed by better designs. It is considered the forerunner of the brig.\n\nIn American parlance, the brig encompasses three classes of ship: the full-rigged brig (often simply called a \"brig\"), the hermaphrodite brig, and the brigantine. All American brigs are defined by having exactly two masts that are entirely or partially square-rigged. The foremast of each is always entirely square-rigged; variations in the taller mainmast are what define the different subtypes (The definition of a brig, brigantine, etc. has been subject to variations in nation and history, however, with much crossover between the classes).\n\nFor the full-rigged brig, the foremast and mainmast each has three spars, all of them square rigged. In addition, the mainmast has a small gaff-rigged sail mounted behind (\"abaft\") the mainmast.\n\nOn a hermaphrodite brig, also called a \"half brig\" and a \"schooner brig\", the main mast carries no yards: it is made in two spars and carries two sails, a gaff mainsail and gaff topsail, making it half schooner and half brig (hence its name). If it also carries one or more square-rigged topsails on the mainmast, it is then considered a \"jackass brig\". Some authors have asserted that this type of sail plan is that of a brigantine.\nLike the hermaphrodite brig, a brigantine also has a main (second) mast made in two spars, and its large mainsail is also fore and aft rigged. However, above this it carries two or three square-rigged yards \"instead\" of a gaff topsail (the hermaphrodite brig retains the gaff topsail), and carries \"no\" square-rigged sail at all on its lowermost yard of its mainmast (the full-rigged brig retains a square-rigged sail in this position, making it very difficult to visually distinguish at a distance from a brigantine).\nAlthough superficially similar in appearance to the brig or brigantine, the snow is a much older three masted design which evolved from the larger fully rigged ship. The foremast and mainmast are both square-rigged, but the fore and aft rigged spanker sail is attached to a small trysail mast (or in modern times a steel cable) stepped directly behind the mainmast. This \"snow-mast\" allows the gaff to raised unhindered by the mainmast and higher than the main yard, which in turn also allows the snow to fly a main course without complications.\n\nThree masts or more, square rigged on all except the aftmost mast. Usually three or four-masted, but five-masted barques have been built. Lower-speed than a full-rigged ship, especially downwind, but requiring fewer sailors than a full-rigged ship. Optimum rig for transoceanic voyages. This is a classic windjammer rig.\nA three-masted vessel, square-rigged on the foremast and fore-and-aft rigged on the main and mizzen masts. Some sailors who have sailed on them say it is a poor-handling compromise between a barque and a ship, though having more speed than a barque or schooner.\nA three master with a narrow hull, carrying a square-rigged foremast, followed by two lateen sails. The same vessel, if she substituted her square-rigged mast with another lateen rigged one, would be called a xebec.\nThree or more masts, square-rigged on all, usually with stay-sails between masts. Occasionally the mizzen mast of a ship-rigged ship would have a fore-and-aft sail as its course sail (top image), but in order to qualify as a \"fully rigged ship\" the vessel would need to have a square-rigged topsail mounted above this (thus distinguishing the fully rigged ship from, say, a barque—see above). The classic \"ship rig\" (top) originally had exactly three masts, but later, four- and five-masted ships were also built (bottom). The classic sailing warship—the ship of the line—was \"full rigged\" in this way, because of high performance on all points of wind. In particular, studding sails or topping sails could be easily added for light airs or high speeds. Square rigs have twice the sail area per mast height compared to triangular sails, and when tuned, more exactly approximate a multiple airfoil, and therefore apply larger forces to the hull. Windage (drag) is more than triangular rigs, which have smaller tip vortices. Therefore, historic ships could not point as far upwind as high-performance sloops. However, contemporary Marconi rigs (sloops, etc.) were limited in size by the strength of available materials, especially their sails and the running rigging to set them. Ships were not so limited, because their sails were smaller relative to the hull, distributing forces more evenly, over more masts. Therefore, due to their much larger, longer waterline length, ships had much faster hull speeds and could run down or away from any contemporary sloop or other Marconi rig, even if it pointed more upwind. Schooners have a heavier rig and require more ballast than ships, which increases the wetted area and hull friction of a large schooner compared to a ship of the same size. The result is that a ship can run down or away from a schooner of the same hull length. Ships were larger than brigs and brigantines, and faster than barques or barquentines, but required more sailors. Also called \"ship-rigged\".\n\nEvery sail plan has maximum dimensions. These maxima are for the largest sail possible and they are defined by a letter abbreviation.\n\n"}
{"id": "20611428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20611428", "title": "Southern Ocean", "text": "Southern Ocean\n\nThe Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.\n\nBy way of his voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term \"Southern Ocean\" has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation. This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.\n\nBorders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), the precursor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\", the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60°S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002 and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the US Central Intelligence Agency and Merriam-Webster. Australian authorities regard the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia. The National Geographic Society does not recognize the ocean, depicting it (if at all) in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and online maps. Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps and GeoNova.\n\n\"Southern Ocean\" is an obsolete name for the Pacific Ocean or South Pacific, coined by Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the first European to discover it, who approached it from the north. The \"South Seas\" is a less archaic synonym. A 1745 British Act of Parliament established a prize for discovering a Northwest Passage to \"the Western and Southern Ocean of \"America\"\".\n\nAuthors using \"Southern Ocean\" to name the waters encircling the unknown southern polar regions used varying limits. James Cook's account of his second voyage implies New Caledonia borders it. Peacock's 1795 \"Geographical Dictionary\" said it lay \"to the southward of America and Africa\"; John Payne in 1796 used 40 degrees as the northern limit; the 1827 \"Edinburgh Gazetteer\" used 50 degrees. The \"Family Magazine\" in 1835 divided the \"Great Southern Ocean\" into the \"Southern Ocean\" and the \"Antarctick [\"sic\"] Ocean\" along the Antarctic Circle, with the northern limit of the Southern Ocean being lines joining Cape Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land and the south of New Zealand.\n\nThe United Kingdom's South Australia Act 1834 described the waters forming the southern limit of the new colony of South Australia as \"the Southern Ocean\". The Colony of Victoria's Legislative Council Act of 1881 delimited part of the division of Bairnsdale as \"along the New South Wales boundary to the Southern ocean\".\n\nIn the 1928 first edition of \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\", the Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits: Antarctica to the south, and South America, Africa, Australia, and Broughton Island, New Zealand to the north.\n\nThe detailed land-limits used were from Cape Horn in South America eastwards to Cape Agulhas in Africa, then further eastwards to the southern coast of mainland Australia to Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia. From Cape Leeuwin, the limit then followed eastwards along the coast of mainland Australia to Cape Otway, Victoria, then southwards across Bass Strait to Cape Wickham, King Island, along the west coast of King Island, then the remainder of the way south across Bass Strait to Cape Grim, Tasmania. The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southwards to the\nSouth East Cape and then went eastwards to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn.\n\nThe northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\". From this edition, much of the ocean's northern limit ceased to abut land masses.\n\nIn the second edition, the Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40°S between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20°E) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115°E), and extended to latitude 55°S between Auckland Island of New Zealand (165 or 166°E east) and Cape Horn in South America (67°W).\n\nAs is discussed in more detail below (see section on '2002 delineation'), prior to the 2002 (draft) edition the limits of oceans explicitly excluded the seas lying within each of them. The Great Australian Bight was unnamed in the 1928 edition, and delineated as shown in the figure above in the 1937 edition. It therefore encompassed former Southern Ocean waters (as designated in 1928) but was technically not inside any of the three adjacent oceans by 1937. In the 2002 draft edition, the IHO have designated 'seas' as being subdivisions within 'oceans', so the Bight would have still been within the Southern Ocean in 1937 if the 2002 convention were in place then. To perform direct comparisons of current and former limits of oceans (for example to compare surface areas) it is necessary to consider, or at least be aware of, how the 2002 change in IHO terminology for 'seas' can affect the comparison.\n\nThe Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition and a note in the publication read:\nInstead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of South East Cape, and the southern limits of the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea were moved northwards.\n\nThe IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name \"Southern Ocean\" won 18 votes, beating the alternative \"Antarctic Ocean\". Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at 60°S (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly 50°S, but a few for as far north as 35°S.\n\nA draft fourth edition of \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002 (sometimes referred to as the \"2000 edition\" as it summarized the progress to 2000). It has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world – primarily the Sea of Japan naming dispute – and there have been various changes, 60 seas were given new names, and even the name of the publication was changed. A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits. Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded.\n\nDespite this, the 4th edition definition has partial \"de facto\" usage by many nations, scientists and organisations such as the U.S. (the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook uses \"Southern Ocean\" but none of the other new sea names within the \"Southern Ocean\" such as \"Cosmonauts Sea\") and Merriam-Webster, scientists and nations – and even by some within the IHO. Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55°S parallel for example. Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the Antarctic Convergence, yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica.\n\nOther sources, such as the National Geographic Society, show the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as extending to Antarctica on its maps, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean.\n\nIn Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60°s elsewhere. Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as \"Southern Ocean\", while Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.\n\nA radical shift from past IHO practices (1928–1953) was also seen in the 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay within the boundaries of 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA \"World Fact Book\") which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the Pacific Ocean in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is.\n\nThe new delineation of seas being subdivisions of oceans has avoided the need to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by Drake Passage which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the Scotia Sea, which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean.\n\nExploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a \"Terra Australis\" – a vast continent in the far south of the globe to \"balance\" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa – which had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. Ferdinand Magellan, who passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, Abraham Ortelius published his first map, \"Typus Orbis Terrarum\", an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the \"Regio Patalis\" with \"Locach\" as a northward extension of the \"Terra Australis\", reaching as far as New Guinea.\n\nEuropean geographers continued to connect the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the \"Terra Australis Incognita\" (\"Unknown Southern Land\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries.\n\nThe Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla, who claimed having sighted \"snow-covered mountains\" beyond the 64° S in 1603, is recognized as the first explorer that discovered the continent of Antarctica, although he was ignored in his time.\n\nIn 1606, Pedro Fernández de Quirós took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \"even to the Pole\".\n\nFrancis Drake, like Spanish explorers before him, had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. When Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land, as previously thought. Subsequently, in 1642, Abel Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent.\n\nThe visit to South Georgia by Anthony de la Roché in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence i.e. in the Southern Ocean/Antarctic. Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict ‘Roché Island’, honouring the discoverer. James Cook was aware of la Roché's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.\n\nEdmond Halley's voyage in HMS \"Paramour\" for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52° S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140 mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \"South Land\" – described by a half legendary \"sieur de Gonneyville\" – resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 54°10′ S, and in the navigation of 48° of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55° S in 1730 .\n\nIn 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \"a very large continent.\" He lighted upon a land in 50° S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him.\n\nThe obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with \"Resolution\", a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and \"Adventure\" of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58° S, and then 30° eastward for the most part south of 60° S, a lower southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached by , where their course was stopped by ice.\n\nCook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10° too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in by 95° E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60° S to 147° E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the \"Adventure\", and reached 60° S by 177° W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching to stand north again in 135° W.\n\nA long detour to served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at by . This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53° and 57° S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roché Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named \"Sandwich Land\" by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55° and 60°. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value.\n\nVoyagers rounding Cape Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.\n\nIn a voyage from 1822 to 1824, James Weddell commanded the 160-ton brig \"Jane\", accompanied by his second ship \"Beaufoy\" captained by Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys where sealing proved disappointing. They turned south in the hope of finding a better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823 the two ships reached latitude 74°15' S and longitude 34°16'45″ W the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would have brought him to Coat's Land (to the east of the Weddell Sea) but Weddell decided to turn back.\n\nThe first land south of the parallel 60° south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain.\n\nIn the meantime, the Spanish Navy ship \"San Telmo\" sank in September 1819 when trying to cross Cape Horn. Parts of her wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of Livingston Island (South Shetlands). It is unknown if some survivor managed to be the first to set foot on these Antarctic islands.\n\nThe first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources, three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the British navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut. It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships \"Vostok\" and \"Mirny\", reached a point within from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.\n\nIn December 1839, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838–42 conducted by the United States Navy (sometimes called \"the Wilkes Expedition\"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, on the sloops-of-war and , the brig , the full-rigged ship \"Relief\", and two schooners \"Sea Gull\" and . They sailed into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery \"of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands\" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named \"Wilkes Land\", a name it maintains to this day.\n\nExplorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\".\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914, led by Ernest Shackleton, set out to cross the continent via the pole, but their ship, the \"Endurance\", was trapped and crushed by pack ice before they even landed. The expedition members survived after an epic journey on sledges over pack ice to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean, in an open boat called \"James Caird\", and then trekked over South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken.\n\nIn 1946, US Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and more than 4,700 military personnel visited the Antarctic in an expedition called Operation \"Highjump\". Reported to the public as a scientific mission, the details were kept secret and it may have actually been a training or testing mission for the military. The expedition was, in both military or scientific planning terms, put together very quickly. The group contained an unusually high amount of military equipment, including an aircraft carrier, submarines, military support ships, assault troops and military vehicles. The expedition was planned to last for eight months but was unexpectedly terminated after only two months. With the exception of some eccentric entries in Admiral Byrd's diaries, no real explanation for the early termination has ever been officially given.\n\nCaptain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947–1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected. The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf, named by Ronne after his wife Edith \"Jackie\" Ronne. Ronne covered 3,600 miles by ski and dog sled – more than any other explorer in history. The Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition discovered and mapped the last unknown coastline in the world and was the first Antarctic expedition to ever include women.\n\nThe Antarctic Treaty was signed on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits military activity in the Antarctic to the support of scientific research.\n\nThe first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in a 10-metre steel sloop \"Ice Bird\".\n\nA baby, named Emilio Marcos de Palma, was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978, becoming the first baby born on the continent. He also was born further south than anyone in history.\n\nThe MS \"Explorer\" was a cruise ship operated by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. Observers point to the \"Explorer's\" 1969 expeditionary cruise to Antarctica as the frontrunner for today's sea-based tourism in that region. The \"Explorer\" was the first cruise ship used specifically to sail the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean and the first to sink there when she struck an unidentified submerged object on 23 November 2007, reported to be ice, which caused a gash in the hull. The \"Explorer\" was abandoned in the early hours of 23 November 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, an area which is usually stormy but was calm at the time. The \"Explorer\" was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62° 24′ South, 57° 16′ West, in roughly 600 m of water.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\n\nWith a northern limit at 60°S, the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\"). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\n\nOne reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans. Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. Water in the Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Southern Ocean has typical depths of between over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The Southern Ocean's greatest depth of occurs at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench, at 60°00'S, 024°W. The Antarctic continental shelf appears generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to , compared to a global mean of .\n\nEquinox to equinox in line with the sun's seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of in March to about in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area.\n\nSub-divisions of oceans are geographical features such as \"seas\", \"straits\", \"bays\", \"channels\", and \"gulfs\". There are many sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean defined in the never-approved 2002 draft fourth edition of the IHO publication \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\". In clockwise order these include (with IHO sub-division chartlet numbers in parenthesis) the Weddell Sea (10.1), the Lazarev Sea (10.2), the Riiser-Larsen Sea (10.3), the Cosmonauts Sea (10.4), the Cooperation Sea (10.5), the Davis Sea (10.6), Tryoshnikova Gulf (10.6.1), the Mawson Sea (10.7), the Dumont D'Urville Sea (10.8), the Somov Sea (10.9), the Ross Sea (10.10), McMurdo Sound (10.10.1), the Amundsen Sea (10.11), the Bellingshausen Sea (10.12), part of the Drake Passage (10.13), Bransfield Strait (10.14) and part of the Scotia Sea (4.2). A number of these such as the 2002 Russian-proposed \"Consmonauts Sea\", \"Cooperation Sea\", and \"Somov (mid-1950s Russian polar explorer) Sea\" are not included in the 1953 IHO document which remains currently in force, because they received their names largely originated from 1962 onward. Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use these latter three names, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' National Geographic Society and the 2014 12th edition of the British Times Atlas of the World, but Soviet and Russian-issued maps do.\n\nThe Southern Ocean probably contains large, and possibly giant, oil and gas fields on the continental margin. Placer deposits, accumulation of valuable minerals such as gold, formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes are also expected to exist in the Southern Ocean.\n\nManganese nodules are expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe icebergs that form each year around in the Southern Ocean hold enough fresh water to meet the needs of every person on Earth for several months. For several decades there have been proposals, none yet to be feasible or successful, to tow Southern Ocean icebergs to more arid northern regions (such as Australia) where they can be harvested.\n\nIcebergs can occur at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea-ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) also pose problems for ships. The deep continental shelf has a floor of glacial deposits varying widely over short distances.\n\nSailors know latitudes from 40 to 70 degrees south as the \"Roaring Forties\", \"Furious Fifties\" and \"Shrieking Sixties\" due to high winds and large waves that form as winds blow around the entire globe unimpeded by any land-mass. Icebergs, especially in May to October, make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.\n\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current moves perpetually eastward – chasing and joining itself, and at in length – it comprises the world's longest ocean current, transporting of water – 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers.\n\nSeveral processes operate along the coast of Antarctica to produce, in the Southern Ocean, types of water masses not produced elsewhere in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. One of these is the Antarctic Bottom Water, a very cold, highly saline, dense water that forms under sea ice.\n\nAssociated with the Circumpolar Current is the Antarctic Convergence encircling Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic, Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.\n\nThe Antarctic Convergence is considered to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean.\n\nLarge-scale upwelling is found in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.\n\nSome models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.\n\nThe Ross Gyre and Weddell Gyre are two gyres that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyres are located in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf.\n\nSea ice has been noted to persist in the central area of the Ross Gyre. There is some evidence that global warming has resulted in some decrease of the salinity of the waters of the Ross Gyre since the 1950s.\n\nDue to the Coriolis effect acting to the left in the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting Ekman transport away from the centres of the Weddell Gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.\nSea temperatures vary from about −2 to 10 °C (28 to 50 °F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently become intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean. The ocean-area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth. In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius. At some coastal points, however, persistent intense drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.\n\nA variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.\n\nThe Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Weddell seal, a \"true seal\", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea. Antarctic krill, which congregates in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds.\n\nThe benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in . As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Deep-sea gigantism is common among these animals.\n\nA census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of . Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution – fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5 °C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larva stages.\n\nThe rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns. The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Freshwater ducks inhabit South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands.\n\nThe flightless penguins are all located in the Southern Hemisphere, with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands. Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter.\n\nThere are relatively few fish species in few families in the Southern Ocean. The most species-rich family are the snailfish (Liparidae), followed by the cod icefish (Nototheniidae) and eelpout (Zoarcidae). Together the snailfish, eelpouts and notothenioids (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost of the more than 320 described fish species of the Southern Ocean (tens of undescribed species also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish). Southern Ocean snailfish are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also occur in shallower waters.\n\nCod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the Notothenioidei suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below . Antifreeze proteins are also known from Southern Ocean snailfish.\n\nThe crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae), also known as white-blooded fish, are only found in the Southern Ocean. They lack hemoglobin in their blood, resulting in their blood being colourless. One Channichthyidae species, the mackerel icefish (\"Champsocephalus gunnari\"), was once the most common fish in coastal waters less than deep, but was overfished in the 1970s and 1980s. Schools of icefish spend the day at the seafloor and the night higher in the water column eating plankton and smaller fish.\n\nThere are two species from the genus \"Dissostichus\", the Antarctic toothfish (\"Dissostichus mawsoni\") and the Patagonian toothfish (\"Dissostichus eleginoides\"). These two species live on the seafloor deep, and can grow to around long weighing up to , living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.\n\nAnother abundant fish group is the genus \"Notothenia\", which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies.\n\nAn unusual species of icefish is the Antarctic silverfish (\"Pleuragramma antarcticum\"), which is the only truly pelagic fish in the waters near Antarctica.\n\nSeven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the elephant seal (\"Mirounga leonina\"), can reach up to , while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (\"Arctocephalus gazella\"), reach only . These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (\"Lobodon carcinophagus\") and Weddell seals (\"Leptonychotes weddellii\") form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (\"Hydrurga leptonyx\") and Ross seals (\"Ommatophoca rossii\") live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.\n\nThe four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals. Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet. The New Zealand sea lion (\"Phocarctos hookeri\"), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range. Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south.\n\nThere are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (\"Balaenoptera musculus\"), grows to long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter.\n\nFive species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, have been found in the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic krill (\"Euphausia superba\") is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is long and weighs over . The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per , turning the water red. Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival. During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition.\n\nMany benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their young in a brood pouch. \"Glyptonotus antarcticus\" is an unusually large benthic isopod, reaching in length weighing . Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals. The amphipods are highly diverse with more than 600 recognized species found south of the Antarctic Convergence and there are indications that many undescribed species remain. Among these are several \"giants\", such as the iconic epimeriids that are up to long.\n\nSlow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing as large as a human hand. They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed.\n\nMany aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as \"Adamussium colbecki\" move around on the seafloor, while others such as \"Laternula elliptica\" live in burrows filtering the water above. There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean, the largest of which is the colossal squid (\"Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni\"), which at up to is among the largest invertebrate in the world. Squid makes up most of the diet of some animals, such as grey-headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (\"Moroteuthis ingens\") is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates.\n\nThe sea urchin genus \"Abatus\" burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it. Two species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, \"Salpa thompsoni\" and \"Ihlea racovitzai\". \"Salpa thompsoni\" is found in ice-free areas, whereas \"Ihlea racovitzai\" is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce.\n\nAntarctic sponges are long lived, and sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.\n\nIncreased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.\n\nAll international agreements regarding the world's oceans apply to the Southern Ocean. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:\n\n\nMany nations prohibit the exploration for and the exploitation of mineral resources south of the fluctuating Antarctic Convergence, which lies in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north. The Antarctic Treaty covers the portion of the globe south of sixty degrees south,\nit prohibits new claims to Antarctica.\n\nThe \"Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources\" applies to the area south of 60° South latitude as well as the areas further north up to the limit of the Antarctic Convergence.\n\nBetween 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, fisheries landed 119,898 tonnes, of which 85% consisted of krill and 14% of Patagonian toothfish. International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998–99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery.\n\nMajor operational ports include: Rothera Station, Palmer Station, Villa Las Estrellas, Esperanza Base, Mawson Station, McMurdo Station, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica.\n\nFew ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean, since ice conditions limit use of most shores to short periods in midsummer; even then some require icebreaker escort for access. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, remain closed to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers.\n\nThe Southern Ocean's southernmost port operates at McMurdo Station at . Winter Quarters Bay forms a small harbor, on the southern tip of Ross Island where a floating ice pier makes port operations possible in summer. Operation Deep Freeze personnel constructed the first ice pier at McMurdo in 1973.\n\nBased on the original 1928 IHO delineation of the Southern Ocean (and the 1937 delineation if the Great Australian Bight is considered integral), Australian ports and harbors between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Otway on the Australian mainland and along the west coast of Tasmania would also be identified as ports and harbors existing in the Southern Ocean. These would include the larger ports and harbors of Albany, Thevenard, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Adelaide, Portland, Warrnambool, and Macquarie Harbour.\nYacht races have been held in the Southern Ocean, such as the Volvo Ocean Race, Velux 5 Oceans Race, Vendée Globe, Jules Verne Trophy and Global Challenge.\n\n\n\n"}

The system extends along a curve from Lake Eğirdir in the west to the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in the east. It is a part of the Alpide belt in Eurasia.\n\nThe Taurus mountains are divided into three chains from west to east as follows;\n\nThe bull was commonly the symbol and depiction of ancient Near Eastern storm gods, hence Taurus the bull, and hence the name of the mountains. The mountains are a place of many ancient storm-god temples. Torrential thunderstorms in these mountains were deemed by the ancient Syrians to be the work of the storm-god Adad to make the Tigris and Euphrates rivers rise and flood and thereby fertilise their land. The Hurrians, probably originators of the various storm-gods of the ancient Near East, were a people whom modern scholars place in the Taurus Mountains at their probable earliest origins.\n\nA Bronze Age archaeological site, where early evidence of tin mining was found, is at Kestel. The pass known in antiquity as the Cilician Gates crosses the range north of Tarsus.\n\nThe Amanus range in southern Turkey is where the Taurus Mountains are pushed up as three tectonic plates come together. The Amanus is a natural frontier: west is Cilicia, east is Syria. There are several passes, like the Amanian Gate (Bahçe Pass), which are of great strategical importance. In 333 BCE at the Battle of Issus, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III Codomannus on the foothills along the coast between these two passes. In the Second Temple period, Jewish authors seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the Promised Land, began to construe Mount Hor as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain.\n\nDuring World War I, the German and Turkish railway system through the Taurus Mountains proved to be a major strategic objective of the Allies. This region was specifically mentioned as a strategically controlled objective slated for surrender to the Allies in the Armistice, which ended hostilities against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the Aladaglar and Bolkar mountains, limestone has eroded to form karstic landscapes of waterfalls, underground rivers, and some of the largest caves of Asia. The Manavgat River originates on the southern slopes of the Beydaglari range.\n\nIn addition to hiking and mountain climbing, there are two ski resorts on the mountain range, one at Davras about from the two nearest towns of Egirdir and Isparta, the second is Saklıkent from the city of Antalya.\n\nThe Varda Viaduct, situated on the railway lines Konya-Adana at Hacıkırı village in Adana Province, is a railway bridge constructed in the 1910s by Germans.\n\nWest Taurus and Taurus Mountains form an arc around the Gulf of Antalya. The East Taşeli Plateau and Goksu River divide it from the Central Taurus Mountains. It has many peaks rising above . The complex is divided into four ranges:\nThe highest point in the central Tauruses is the summit of Mt. Demirkazık (3,756m).\n\nCentral Taurus are roughly defined to be the north of Mersin and north west of Adana\nThe Southeastern Taurus mountains form the northern boundary of the Southeastern Anatolia Region and North Mesopotamia. They are also the source of the Euphrates River and Tigris River.\n\n"}

Its name means \"Timok Frontier\". Timočka krajina corresponds to parts of two Serbian districts (Bor and Zaječar), with a total 2002 census population of 284,112.\n\nThe toponym is derived from the hydronym \"Timok\" and \"krajina\" (\"frontier, march\"), named such due to its location and history as a borderland. It was introduced in the Interwar period as denoting the Timok confluence with the Negotinska Krajina and Ključ. The term has no historical or geographical basis. In Romanian, the term \"Timoc Valley\" () is used for the area inhabited by the Romanian-speaking Vlachs. The region was named sometimes Podunavia in Medieval times.\n\nTimočka Krajina roughly corresponds to the Bor and Zaječar districts of Serbia. It includes seven municipalities and one city: \n\nThe largest city in the region is Zaječar, and therefore functions as its cultural, urban, and economic centre. It consists of four municipalities: Stari grad (old parts of the city: Vlačić, Kraljevica, Karađorđev venac, Šljivarsko brdo, Lubničko brdo, Oskoruša, Pazaršte, Zvezdan, Podliv, Veliki izvor), Kotlujevac (Ključ 1,2,3,4, Živinarnik, Selište, Vlaško brdo, Beli breg), Grljan (south suburban parts and Višnjar) and Salaš (north suburban parts). The largest ethnic group in Zaječar is Koltlujevac, with a population of over 25,000.\n\nEarly Bronze Age pottery of the Kostolac-Kocofeni culture has been found throughout the region. During the Roman era, the area was administratively part of the Dacia Ripensis. During emperor Justinian's reign there were numerous fortifications in the area. Notable Roman sites include Timacum Minus, Trajan's Bridge, Diana Fortress, and others.\nThe Bulgar ruler Ivan Stracimir (Vidin principate) and voevod Mircea cel Batran controlled the territory of Podunavia until the Ottoman conquest in the XIVth century\nSeveral settlements in the region received Habsburg Monarchy frontier status after the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718); the area became a frontier towards the Ottoman Empire.\n\nA peasant uprising took place in 1883 in Timok, in Eastern Serbia, known as the Timok Rebellion ( Timocka buna in Serbian). The peasant movement of 1883 resulted from economic, political and social factors.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1922, two districts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes existed in the area - Krajina District, with seat in Negotin, and Timok District with seat in Zaječar. In 1922, these two districts were merged into the newly formed Timok Oblast with seat in Zaječar. Timok Oblast existed until 1929 when it was included into the newly formed Morava Banovina with seat in Niš. At present there are two districts in the area: Bor District with seat in Bor; and Zaječar District with seat in Zaječar.\n\nThe region is inhabited by a majority of Serbs and minority of Vlachs. Based on the 2002 census and results in the Bor and Zaječar Districts (which together had 284,112 inhabitants), there were 85,58% Serbs, 8,31% Vlachs and 0,96% Romani. The Serb community traditionally speak the Kosovo–Resava dialect in the north and the Prizren-Timok dialect in the south, however, Standard Serbian is used in formal communication. The Vlachs speak the Vlach language, which awaits standardization, which in this region is a form of the Oltenian subdialect. Both Serbs and Vlachs are Eastern Orthodox by denomination. There is currently controversy regarding the ethnic identification of the Vlach community.\n\nThe region is rich in copper and gold mines, especially in the Bor and Majdanpek areas.\n\n"}

It may have been used as late as the 19th century, when popular tradition still held the mountain to be off-limits for Christians.\n\nAccording to Lidman (1972:52) old people used to say: \"No Christian can go there. The mountains of the troll church belong to the heathen trolls. If a Christian ventures there, he will come to grief.\"\n\nIn fact, local tradition relates that the mountain was used not long ago for heathen rites and that anyone who was not initiated and saw it risked either to be buried in a bog in the forest or sworn into the brotherhood. These precautions clearly indicate that the rites took place as late as the period 1604–1735, which was a time when there was a penalty of death on practising such rituals. The rites are described in a folk poem documented by the folklorist Carshult (1941) when he documented the traditions on Skaga stave church. It has later been published in Karlsson (1970:62) and Lidman (1972:52).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5322650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5322650", "title": "Truncated spur", "text": "Truncated spur\n\nA truncated spur is a spur, which is a ridge that descends towards a valley floor or coastline from a higher elevation, that ends in an inverted-V face and was produced by the erosional truncation of the spur by the action of either streams, waves, or glaciers. Truncated spurs can be found within mountains, along the walls of river valleys, or along coastlines.\n\nA faceted spur is also a spur that ends in a triangular face, known as a triangular facet, with a broad base and an apex pointing upward. As typically used in geology, the triangular facet is usually a remnant of a fault plane and it and its associated faceted spur are the result of faulting. The term \"faceted spur\" is also applied to inverted-V rock faces formed by stream, wave, or glacial erosion and, thus, as a synonym for \"truncated spur\".\n\nBefore glaciation, relatively immature rivers display a pattern of interlocking spurs. A valley glacier cannot avoid the interlocking spurs as a river can. As the valley glacier moves, abrasion and plucking erode the protruding tips of the spurs, leaving steep cliff-like truncated spurs. Hanging valleys are found in between truncated spurs as they join the main glacial valley from the side. It is common for waterfalls to form from them, where they fall into the main valley. Such truncated spurs can be found in mountainous regions. The Mer de Glace, in the European Alps, is a valley through which a glacier currently flows. This is a geologically active process where the glacier continues to gradually erode the valley sides.\n\nIn the most typical usage of this term, faceted spurs are formed by active faulting, especially normal faulting that produces well-defined triangular facets along either a mountain front or edges of a rift valley. These triangular facets provide evidence for recent fault movement and are used in seismotectonic analysis. Classic examples of faceted spurs can be found all along the Central Wasatch Fault, north-central Utah.\n"}

The museum collects, preserves, and exhibits materials related to the cultural heritage of the Rocky Mountains of Canada, making them available for education as well as research. The museum, which contains an archive and a library, was the inspiration of Banff artists Peter and Catharine Whyte. The Alpine Club of Canada has dedicated the Peter and Catharine Whyte Hut on the Peyto Glacier after the couple.\n\nThe Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies is the largest privately funded public museum in Canada and is the fourth largest cultural history museum in Alberta. The Museum opened in 1968 and houses the Art Galleries, Archives, Heritage Gallery and Museum Shop. The four-acre site also includes two historic log homes, that can be visited during the summer, and four log cabins.\n\nThe museum was opened on June 16, 1968 by the Peter and Catharine Whyte Foundation. The Archives of the Canadian Rockies was the starting point of the museum and the Banff Library was incorporated in the Whyte Museum in 1970. The exhibition space saw several expansions during the 1980s and a new facility was opened in 1993. The museum acquires and exhibits art and artifacts from the Canadian Rockies, aiming to showcase the culture and history of the Rocky Mountains of Canada. Many of Byron Harmon's photographs, pioneer photographer of the Canadian Rockies, are housed at the museum.\n\nPeter and Catharine Whyte met at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Peter was a typical \"Banffite\", he participated in all the activities the area offered like skiing, hiking, horseback riding, etc. He was also an artist and had learnt a lot by accompanying artists that came to Banff in the early 20th century, including Carl Rungius, Aldro Hibbard, and J.E.H. MacDonald. He drove tourbusses and limousines for the Brewster Company. Catharine was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts to a fairly affluent family. Her father had been the treasurer and Vice President of the Stone & Webster Engineering Firm and her mother was a business woman in the 1890s. Her grandfather, Edward Sylvester Morse, had been the first director of the Peabody Museum in Salem. Her affluent lifestyle gave her a great childhood, but she was looking something more in her life. Peter and the Canadian Rockies offered her that; Catharine was a free spirit, and she believed in happiness over material goods. Peter and Catharine got married in 1930, and moved out to Banff to start their lives together. Catharine fell in love with Pete's mountains quickly. Their first summer they dedicated to painting wilderness and First Nations people, and in the autumn they arranged with Earl Spencer to build their log home studio, still located today on Museum property.\n\nFounded and initially endowed by Peter and Catharine in 1958, the Foundation originally had a broad base of interests. As well as acting as an agency for collecting and preserving the culture of the Canadian Rockies, the Wa-Che-Yo-Cha-Pa Foundation supported medical research and Native education. Peter and Catharine's extensive collection of artifacts and historical materials formed the nucleus of what became known as the Archives of the Canadian Rockies. Catharine increased the Foundation's endowments in 1971 and renamed it in honour of Peter who died in 1966. The Peter Whyte Foundation ceased to give money to other causes and used all of its income to support the new building which now housed the archives, gallery and library. Catharine Whyte, founder, benefactor and President of the Foundation passed away in 1979. The endowment was increased through her bequest and the remainder of the historic and artistic collections, including the Whyte and Moore homes, were left to the Foundation, which was renamed the Peter and Catharine Whyte Foundation.\n\nIn 1993 a new wing was added to the Whyte Museum to help it meet its full potential as a cultural tourism generator. The new wing added 13,000 square feet to the existing 16,000 square foot building, which was renovated at the same time the addition was completed. The construction and renovation project increased exhibition and public space, provided expanded storage space and conservation work areas, and expanded the Museum Shop and administration areas. The new building allowed the Museum to continue to collect, preserve and exhibit its growing collections.\n\nThe Heritage Collection began with the vision of Peter and Catharine Whyte. The collection includes artifacts that help tell the stories of Aboriginal people, artists, immigrants, guides and outfitters, climbers, surveyors, hikers, explorers, adventurers, skiers and residents of the town and area.\n\nThe Whyte Museum's art collection works to embody the artistic spirit and vision of the founders, Peter and Catharine Whyte. The collection spans the early 1800s to present day and includes regionally created and related works by Canadian and international artists.\n\nProminent/Notable Artists and Collections:\n\nThere are six homes on the property of the Whyte Museum. Two are available for entry during the summer tour season (the Moore home and the Whyte home), and the other four cabins are only able to be seen on the outside. These historic homes work to represent the lifestyle of Banff's earlier pioneers and the people who helped to shape the community and land into what it is today. They are aimed at preserving significant examples of Banff's earlier architectural styles and homes associated with some of the area's more noteworthy residents.\n\nThe Moore home is the home of collectors and community leaders Philip and Pearl (Brewster) Moore. The house was built in 1907 on Fox Street and was later donated to the Whyte Museum in 1971, leading to its transplant onto museum property. It belonged to Philip and Pearl Moore, who were early pioneers of the area and worked to preserve a lot of Banff's earlier history.\n\nThe home of Peter and Catharine (Robb) Whyte, the Museum's founders, philanthropists, world travellers and visual artists. The Whyte home was built in its current location in 1930-31 just after Peter and Catharine were married. It was originally meant to be a summer home, but as time went by it turned into a year-round residence.\n\nWelcoming visitors to the town of Banff is the face of the legendary guide Bill Peyto. Ebenezer William Peyto came to Banff from England in the early 1890s. Peyto, a prospector, hunter-trapper, warden and guide, used this cabin to store his outfitting and trapping supplies. With Peyto's cabin as well as those of Jack Sinclair, Jimmy Simpson, and Fred Ballard, this property by the Bow River became Banff's outfitting and guiding center. In the 1930s Peter and Catherine Whyte moved the cabin closer to their house and used it to house their Stoney friends while painting portraits.\n\nJack Sinclair was a prospector from Australia. After settling in Banff in the 1890s, Jack began packing for his prospecting companion and friend Bill Peyto. At the outbreak of the Boer war, Jack and Bill flipped a coin to see who would go forth to defend the Empire. Jack, losing the toss, stayed to look after their claims. Sinclair later decided to seek his own fortune in prospecting in Africa. The land near the Bow where the museum now stands was transferred to Dave White for $100 in 1910.\n\nWilliam Mather arrived in Banff from Ontario around 1910, where he entered into a boat rental business with Raymond Rooper. Bill later became sole owner and expanded the business to include ice skating in the winter. A well trained logman, Bill built the sturdy shaped timber cabin. This small structure was where Mather's four children were raised. Bill's wife once gave birth in the cabin during a large flood; the doctor who birthed the baby was wearing a pair of hipwaders! In later years Bill's son, Allen, rented the cabin out as part of a cabin rental business. The cabin was moved to the Whyte property from across the river in 1977.\n\nWindy is the sole remaining example of the original backcountry cabins used by the National Parks Warden Service. It is the third of a string of cabins that enabled the wardens to patrol the Parks frontiers against poaching. Built in 1911, Windy was located 45 kilometers north of Banff on the Panther River. As headquarters for the Panther River district, Windy was operated year-round. In the early 1970s, worried about the deterioration of this important structure, Parks Canada moved the cabin down the Cascade fire road to its present location. The Park Warden Service furnished Windy with appropriate artifacts in 1985.\n\nThe Whyte Museum's Archives & Library was established in 1966 to serve the unique mountain regions of Western Canada. The Archives & Library has various collections available, and holds the records and archival materials of the Alpine Club of Canada.\n\nThe Museum is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\nUnless specifically stated otherwise, the sources for this article are the Whyte Museum website and their online archives.\n"}
