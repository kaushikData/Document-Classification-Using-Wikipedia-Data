His most famous works are \"Ashkharatsuyts\" (\"Geography\") and \"Cosmography and the Calendar\". Robert H. Hewsen describes him as \"Armenia's First Scientist\".\n\nScholars do not agree on where Anania was born. Some historians believe that he was born in Shirakavan; others, that the village of Anania in Shirak or the city of Ani was his birthplace.\n\nUpon the recommendation of several of his friends who were returning from Constantinople, he decided to find a suitable teacher in Trebizond in the Byzantine Empire. There he met and fell under the tutelage of a renowned Greek scholar who spoke Armenian, Tychikos, and spent eight years learning mathematics there. Anania profited greatly from his mentor's teachings, as evidenced from the writings in his autobiography, \"[I] acquired a perfect knowledge of mathematics. In addition, he also learned a few elements of other sciences.\" He left Byzantium and returned to his homeland in 651, determined to spread his knowledge among his fellow Armenians, opening a school that taught the quadrivium and authoring textbooks to educate his students.\n\nThe education center Anania established could not have come at a better time and was a welcoming sight during an era when the study of mathematics was waning. After teaching for only several years, he had gained a famous reputation all throughout Armenia and abroad. The beginning of one of his most significant accomplishments came in 667 when the Armenian Apostolic Church invited him to Dvin and asked him to modify the Armenian calendar from a movable to fixed system.\nTaking into account the incompatibilities of the seven-day week, the lunar month, and the solar year, he worked for two years and devised a system that was based on cycle of 532 years. Anania's solution, though, was never adopted by the Church.\n\nAmong all his works, Anania is best known for writing the \"Ashkharhatsuyts\" (\"Geography\"). Up until recently, it was attributed to the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi but it is now believed by a number of experts such as Robert Hewsen and Suren T. Yeremyan to have been authored by Anania himself. Babken Harutyunyan, head of Chair of the History of Armenia at Yerevan State University, however disputes this and maintains that Movses Khorenatsi was the true author on the basis \"that all the manuscripts of the 'Ashxarhatsoyts' preserving the author's name, without exception, point at the Patmahayr [father of history] Movses Xorenatsi as an author of the work.\"\n\nThe \"Ashkharhatsuyts\" is a historical atlas that gives detailed information on the fifteen provinces of Armenia. Anania gives general information on \"the earth, its surface, climatic belts, seas\" and also includes information on Armenia's neighbors. The oldest extant manuscript in the field of Armenian geography preserved at the Matenadaran in Yerevan is Anania's \"Ashkharhatsuyts\".\n\nAnania also authored \"Cosmography and the Calendar\", a 48 chapter work that discusses astronomy, meteorology, and physical geography. He described the world as \"being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky).\" He also believed \"that the Milky Way is a mass of dense but faintly luminous stars and agreed with earlier philosophers that the moon was a dark body by nature whose only light was that which it reflected from the sun.\"\n\nAnania is considered the founder of the study of the natural sciences in Armenia. For centuries, his works were used at schools in Armenia as textbooks. The Anania Shirakatsi Medal is an Armenian State Award for scientists in the economics and natural sciences, engineers and inventors. In 2005, the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia issued an Anania Shirakatsi commemorative coin.\n\n\n\n"}

It contains a record of geodynamic processes during one of the most important episodes of continental growth in Phanerozoic time.\n\nThe CAOB stretches from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, occupying an area of about 5.3 million square kilometers, about 11% of the Asian surface area. It is bounded on the north by the Siberian craton and on the south by the North China craton and the Tarim craton, which provides substrate for the Tarim Basin. The CAOB encompasses parts of six nations: China, Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. It includes mountain ranges north of Tibet, including the Tian Shan (Chinese for \"heavenly mountains\") where a good example of Paleozoic arc accretion is exposed. The Altai Mountains of Russia, Kazakhstan, northwest China and western Mongolia also expose a complex accretionary terrane. CAOB rocks are also well exposed in Kazakhstan, the South Gobi Range of southern Mongolia, the Beishan and Inner Mongolia of northern China, the Sayan Mountains of southern Siberia just north of Mongolia, the ranges of Buryatia in southern Siberia south of Lake Baikal, and in the Far East of China and Russia.\n\nThere has been much discussion about the tectonic evolution of the CAOB over the last two decades, and these interpretations fall into two general groups.\n\nOne group of researchers suggests that the belt grew, in the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic, from the margin of the Siberian craton to the south through accretion of island arcs and Precambrian continental blocks until the evolution was terminated through collision with the North China and Tarim cratons in the latest Paleozoic to early Mesozoic. The original paleogeographic position of the continental blocks is debated, but some studies suggest a Gondwana affinity of many allochthonous terranes, whereas others infer a Siberian or Tarim origin for the same blocks . The second group of researchers regards the CAOB as mainly composed of a huge Paleozoic subduction-accretion complex, which accumulated against a single, long magmatic arc.\n\nThe CAOB, like other major accretionary orogens, consists of:\n\nThere are many controversies about CAOB tectono-magmatic evolution. One is the problem of juvenile versus recycled crust in the formation of CAOB igneous rocks. On one hand, the CAOB is considered to be the most important site of juvenile crust formation since the Neoproterozoic, because during its amalgamation, which involved terrains of different geodynamic origin overlain by magmatic units, massive amounts of granitic magmas were generated with juvenile Nd isotopic signatures. However, recently obtained detrital and xenocrystic zircon ages confirmed an important role for older crust in the orogen's evolution.\n\nThe modest Neoproterozoic and huge early-middle Paleozoic zircon age spectra match CAOB crustal growth very well but older peaks of ~1.8 Ga and ~2.7 Ga suggest the involvement of older crust.\n\n"}

CODs are 'best available' datasets that ensure consistency and simplify the discovery and exchange of key data. The data is typically geo-spatially linked using a coordinate system (especially administrative boundaries) and have unique geographic identification codes (P-codes).\n\nCommon operation datasets are commonly used and referenced by all operations, they provide consistency among all actors working on humanitarian preparedness and response and enable a common operational picture (COP) of the crisis. P-codes facilitate the exchange and harmonization of data and information, they provide a geographic framework for data collection, analysis, and visualization (see P-code) and allow for a better interoperability and exchange between different actors. Therefore, common cperation cdatasets (CODs) reduce duplication of work on baseline data by partnering organizations and facilitate informed decision making both pre- and post-crisis.\n\nThe Information Management Network (IM Network) is an important component of the common operational datatset (COD) process. The IM Network can exist at country, regional and global levels and is composed of the humanitarian information management actors active in the country, region or at the global level. Potential IM Network actors include governments, United NAtions agencies and programmes, humanitarian cluster information management staff, international and national NGOs.\n\nCore CODs are required in all disaster-prone countries as a preparedness measure, including administrative boundaries (COD-AB), sex and age-disaggregated population data (COD-PS), and humanitarian profile (caseload or COD-HP). They are critical for information and data products and to underpin effective coordination. Core CODs enable effective risk analysis, needs assessment, decision-making, and reporting on all aspects of the response.\n\nAdministrative Boundary CODs are baseline geographical datasets that are used by humanitarian agencies during preparedness and response activities. They are preferably sourced from official government boundaries but when these are unavailable the information management network must develop and agree to a process to develop or adopt an alternate dataset. Administrative boundaries provide an essential data standard and are used directly and indirectly in almost every information product.\n\nThe administrative boundary dataset is key in preparedness and undergoes a review process to keep the data up to date.\n\nPopulation Statistics CODs are the baseline population figures of a country pre-crisis situation. They are preferably developed by a government during a census but can also be derived from estimated figures. When neither of these options are available the information management network must develop and agree to a process to develop a dataset that can be used by humanitarian agencies during preparedness and response activities.\n\nPopulation statistics are required to inform programming in humanitarian response. Specifically, they are used to estimate the potential number of affected people or as a reference/resource in the development of needs assessments and in analysis.\n\nHumanitarian profile (affected people, people in need)\n\nCountry-specific Common Operational Datasets are a subset of the CODs that are specific to each country’s risk profile. They are datasets for which it is essential that the humanitarian community uses the same version of the data as a reference. The purpose of a country-specific COD is to provide a common reference for the humanitarian community to create a common operational picture (spatial datasets); to allow for further understanding of the situation (statistical data, tabular data etc); or to aid with assessments. Ideally, Country-specific CODs are identified and agreed to as a preparedness activity but the list should be reviewed and revised (if required) at the onset of a crisis based on the situation at that time and the humanitarian needs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe life cycle of a Common Operational Dataset (COD) is planning, collecting, processing, endorsing, communicating, maintaining.\n\nCommon Operational Datasets (CODs) are identified by the information management network (IM network) in a country or regionally. If there is no IM network in place all efforts are made at higher levels (e.g. global) to identify desired datasets. The IM network is responsible for collecting and maintaining the CODs and revising the datasets as required. CODs are made available online, if possible, prior to an emergency or shortly after disaster strikes.\n\nIM Network partners work together to develop a plan for all CODs including prioritization of datasets. The goal of the planning phase is to have an agreed upon list of commonly used datasets by partners. Once clear goals and objectives are identified, work can begin on the identification of sources and datasets.\n\nCollecting CODs is the process of locally acquiring datasets, and includes collection of metadata. The second part of the collection process is the evaluation phase that includes an examination of potential sources. The evaluation involves a quick in-country quality assurance check to ensure (potential) compliance with the minimum standard of data characteristics (spatial and attribute) and metadata. The process identifies potential problems or opportunities with datasets that should be considered when deciding what dataset should become the COD.\n\nIn the process phase the quality of the dataset is improved to the best standard possible. The processing phase cleans and standardizes the datasets and can be the most resource and time intensive stage of the COD cycle if the quality of the data is low.\n\nThe endorsement phase has 2 steps: validation and endorsement (in the country and at the global level).\n\nThe validation phase is a technical review on the Candidate COD and is done to ensure that the corrections made in the processing phase have created the best available COD.\n\nThe endorsement phase of CODs is the defining moment of the COD cycle as it is at this stage that operational partners agree that the candidate COD is going to be the referential dataset for humanitarian preparedness and response activities.\n\nThe Communication phase includes agreed upon means of sharing the dataset and also transparency about changes of the data in the process, available metadata and advocation for the use of common operational datatsets.\n\nMaintenance is an important step in the COD cycle as it ensures that the datasets are still relevant and accurate for humanitarian use. This is done at least once a year or in the timespan agreed upon.\n\nPlace Codes (P-Codes) are found in Administrative Boundary CODs. They are unique geographic (geo) identification codes, represented by combinations of letters and/or numbers to identify a specific location or feature on a map or within a database. For a specific place, point, or positional locations, the geo-codes have come into common usages as P-codes (abbreviated for Place-code). These terms can be essentially interchanged as long as one recognizes the focus on “position or place” for P-codes. They are also used to provide unique reference codes to refer to settlements or administrative boundaries in other datasets.\n\nWhilst some data-sets remain relatively constant (e.g. geographical features and administrative boundaries) others change (assessed disaster impacts and needs) and require to be regularly updated.\n\nCODs are intended to be used universally to improve coordination in humanitarian action; to build a common operational picture enabling more consistent activity and reduce duplication of data collection. The main source of curated CODs is the Humanitarian Data Exchange, though CODs may also be found on various governmental and independent websites.\n\nEssential Reading for OCHA IMOs\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\nAdvocacy Resources\n\n"}

The Constitution of Latvia recognises four distinct regions: Kurzeme, Zemgale, Latgale and Vidzeme.\n\n\nIn some cases, Kurzeme and Zemgale are combined into one region. This reflects the political division of Latvia between 1629 and 1917, when Kurzeme and Zemgale were together, first as the Duchy of Courland, then as the Courland Governorate in the Russian Empire while Vidzeme and Latgale were politically separate, both from Courland and one from another.\n\nFrom this perspective, there are three regions: Kurzeme (including Zemgale and Sēlija), Vidzeme and Latgale. Such division is no longer commonly used but it can be seen in the coat of arms of Latvia and the \"Monument of Freedom\" in Riga both of which contain three stars: for Kurzeme, Vidzeme and Latgale, which were united into Latvia in 1918.\n\n"}

Because they are separated by the International Date Line, Big Diomede is almost a day ahead of Little Diomede, but not completely; due to locally defined time zones, Big Diomede is only 21 hours ahead of Little Diomede (20 in summer; not 23 or 24 hours ahead—which is a common misconception). Because of this the islands are sometimes called Tomorrow Island (Big Diomede) and Yesterday Isle (Little Diomede).\n\nThe islands are named for Saint Diomedes, whose name is derived from the Greek words Διος (\"Dios\"), meaning \"of Zeus\", and μηδομαι (\"medomai\"), meaning \"to think, to plan\".\n\nThe islands are separated by an international border, which is also part of the International Date Line, about from each island, at 168°58'37\"W. At their closest points, the two islands are about apart. The small habitation on Little Diomede Island is centered on the west side of the island at the village of Diomede.\n\nThe Big Diomede Island is the easternmost point of Russia.\n\nThe Diomede Islands are often mentioned as likely intermediate stops for the hypothetical bridge or tunnel (Bering Strait crossing) spanning the Bering Strait.\n\nDuring winter, an ice bridge usually spans the distance between these two islands; therefore during such times it is theoretically possible (although not legal, since travel between the two islands is forbidden) to walk between the United States and Russia.\n\nThe first European to reach the Bering Strait was the Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnev in 1648. He reported two islands whose natives had bone lip ornaments, but it is not certain that these were the Diomedes. Danish navigator Vitus Bering re-discovered the Diomede Islands while leading a Russian expedition on 16 August (O.S., 26 August N.S.) 1728, the day when the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the memory of the martyr St. Diomede (hence, the name of the islands). In 1732, a Russian geodesist, Mikhail Gvozdev, determined longitude and latitude for the two islands.\n\nThe text of the 1867 treaty between the United States and Russia which finalized the Alaska purchase uses the islands to designate the boundary between the two nations: The border separates \"equidistantly Krusenstern Island, or Ignaluk, from Ratmanov Island, or Nunarbuk, and heads northward infinitely until it disappears completely in the Arctic Ocean.\"\n\nDuring the Cold War, that gap constituted the border between the US and the USSR, and became known as the \"Ice Curtain\". In 1987, however, Lynne Cox swam from one island to the other, and was congratulated by both Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan for her feat.\n\nIn summer 1995, British television actor and documentary presenter Michael Palin started his counterclockwise circumnavigation of the Pacific Rim, encompassing 18 different countries, on Little Diomede Island, as part of the BBC series \"Full Circle\". He intended to set foot on it again at the end of his eight-month trek, but was unable to do so because of rough seas.\n\nBig Diomede Island was traditionally the easternmost landmass before the International Date Line, and the first landmass to ring in a new year, if using local solar time. When using official time, however, a large area in eastern Russia and New Zealand also share the same time zone. New Zealand also has Daylight Saving time in effect during late December, but Russia does not (see time in New Zealand and time in Russia). This became moot in 1995, however, when the International Date Line was moved to the east of Kiribati and that country's easternmost time zone (GMT+14) is now the world's earliest.\n\nThe Soviet government relocated the indigenous population of Big Diomede Island to mainland Russia, and the island is now inhabited only by military units. Little Diomede has an Inupiat Inuit population of 170, entirely in the village site on the west side of the island, though the island as a whole comprises the City of Diomede. This village has a school and a store. Some Inuit residents are famous for their ivory carving. When weather permits, air contact is maintained with the island.\n\n\n"}

He was a son of Hendrik Muller Sz., a Rotterdam-based Dutch businessman and politician, and Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel, member of another prominent Rotterdam based business family.\n\nMuller started his career as a businessman, trading with East and West Africa. In his mid-twenties he travelled to Zanzibar, Mozambique, and South Africa for business purposes, but showed himself a keen ethnographer as well, collecting ethnographic artefacts and writing reports about the societies and people he encountered on his way. In 1890, Muller retired from business for personal reasons, and went to Germany to study ethnography and geography. He graduated with a PhD dissertation four years later.\n\nIn 1896 he was first appointed consul and later consul general for the Orange Free State. Muller held this position all through the Second Boer War and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902 Muller retired to a life of travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to Czechoslovakia, where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.\n\nMuller was a prolific writer. Over the course of his life he published well over two hundred articles, brochures, and books about his travels through the world, about South Africa and the Boers, and about Dutch foreign policy and diplomacy, apart from a range of other subjects. Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments. He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage.\n\nHendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller was born in Rotterdam (Netherlands) on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of Hendrik Muller Sz. and Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel. His father was a successful businessman based in Rotterdam and trading with Africa and the Netherlands East Indies. H.P.N. Muller's maternal grandfather, Abram van Rijckevorsel, was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community in the early part of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, liberals who staunchly defended the principle of free trade, and both were at one time members of the Senate of the States-General of the Netherlands.\n\nMuller's paternal grandfather was a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a Doopsgezind (Mennonite) minister and professor of theology in Amsterdam. The Muller family was fairly prominent in the Netherlands in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Christian ministers, professors of literature and history, archivists, antiquarian booksellers, statesmen and businessmen in their midst. \n\nMuller was destined to step into his father's footsteps and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the Hogere Burgerschool (high school) in Rotterdam, before continuing his education in Germany, at the \"Hohe Real Schule\" in Frankfurt-am-Main, to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool, Manchester, and Marseilles. His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882, to become interim manager of the Handels Compagnie Mozambique (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At the end of his trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting Natal, Zululand, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Colony. On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa.\n\nIn the 1880s Muller was active for his businesses, and travelled to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In the same year he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the Gold Coast, for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out with his father and younger brother Abram Muller, about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.\n\nAlready in the 1880s, Muller had dabbled in ethnography and writing. On the basis of materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled \"Zuid-Afrika\". It made him somewhat of a celebrity, and an expert on South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F. Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden.\n\nOnce freed from running the better part of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study geography and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis \"Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo\" (\"Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo\") was mainly based on secondary material, rather than the materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.\n\nAfter his return to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was originally only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.\n\nIn 1898 Muller travelled to South Africa, where he visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria he attended the inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, and chairman of the Volksraad C.H. Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner.\nOnce back in the Netherlands, the political situation in South Africa became tense very rapidly, and Muller did all he could to propagate the cause of the Boer Republics in the press and via diplomatic channels. Once the South African War broke out in October 1899, Muller set up an elaborate operation to support the cause of the war for the Orange Free State. He mobilised public support in the Netherlands, Germany and the United States of America and had public gatherings organised. Through his many contacts with the European press Muller saw to it that the Boer cause was extensively covered in the newspapers, usually in his own words, but published in the name of the respective editor. His office in The Hague was the hub of diplomatic and consular activity in this period, with several secretaries working continuously on the gathering of information and dealing with correspondence. In the war effort Muller cooperated with the in Dordrecht, the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging in Amsterdam, and of course the Transvaal's diplomatic representative in Brussels, Dr. W.J. Leyds. Originally the relationship between Muller and Leyds was cordial, but with time it soured and turned into open animosity. Both men were strong personalities with strong convictions. The fact that Muller was only consul general and Leyds an accredited diplomat was not helpful either and neither was the fact that – at least in Muller's opinion – the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek received much more attention than the Orange Free State. The first time problems arose in the open was in 1900, when the Boer Republics sent a joint Special Diplomatic Delegation to Europe and the United States, which was ill-prepared and for which Leyds had very different ideas than Muller.\n\nIn 1901 Muller travelled to the United States himself to mobilise support from President Theodore Roosevelt, especially on behalf of the women and children in the British concentration camps. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting Mexico, news reached Muller about the Peace of Vereeniging, making him jobless. Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it. In the years after the end of the South African War Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the Afrikaners, both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the Steyn family when they were in Europe for the President's recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1909 Muller travelled through Asia, a journey that produced several books and articles after his return, including a two-part report of his travels (\"Azië gespiegeld\"; Asia mirrored). Muller also published a scientific source publication on Cambodia and the earliest Dutch presence in French Indochina. The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the Légion d'Honneur for the latter. The French colony Annam made Muller a knight in the Order of the Dragon for his contributions to the history of Vietnam.\n\nMuller's Asian trip was comprehensive. He visited British India and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and French Indochina, travelled extensively through the Dutch East Indies, and returned via Japan, Korea – where he had an audience with the last Korean emperor –, Manchuria, China, and Siberia. Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest in this country and its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly under the auspices of the Comité Nederland-Japan (Dutch-Japanese Committee).\n\nIn 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge of one of the main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.\n\nFrom the 1890s onwards, Muller had published with great regularity about the importance of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.\n\nIn 1919, now already sixty years old, he got the chance to put his opinions on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch government appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, \"inter alia\" looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.\n\nHe resigned his post in 1932 after being requested to step back by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy. Muller decided not take his pension, allowing him to keep his title of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary until his death.\n\nFrom an early age Muller was interested in Dutch history, especially in the great national achievements of the Dutch during the centuries. During his lifetime Muller translated his interests in several concrete projects.\nIn line with his historical interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt (1625–1672). The statue was designed and made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close to the place where De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the freedom of the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.\n\nMuller funded the erection of a plaque in honour of the Dutch seventeenth-century admiral Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp in the newly built City Hall of his birthplace Rotterdam.\n\nIn the years after 1932 Muller travelled a little around Europe and retired to his house in The Hague. He remained involved in cultural and academic activities, organised his papers, and kept a keen interest in South African affairs. In the last years of his life he was honoured in several ways, among others with an honorary doctorate in law from the University of South Africa, a bust in the hall of the Eeufeesgebou of the University of the Free State, with a copy in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden, and an honorary diner party by the Royal Geographical Society in London. Without children and never fully reconciled with his family, Muller left almost his complete estate to the for the support of academic research and cultural heritage. Finally his health failed more and more and H.P.N. Muller died in his house in The Hague on 11 August 1941. He was buried in the cemetery of in The Hague in a grand ceremony, with the Dutch flag covering the coffin and the national anthem being played, in defiance of the and as a – somewhat old-fashioned – celebration of Dutch cultural identity. Among the attendants were several former government ministers and high-ranking military officers, university professors, former diplomats, representatives of cultural and scientific organisations, and friends from his South African period and after.\nDuring his lifetime H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work. He was extensively decorated by almost all the countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a Knight Grand Cross in military and civilian orders of Portugal, Liberia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, was commander of the French Legion of Honour, and knight in orders of Liberia, Annam and the Netherlands. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him.\n\nAlthough highly decorated, honoured and well respected for his work, Muller was not an easy person. This shows through in a consistently bad press he received during his lifetime and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.\n\nMuller was a member of several societies and associations:\n\n\nHe sometimes used these names, with or without 'Dr.' added:\n\n\n\nThe Dr Hendrik Muller Prize for Behavioural and Social Sciences was named after Hendrik Muller. The prize is awarded every other year by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences to a researcher who has made a valuable contribution to the behavioural and social sciences.\n\nDuring his life, H.P.N. Muller published well over 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these – especially his newspaper articles – were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles he wrote about the South African War when he was consul general for the Orange Free State were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, to maximise the public relations effect.\n\nThis bibliography only lists Muller's main book publications and some key articles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first town immediately to the north of the pass is Tashidian. The Iron Gate Pass was of historical strategical significance because it formed a vulnerable bottle-neck on the Silk Road.

The modern road (G218) from Yanqi to Korla passes through the mountains to the east of the gorge.\n\nThe gorge of the Iron Gate Pass is the setting of a legendary love story. According to the legend, a princess of the Kingdom of Yanqi called Tzouhla had fallen in love with a poor herdsman named Tayir. The royal court opposed the relationship and a minister Karehan convinced the king to have Tayir killed. As the princess tried to rescue her lover from the king's soldiers, they both fell to their death in the gorge.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, German scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or \"Ortsnamenkunde\". These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of genealogy. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternative names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology.\n\nLatin place names are not always exclusive to one place — for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with \"Colonia\" and then a more descriptive term. During the Middle Ages, these were often shortened to just \"Colonia\".

The EU is the world's largest economic union, customs union and donor of humanitarian and development assistance and thus has an extensive network of delegations around the world mainly operating in the framework of External Relations, for which the European Commission is the main decision body. The EU also represents shared political and security viewpoints held by its member states, as articulated in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.\n\nThe EU's predecessor, the European Coal and Steel Community, opened its first mission in London in 1955, three years after non-EU countries began to accredit their missions in Brussels to the Community. The US had been a fervent supporter of the ECSC's efforts from the beginning, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson sent Jean Monnet a dispatch in the name of President Truman confirming full US diplomatic recognition of the ECSC. A US ambassador to the ECSC was accredited soon thereafter, and he headed the second overseas mission to establish diplomatic relations with the Community institutions.\n\nThe number of delegates began to rise in the 1960s following the merging of the executive institutions of the three European Communities into a single Commission. Until recently some states had reservations accepting that EU delegations held the full status of a diplomatic mission. Article 20 of the Maastricht Treaty requires the Delegations and the Member States’ diplomatic missions to \"co-operate in ensuring that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council are complied with and implemented\".\n\nManagement of the EU External Relations is conducted by the European External Action Service which reports to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. Delegates are generally sent only to capital cities and cities hosting multilateral bodies.\n\nThe EU missions work separately from the work of the missions of its member states, however in some circumstances it may share resources and facilities.

Since 2005, Metropolitan Stockholm is defined by official Swedish Statistics as all of Stockholm County. It is the largest of the three metropolitan areas in Sweden.\n\nMetropolitan Stockholm is divided into 5 areas: Stockholm City Centre, Söderort, Västerort of Stockholm Municipality; and the northern suburbs and southern suburbs, which consists of several municipalities.\n\nMetropolitan Gothenburg (\"Storgöteborg\" or literally Greater Gothenburg), is a metropolitan area surrounding the city of Gothenburg in Sweden. The metropolitan region is located in Västra Götaland County, except for the municipality of Kungsbacka, which is located to the south in Halland County. As of 2005, the municipalities of Alingsås and Lilla Edet were added to the region. The region is often used for statistical measures, and estimates in the 1960s predicted that the region would have about one million inhabitants in the year 2000. The region is the second largest metropolitan area in Sweden after Metropolitan Stockholm.\n\nGreater Malmö (\"Stormalmö\"), also known as Metropolitan Malmö is the metropolitan area of Malmö in Sweden. The area is located in Southwestern Scania (\"Sydvästra Skåne\"), which is often considered synonymous with Greater Malmö, and it is part of the wider transnational Öresund Region. Besides Malmö, large towns in Greater Malmö includes Lund and Trelleborg, the former of which was the seat of the historical Catholic Archdiocese of Lund.\n\nSince the 1970s, improvements in highways and the regional and InterRegio train networks means the commuting area has grown to include Ystad, Skurup, Sjöbo, Eslöv, Höör, Landskrona and Helsingborg, though only some of these are included in official definitions of Greater Malmö. It's not uncommon to live in Malmö and work either in Ystad or Helsingborg, or vice versa, but these towns have kept their mental allegiance with older divisions of Scania. Commuting across the Öresund has become more common, both through the Øresund Bridge and the HH Ferry route, at which car ferries departs every 12 minutes in summer (every 15 minutes in winter).\n\nStatistics Sweden, which sets the official definitions for all metropolitan areas in Sweden, has changed which municipalities are included in Greater Malmö over time.

Best known for his works of décollage and psychogeographics, made from torn advertising posters. He was associated to the Ultra-Lettrists an offshoot of Lettrism and later was a member of the \"Nouveau Réalisme\", founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre Restany.\n\nAfter finishing school studies he moves to Naples in 1933 to pursue his artistic studies, but he got a job at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1941, he moved to Rome. He remains in the capital only for a short period, because he is called up. In 1944 he left the army and he graduated from the Art School of Naples. Between 1944 and 1945 he teaches drawing in Catanzaro. In 1945 he returned to Rome and, following his figurative beginnings and first experimentations, he began to paint new-geometric paintings. He starts in 1947 to participate at the exhibition, with the Exhibition Board of Fine Arts and the annual Art Club. In 1949 he devoted himself to the phonetic poetry experiments, calling epistaltic (a meaningless neologism), which in the same year he draws up the Manifesto (published by L.Sinisgalli in \"Civilization of machines\")\n\nIn 1951 he had his first contact with French art, exhibiting in Paris at the Salon des Nouvelles Réalités. Between 1951 and 1952, he obtained the award of a scholarship from the Fulbright Foundation, which allows him to travel to the US as an \"Artist in Residence\" at the University of Kansas City. Also in 1952 he realized the second personal exhibithion at the Rockhill Nelson Gallery in Kansas City. In the United States he had the opportunity to meet representatives of the new artistic currents: Robert Rauschenberg, Claes Oldenburg, Cy Twombly, Jackson Pollock and Yves Klein.\n\nIn 1953, he suffers from an artistic crisis, during which interrupts his pictorial production. Now convinced that there is nothing to be done again in art, suddenly what he calls \"Zen illumination\": the discovery of the advertising poster as artistic expression of the city. Thus the décollage (early collages) was born: paste on canvas pieces of torn posters of the street, by adopting the collages of the cubists and contaminating it with Dadaist array of ready made. In 1955, in Rome, in the exhibition \"actual art exhibition\", he exhibited for the first time the 'torn poster'. Later, he practiced the so-called double décollage: the poster firstly removed from the billboard, then torn up in his studio. In those years he also made use of the retro d'affiche, using the posters pasted on the side and obtaining non-figurative and monochrome works.\n\nThe first awards arrive in 1956 with the Graziano Award and in 1957 with the Battistoni Prize and Public Education. With the Cinecittà series of 1958, select figures and faces of film advertising directing production toward more figurative works. At the end of the Fifties, Rotella, is labeled by critics as a ripper or painter of glued paper. At night, tearing not only posters but also pieces of sheet metal from frames of the billboard zones of the Rome Municipality. In 1958 he receives in Rome the visit of the French critic Pierre Restany, with whom he began a long association. In the same year he participated in Rome in the exhibition \"New Italian art trends\" organized by Lionello Venturi in the seat of Rome - New York Art Foundation. The curiosity of the public for the artist's extravagances, culminated in 1960 with the creation, the work of Enzo Nasso, a short film dedicated to angry Painters, which cure Rotella spoken commentary.\n\nAlso in 1960 he joined the New Realism - but he didn't sign the manifesto - theorist of which Pierre Restany and bringing together, among others, Yves Klein, Spoerri, Tinguely, César, Arman and Christo. The group will also take part in the French Hains, Dufrêne and Villeglé, operating on décollage in the same years, but independently.\nTogether with décollages, Rotella also performs assemblage of objects bought from junk dealers as bottle caps or cords. Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism, with the Informal and the spatial and material research in those years, Lucio Fontana and Alberto Burri taking place in Italy, they play an important role in the orientation of Rotella. In 1961 he composed a historical exhibition À 40 ° au-dessus de Dada, edited in Paris by Restany. In 1962 he gives a presentation on his art at the School of Visual Arts in New York and in 1964 he was invited to the Venice Biennale and, in 1965, the IX Quadrennial of Rome.\nUsing typographic tools, between 1967 and 1973 he created his Art-typo, prints chosen and reproduced freely on the canvas. This procedure is able to overlap and superimpose advertising images, reversing the previous approach.\nIn the early seventies produces some works by intervening on the advertising pages of magazines with the use of solvents and reducing or state at the imprint (frottage) or deleting one (effaçage). In 1972, he published his autobiography entitled Autorotella.\nIn 1975 he recorded his first disc of phonetic poetry and in 1976 he took part in the \"International Poetry Recital Sonora - Poetry Action\". Another trial, in those years, it is that of rolling up posters and closing them in plexiglass cubes.\n\nFinally he left Paris to settle in Milan (1980), in the eighties he processes the \"blanks\" or affiches covers: zeroed advertising posters covered with white sheets, as with the expired advertisement. In 1984 he made the second cycle of works dedicated to the cinema: Cinecittà 2. After 1986 he realizes 'Sovrapitture', inspired by graffiti: intervenes pictorially of torn poster glued on canvas. It drew anonymous writings, such as those that can be read on city walls: love notes and political slogans, etc., in a double message. In 1990 he participated at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in the exhibition \"Art et Pub\" and the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibition \"High and Low\". He married in 1991 with the Russian Inna Agarounova, and in 1993 they had a child called Asya.\nIn 1992 from the French Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, he receives the title of 'Officiel des arts et des Lettres'.\nA foundation dedicated to him was established in 2000, to the artist's will: the 'Fondazione Mimmo Rotella', with the aim of collecting the works and documents cataloged in the artistic life of the teacher. In 2004 Rotella received an honorary degree in Architecture at the University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria.\n\nHe was invited to the New York Guggenheim Museum in 1994 for the exhibition \"Italian Metamorphosis\", then again at the Centre Pompidou in 1996 in \"Face à l'Histoire\", and in 1996 the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in \"Halls of Mirrors \"exhibition subsequently exported all over the world. The Federico Fellini film dedicates the series of works called Fellini.\n\nHe died in Milan on January 8, 2006 at the age of 88 years.\n\nDécollage is an artistic technique of collage to the opposite procedure. Instead of adding elements of the work, it starts from an artistic object from which the parts are detached. The idea of decollage was born during a period of \"artistic crisis\" and took place following the trip to the US, during which he was in contact with members of the New Dada. Back in Rome he became inspired by torn posters around the town and began to carry them in his studio and to work on them. The result was the creation of canvases on which pasted wheel one or more pieces of torn posters, often superimposed. Rotella wanted to somehow find some form of artistic innovation and at the same time give artistic dignity to a common object, and of little value removed from its natural environment.\nThe first trials of Rotella with decollage date back to 1953. The first decollage, in most small cases, were exhibited for the first time in the spring of 1955.\n\nThe two roads that Rotella takes on simultaneously, starting in 1953-1954 are those of decollage and retro posters. The first retro d'affiche documented date back to 1954. The retro d'affiche are displayed for the first time to the public in December 1955 at the personal exhibition the artist held at the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan. Unlike decollage where often textural layers are wrapped together and manipulated, in the back of posters the artist retains the \"urban relic\". In these works his speech tends to be subtle, the colors are often absent, the surface is gritty and raw, it has compared to decollage a more targeted research to informal language, except that it will become evident starting especially from the sixties when decollages in expected to bet influenced by the rising pop language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Due to avalanches in 2014 and 2015, this was the last big summiting year until 2016.\n\nThe 2013 Himalayan Database recorded 658 summits, which brought the total number to 6,871 by 4,042 different persons. The year's total was greater than 2007's 633 summiters, the previous yearly record.\n\nIn 2013, Yuichiro Miura became the oldest person to reach the summit, at age 80. \n\nA Eurocopter AS350 B3 flown by Maurizio Folini achieved a record breaking rescue at on the morning of 21 May, retrieving Sudarshan Gautam, who was descending the mountain after becoming the first person without arms to summit Everest without using prosthetics. Gautam was rescued after collapsing near Camp 3.\n\nOn 21 May, Arunima Sinha became the first female amputee to summit Everest.\n\nPhurba Tashi completed his 21st summit in May, a total equal to the record held by Apa Sherpa.\n\nOn 27 April, three climbers were attacked by a group of 100 Sherpas at 21,000 feet elevation. The event was seen as an aberration in the otherwise decades-long spirit of teamwork and friendship on the mountain. Sherpas have a reputation for going to extraordinary lengths for climbers, and being generous in sharing Everest with visitors to Nepal. \n\nEarlier in the day, a group of three climbers on the Lhotse Face had crossed over lines being laid by the Sherpas, contrary to the etiquette that climbers should avoid Sherpas working on the mountain. Words were exchanged and the situation escalated. An ice pick was brandished and ice and stones were thrown. The Sherpas then left the Lhotse Face, but later visited the camp site with about 100 others and threatened to kill one of the three climbers. The climber was upset because he considered himself a friend of the Sherpa community, had built a school for nearly 400 Sherpa children, and also had funded free evacuations via helicopters for Sherpas. \nThe American climber Melissa Arnot helped defuse the fight. The 29-year-old Arnot placed herself between the attackers and the climbers. She had friendly relationships with both the climbers and the high-altitude Sherpas, and managed to bring a halt to the fighting. She then negotiated a truce between the mountaineers.\n\nThe Nepalese government said if climbers were attacked, action would be taken against the aggressors. An official from the Nepal tourism ministry described the attack as a misunderstanding that had been sorted out and pledged to ensure the safety of climbers. The three ringleaders of the attack were removed from the mountain. Sherpas are renowned for the most part for their climbing skill and demeanour, with one Everest climber noting, \"To a man everyone seems to be absolutely impressed with the Sherpas. Not just their strength on the mountain, which is legendary, but their personalities and their friendliness. They become your friends.\" The fight led to improved communication between the people on the mountain, which helped to overcome the cultural and language barriers that complicated an already difficult environment.\n\nThere were 8 fatalities attributed to mountaineering. One of the losses was the well-known and respected climber, Alexi Bolotov, who died in the Khumbu Icefall when the rope he was rappelling down broke.\n"}

{"id": "10063629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10063629", "title": "Rank-size distribution", "text": "Rank-size distribution\n\nRank-size distribution is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the rank-frequency distribution, when the source data are from a frequency distribution. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a power law distribution, or less well-known ones such as a stretched exponential function or parabolic fractal distribution, at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below.\n\nA rank-size distribution is not a probability distribution or cumulative distribution function. Rather, it is a discrete form of a quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank.\n\nIn the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.\n\nWhen any log-linear factor is ranked, the ranks follow the Lucas numbers, which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, etc. Like the more famous Fibonacci sequence, each number is approximately 1.618 (the Golden ratio) times the preceding number. For example, the third term in the sequence above, 4, is approximately 1.618, or 4.236; the fourth term, 7, is approximately 1.618, or 6.854; the eighth term, 47, is approximately 1.618, or 46.979. With higher values, the figures converge. An equiangular spiral is sometimes used to visualize such sequences.\n\nA rank-size (or rank-frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for market segmentation, but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies.\n\nMost simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two, termed the head and tail. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically middle, also belly, torso, and body. These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly \"long tail\", also \"fat belly\", \"chunky middle\", etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called \"top-tier\", \"mid-tier\", and \"bottom-tier\".\n\nThe relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterizes a distribution, analogously to the skewness or kurtosis of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused?\n\nThese distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the 90–9–1 principle, which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving form letters; and the line is simply as far as resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop.\n\nPurely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first \"p\" portion of ranks, which account for formula_1 of the overall population, as in the 80:20 Pareto principle, where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point—and for power laws can be computed from the Pareto index.\n\nSegments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the king effect, where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a piecewise function. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a broken power law for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this.\n\nThe Yule–Simon distribution that results from preferential attachment (intuitively, \"the rich get richer\" and \"success breeds success\") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to \"very well capture\" word frequency versus rank distributions. It originated from trying to explain the population verses rank in different species. It has also been show to fit city population versus rank better.\n\nThe rank-size rule (or law), describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena, including the distribution of city sizes, the sizes of businesses, the sizes of particles (such as sand), the lengths of rivers, the frequencies of word usage, and wealth among individuals.\n\nAll are real-world observations that follow power laws, such as Zipf's law, the Yule distribution, or the Pareto distribution. If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the natural logarithm of the rank and of the city population, the resulting graph will show a log-linear pattern. This is the rank-size distribution.\n\nOne study claims that the rank size rule \"works\" because it is a \"shadow\" or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon. The true value of rank size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure (since other power-law formulas are more accurate, especially at ranks lower than 10) but rather as a handy measure or \"rule of thumb\" to spot power laws. When presented with a ranking of data, is the third-ranked variable approximately one-third the value of the highest-ranked one? Or, conversely, is the highest-ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth-ranked one? If so, the rank size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship.\n\nWhile Zipf's law works well in many cases, it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries; one type of deviation is known as the King effect. A 2002 study found that Zipf's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries, far more than would be expected based on random chance. The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs. A 2004 study showed that Zipf's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries. In the richer countries, the distribution was flatter than predicted. For instance, in the United States, although its largest city, New York City, has more than twice the population of second-place Los Angeles, the two cities' metropolitan areas (also the two largest in the country) are much closer in population. In metropolitan-area population, New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles. In other countries, the largest city would dominate much more than expected. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the capital, Kinshasa, is more than eight times larger than the second-largest city, Lubumbashi. When considering the entire distribution of cities, including the smallest ones, the rank-size rule does not hold. Instead, the distribution is log-normal. This follows from Gibrat's law of proportionate growth.\n\nBecause exceptions are so easy to find, the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city-systems in different countries. The rank-size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established. A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy, but countries with a dominant \"primate city\" clearly vary from the rank-size rule in the opposite manner. Therefore, the rule helps to classify national (or regional) city-systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city. Countries with a primate city, for example, have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern. If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank-size rule (i.e. if the rank-size principle correlates with central place theory), then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern. For example—the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule. By contrast, small countries that had been connected (e.g. colonially/economically) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule, compared with the other cities—the excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone.\n\n"}

Spatio-spectral scanning yields a series of thin, diagonal slices of the data cube. Figuratively speaking, each acquired image is a 'rainbow-colored' spatial map of the scene. More precisely, each image represents two spatial dimensions, one of which is wavelength-coded. To acquire the spectrum of a given object point, scanning is needed.\n\nSpatio-spectral scanning combines some advantages of spatial and spectral scanning: Depending on the context of application, one can choose between a mobile and a stationary platform. Moreover, each image is a spatial map of the scene, facilitating pointing, focusing, and data analysis. This is particularly valuable for irregular or irretrievable scanning movements. Being based on dispersion, spatio-spectral scanning systems yield high spatial and spectral resolution.\n\nA prototypical spatio-spectral scanning system, introduced in June 2014, consists of a basic slit spectroscope (slit + dispersive element) at some suitable, non-zero distance before a camera. (If the effective camera distance is zero, the system is applicable to spatial scanning). The imaging process is based on spectrally-decoded camera obscura projections: A series of projections from a continuous array of pinholes (= the slit) is projected onto the dispersive element, each projection contributing a rainbow-colored strip to the recorded two-dimensional image. The field of view in the wavelength-coded spatial dimension asymptotically approaches the dispersion angle of the dispersive element as the camera distance from the dispersive element approaches infinity.\nScanning is achieved by moving the camera transverse to the slit (stationary platform), or by moving the entire system transverse to the slit (mobile platform).\n\nAn advanced spatio-spectral scanning system, proposed in June 2014, consists of a dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. (This allows for easy switching between spatial and spatio-spectral scanning). The imaging process is based on spectral analysis of a strip of a dispersed image of the scene. The field of view in the wavelength-coded spatial dimension equals the dispersion angle of the dispersive element. As in the more basic system, scanning is achieved by transverse movement of the slit or by moving the system relative to the scene. \n"}

{"id": "3154072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3154072", "title": "Tracking system", "text": "Tracking system\n\nA tracking system is used for the observing of persons or objects on the move and supplying a timely ordered sequence of location data for further processing.\n\nIn virtual space technology, a tracking system is generally a system capable of rendering virtual space to a human observer while tracking the observer's coordinates. For instance, in dynamic virtual auditory space simulations, a real-time head tracker provides feedback to the central processor, allowing for selection of appropriate head-related transfer functions at the estimated current position of the observer relative to the environment.\n\nThere are myriads of tracking systems. Some are 'lag time' indicators, that is, the data is collected after an item has passed a point for example a bar code or choke point or gate. Others are 'real-time' or 'near real-time' like Global Positioning Systems (GPS) depending on how often the data is refreshed. There are bar-code systems which require a person to scan items and automatic identification (RFID auto-id). For the most part, the tracking worlds are composed of discrete hardware and software systems for different applications. That is, bar-code systems are separate from Electronic Product Code (EPC) systems, GPS systems are separate from active real time locating systems or RTLS for example, a passive RFID system would be used in a warehouse to scan the boxes as they are loaded on a truck - then the truck itself is tracked on a different system using GPS with its own features and software. The major technology “silos” in the supply chain are:\n\nIndoors assets are tracked repetitively reading e.g. a barcode, any passive and active RFID and feeding read data into Work in Progress models (WIP) or Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) or ERP software. The readers required per choke point are meshed auto-ID or hand-held ID applications.\n\nHowever tracking could also be capable of providing monitoring data without binding to a fixed location by using a cooperative tracking capability, e.g. an RTLS.\n\nOutdoors mobile assets of high value are tracked by choke point,\n802.11, Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), Time Delay on Arrival (TDOA), active RFID or GPS Yard Management; feeding into either third party yard management software from the provider or to an existing system. Yard Management Systems (YMS) couple location data collected by RFID and GPS systems to help supply chain managers to optimize utilization of yard assets such as trailers and dock doors. YMS systems can use either active or passive RFID tags.\n\nFleet management is applied as a tracking application using GPS and composing tracks from subsequent vehicle's positions. Each vehicle to be tracked is equipped with a GPS receiver and relays the obtained coordinates via cellular or satellite networks to a home station. Fleet management is required by:\n\nOne such use of the RFID technology is in tracking IDs of students. Using GPS IDs would resolve the decreasing attendance in schools by monitoring the whereabouts of students when they did not attend class (Jensen, 2008). It is also used to efficiently check attendance. Perks of this tracking system is allowing students to check out library books buy food in the cafeterias (Jensen, 2008). The GPS IDs also act as a security measure to monitor any unwanted visitors or an emergency locator if a student cannot be found (Jensen, 2008). In the Spring Independent School District, students have been using for many years in check that students are staying in school during the day. Since they have instigated the system, attendance has increased thus schooling funding has increased as well (Jensen, 2008).\n\nRecently, debates over the Fourth Amendment have come up. Conservative students wish to keep their privacy and forbid to wear tracking devices, especially hackers can break into these systems to find out students’ information. Since many schools, such as those in the Spring Independent School District, require students to wear the tracking IDs, students argue that it is an immediate violation of their privacy (Jensen, 2008). Yet, the Fourth Amendment is not violated in these cases since students are not tracked in their homes (Warner, 2007). Each school’s decision over GPS IDs varies as states develop laws against these IDs in schools and as students protest for their privacy rights.\n\nLocation-based services or LBS is a term that is derived from the telematics and telecom world. The combination of A-GPS, newer GPS and cellular locating technology is what has enabled the latest “LBS” for handsets and PDAs. Line of sight is not necessarily required for a location fix. This is a significant advantage in certain applications since a GPS signal can still be lost indoors. As such, A-GPS enabled cell phones and PDAs can be located indoors and the handset may be tracked more precisely. This enables non-vehicle centric applications and can bridge the indoor location gap, typically the domain of RFID and RTLS systems, with an off the shelf cellular device.\n\nCurrently, A-GPS enabled handsets are still highly dependent on the LBS carrier system, so handset device choice and application requirements are still not apparent. Enterprise system integrators need the skills and knowledge to correctly choose the pieces that will fit the application and geography.\n\nRegardless of the tracking technology, for the most part the end-users just want to locate themselves or wish to find points of interest. The reality is that there is no \"one size fits all\" solution with locating technology for all conditions and applications.\n\nApplication of tracking is a substantial basis for vehicle tracking in fleet management, asset management, individual navigation, social networking, or mobile resource management and more. Company, group or individual interests can benefit from more than one of the offered technologies depending on the context.\n\nGPS has global coverage but can be hindered by line-of-sight issues caused by buildings and urban canyons. RFID is excellent and reliable indoors or in situations where close proximity to tag readers is feasible, but has limited range and still requires costly readers. RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification. This technology uses electromagnetic waves to receive the signal from the targeting object to then save the location on a reader that can be looked at through specialized software (Warner, 2007).\n\nRTLS are enabled by Wireless LAN systems (according to IEEE 802.11) or other wireless systems (according to IEEE 802.15) with multilateration. Such equipment is suitable for certain confined areas, such as campuses and office buildings. RTLS require system-level deployments and server functions to be effective.\n\n"}
