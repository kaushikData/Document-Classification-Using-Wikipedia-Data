{"id": "28948227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28948227", "title": "Bock (Luxembourg)", "text": "Bock (Luxembourg)\n\nThe Bock () is a promontory in the north-eastern corner of Luxembourg City's old historical district. Offering a natural fortification, its rocky cliffs tower above the River Alzette which surrounds it on three sides. It was here that Count Siegfried built his Castle of \"Lucilinburhuc\" in 963, providing a basis for the development of the town which became Luxembourg. Over the centuries, the Bock and the surrounding defences were reinforced, attacked and rebuilt time and time again as the armies of the Burgundians, Habsburgs, Spaniards, Prussians and French vied for victory over one of Europe's most strategic strongholds, the Fortress of Luxembourg. Warring did not stop until the Treaty of London was signed in 1867, calling for the demolition of the fortifications. Ruins of the old castle and the vast underground system of passages and galleries known as the casemates continue to be a major tourist attraction.\n\n \nIt was in 963 that Count Siegfried, in search of a site from which he could defend his properties, obtained the Bock and its surroundings from St Maximin's Abbey in Trier in exchange for the land he owned at Feulen in the Ardennes to the north. The Romans, then the Franks, had probably already inhabited the Bock although there is only scant archeological evidence of their presence. There are however traces of a 4th-century Roman watchtower close to the point in the Fish Market where two major Roman roads used to cross, one from Reims to Trier and the other from Metz to Liège.\nThe first historical mention of the Bock is indeed in connection with a watchtower or fortification on the Roman road from Reims to Trier which, in 723, was ceded by Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, to the Abbey of St Maximin in Trier. Two centuries later, Count Siegfried, who had properties \"in Feulen, Hosingen and Monnerich in the \"Pagus Wabrensis\", in Sarreburg, Berncastel and Roussy in the \"Pagus Mosellanus\"\", was looking for a location for a castle able to withstand any onslaught which would serve as a central point for his holdings. After failing to obtain a site near the Abbey of Stavelot, now in the Belgian province of Liège, he approached the Abbot of St Maximin's for the purchase of the property high up on the Bock cliff above the Alzette River, described as a \"castle by name Lucilinburhuc\" (\"castellum quod dicitur Lucilinburhuc\"). It therefore seems as if there was already a castle on the site before Siegfried became interested in it and that it was not Siegfried who called it Lucilinburhuc. After the consent of Emperor Otto I had been obtained, the deed was signed by Viker, Abbot of St Maximin's, on 7 April 963. Siegfried acquired the site in exchange for some of his properties at Feulen.\nOver the centuries, Siegfried's fortified castle on the Bock was considerably enlarged and protected with additional walls and defences. In 987, the castle chapel was built at the nearby Fish Market. Today's St Michael's Church stands on the same site. Under Conrad I, the castle became the residence of the Counts of Luxembourg. It was damaged, destroyed, captured and rebuilt on several occasions as the Burgundians (1473), the Habsburgs (1477), and the Spaniards (1555) attacked and took the fortress.\n\nAs time passed, the fortifications needed to be adapted to new methods of war based on increasingly strong firepower. During the 1640s under the Spaniards, the Swiss engineer Isaac von Treybach significantly reworked the defences. The Bock was also strengthened with three forts, the Large Bock, Middle Bock and Small Bock (from west to east), separated from each other by cuts in the rock and linked by bridges. As a result, little remained of the medieval castle.\n\nA little later in 1684, on behalf of Louis XIV, Vauban succeeded in capturing the city of Luxembourg during a month-long siege under which the Bock fortifications were completely flattened. Thereafter Vauban, perhaps the most competent fortification engineer of his day, undertook major additions to the defences, realizing that underground passages and chambers were just as important as the surface installations. The Large Bock, connected to the old town by the Pont du Château, was further reinforced. Enclosed by a wall 12 m (39 ft) high, it was the major component of the new fortress.\nIn addition to these structures, the Bock also included a system of casemates which originated in the cellars of the medieval castle. In 1744, during the Austrian period, these underground passages were considerably enlarged by General Neipperg. The main passage. which still remains, is 110 m long and up to 7 m wide. Branches leading off on either side were equipped with no less than 25 cannon slots, 12 to the north and 13 to the south, offering considerable firepower. In the event of war, the Bock casemates, covering an area of 1,100 m, could be used as barracks for several hundred soldiers. Water was supplied from a well 47 m deep.\n\nThanks to its defences, in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, the city held out against a French siege for seven months. When the garrison finally surrendered, the walls were still unbreached. This led the French politician and engineer Lazare Carnot to call the Luxembourg fortress \"the best in the world, apart from Gibraltar\". As a result, it has often been called the Gibraltar of the North.\n\nThe fortifications were finally demolished under the terms of the Treaty of London in 1867. The demolition took 16 years and cost the enormous sum of 1.5 million gold francs.\n\nThe two-storey bridge connecting the Bock to the old town was an important component of the fortifications. Technically, it is a rather curious structure. Built in 1735 by the Austrians, it provides no less than four ways of crossing between the cliffs: the road over the top, a passage by way of the four upper arches, a spiral staircase up through the main arch and a tunnel under the road at the bottom.\n\nOver the years, the Bock casemates have received several famous visitors. These include:\n\nThere have reportedly been people that have seen Melusine in the waters nearby.\n\n"}

Most are in Nigeria, with important areas Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea/Gabon and patches in Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, and northern Angola. The largest area in the region is on the delta of the Niger River on the Gulf of Guinea, while others include the eastern side of the Cross River delta in Nigeria and Cameroon, the Wouri estuary in Cameroon, and the Muni River estuary on the border of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. As well as being home to much wildlife the mangroves hold rivers in place, filter the waters and create build-ups of nutrient rich soil on the banks. Mangroves thrive in humid tropical climates where the sea is warm, and where high tides flood into the rivers. Therefore, there is less on the coast of the Congo, where the Benguela Current brings cool seas, but there are patches here and further south in Angola.\n\nThere are five main species of mangrove trees in the ecoregion: red mangrove (\"Rhizophora mangle\"), \"Rhizophora racemosa\", and \"Rhizophora harrisonii\", black mangrove (\"Avicennia germinans\") and white mangrove (\"Laguncularia racemosa\"), while the palm \"Nypa fruticans\" has been introduced from Asia.\n\nThe rich communities of oysters, crabs, invertebrates and the great variety of fish sheltering and spawning in the mangroves sustain animal life including monkeys, African manatee (\"Trichechus senegalensis\"), and turtles like the African softshell turtle (\"Trionyx triunguis\"). Birds include breeding waterbirds such as striated heron and reed cormorant and large flocks of others during migration.\n\nExample of services related mangrove services include regulatory, provisional, cultural and supportive[2].\n\nNigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, which puts a strain on the largest remaining areas of these fertile coastal habitats. Much has been cleared for urban and industrial development, such as the oil refineries of the Niger Delta which have also caused the rivers and swamps to become polluted. Urban areas in originally mangrove areas include Lagos in Nigeria and Douala in Cameroon. Other strains on the ecoregion include clearance for salt panning and agriculture. However mangrove is a resilient habitat and small clumps of mangrove remain in isolation all along the coast of west and central Africa. Protected areas include Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve in Cameroon and Songor Lagoon in Ghana, while the Keta Lagoon, also in Ghana, is a Ramsar site.\n\nUNEP (2007).

{"id": "4876592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4876592", "title": "Diver navigation", "text": "Diver navigation\n\nDiver navigation, termed \"underwater navigation\" by scuba divers, is a set of techniques—including observing natural features, the use of a compass, and surface observations—that divers use to navigate underwater. Free-divers do not spend enough time underwater for navigation to be important, and surface supplied divers are limited in the distance they can travel by the length of their umbilicals and are usually directed from the surface control point. On those occasions when they need to navigate they can use the same methods used by scuba divers.\n\nAlthough it is considered a basic skill, it is normally only taught to a limited degree as part of basic Open Water certification. Most North American diver training agencies only teach significant elements of underwater navigation as part of the Advanced Open Water Diver certification program.\n\nUnderwater navigation is usually a core component of most, if not all, advanced recreational diver training. In the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course, it is one of the two mandatory skills (together with Deep diving) which must be taken alongside three elective skills.\n\nTraining agencies promote underwater navigation as a skill (despite the fact that it is less popular than other recreational diving specialties) on the basis that it:\n\nUnderwater compass navigation is a component of the scuba-based underwater sport, underwater orienteering.\n\nUnderwater navigation in recreational diving is broadly split into two categories. \"Natural navigation\" techniques, and \"orienteering\", which is navigation focused upon the use of an underwater magnetic compass.\n\nNatural navigation, sometimes known as pilotage, involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples run parallel to the direction of the wave front, which tends to run parallel to the shore), bottom contour and noise. Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience.\n\nOrienteering, or compass navigation, is a matter of training, practice and familiarity with the use of underwater compasses, combined with various techniques for reckoning distance underwater, including kick cycles (one complete upward and downward sweep of a kick), time, air consumption and occasionally by actual measurement. Kick cycles depend on the diver's finning technique and equipment, but are generally more reliable than time, which is critically dependent on speed, or air consumption, which is critically dependent on depth, work rate, diver fitness, and equipment drag. Techniques for direct measurement also vary, from the use of calibrated distance lines or surveyor's tape measures, to a mechanism like an impeller log, to pacing off the distance along the bottom with the arms.\n\nMany skilled underwater navigators use techniques from both of these categories in a seamless combination, using the compass to navigate between landmarks over longer distances and in poor visibility, while making use of the generic oceanographic indicators to help stay on course and as a check that there is no mistake with the bearing, and then recognising landmarks and using them with the remembered topography of a familiar site to confirm position.\n\nRecognisable topographical features may be remembered or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility is sufficient to see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, shot lines, jackstays and guide lines.\n\nThe slope of the bottom is often a reliable indicator of the direction toward the shore, particularly when the bottom is of soft or loose material, and is not broken up greatly by rocky outcrops. This information can be checked for reliability on a sufficiently detailed chart of the area. Contours of depth running roughly parallel to the coastline indicate a slope dipping directly away from the shore, and can be used to maintain a sense of distance and orientation relative to the shore. In some places where the bottom is composed of predominantly rocky outcrops the slope may be in any direction and is not a reliable indicator of direction.\n\nIf circumstances of depth and water clarity allow the position of the sun to produce sufficient variation in brightness, this may indicate the direction of the sun, and be used as a cue to orientation. The effect is greater if the sun is relatively low in the sky, the water is clean, the depth fairly shallow and the surface fairly smooth.\n\nIn some circumstances the diver can look up at the surface, to see in which direction the land lies. These cues will not give any precise information about position, but will allow the diver to keep a mental picture of where he or she is and is going.\n\nCurrent direction can be useful as an orientation cue as long as the direction of the current is known. In rivers it tends to be fairly consistent and reliable, though localised eddies may occur. In the sea it may depend on weather conditions and local topography, as well as the state of the tide. In estuaries and harbours the currents will usually be predominantly tidal, so the state of the tide must be known, as the difference in direction between ebb and flow is usually about 180°.\n\nWave surge direction is essentially the same as wave direction, but may be felt at depths where the wave direction is no longer visible. It is useful if the offshore wave direction relative to the shore is known and does not change appreciably during the dive. In shallow water the wave crests will often be parallel to the shore. The important difference is that waves can be seen to travel in a definite direction, whereas surge is a back and forth motion, allowing a possible 180° error.\n\nA regular and distinct ripple pattern on a sand, mud or gravel bottom is an indication that it has been affected by wave action. The surge of the wave at depth causes the particles to be moved backwards and forwards in the direction the waves are travelling. This movement produces a ripple pattern on the bottom which is an indication of the wave direction on the surface. The ripple crests will be approximately parallel to the crests of the waves that formed them. It is however possible for the surface waves to change direction, and due to shorter wavelength, not reach the bottom to change the ripple pattern. When this is the case there will be no surge at the bottom. If there is a surge at the bottom, and the ripple crests are perpendicular the direction of the surge, then the wave crests will be parallel to the ripple crests. Ripple crests, like surge, may be interpreted with a 180° error.\n\nMany rock formations have characteristic angles known as dip and strike. Dip is the slope of the strata from the horizontal, and strike is the general direction of the strata in the horizontal plane (very roughly). These characteristics will usually be similar in the rocks above and below the water in a locality, so they can be used to estimate direction. Ridges above and below water are often parallel, and gullies and valleys may well extend under water for considerable distances.\n\nDifferent areas may for a wide variety of reasons have different ecologies. A diver who is familiar with an area can use the diversity variations and patterns to provide orientation cues.\n\nThere is often variation of ecological zoning with depth, but a diver is expected to be aware of the depth all the time anyway. In some places the seaward side of big rocks may have different species from the shoreward face because of the greater exposure to wave action.\n\nSea fans and sponges are filter feeders, and may grow into a fan shape at right angles to the usual current or surge direction, to get the maximum volume of water flowing past them.\n\nThe magnetic compass indicates the local direction of the ambient magnetic field, which is usually that of the Earth. This is usually a reliable and consistent feature and is very useful as a navigational aid as it is not affected by visibility, pressure, or the presence of water.\n\nAn important concept is that the compass card should not turn, even though it appears to always “swing” to magnetic north. The housing that holds the compass card turns around the card, which remains pointing in the same direction (Magnetic North) all the time. There are occasions when the card does turn, but this is when it has been stuck or the compass is turned over, and the card is unable to remain aligned with the magnetic field.\n\nTrue north is the geometrically accurate direction along the surface of the earth toward the North pole of the planet’s axis of rotation.\nThe lines of longitude on maps are in true North/South directions.\n\nThe Earth has a magnetic field which is not quite in line with the geographic directions. The difference between the magnetic and true directions is known as Variation. It differs from place to place and changes with time. Large scale charts and maps will usually include a compass rose showing variation.\n\nThe compass will indicate the magnetic field direction at the place where it happens to be at the time. If there are influences other than the Earth’s magnetic field, these may change the direction indicated by the compass. These effects are called deviation, and can be caused by a whole range of things. Any magnetic object or electrical current will have an influence, some more than others. The current in a dive computer is too small to affect the compass, even when quite near, but the hull of a ship or overhead power lines may make a difference even several meters away. It is difficult and often impossible to correct for all possible deviations, but it is worth checking a dive compass for deviation caused by dive equipment. It has been known for regulators to cause deviation, steel cylinders can cause deviation, and powerful lights may be a problem. A diver propulsion vehicle with an electric motor is also a potential problem for those who use them, though divers have been known to navogate adequately using compasses mounted on the handgrip of a DPV. A magnetic clip used to secure equipment to the diver's harness has a powerful magnet in both parts, and should not be used to hold the compass, as the part attached to the compass will produce a serious error.\n\nDeviation may be checked by comparing the compass bearing as measured with a known magnetic bearing measured by a compass with no deviation. Deviation may vary with different directions and for accurate work it is necessary to make up a table of deviations. This is done for ships, but for diving it is generally not worth the trouble. Bearings of one diver's compass may vary from those of another diver even if they have both been read correctly. The difference should not be large, but it can result in being off course and not finding something. A compass is a magnet, and will affect another compass nearby, so they can not be checked by putting them together.\n\nThe magnetic field of the earth is tilted from the horizontal. The angle is called dip and varies with place, so compasses can be corrected for different zones. This is a factory process. A compass made for the northern parts of the northern hemisphere will tilt badly in the southern hemisphere, in some cases to the extent that it will jam if held horizontal.\n\nAlso known as cave lines, distance lines, penetration lines and jackstays. These are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks and other areas where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious. Guidelines are also useful in the event of silt out.\n\nDistance lines are wound on to a spool or a reel. The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. An open water diver using the distance line only for a surface marker buoy may only need 50 metres / 165 feet, whereas a cave diver may use multiple reels of lengths from 50 ft (15 m) to 1000+ ft (300 m).\n\nReels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy surface marker buoys and decompression buoys and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a shotline or boat anchor.\n\nThe material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use, nylon being the material of choice for cave diving. A common line used is 2 mm (0.08 inch) polypropylene line when it does not matter if the line is buoyant.\n\nThe use of guideline for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication.\n\nIn cave (and occasionally wreck) diving, line markers are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a \"jump\" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low visibility. Non-directional markers (\"cookies\") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.\n\nIn some circumstances divers may be directed by their surface control personnel. This requires a method of communication between the surface team and the diver.\nBoth voice communications and line signals may be used to direct the movement of the diver and to provide other information.\nSurface direction may be used in scuba diving when diving under ice or conducting an underwater search, and in surface supplied diving for both these purposes and at any other time that it is useful or convenient for the dive controller to direct the movement of the diver. Surface direction is most useful when the surface personnel have a better idea of where the diver is relative to where he or she needs to be than the diver has, which can happen when the visibility is poor, or when the diver is following a search pattern controlled by the surface controller.\n\nSurface applications for compass navigation include marking a position and finding the position using compass bearings. At least two position lines are required to fix a position, as only direction can be found using a compass. When two bearings are used a large angle between the bearings will minimize error. The angle should preferably be between 60 and 120 degrees, and near 90 degrees would be ideal. Three bearings are better as they will also give an indication of probable accuracy when plotted on a chart. The \"cocked hat\" or triangle where the lines intersect, shows the probable location of the position measured, and a small triangle indicates a small probable error. The angle between the three bearings should preferably be in the order of 60 or 120 degrees where available landmarks allow. In all cases landmarks should be as close to the diver as possible and spread over a large arc for best accuracy.\n\nVarious pieces of equipment are available to assist divers navigating underwater.\nPeriodically reports are issued suggesting the development of underwater GPS technology, but no system is currently available on market. It is generally thought that the difficulty of locating satellite by signals from underwater at present is not capable of being overcome by existing technology.\n\nThe typical diving compass is made from a card with graduation in degrees, mounted on a pivot in a transparent housing filled with fluid which damps the movement and prevents pressure collapse of the housing. It may be wrist mounted, console mounted or carried some other way. It is desirable that the compass can operate accurately at significant tilt angles without sticking.\n\nOn the card there is a magnet which will interact with the ambient magnetic field so as to align itself and the card with the field provided it is free to rotate. There will be other marks on the housing which are intended to be aligned with the direction of travel of the user, so the offset of the card to the housing will indicate the direction of the magnetic field and the orientation of the user.\n\nImportant features of a diving compass are that it can easily be read in dim light, the card or needle does not easily jam if the housing is tilted slightly, and that it can be securely attached to the diver's arm or equipment and does not get lost. It is useful for any straps to be adjustable while wearing gloves, and any clips that may attached should be non-magnetic.\n\nThe strap should be long enough to go round the diver's wrist over the diving suit glove, and if it is slightly elastic it will stay in place when the suit compresses.\n\nThere may be a movable bezel which can be set to record a course and to help set a reciprocal course.\n\nThere are also electronic compasses which can provide a digital or analogue display These are based on magnetometer technology. Several models of dive computer incorporate a compass function, but this may not be accessible at the same time as the primary decompression information, and may be limited in their precision of display information.\n\nThere are two ways in which a compass may be marked, which influence the way you would read them. These are known as direct reading compasses and indirect reading compasses. Both provide the same information to the same level of accuracy. Both types may have graduations on the card which can be read through a side window to give the bearing directly.\n\nThe direct reading compass has graduations on the housing which read anti-clockwise round the face, with zero on the far side. \nThe effect of this configuration is that if the housing is aligned with a direction, the north point of the card or needle will point directly towards the number representing the bearing. No further effort is needed on the part of the operator, you just find the number the arrow points at and read off the bearing. \nThe bezel has no graduations, it is just a marker to align the card.\n\nThe indirect reading compass has graduations on the bezel. These graduations are clockwise round the face, and the zero mark coincides with the notch. To take a bearing the compass must first be aligned with the direction, then the bezel must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read at the far side of the compass.\n\nFlux-gate compasses are built into several models of dive computer as an extra function. They may require calibration when powered up, but calibration usually lasts as long as the processor is running. They are usually insensitive to tilt as there are no moving parts to jam. The display varies, and may not be as intuitive as for a mechanical compass needle or card arrangement. They can often be calibrated to account for local deviation and give true direction. The nearby presence of a magnetic compass can cause large error, but they are not greatly affected by other electronic compasses, as can be seen from the images.\n\nSome digital cameras for underwater use also have a built in flux-gate compass (such as the Olympus TG series) which can be used for navigation as well as for recording the direction of a photograph.\n\n\n"}

Treatment with aluminium chloride in 2000, however, greatly reduced the amount of leaking phosphorus. Most of the surface runoff reaching Flaten comes from a ditch (\"Flatendiket\") stretching a kilometre to empty in the northern end of the lake where two sedimentation basins reduces the amount of pollutants reaching the lake. The ditch also receives stormwater from local settlements rich in nutrients and from the only road in the catchment area which contains metals and PAHs. Occasionally, the ditch therefore transports waste water to the lake which the available caissons mostly fails to treat properly. However, pipes from the bathe lead to a local sewage disposal plant, and, additionally, the catchment area was reduced by some 20 per cent in 1978 when stormwater from the graveyard Skogskyrkogården was guided past the lake, which decreased pollution but also increased lake retention time.\n\nIn summers, phytoplankton algae are dominated by cyanobacteria and some carapace flagellates. Other species have been abundant, but today only a single nitrogen fixating algae is present in the lake. During winters and springs, \"Planktothrix agardhii\" adopt a red colour which occasionally colours the lake in shades of red and brown. Larger zooplankton include water fleas (\"Bosmina\") and copepods (\"Daphnia\"); and smaller species, rotifers, seem to have increased during the later part of the 1990s. An inventory of aquatic plants in 1997 resulted in a list of 13 species, most commonly spring quillwort, awlwort, shoreweed, and needle spike-rush. The shores of Flaten are covered with bog-myrtle. Trailing plants have occasionally been abundant near the bathe.\n\nA documentation of lake bed fauna in 1997 registered 68 species, of which fourteen were freshwater gastropods commonly found around Stockholm and five were dragonflies. Notable catches included European stream valvata (\"Valvata piscinalis\") and duck mussel. Common fishes are perch, roach, and silver bream, with bigger variations in population for carp bream, northern pike, tench, bleak, ruffle, and zander (notwithstanding attempts to introduce the latter). Crayfish have been successfully introduced. Thirteen breeding bird pairs were documented in 1994 of which the black-throated diver is considered the most important, even though the species is sensitive to interference so breeding might be challenging. Four of five amphibians with a natural habitat in the Stockholm area are found by the lake, as were four species of bats.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31751515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31751515", "title": "Geology of Paraguay", "text": "Geology of Paraguay\n\nThe country of Paraguay lies geologically at the borderzone between several cratons. Due to thick Cenozoic sediment cover and regolith development few outcrops are available in Paraguay. East of Paraguay River that Precambrian and Early Paleozoic crystalline basement crop out mainly in the heights of Caapucú and Apa. The geological processes that have shaped Paraguay's bedrock and sedimentary basins are diverse including rifting, marine sedimentation, metamorphism, eruption of flood basalts and alkaline potassic volcanism.\n\nCaapucú High (formerly called \"Precámbrico Sur\" and \"Saliente del Pilar\") is the Northwesternmost outcrop of Río de la Plata Craton. The rocks found in the Caapucú High include porphyritic granitic rocks, orthogneisses, paragneisses, amphibolites, migmatites, talc schists and rhyolite dykes. During the Brasiliano Cycle (576-480 Ma ago) the area of the Caapucú height suffered a major magmatic event.\n\nThe formations at the Apa High include metamorphosed limestone of Vendian Age and granites, metasediments, mafic gneisses and granitoid-pegmatititic intrusvies of Late Proterozoic age. The Apa high is often considered the southernmost outcrop of the Central Brazilian Shield (also called Guaporé Shield) which is sometimes considered to form one sole shield (or at least craton) with the Guyana Shield called the Amazonian Shield.\n\nThe Paraná Basin is a large sedimentary basin situated in the central-eastern part of South America. About 75% of its areal distribution occurs in Brazil, from Mato Grosso to Rio Grande do Sul states. The remainder area is distributed in eastern Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and northern Uruguay. The shape of the depression is elliptical and covers an area of about , of which 110,000 km are in Paraguay. The basin developed during the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic with a sedimentary record comprising rocks from the Ordovician right up to the Cretaceous, thus spanning the time interval between 460 and 66 million years. The maximum thickness of the infill reaches 7,000 m in its central area and is composed of sedimentary and igneous rocks.\n\nThe Paraná Basin is a typical intra-cratonic flexural basin, although during the Paleozoic it was a gulf that opened to the southwest. The basin genesis is related to the convergence between the former Gondwana supercontinent and the oceanic crust of the former Panthalassa ocean. The basin formed, at least during the Paleozoic orogenesis of the Gondwanides, a foreland basin. \n\nThe Paraná River, that forms Paraguay's eastern boundary, flows along the central axis of the Paraná Basin and drains the modern basin.\n\nThe Chaco region that makes up the northwestern half (~60%) of Paraguay is a modern foreland basin that extends into Argentina and Bolivia where it borders the Andean thrust front. Superficially the Chaco Basin is an alluvial basin composed of land-derived (in contrast to marine sediments) material, mostly fine sand and clays of Paleogene, Neogene and Quaternary age. On deeper levels the Paraguayan Chaco is made up by four sub-basins, the Pirizal, Pilar, Carandaity and Curupaity basins. \n\nCarandaity and Curupaity in the northwest are chieftly composed of Paleozoic sediments.\n\nPirizal (also called Pirity) Basin is made up mostly of Late Cretaceous and younger sediments. The Pilar Basin is located mainly on Presidente Hayes Department and borders the Paraná Basin across Paraguay River to the east, geologically the basins are separated by the Asunción Anticline that roughly follows the path of Paraguay River.\n\nIn Alto Paraguay Department 240 Ma old alkaline volcanic rocks underlies younger sediments. In the 1970s these rocks were studied for their potential to host valuable phosphate and uranium minerals.\n\nIn a strip along Paraná River tholeiitic basalts belonging to the Paraná Traps makes up most of the bedrock and overlies earlier sediments of the Paraná Basin. These tholeiites were erupted in the Early Cretaceous in association with the initial opening of the South Atlantic. The Cretaceous volcanism did also created minor outcrops of potassic alkaline volcanics in a graben structure developed between Asunción and Villarrica and in Amambay Department. Cretaceous volcanism did also left small units of sodic alkaline rocks in Misiones Department in southern Paraguay.\n\n"}

{"id": "184235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184235", "title": "Hejaz", "text": "Hejaz\n\nThe Hejaz (; ), is a region in the west of present-day Saudi Arabia. The region is so called as it separates the land of the Najd in the east from the land of Tihamah in the west. It is also known as the \"Western Province.\" It is bordered on the west by the Red Sea, on the north by Jordan, on the east by the Najd, and on the south by 'Asir Region. Its largest city is Jeddah, but it is probably better known for the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. As the site of the two holiest sites in Islam, the Hejaz has significance in the Arab and Islamic historical and political landscape.\n\nHistorically, the Hejaz has always seen itself as separate from the rest of Saudi Arabia. The Hejaz is the most populated region in Saudi Arabia; 35% of all Saudis live there. Hejazi Arabic is the most widely spoken dialect in the region. Saudi Hejazis are of ethnically diverse origins.\n\nThe Hejaz is the most cosmopolitan region in the Arabian Peninsula. People of Hejaz have the most strongly articulated identity of any regional grouping in Saudi Arabia. Their place of origin alienates them from the Saudi state, which invokes different narratives of the history of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, Hejazis experienced tensions with people of Najd.\n\nOne or possibly two megalithic dolmen have been found in the Hijaz.\n\nThe Hejaz includes both the \"Mahd adh-Dhahab\" (\"Cradle of the Gold\") () and a water source, now dried out, that used to flow north east to the Persian Gulf via the Wadi Al-Rummah and Wadi Al-Batin system. Archaeological research led by of Boston University and the University of Qassim indicates that the river system was active in 8000  BCE and 2500–3000 BCE.\n\nThe northern part of the Hejaz was part of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea.\n\nSaudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site that was recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is that of Al-Hijr. The name \"Al-Ḥijr\" (\"The Land of Stones\" or \"The Rocky Place\") occurs in the Quran, and the site is known for having structures carved into rocks, similar to Petra. Construction of the structures is credited to the people of Thamud. The location is also called \"Madā’in Ṣāliḥ\" (\"Cities of Saleh\"), as it is speculated to be the city in which the Islamic \"Nabī\" (Prophet) Salih was sent to the people of Thamud. After the disappearance of Thamud from Mada'in Saleh, it came under the influence of other people, such as the Nabataeans, whose capital was Petra. Later, it would lie in a route used by Muslim Pilgrims going to Mecca.\n\nAccording to Arab and Islamic sources, the civilization of Mecca started after Ibrāhīm (Abraham) brought his son Ismā‘īl (Ishmael) and wife Hājar (Hagar) here, for the latter two to stay. Some people from the tribe of Jurhum settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing another, at least one of them from this tribe, and helped his father to construct or re-construct the \"Ka‘bah\" ('Cube'), which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region.\n\nFor example, in Arab or Islamic belief, the tribe of Quraysh would descend from Isma'il ibn Ibrahim, be based in the vicinity of the Ka'bah, and include Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib ibn Hashim ibn Abd Manaf. From the Period of \"Jāhiliyyah\" ('Ignorance') to the days of Muhammad, the often-warring Arab tribes would cease their hostilities during the time of Pilgrimage, and go on pilgrimage to Mecca, as inspired by Ibrahim. It was during such an occasion that Muhammad met some Medinans who would allow him to migrate to Medina, to escape persecution by his opponents in Mecca.\n\nAs the land of Mecca and Medina, the Hijaz was where Muhammad was born, and where he founded a Monotheistic \"Ummah\" (Community) of followers, bore patience with his foes or struggled against them, migrated from one place to another, preached or implemented his beliefs, lived and died. Given that he had both followers and enemies here, a number of battles or expeditions were carried out in this area, like those of \"al-Aḥzāb\" (\"the Confederates\"), Badr and Ḥunayn. They involved both Meccan companions, such as Hamzah ibn Abdul-Muttalib, Ubaydah ibn al-Harith and Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas, and Medinan companions. The Hijaz fell under Muhammad's influence as he emerged victorious over his opponents, and was thus a part of his empire.\n\nDue to the presence of the two holy cities in the Hijaz, the region was ruled by numerous empires. The Hijaz was at the center of the Rashidun Caliphate, in particular whilst its capital was Medina from 632 to 656 ACE. The region was then under the control of regional powers such as Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, throughout much of its later history.\n\nIn 1916, Sharif Hussein ibn Ali proclaimed himself King of an independent Hejaz, as a result of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence. The ensuing Arab Revolt overthrew the Ottoman Empire. In 1924, however, Ibn Ali's authority was replaced by that of Ibn Saud of the Najd.\n\nAt first, Ibn Saud ruled the two as separate units, though they became known as the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd. Later they were formally combined as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl Bahah Region:\n\nAl Madinah Region:\n\nMakkah Province:\n\nTabuk Region:\n\nThe region is located along the Red Sea Rift. It is also known for its darker, more volcanic sand. Depending on the previous definition, the Hejaz includes the high mountains of Sarawat, which topographically separate the Najd from Tehamah. Bdellium plants are also abundant in the Hijaz.\n\nAs a component of Saudi Vision 2030, a beach resort is proposed to be built on the Red Sea between the towns of Umluj () and Al-Wajh (), in the northern section of the Hejazi coast. The resort project will involve \"50 islands and 34,000 square kilometers in a global upmarket tourism and leisure mega-development,\" and will be \"governed by laws on par with international standards.\"\n\nPeople of Hejaz, who feel particularly connected to the holy places of Mecca and Medina, have probably the most strongly articulated identity of any regional grouping in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe people of Hejaz have never fully accommodated to Saudi rule and their Wahhabi religion. They continue to be Sunni of Maliki rite with a Shia minority in the cities of Medina, Mecca and Jeddah. Many consider themselves more cosmopolitan because Hejaz was for centuries a part of the great empires of Islam from the Umayyads to the Ottomans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is adjacent to the Pálava Landscape Protected Area (Pálava Biosphere Reserve), a WHS registered by UNESCO several years before. The close proximity of two cultural landscapes protected by UNESCO is unique.\n\nThe House of Liechtenstein acquired a castle in Lednice in 1249, which marked the beginning of their settlement in the area. It remained the principal Liechtenstein residence for 700 years, until 1939 and World War II. \n\nThe Dukes of Liechtenstein transformed their properties into one large and designed private park between the 17th and 20th centuries. During the 19th century, the Dukes continued transforming the area as a large traditional English landscape park. The Baroque and Gothic Revival style architecture of their chateaux are married with smaller buildings and a landscape that was fashioned according to the English principles of landscape architecture.\n\nIn 1715 these two chateaux (castles) were connected by a landscape alée and road, later renamed for the poet Petr Bezruč.

In 1989 there was a public inquiry relating to a publicly funded motorway.\n\nIn 1989 it was announced that it would be built privately and a competition took place which was won by Midland Expressway Ltd in 1991. The contract was for a 53-year concession to build and operate the road as an early form of public private partnership with the operator paying for the construction and recouping its costs by setting and collecting tolls, allowing for a 3-year construction period followed by 50 years of operation. At the end of this period the infrastructure would be returned to the Government. Toll rates are set at the discretion of the operator at six-monthly intervals and there is no cap on the rates charged.\n\nThere was a second public inquiry from relating to the new scheme in 1994–1995 and a decision to go ahead in 1997. A legal challenge was made by the \"Alliance against BNRR\" which was cleared in 1998.\n\nMEL contracted out the construction of the road to a consortium of major contractors Carillion, Alfred McAlpine, Balfour Beatty and AMEC (together known as CAMBBA).\n\nSite clearance started in 2000, construction work began in mid-2002 and the road opened in December 2003. When creating the surface of the road 2.5 million Mills & Boon novels were pulped and mixed into the tarmac to help the surface absorbency.\n\nIn August 2003 freight operators indicated that they planned to keep their vehicles on the heavily congested M6 through Birmingham rather than send them on the new motorway due to high fees. The AA Motoring Trust said it welcomed the decision to make lorries pay a premium rate explaining that \"Car drivers find lorries intimidating and they frequently hold up traffic on motorways when overtaking each other.\n\nThe road was partially opened on 9 December 2003 for traffic entering from local junctions, then fully opened on 14 December 2003.\n\nOn 10 January 2004, five weeks after opening, a short section of the road near Sutton Coldfield was reduced to one lane to allow for repairs to an uneven surface.\n\nOn 23 July 2004 prices for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) were reduced from £10 to £6 to encourage them to use the route \"for a trial period\".\n\nIn December 2004, one year after opening, Friends of the Earth issued a press release expressing concern that faced with lower than expected traffic numbers, Midland Expressway were trying to attract new traffic-generating developments to greenbelt and greenfield sites in the M6 Toll Corridor. and in April 2005 the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors reported that there was strong interest in the commercial property market place around the M6 Toll \"zone of influence\".\n\nIn May 2005 the Macquarie Infrastructure Group reported that traffic figures were \"disappointing\". In August 2005 the Highways Agency confirmed in its own \"one year\" study showing that usage had settled at around 50,000 vehicle per day (lower than the predicted 74,000) but that traffic volumes on the M6 had reduced slightly.\n\nFrom 2008, traffic levels started to fall. Traffic in the first quarter of 2009 was 39,000 vehicles-per-day (Monday-Friday figures), but recovered to reach 54,000 in the second quarter of 2015.\n\nDay time cash prices for various vehicle classes since opening:\n\nThere is a 5% discount for using a tag. Leasing of one tag currently costs £1.00/month. In addition, a monthly administrative fee of £2.00 is charged if the user wishes to receive a postal statement.\n\nExit/entry at some of the intermediate junctions away from the main toll booths entails a reduced toll, typically £1 less than the full fee.\n\nThere was a proposal to build a new toll motorway, called the M6 Expressway running from the end of the M6 Toll to Knutsford, where much of the traffic leaves the M6 for Manchester. It was announced on 20 July 2006 that this proposal had been abandoned due to excessive costs and anticipated construction problems.\n\nTolls can be paid by one of four means: automated coin payments, payment at a staffed toll booth, automated credit/debit card payments or in advance via an M6 Toll tag. Not all methods are available at all toll gates; each of the toll gates features an electronic sign showing the payment methods available at the time.\n\nVehicles are classified electronically at the toll booths according to their number of wheels, number of axles and height at first axle. Thus vehicles with trailers are charged extra and some large models of 4x4 are classified as vans.\n\nFailure to pay the toll for using the motorway is a civil offence; anyone attempting to do so will be issued with an unpaid toll notice and required to send payment. If it is not paid within two days a £10 administration charge is added, plus further costs will be added if the toll is still unpaid after 14 days.\n\nAn M6 Toll tag is an electronic toll collection device attached to a vehicle's windscreen, which records the vehicle's passage through toll plazas on the M6 Toll.\n\nEach tag can only be used with the registered number plate and has a unique account. All accounts on the M6 Toll are pre-paid, and must contain a positive balance, sufficient to cover the cost of the vehicle's toll, in order for the vehicle to be allowed through the toll gate. If the balance is sufficient, the tag will beep once and the barrier at the toll gate will automatically raise. If the balance is low (fewer than three journeys remaining), the tag will beep twice. If the balance of the account cannot cover the cost of the toll, the barrier will remain closed and an alternative method of payment must be used.\nBalances can be topped up automatically once a month using Direct Debit or credit card, or by cheque.\n\nThe tags contain a microchip which uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Physically, the tag resembles a DART-Tag, as used to pay the tolls on the Dartford Crossing. The two systems do not interoperate.\n\nThe contract to build and operate the M6 Toll was won by Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL) in 1991. In 2005 MEL reported an operating profit of around £16 million. Total revenue was £45 million, with staff and other operating costs amounting to £11.4 million and depreciation of £17.4 million. Taking into account net interest costs of around £43 million, that leaves an overall loss of £26.5 million in 2005 – their first full financial year.\n\nAs of June 2005, MEL was 100% owned by Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG) of Australia, which operated several tolled roads in Australia and North America. Long term debt was £819 million as of 30 June 2005. Disappointing traffic figures for 2005 led to a price rise in June, and MIG Chief Executive Steve Allen commented in the Australian newspaper \"The Age\", \"What we need is to slow down the M6\".\n\nBusiness leaders in Staffordshire, now effectively closer to London, welcomed the opening of the road, saying that it would make it easier to do business there.\n\nIn June 2006 the decision to not increase tolls was put down to disappointing traffic levels and led to a reduction in value for the owner.\n\nIn 2010 MIG was split into two, and the M6 Toll is now managed by Macquarie Atlas Roads.\n\nThe road was put up for sale in 2016 and was sold to IFM Investors in June 2017.\n\nThe M6 Toll lacks a proper link with the M54, which joins the M6 1.5 miles/2.5 km south of the northern end of the M6 Toll. Plans are afoot to link them eventually but for the time being traffic between the two has to use either the slow and often congested A460 to M54 J1, or go from M54 J2 via the A449 and A5 to M6 J12 – an extra 4 miles/7 km. It is unclear why access to/from the M54, which provides a link to the West Midlands from Shropshire and much of Wales, was not considered a priority when the toll road was being built; indeed, the M6 Toll did not appear on the M54's junction signs (at J2) until early 2009, more than 5 years after the road was opened.\n\nSince the M6 Toll was designed primarily to speed journeys between the North West and the South East of England (by bypassing Birmingham), it offers no relief to traffic travelling to and from the South West region of the country, which has to continue using the \"old\" M6 in order to access the M5. The default lanes on the southbound M6 direct drivers onto the M6 Toll, making it easy for traffic bound for the South West, and indeed Birmingham itself, to accidentally enter the toll road, which will not only cost them the toll but will also take them severely off course.\n\nSoon after the opening of the M6 Toll new signage directed drivers making local journeys onto the toll road. As well as incurring toll charges, the new routes were longer than the original routes leading to accusations that this was just a ploy to increase traffic on the M6 Toll. Similar accusations have been made about traffic signs on the M6 that announce \"M6 TOLL CLEAR\", even when the M6 is also clear, that are under the control of Midland Expressway Ltd. These issues are mentioned on the M6 Toll FAQ pages, with explanations which emphasise that all drivers using the road are still liable to pay the toll.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners opposed the road, from its inception. While the road was being built some advocates of direct action dug tunnels under Moneymore Cottage and two large underground bunkers in an adjacent wood named the Greenwood Camp. The camp was in the path of the road in order to frustrate and delay the work. Peter Faulding, a confined space rescue specialist from Specialist Group International who removed Swampy the anti-roads protester from the A30 protest and from the Newbury Bypass tunnels, was brought in to safely remove a number of protesters tunnelled deep underground. The tunnels were very complex and on different levels in Moneymore Cottage. Operation Encompass as it was called by the police was run by the Under sheriff of Staffordshire Mr John James, the eviction operation ran for fourteen days enabling construction to begin.\nFriends of the Earth claimed that the road would not relieve much traffic from the West Midlands conurbation as most users using the M6 in that area began or ended their journeys within the conurbation and so the M6 Toll would offer no advantage to them. Their campaign co-ordinator for the West Midlands, Chris Crean, said that although the £900 million cost of the road had been borne by private companies, the money should have been spent on public transport.\n\nThe M6 Toll has few junctions, and some have limited access to discourage local traffic. Like modern toll roads in continental Europe, the M6 Toll still uses toll plazas.\n\nThe construction of the motorway threatened the restoration of the Lichfield Canal, which cut across the motorway's route. The Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust campaigned and raised funds to build an aqueduct to carry the canal over the motorway. The aqueduct has been finished but the canal has yet to reach it, giving it an odd appearance, known to some local residents as \"The Climbing Lemming Bridge\".\n\nThe motorway's only service station is situated at Norton Canes, between junctions T6 and T7.\n\nThe towns, cities and roads listed are those given on road signs on the motorway as the junction is approached.\n\n!scope=col|Junction \n!scope=col|Coordinates\n!scope=col|Northbound exits\n!scope=col|Tolls\n!scope=col|Southbound exits\n!scope=col|Tolls\n\nThe southernmost section of the M6 Toll, south of Junction T1, is shared by traffic using the M42. Vehicles using only this five-mile section are not charged a toll.\n\nEach motorway in England requires that a legal document called a statutory instrument be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these statutory instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is a list (possibly incomplete) of the statutory instruments relating to the M6 Toll.\n\n"}

The wharf area, which is owned by the corporation Stockholms Hamnar, is about 600 metres long, and is mostly located between Londonviadukten and Fåfängan on one side and Saltsjön on the other, it stretches from Varvsbranten in the west to the mouth of the Danvikskanalen channel in the east. Today, Masthamnen serves the Viking Line cruiseferries while Yttre Masthamnen serves international cruiseferries.\n\nA \"mast harbour\" (\"masthamn\") was an area in a harbour, surrounded with a palisade, where lumber used for masts was stored.\n\nMasthamnen got its current name in 1925. The naming board of the city of Stockholm states: \"A map from 11 January 1774 over the area, established as a permission to use the cliff for businessman Fredrik Lundin [...] shows the situation of the mast harbour previously located by the western end of the cliff face.\" Even on a drawing of the Stockholm ship docks from 1745 can \"masthamnen\" be seen mentioned. The \"cliff face\" referred to Fåfängan and Fredrik Lundin constructed his mansion and his villa \"Fåfängan\" there. The mansion is still there, nowadays located in the wharf area.\n\nTogether with the need to expand Stadsgårdshamnen, work on the ship docks could no longer continue, Tegelviken was reconstructed, and the new Stadsgårdshamnen and its exit to Folkungagatan was inaugurated in August 1910. In the 1940s, the area for Yttre Masthamnen was developed, partly on a filled part of Saltsjön. On a Stockholm map from 1940 there are three narrow areas named \"Hamnarbetaren\", \"Skeppslasten\" and \"Vinschen\".\n\nStadsgården, together with Masthamnen, is an important harbour for cruiseferry traffic. Masthamnen's western part and the Londonviadukten area now (2011) serve Viking Line cruiseferries. Yttre Masthamnen is the only central location in Stockholm where large cruiseferries can anchor. Stockholms Hamnar has two wharf places here. Outside travel season, the area is poorly used and is spotted with large asphalt areas with parking places for lorries and containers. The construction board of the city of Stockholm has made a detailed plan which gives Viking Line the right to retain the buildings that have had temporary building permissions until the year 2017.\n\nThe Danvikslösen project contains a plan to rebuild the Saltsjöbanan to match the double track standard of the Tvärbanan. The current plan is to widen the current track, with a new station south of Londonviadukten. The Danvikslösen project has presented several development proposals, containing drawings by Jan Inghe-Hagström (1944-2005), a former plan architect in the municipality of Stockholm, White arkitekter and Rosenbergs Arkitekter. Of the proposals, White arkitekter was seen to have the best connection to the rest of north-eastern Södermalm. Their proposals include a proposal to cover Londonviadukten with a roof. According to a rough cost analysis, covering Londonviadukten with a roof should cost about 250 million kronor. Other costs have not been studied.\n\n"}

It consists of the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding areas. The rule of the indigenous Newars in Nepal Mandala ended with its conquest by the Gorkha Kingdom and the rise of the Shah dynasty in 1768.\n\nAccording to the Outline History of Nepal, Nepal consisted of three kingdoms during the early medieval period: Khas in the west, Karnatak in the south and Nepal Mandala in the center and Kirat in the east.\n\nBhaktapur was the capital of Nepal Mandala until the 15th century when three capitals, including Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established.\n\nThe extent of Nepal Mandala has been traditionally defined by the locations of 64 Hindu and 24 Buddhist pilgrimage sites. The Hindu shrines consist of 64 Shiva lingas scattered from Brahmeswar in Nuwakot district in the west to Bhimeswar in Dolakha District in the east.\n\nThe 24 Buddhist pilgrimage sites are spread from the Trishuli River in the west to Dolalghat in the east. When seen as an ordered pattern, they form the picture of the mandala of Chakrasamvara, the principal deity of Vajrayana Buddhism. Nepal Mandala was conceived on the basis of the Chakrasamvara Mandala.\n\nFrancis Buchanan-Hamilton has written in \"An Account of the Kingdom Of Nepal\" published in 1819 that four pilgrimage spots marked the boundaries of Nepal Proper: Nilkantha (an eight-day journey north from Kathmandu), Nateswar (three days to the south), Kaleswar (two days to the west) and Bhimeswar (four days to the east).\n\nThe term mandala also means a country, and it has been used to represent traditional political formations such as federation of kingdoms. The area comprising Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur and Dolakha during the Malla period is generally known as Nepal Mandala.\n\nAccording to the Outline History of Nepal, Nepal Mandala was situated between the Khas and Simraungarh kingdoms. The Khas kingdom extended from Garhwal in the west to the Trishuli River in the east, and from Lake Manasarovar in the north to the Terai in the south. Karnataka, also called Simraungarh, was situated in the Terai.\n\nWestern travelers in the late 18th century have written that Nepal's borders extended to Tibet in the north, the nation of the Kirata in the east, the kingdom of Makwanpur in the south and the Trishuli River in the west which separated it from the kingdom of Gorkha.\n\nIn 1661, Jesuit Fathers Johann Grueber and Albert d'Orville travelled from Tibet to India through Nepal. They mentioned in their report that they passed through \"Cuthi\", the first town in the kingdom of \"Necbal\" (Nepal), and arrived in \"Cadmendu\" (Kathmandu), the capital of \"Necbal\". From \"Cadmendu\", a journey of five days brings one to \"Hedouda\", a market town in the kingdom of \"Maranga\". The town of Hedouda is known as Hetauda today.\n\nThe oldest inhabitants of Nepal Mandala are the Newars who are of multiple racial strains that combined over millennia. Newar civilization is a blend of different cultures that came together in Nepal Mandala. According to sociologists, the people of Nepal gradually became known as Newar.\n\nThe Buddhist text \"Manjushrimula Kalpa\" has mentioned Manadeva (reigned 464-506 AD) as being the king of Nepal Mandala. The term Nepal Mandala also appears in the popular Buddhist text \"Swayambhu Purana\". It occurs in a stone inscription at Gyaneswar, Kathmandu dating from the eighth century during the reign of Licchavi king Jayadeva II.\n\nThe term Nepal Mandala has been used through the centuries in stone and copper inscriptions and the colophons of manuscripts when mentioning the dedicator's address. It is also referred to during important Buddhist ceremonies.\n\n\n"}

New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb, by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping.\n\nThe design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to customization, new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city-center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing.\n\nSuburban sprawl is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities. Suburban sprawl continues to grow as over 70% of Americans choose to live in such communities. Planners are currently seeking to make the suburbs more sustainable and New Suburbanism offers a solution. This planning approach seeks to redesign suburban communities by making them more-dense, equitable, and environmentally sustainable while still keeping housing and design preferences of the consumer in mind.\n\n\nNew Urbanism is a style of planning a new neighborhood that focuses on designing aspects that create more community engagement, whereas New Suburbanism is the improving of an existing suburban neighborhood.\n\nNew urbanism, though a small movement, is more successful than New Suburbanism, as NS only has 1 location and NU has hundreds.\n"}

{"id": "128608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=128608", "title": "Population density", "text": "Population density\n\nPopulation density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term. In simple terms population density refers to the number of people living in an area per kilometer square.\n\nPopulation density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.\n\nLow densities may cause an extinction vortex and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the Allee effect after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes in low population densities include:\n\nFor humans, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude, for example, areas of water or glaciers). Commonly this may be calculated for a county, city, country, another territory or the entire world.\n\nThe world's population is around 7,500,000,000 and Earth's total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000 square kilometers (197,000,000 sq. mi.). Therefore, the worldwide human population density is around 7,500,000,000 ÷ 510,000,000 = 14.7 per km (38 per sq. mi). If only the Earth's land area of 150,000,000 km (58,000,000 sq. mi.) is taken into account, then human population density is 50 per km (129 per sq. mile). This includes all continental and island land area, including Antarctica. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 55 people per km (over 142 per sq. mile). However, over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh-water sources. Thus, this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density.\n\nSeveral of the most densely populated territories in the world are city-states, microstates and dependencies. These territories have a relatively small area and a high urbanization level, with an economically specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and overpopulation\n\nThe potential to maintain the agricultural aspects of deserts is extremely limited as there is not enough precipitation to support a sustainable land. The population in these areas are extremely low. Therefore cities in the Middle East, such as Dubai, have been increasing in population and infrastructure growth at a fast pace. \n\nCities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources. Most of the most densely populated cities are in Southeast Asia, though Cairo and Lagos in Africa also fall into this category.\n\nCity population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of \"urban area\" used: densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included, as in the areas of agglomeration or metropolitan area, the latter sometimes including neighboring cities. For instance, Milwaukee has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured, and the surrounding suburbs excluded.\n\nIn comparison, based on a world population of seven billion, the world's inhabitants, as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet (one square metre) per person (Jacobs Method), would occupy a space a little larger than Delaware's land area.\n\nThe Gaza Strip (blockaded exclave of Palestine) has a population of 1.85 million and a population density of 5,046 pop/km.\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" | Pos.!!Country (or dependent territory)!!Area (km)!!Area (mi)!!Population!!Density<br>(pop./km)!!Density<br>(pop./mi)\n\nAlthough arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area.\n\n\n\n"}

The organization provides its members with zoological data collection and management software called ZIMS—the \"Zoological Information Management System\". \n\nZIMS project was a large global collaboration with 600 people contributing under the leadership of Hassan Syed, CIO of Species360 (2003-2010). The ZIMS database contains information on 21,000 species, 6.8 million animals, and 75 million medical records. It also includes. Members use the basic biologic information (age, sex, parentage, place of birth, circumstance of death, etc.) collected in the system to care for and manage their animal collections (including demographic and genetic management in many cases). It is also used for ex situ breeding programs and supporting conservation research and programs. \n\nSince its founding in 1973, the group has been a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) pursuing wild animal conservation goals. Species360 works in partnership with zoo associations around the world.\n\nRegional association members include:\nSpecies360 and the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) have a five-year memorandum of understanding with a primary goal of migrating the majority of the zoos in India into the ZIMS database.\n\nThe organization has staff and representatives in Amsterdam (the Netherlands), New Delhi (India), Jerusalem (Israel), Odense (Denmark), and Istanbul (Turkey) with headquarters in Minnesota (USA).\n\nModern zoos and aquariums often are \"gene banks\" for endangered species. In some cases, species which have become extinct in the wild and have been bred in zoos are eventually returned to the wild. Examples include the black-footed ferret, California condor, Przewalski's horse, red wolf, Micronesian kingfisher (not yet reintroduced), and the Arabian oryx. Individual zoos generally do not have the space to maintain a viable species population (which for many mammals and birds requires 500+ animals in order to maintain sufficient genetic diversity), so maintaining genetic diversity requires coordination between many zoos. Scientific expertise on husbandry, nutrition, veterinary care and so on is spread throughout the zoos and aquaria of the world. Breeding and population management relies on accurate information about animals in all member institutions, especially pedigree history (parentage) and demography (births and deaths).\n\nSpecies360 records are accepted by international regulatory bodies such as CITES. Roughly three-quarters of Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) members in North America are members, and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) requires its members to join. The World Association of Zoos and Aquaria's (WAZA) Conservation Strategy Guidelines strongly recommend that all zoo and aquaria join and participate in data sharing via ZIMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1973, Ulysses Seal and Dale Makey proposed the \"International Species Information System\" (ISIS) as an international database to help zoos and aquariums accomplish long-term conservation management goals. It was founded in 1974 with an initial membership of 51 zoos in North America and Europe, and its membership has increased every year since. Grants and endorsements were provided by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV) and other zoological associations. The founders also raised development funding from private foundations and the United States Department of the Interior. For the first 30 years, the Minnesota Zoo hosted the program on their grounds.\n\nSince 1989, the organisation has been incorporated as a non-profit entity under an international Board of Trustees elected by subscribing member institutions. In 2016, the organization was renamed as Species360, due to the ISIS being an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a terrorist organization.\n"}

This groundbreaking theory was the foundation of the study of cities as systems of cities, rather than simple hierarchies or single entities.\n\nWalter Christaller was born to Erdmann Gottreich and Helene Christaller, an author of Christian-themed children's novels at Berneck (today part of Altensteig in Germany. His paternal grandfather Johann Gottlieb Christaller was a linguist and a Christian missionary in West Africa.\n\nBefore 1914, Christaller began studies in philosophy and political economics and subsequently served in the German Army during World War I. He was homeschooled and educated at the Universities of Heidelberg and Munich. In the 1920s, he pursued a variety of occupations. In 1929, he resumed graduate studies, which led to his famous dissertation on Central Place Theory, which he published as the \"Die zentralen Orte in Süddeutschland\" (The Central Places in Southern Germany), in 1933.\n\nIn the late 1930s, he held a short-lived academic appointment at the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau. He was never a Nazi and was even noticed for some brawls with Nazi students. He moved into government service, for Himmler's SS-Planning and Soil Office, during the Second World War. Christaller's task was to draw up plans for reconfiguring the economic geography of Germany's eastern conquests (Generalplan Ost), primarily in Czechoslovakia and Poland but also, if successful, Russia itself. Christaller was given special charge of planning occupied Poland, and he did so by using his central place theory as an explicit guide.\nAfter the war, he joined the Communist Party of Germany and became politically active. In addition, he devoted himself to the geography of tourism. Since 1950, his Central Place Theory has been used to restructure municipal relationships and boundaries in the Federal Republic of Germany, and the system is still in place today.\n\nIn 1950, Christaller, together with Paul Gauss and Emil Meynen, founded the German Association of Applied Geography (DVAG). The Walter Christaller Award for Applied Geography is named after him. \n\nHe died in Jugenheim, Germany on March 9, 1969.\n\n"}
