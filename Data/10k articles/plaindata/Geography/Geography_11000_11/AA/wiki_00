It contains 16 mounds. Abalos Colles is one of the named features in the vicinity of Planum Boreum, the Martian North pole. It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars located at latitude 72°N, longitude 70°W. Its name was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2003.\n\nIt extends from latitude 74.81°N to 78.78°N and from longitude 284.54°E to 293.39°E (66.61°W – 75.46°W). Its centre is located at latitude 71.65°N, longitude 76.83°W, and has a diameter of 235.83 km. The Abalos Colles mounds are of irregular, angular, or conical form. The tops of the conical forms can feature craters, and can also be flat. Their height varies between less than a hundred to less than 700 metres, with top diameters in the range of 20 km. The northernmost boundary of the dune field of Abalos Undae is located in the southwest channel that separates Abalos Colles from the main ice cap, and from there the dune field extends southwest all the way to the lowlands of Vastitas Borealis.\n\nThe Abalos Colles stratigraphy shows similar characteristics with the \nRupes Tenuis basal unit, and it is considered a remnant of a larger, contiguous ancient north polar basal unit. The Abalos Colles formation is considered to be the result of large-scale erosion episodes of the Rupes Tenuis basal unit. Probable erosion mechanisms include crater impact which formed ejecta that subsequently covered and protected the ancient basal unit.\n\nConical mounds with flat or cratered tops could have been formed by layer accumulations on top of impact craters which then eroded to varying degrees, depending on the size of the original crater. At the southern boundary of Chasma Boreale, a sequence of mounds of Abalos Coles with flat, pitted or cratered tops, show similar morphological characteristics to small Icelandic shield volcanoes of basaltic origin. Adjusted to account for the difference in topology between the two planets, both the terrestrial and Martian volcanoes share similar side slopes and volume to diameter ratios, the latter being defined as the \"volcanic productivity index\".\n"}

The airbase also included an emergency landing strip, \"Tobago\".\n\nThe American rights to the airfield were obtained via the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940 when the United States transferred fifty destroyers to Great Britain in exchange for Army and Navy base rights on British possessions in the Americas.\n\nOpened in 1942, Edinburgh Field had been intended solely as an overflow facility for Air Transport Command transport aircraft headed for nearby Waller Field, but eventually, it grew into an enormous sprawling complex with three parallel paved runways – 5000 x 150 ft / 5000 x 150 ft / 2000 x 300 ft and an Airship operating area that made it physically larger than all the other airbases in Trinidad, being used by both Army and Navy aircraft.\n\nEdinburgh Field became the principal combat base for USAAF bombers and Naval airships on Trinidad as well as Navy fighters with a complex of runways and taxiways that surpassed even Waller Field. This lasted until 3 November 1943, when it was renamed Carlsen Field. It was also used by the Royal Air Force and was defended by US Army infantry and AA units. When the Navy began lighter-than-air operations in the Caribbean in the fall of 1943, the 80th Seabees were brought in to build a station at Carlsen Field. To supplement the eight Army-owned buildings taken over by the Navy, the 80th Battalion built a large, steel blimp hangar, a mooring circle, paved runways, a helium-purification plant, and other operational appurtenances.\n\n\nWith the end of World War II Carlsen Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was placed under the command of the 24th Composite Wing based at Borinquen AFB, Puerto Rico. In 1947 Navy C-47 operations at nearby Waller Air Force Base were moved to Carlsen.\n\nThe airfield was redesignated Carlsen Air Force Base on March 26, 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10. Carlsen AFB was turned over to the United States Navy on 28 May 1949 and was renamed NAF (LTA) Carlsen Field. Naval units used the facility until it was formally disestablished on 10 January 1950.\n\nToday the former air and naval airship base has been turned into a dairy and agricultural area south of Chaguanas and is all but unrecognizable. Much of the former airfield area is owned by National Flour Mills and the only remnants of the base are the name of the area in south Chaguanas, along with streets named \"Edinburgh\" and \"Xeres\"\n\n\n"}

The work was begun in 1972 by the artist Michael Heizer and is ongoing. When complete, it will be one of the largest sculptures ever built.\n\n\"City\" will open to the public in 2020.\n\nLike Heizer's previous \"Double Negative\" (1969), \"City\" is designed and executed on a massive scale. Covering a space approximately one and a quarter miles long and more than a quarter of a mile wide (2 km by 0.4 km, roughly the scale of the National Mall), \"City\" is one of the largest sculptures ever created. Using earth, rocks, sand and concrete as building materials and assembled with heavy machinery, the work comprises five phases, each consisting of a number of structures referred to as complexes, with some of the structures reaching a height of eighty feet. \n\n\"City\" attempts to synthesize ancient monuments, Minimalism and industrial technology. Heizer's inspiration for the work came while he was visiting the Yucatan and studying Chichen Itza. Heizer also cites an interest in the ceremonial squares and associated civic monuments of cites.\n\nThe cost of \"City\" is being financed by several patrons, including the Dia Art Foundation and Lannan Foundation, with an estimated cost of well over twenty five million USD. The work is located on a large parcel of private land owned by the artist and is closed to the public until its completion. Heizer is currently completing the work with a team of roughly a dozen and had, as of 2005, anticipated completion before 2010. As of Spring 2015 \"City\" is not yet open to the public. Visitors are explicitly not welcome, and due to its orientation away from the road and system of earthen berms no part of \"City\" can be viewed from the ground without trespassing on posted property, but photos can be seen here.\n\nGarden Valley has been eyed for several major projects in the years since Heizer started working on his sculpture. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the government planned to crisscross the valley and others nearby with railroad tracks that would carry MX missiles to and from hidden silos. The program was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe proposed Yucca Mountain Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy terminal storage facility for spent nuclear reactor and other radioactive waste would have included a new railroad line across Garden Valley, and would have come within its sightline. Heizer reportedly considered burying \"City\" if this line was built.\n\nIn September 2014, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada introduced “Garden Valley Withdrawal Act,” a bill that would preserve the land around \"City\" and protect 805,100 acres of Federal land from mineral and energy development. Reid had visited the area around \"City\" in 2007, and he soon after tried to pass a similar bill in 2010 that would designate part of Garden Valley and nearby Coal Valley as a national conservation area. In early 2015, a group of American museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston the Walker Art Center, and the Nevada Museum of Art joined together to urge preservation of the area.\n\nIn July 2015, the area became part of the newly-created Basin and Range National Monument. The national monument designation will prevent new railroad or power lines and other development.\n\n"}

He worked on the official maps of the \"Padrón Real\" (or \"Padrón General\") from 1518-1532. He also made navigation instruments, including astrolabes and quadrants.\n\nBorn as Diogo Ribeiro, he was the son of Afonso Ribeiro and Beatriz de Oliveira. However, there is no known record of the date and place of his birth. He is believed to have become a seaman at an early age and made several voyages to India as a ship pilot. Reportedly, Ribeiro sailed with Pedro Afonso de Aguiar who served as captain in the Armadas of the explorers Vasco da Gama (1502), Lopo Soares (1504), and Afonso de Albuquerque (1509).\n\nBy 1516, Diogo Ribeiro and other several Portuguese navigators and cartographers, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, gathered in Seville to serve the newly crowned Charles V. Among them were explorers and cartographers Diogo and Duarte Barbosa, Estêvão Gomes, João Serrão, Ferdinand Magellan and Jorge Reinel, cosmographers Francisco and Ruy Faleiro and the Flemish merchant Christopher de Haro. Ribeiro started working for Charles I (and V of the Holy Roman Empire) in 1518, as a cartographer at the \"Casa de Contratación\" in Seville. Ferdinand Magellan took part in the development of the maps used in the first circumnavigation of the Earth.\n\nOn January 10, 1523, he was named Royal Cosmographer and \"master in the art of creating maps, astrolabes, and other instruments\". He eventually succeeded Sebastian Cabot (who left on a voyage) as the head cartographer. Cabot published his first map in 1544.\n\nIn 1524, Ribeiro participated in the Castilian (\"Spanish\") delegation at the Conference of Badajoz, where Castile (\"Spain\") and Portugal discussed whether the Philippines were on the Castilian or Portuguese side of the Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nIn 1527, Ribeiro finished the Padrón Real, the official (and secret) Spanish map used as template for the maps present in all Spanish ships. It is considered the first scientific world map.\n\nIn 1531, he invented a bronze water pump that was able to pump water out ten times faster than the previous models.\n\nDiogo Ribeiro died in 1533.\n\nRibeiro's most important work is the 1527 Padrón Real. There are 6 copies attributed to Ribeiro, including at the Weimar Grand Ducal Library (1527 \"Mundus Novus\") and at the Vatican Library, in Vatican City (1529 \"Propaganda Map\" or \"Carta Universal\"). The layout of the map (\"Mapamundi\") is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-Elcano trip around the world.\n\nDiogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of Central and South America. It shows the whole east coast of the Americas but of the west coast only the area from Guatemala to Ecuador. However, neither Australia nor Antarctica appear, and the Indian subcontinent appears too small. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the Pacific Ocean. It also shows, for the first time, the North American coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by Estêvão Gomes's exploration in 1524/25). It also shows the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The absence of any large continent south of Asia is evidence that there had been no discovery of Australia at that date.\n\n  - Diego Ribero's name also appears as \"Diogo Ribeiro\" in Portuguese documents.\n<br>  - An exhibit of Padron Real was March 2002, in \"Florida, the Making of a State\".\n\n<br>  - The main sources include:\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1812 to take over functions previously conducted by the United States Department of the Treasury. Starting with the passage of the Land Ordinance of 1785, which created the Public Land Survey System, the Treasury Department had already overseen the survey of the \"Northwest Territory\", including what is now the state of Ohio.\n\nPlaced under the Department of the Interior when that department was formed in 1849, it was merged with the United States Grazing Service (established in 1934) to become the Bureau of Land Management on July 16, 1946.\n\nThe GLO oversaw the surveying, platting, and sale of the public lands in the Western United States and administered the Homestead Act and the Preemption Act in disposal of public lands. The frantic pace of public land sales in the 19th century American West led to the idiomatic expression \"land-office business\", meaning a thriving or high-volume trade.\n\nThe GLO was placed under the Secretary of the Interior when the Department of the Interior was formed in 1849. Reacting to public concerns about forest conservation, Congress in 1891 authorized the President to withdraw timber lands from disposal. Grover Cleveland then created 17 forest reserves of nearly , which were initially managed by the GLO. In 1905, Congress transferred responsibility for these reserves to the newly created Forest Service, under the Department of Agriculture.\n\nBeginning in the early 20th century, the GLO shifted from a primary function of land sales to issuing leases and collecting grazing fees for livestock raised on public lands, and royalties from minerals off lands recently withdrawn from disposal under the Withdrawal Act of 1910, as well as other custodial duties. Thus, beginning around 1900, the GLO gained a focus for conservation of renewable public resources, as well as for their exploitation.\n\nOn July 16, 1946, the GLO was merged with the United States Grazing Service (established in 1934 under the Taylor Grazing Act) to become the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency of the Interior Department responsible for administering the remaining of public lands still in federal ownership.\n\nAn early commissioner was John McLean, later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThe BLM makes images of GLO records (federal land patents, survey plats and field notes, land status records, and tract books) issued between 1787 and present publicly available on its website.\nSince 1990, the BLM's Geographic Coordinates Database (GCDB) program has endeavored to generate coordinate values for each established PLSS corner using the official survey records of the GLO and BLM on a township basis.

The country is situated in its entirety inside the tropical Indomalayan ecozone and the (ICT).\n\nCambodia's main geographical features are the low lying Central Plain that includes the Tonlé Sap basin, the lower Mekong River flood-plains and the Bassac River plain surrounded by mountain ranges to the north, east, in the south-west and south. The central lowlands extend into Vietnam to the south-east. The south and south-west of the country constitute a long coast at the Gulf of Thailand, characterized by sizable mangrove marshes, peninsulas, sandy beaches and headlands and bays. Cambodia's territorial waters account for over 50 islands. The highest peak is Phnom Aural, sitting above sea level.\n\nThe landmass is bisected by the Mekong river, which at is the longest river in Cambodia. After extensive rapids, turbulent sections and cataracts in Laos, the river enters the country at Stung Treng province, is predominantly calm and navigable during the entire year as it widens considerably in the lowlands. The Mekong's waters disperse into the surrounding wetlands of central Cambodia and strongly affect the seasonal nature of the Tonlé Sap lake.\n\nTwo third of the country's population live in the lowlands, where the rich sediment deposited during the Mekong's annual flooding makes the agricultural lands highly fertile. As deforestation and over-exploitation affected Cambodia only in recent decades, forests, low mountain ranges and local eco-regions still retain much of their natural potential and although still home to the largest areas of contiguous and intact forests in mainland Southeast Asia, multiple serious environmental issues persist and accumulate, which are closely related to rapid population growth, uncontrolled globalization and inconsequent administration.\n\nThe majority of the country lies within the Tropical savanna climate zone, as the coastal areas in the South and West receive noticeably more and steady rain before and during the wet season. These areas constitute the easternmost fringes of the south-west monsoon, determined to be inside the Tropical monsoon climate. Countrywide there are two seasons of relatively equal length, defined by varying precipitation as temperatures and humidity are generally high and steady throughout the entire year.\n\nSoutheast Asia consists of allochthonous continental blocks from Gondwanaland. These include the South China, Indochina, Sibumasu, and West Burma blocks, which amalgamated to form the Southeast Asian continent during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods.\n\nThe current geological structure of South China and South-East Asia is determined to be the response to the \"Indo-sinian\" collision in South-East Asia during the Carboniferous. The Indo-Sinian orogeny was followed by extension of the Indo-Chinese block, the formation of rift basins and thermal subsidence during the early Triassic.\n\nThe Indochina continental block, which is separated from the South China Block by the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan Suture zone, is an amalgamation of the Viet-Lao, Khorat-Kontum, Uttaradit (UTD), and Chiang Mai-West Kachin terranes, all of which are separated by suture zones or ductile shear zones.\nThe Khorat-Kontum terrane, which includes western Laos, Cambodia and southern Vietnam, consists of the Kontum metamorphic complex, Paleozoic shallow marine deposits, upper Permian arc volcanic rocks and Mesozoic terrigenous sedimentary rocks.\n\nThe central plains consist mainly of Quaternary sands, loam and clay, as most of the northern mountain regions and the coastal region are largely composed of Cretaceous granite, Triassic stones and Jurassic sandstone formations.\n\nBowl- or saucer-shaped, Cambodia covers in the south-western part of the Indochinese peninsula as its landmass and marine territory is situated entirely within the tropics.\n\nThe bowl's bottom represents Cambodia's interior, about 75 percent, consisting of alluvial flood-plains of the Tonlé Sap basin, the lower Mekong River and the Bassac River plain, whose waters feed the large and almost centrally located wetlands. As humans preferably settle in these fertile and easily accessible central lowlands, major transformations and widespread cultivation through wet-rice agriculture have over the centuries shaped the landscape into distinctive regional cultivated lands. Domestic plants, such as sugar palms, Coconut trees and banana groves almost exclusively skirt extensive rice paddies, as natural vegetation is confined to elevated lands and near waterways. The Mekong traverses the north to south-east portions of the country, where the low-lying plains extend into Vietnam and reach the South China Sea at the Mekong Delta region.\n\nCambodia's low mountain ranges - representing the walls of the bowl - remain as the result of only rather recent substantial infrastructural development and economic exploitation - in particular in remote areas - formidably forested. The country is fringed to the north by the Dangrek Mountains plateau, bordering Thailand and Laos, to the north-east by the Annamite Range, in the south-west by the Cardamom Mountains and in the South by the Elephant Mountains. Highlands to the north-east and to the east merge into the Central Highlands and the Mekong Delta lowlands of Vietnam.\n\nA heavily indented coastline at the Gulf of Thailand of length and 60 offshore islands, that dot the territorial waters and locally merge with tidal mangrove marshes - the environmental basis for a remarkable range of marine and coastal eco-regions.\n\n\"Sandy materials cover a large proportion of the landscape of Cambodia, on account of the siliceous sedimentary formations that underlie much of the Kingdom. Mesozoic sandstone dominates most of the basement geology in Cambodia and hence has a dominating influence on the properties of upland soils. Arenosols (sandy soils featuring very weak or no soil development) are mapped on only 1.6% of the land area.\"\n\n\"Sandy surface textures are more prevalent than the deep sandy soils that fit the definition for Arenosols. Sandy textured profiles are common amongst the most prevalent soil groups, including Acrisols and Leptosols. The Acrisols are the most prevalent soil group occupying the lowlands - nearly half of the land area of Cambodia. Low fertility and toxic amounts of aluminium pose limitations to its agricultural use, crops that can be successfully cultivated include rubber tree, oil palm, coffee and sugar cane.\nThe main subgroups are: Gleyic Acrisols (20.5%, Haplic Acrisols (13.3%), Plinthic Acrisol (8.7%) and Ferric Acrisol (6.3%).\"\n\n\nThe vast alluvial and lacustrine interconnected Cambodian flood-plain is a geologically relatively recent depression where the sediments of the Mekong and its tributaries accumulate as waters are subject to frequent course changes. The area covers . The Tonlé Sap lake and - river system occupies the lowest area. The Tonle Sap river is a waterway that branches off the Mekong near Phnom Penh in the north-westerly direction and meets the Tonle Sap lake after around . Its waters' flow reverses direction every year, caused by greatly varying amounts of water carried by the Mekong over the course of a year and the impact of monsoonal rains, that coincides with the river's maximum.\n\nThe plains of the Mekong and Tonle Sap basin are confined in the North by the Dangrek and Central Annamite Mountains, and to the South by the Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Mountains. The plains completely surround the Tonle Sap Lake in the western half of the country and wind their way through the middle of the country following the course of the Mekong River. The two basins actually form a single body of water, the whole of which effects about 75% of Cambodia’s land cover.\n\nThe Mekong river and its tributaries increase water volumes in spring (May) on the northern hemisphere, mainly caused by melting snows. As the Mekong enters Cambodia (over 95% of its waters have already joined the river) it widens and inundates large areas.\n\nThe plain's deepest point - the Tonle Sap - flooded area varies from a low of around with a depth of around 1 meter at the end of the dry season (April) to and a depth of up to 9 meters in October/November. This figure rose to during 2000 when some of the worst flood conditions recorded caused over 800 deaths in Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nInflow starts in May/June with maximum rates of flow of around 10,000 m/s by late August and ends in October/November, amplified by precipitation of the annual monsoon. In November the lake reaches its maximum size. The annual monsoon coincides to cease around this time of the year. As the Mekong river begins its minimum around this time of the year and its water level falls deeper than the inundated Tonle Sap lake, Tonle Sap river and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin now drains via the Tonle Sap river into the Mekong. As a result the Tonle Sap River (length around ) flows 6 months a year from South-East (Mekong) to North-West (lake) and 6 month a year in the opposite direction. The mean annual reverse flow volume in the Tonle Sap is , or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10% is estimated to enter the system by overland flow from the Mekong. The Mekong branches off into several arms near Phnom Penh and reaches Vietnamese territory south of Koh Thom and Loek Daek districts of Kandal Province.\n\nThis region represents the eastern parts of the original extent of the wet evergreen forests that cover the Cardamom - and Elephant Mountains in South-West Cambodia and along the mountains east of Bangkok in Thailand.\n\nThe densely wooded hills receive rainfall of annually on their western slopes (which are subject to the South-West monsoons) but only on their eastern - rain shadow - slopes.\n\nThe Cardamom/Krâvanh Mountains\nOccupying Koh Kong Province and Kampong Speu Province, running in a north-western to south-eastern direction and rising to more than . The highest mountain of Cambodia, Phnom Aural, at is located in Aoral District in Kampong Speu Province.\nThe Cardamom Mountains form - including the north-western part of Chanthaburi Province, Thailand, the 'Soi Dao Mountains' - \"the Cardamom Mountains Moist Forests Ecoregion\", that is considered to be one of the most species-rich and intact natural habitats in the region. The climate, size inaccessibility and seclusion of the mountains have allowed a rich variety of wildlife to thrive. The Cardamom and Elephant Mountains remain to be fully researched and documented.\n\nThe Elephant Mountains\nChuŏr Phnum Dâmrei - A north-south-trending range of high hills, an extension of the Cardamom/Krâvanh Mountains, in south-eastern Cambodia, rising to elevations of between 500 and 1,000 meters. Extending north from the Gulf of Thailand, they reach a high point in the Bok Koŭ ridge at Mount Bokor near the sea.\n\nTo the south-west of the Southern mountain ranges extends a narrow coastal plain that contains the Kampong Saom Bay area and the Sihanoukville peninsula, facing the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nThe Dangrek Mountains\nA forested range of hills averaging , dividing Thailand from Cambodia, mainly formed of massive sandstone with slate and silt. A few characteristic basalt hills are located on the northern side of the mountain chain. This east–west-trending range extends from the Mekong River westward for approximately , merging with the highland area near San Kamphaeng, Thailand. Essentially the southern escarpment of the sandstone Khorat Plateau of northeastern Thailand, the Dângrêk range slopes gradually northward to the Mun River in Thailand but falls more abruptly in the south to the Cambodian plain. Its highest point is . The watershed along the escarpment in general terms marks the boundary between Thailand and Cambodia, however there are exceptions. The region is covered in dry evergreen forest, mixed dipterocarp forest, and deciduous dipterocarp forests. Tree species like Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Shorea siamensis and Xylia xylocarpa var. kerrii dominate. Illegal logging are issues on both, the Thai as well as on the Cambodian side, leaving large hill stretches denuded, vulnerable tree species such as Dalbergia cochinchinensis have been affected. Forest fires are common during the dry season.\nAnnamite Range\nLying to the east of the Mekong River, the long chain of mountains called the Annamite Mountains of Indochina and the lowlands that surround them make up the Greater Annamites ecoregion. Levels of rainfall vary from annually. Mean annual temperatures are about . This eco-region contains some of the last relatively intact moist forests in Indochina. Moisture-laden monsoon winds, that blow in from the Gulf of Tonkin ensure permanent high air humidity. Plants and animals adapted to moist conditions, to seek refuge here and evolve into highly specialized types that are found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nEthnically diverse\nMore than 30 ethnic groups of indigenous people live in the Annamites, each with their distinctive and traditional music, language, dress and customs. The natural resources of the Greater Annamites are vital to all of these people.\n\nTall grasses and deciduous forests cover the ground east of the Mekong River in Mondulkiri, where the transitional plains merge with the eastern highlands at altitudes from . The landscape has suffered from rubber farming, logging and particularly mining, although sizable areas of pristine jungle survive, which are home to rare and endemic wildlife.\n\nCambodia's coastal area covers , distributed among four provinces: Sihanoukville province, Kampot province, Koh Kong province, and Kep province. The total length of the Cambodian coastal area has been disputed. The most widely accepted length is , a 1997 survey by the DANIDA organization announced a length at , and in 1973 the \"Oil Authority\" found the coast to be long. The Food and Agriculture Organization claims a length of in one of its studies.\n\nThe southern mountain ranges drain to the south and west towards the shallow sea. Sediments on the continental shelf are the basis for extensive mangroves marshes, in particular in the Koh Kong province and the Ream National Park.\n\nCambodia’s islands fall under administration of the 4 coastal provinces. \"There are 60 islands in Cambodia's coastal waters. They include 23 in Koh Kong province, 2 in Kampot province, 22 in Sihanoukville and 13 in Kep city.[sic]\" Most islands are, apart from the two small groups of the outer islands, in relative proximity to the coast. The islands and the coastal region of Koh Kong Province are mainly composed of upper Jurassic and lower Cretaceous sandstomne massives. The north-westernmost islands near and around the Kaoh Pao river delta (Prek Kaoh Pao) area are to a great extent sediments of estuaries and rivers, very flat and engulfed in contiguous mangrove marshes.\n\nCambodia's climate, like that of much of the rest of mainland Southeast Asia is dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because of the distinctly marked seasonal differences. The monsoonal air-flows are caused by annual alternating high pressure and low pressure over the Central Asian landmass. In summer, moisture-laden air—the southwest monsoon—is drawn landward from the Indian Ocean. The flow is reversed during the winter, and the northeast monsoon sends back dry air. The southwest monsoon brings the rainy season from mid-May to mid-September or to early October, and the northeast monsoon flow of drier and cooler air lasts from early November to March. Temperatures are fairly uniform throughout the Tonlé Sap Basin area, with only small variations from the average annual mean of around .\n\nThe maximum mean is about ; the minimum mean, about . Maximum temperatures of higher than , however, are common and, just before the start of the rainy season, they may rise to more than . Minimum night temperatures sporadically fall below . in January, the coldest month. May is the warmest month - although strongly influenced by the beginning of the wet season, as the area constitutes the easternmost fringe of the south-west monsoon. Tropical cyclones only rarely cause damage in Cambodia.\n\nThe total annual rainfall average is between , and the heaviest amounts fall in the southeast. Rainfall from April to September in the Tonlé Sap Basin-Mekong Lowlands area averages annually, but the amount varies considerably from year to year. Rainfall around the basin increases with elevation. It is heaviest in the mountains along the coast in the southwest, which receive from to more than of precipitation annually as the southwest monsoon reaches the coast. This area of greatest rainfall, however, drains mostly to the sea; only a small quantity goes into the rivers flowing into the basin. Relative humidity is high throughout the entire year; usually exceeding 90%. During the dry season daytime humidity rates average around 50 percent or slightly lower, climbing to about 90% during the rainy season.\n\nThe Mekong River and its tributaries comprise one of the largest river systems\nin the world. The central Tonle Sap, the \"Great Lake\" has several input rivers, the most important being the Tonle Sap River, which contributes 62% of the total water supply during the rainy season. Direct rainfall on the lake and the other rivers in the sub-basin contribute the remaining 38%. Major rivers are the Sen river, Sreng River, Stung Pouthisat River, Sisophon River, Mongkol Borei River, and Sangkae River.\n\nSmaller rivers in the southeast, the Cardamom Mountains and Elephant Range form separate drainage divides. To the east the rivers flow into the Tonle Sap, as in the south-west rivers flow into the Gulf of Thailand. Toward the southern slopes of the Elephant Mountains, small rivers flow south-eastward on the eastern side of the divide.\n\nThe Mekong River flows southward from the Cambodia-Laos border to a point south of Kratié (town), where it turns west for about and then turns southwest towards Phnom Penh. Extensive rapids run north of Kratie city. From Kampong Cham Province the gradient slopes very gently, and inundation of areas along the river occurs at flood stage. From June through November—through breaks in the natural levees that have built up along its course. At Phnom Penh four major water courses meet at a point called the Chattomukh (Four Faces). The Mekong River flows in from the northeast and the Tonle Sap river emanates from the Tonle Sap—flows in from the northwest. They divide into two parallel channels, the Mekong River proper and the Bassac River, and flow independently through the delta areas of Cambodia and Vietnam to the South China Sea.\n\nThe flow of water into the Tonle Sap is seasonal. In spring, the flow of the Mekong River, fed by monsoon rains, increases to a point where its outlets through the delta can't handle the enormous volume of water. At this point, the water pushes northward up the Tonle Sap river and empties into the Tonle Sap lake, thereby increasing the size of the lake from about to about at the height of the flooding. After the Mekong's waters crest — when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water — the flow reverses, and water flows out of the engorged lake.\n\nAs the level of the Tonle Sap retreats, it deposits a new layer of sediment. The annual flooding, combined with poor drainage immediately around the lake, transforms the surrounding area into marshlands, unusable for agricultural purposes during the dry season. The sediment deposited into the lake during the Mekong's flood stage appears to be greater than the quantity carried away later by the Tonle Sap River. Gradual silting of the lake would seem to be occurring; during low-water level, it is only about deep, while at flood stage it is between deep.\n\nCambodia has one of the highest levels of forest cover in the region as the interdependence of Cambodia’s geography and hydrology makes it rich in natural resources and biological diversity - among the bio-richest countries in Southeast Asia. The Royal Government of Cambodia estimates Cambodia contains approximately 10.36 million hectares of forest cover, representing approximately 57.07% of Cambodia’s land area (2011). On the contrary, international observers and independent sources provide rather different numbers. Consensus permeates, as most sources agree, that deforestation, loss of seasonal wetlands and habitat destruction - among countless minor factors - correlates with the absence of strict administrative control and indifference in law enforcement - not only in Cambodia but the entire region.\n\nFigures and assessments are numerous as are available sources. as seen in numbers below, which provide a wide range for interpretation. About (1%) of forest cover is planted forest. Overall Cambodia’s forests contain an estimated 464 million metric tonnes of carbon stock in living forest biomass. Approximately 40% of Cambodia’s Forests have some level of protection, while one of the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals targets is to achieve a 60% forest cover by 2015.\n\nAccording to the \"Forestry Administration\" statistics, a total of 380,000 hectares of forest were cleared between 2002 and 2005/2006 - a deforestation rate of 0.5% per year. The main cause of deforestation has been determined to be large-scale agricultural expansions.\n\nThe Southern Annamites Montane Rain Forests ecoregion of the montane forests of Kontuey Nea, \"the dragon's tail\" in the remote north-west of Cambodia, where the boundaries of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam meet, is remarkably rich in biodiversity. The relatively intact forests occupy a broad topographic range - from lowlands with wet evergreen forests to montane habitats with evergreen hardwood and conifer forests. The complex geological, topographic and climatic ( rainfall and temperature ) facets that characterize the region make forest structure and composition unique and very variable. There is a unusually high number of near-endemic and endemic species among the many species to be found in the area. The entire eco-region has a size of .\n\nThe Tonle Sap, also known as the Great Lake in central Cambodia is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world. The Lake functions as a natural flood water reservoir for the Mekong system as a whole and therefore is an important source of water for the Mekong Delta during the dry season. The ecosystem has developed as a result of the Mekong’s seasonal flow fluctuations. A belt of freshwater mangroves known as the \"flooded forest\" surrounds the lake. The floodplains in turn are surrounded by low hills, covered with evergreen seasonal tropical forest with substantial dipterocarp vegetation or deciduous dry forest. The eco-region consists of a mosaic of habitats for a great number of species. The forest gradually yields to bushes and finally grassland with increasing distance from the lake.\n\nHenri Mouhot: \"Travels in the Central Parts of Indo-China\" 1864\n\nOn higher quality soils or at higher elevation, areas of mixed deciduous forest and semi-evergreen forests occur. This variety of vegetation types accounts for the quantity and diversity of species of the Great Lake ecosystem. Interlocking forest, - grassland and marshland patches provide the many facets and refugiae for the abundant local wildlife.\n\nThe lake’s flooded forest and the surrounding floodplains are of utmost importance for Cambodia's agriculture as the region represents the cultural heart of Cambodia, the center of the national freshwater fishery industry - the nation's primary protein source.\nThreats to the lake include widespread pollution, stress through growth of the local population which is dependent on the lake for subsistence and livelihood, over-harvesting of fish and other aquatic - often endangered - species, habitat destruction and potential changes in the hydrology, such as the construction and operation of dams, that disrupt the lake's natural flood cycle. However, concerns that the lake is rapidly filling with sediment seem - according to studies - to be unfounded at the present time.\n\nWetlands cover more than 30% of Cambodia. In addition to the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap floodplain there are the Stung Sen River and the coastal Stung Koh Pao - and Stung Kep estuaries of Koh Kong Province and Kep Province. The freshwater wetlands of Cambodia represent one of the most diverse ecosystems worldwide. The area’s extensive wetland habitats are the product of the annual Mekong maximum, the simultaneous wet season and the drainage paths of a number of minor rivers. See also:Geography of Cambodia#Hydrology The numerous and varied wetlands are Cambodia's central and traditional settlement area, the productive environments for rice cultivation, freshwater fisheries, other forms of agriculture and aquaculture and the constantly growing tourism sector. Considering the eco-region's importance, a variety of plans for local wetland management consolidation exist with varying degrees of completion.\n\nThe Cambodian coastline consists of of over 30 species of mangroves - among the most biologically diverse wetlands on earth. The most pristine mangrove forests are found in Koh Kong Province. In addition to mangroves, sea-grass beds extend throughout the coastal areas, especially in Kampot Province, the Sihanoukville Bay Delta and the Kep municipal waters. The meadows are highly productive, but few animals feed directly on the grasses. Those that do tend to be vertebrates such as sea turtles, dabbling ducks and geese.\n\n\"With their roots deep in mud, jagged and gnarled mangrove trees are able to grow in the brackish wetlands between land and sea where other plant life cannot survive. The trees offer refuge and nursery grounds for fish, crabs, shrimp, and mollusks. They are nesting - and migratory sites for hundreds of bird species. They also provide homes for monkeys, lizards, sea turtles, and many other animals as well as countless insects. \"\n\n\"Until relatively recently, the mangroves of Koh Kong, Cambodia have remained relatively intact. This is partly because of the region’s location — it is an isolated, inaccessible place — and because decades of war and conflict perversely protected the forests from over-exploitation. Local people, however, tended to use the forest's sustainability, for food, fuel, medicine, building materials, and other basic needs. \"\n\nCambodia is home to a wide array of wildlife. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 176 reptile species (including 89 subspecies), 850 freshwater fish species (Tonlé Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species.\nMany of the country's species are recognized by the IUCN or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to deforestation and habitat destruction, poaching, illegal wildlife trade, farming, fishing, and unauthorized forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the Kouprey, to extinction. Wild tigers, Eld's deer, wild water buffaloes and hog deer are at critically low numbers.\n\n\"The 1993 Royal Decree on the Protection of Natural Areas recognized 23 protected areas, which at the time covered more than 18% of the country’s total land area.\"\n\n\nCambodia borders Vietnam over a length of , Thailand over a length of and Laos over a length of , with in total and an additional of coastline. The capital (\"reach thani\") and provinces (\"khaet\") of Cambodia are first-level administrative divisions. Cambodia is divided into 25 provinces including the capital.\n\nMunicipalities and districts are the second-level administrative divisions of Cambodia. The provinces are subdivided into 159 districts and 26 municipalities. The districts and municipalities in turn are further divided into communes (\"khum\") and quarters (\"sangkat\").\n\nCambodia, Laos and Vietnam have experienced major changes in land use and land cover over the last two decades. The emergence from cold war rivalries and recent major economic reforms result in a shift from subsistence agrarian modes of production to market-based agricultural production and industrialized economies, which are heavily integrated into regional and global trade systems.\n\nCambodia's boundaries were for the most part based upon those recognized by France and by neighboring countries during the colonial period. The boundary with Thailand runs along the watershed of the Dangrek Mountains, although only in its northern sector. The border with Laos and the border with Vietnam result from French administrative decisions and do not follow major natural features. Border disputes have broken out in the past and do persist between Cambodia and Thailand as well as between Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nArea:\n<br>\"total:\"\n\n<br>\"land:\"\n\n<br>\"water:\"\nMaritime claims:\n<br>\"territorial sea:\"\n\n<br>\"contiguous zone:\"\n\n<br>\"exclusive economic zone:\"\n\n<br>\"continental shelf:\"\nElevation extremes:\n<br>\"lowest point:\"\nGulf of Thailand \n<br>\"highest point:\"\nPhnum Aoral \n\nBorder disputes\n\n\nLakes\n\nIn late 1969, the Cambodian government granted a permit to a French company to explore for petroleum in the Gulf of Thailand.

Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the South China Sea, however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's offshore area, especially because the country is on the same continental shelf as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.\n\n\nTotal renewable water resources:\n\n\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nA nascent environmental movement has been noticed by NGO's - and it is gaining strength, as the example of local resistance against the building of a Chinese hydro-electric dam in the Areng Valley shows.\n\nConsequences\n\nCambodia is party to the following treaties:\n\n\nSigned, but not ratified:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The islands are primarily granite rock, with some sequences of sedimentary rocks formed during rift basin periods or times when the islands were submerged in shallow water. \n\nSeychelles began to form in the Neoproterozoic as a granite microcontinent. Granite is the bedrock of Mahe, Praslin, La Digue and Fregate, with the rock dated as 755 million years old. Much of the rock is gray granite, while in southwest it is a pink porphyry form of granite. \n\nThe rifting apart of the supercontinent Gondwana in the Late Paleozoic created failed rift grabens. The rifting process stalled and then continued in the Triassic until the Middle Jurassic as between two and six kilometers of clastic sediments accumulated on the western margin of the Seychelles microcontinent. Along the passive northwest margin with Gondwana, the coastline was submerged and one kilometer of fine sediments deposited there as the Somali oceanic basin formed \n\nEast Gondwana fragmented 120 million years ago, splitting up Antarctica-Australia and Madagascar-Seychelles-India, which ultimately separated 85 million years ago as the Mascarene ocean basin formed. The Deccan Traps hotspot, which poured out immense basalt flows in India 65 million years ago and ultimately formed islands such as Mauritius and Réunion, isolated Seychelles. \n\nThe microcontinent was confined between northern Madagascar and western India until the Late Cretaceous and evolved during the Cenozoic through a process of rift and drift tectonics. The microcontinent was uplifted, eroded and impacted by volcanic eruptions. \n\nIn the early Cenozoic, around 63 million years ago, alkaline plutonic and volcanic rocks emplaced to become the Silhouette and North islands. \n\nSeychelles sources most of its water from rainfall and desalination and receives 2300 millimeters of precipitation every year. Surface water is stored by the La Gogue dam and the Rochon dam. However, the government has had to institute water rationing during the dry season from May to October. Beginning in 2009, the Seychelles government took interest in groundwater as a backup supply in fractured granite bedrock, looking to the example of granite aquifers in Sweden and commercial water companies such as Gondwana Water Drilling Company, which drilled eight test wells in the 1990s. \n\nSeychelles had a small scale guano mining industry until the 1980s and has ongoing exploration for offshore oil and gas. Currently, there is no mining in Seychelles except quarrying for clay, coral and sand to use as building material. \n"}

Schoff to indicate that he was from the city of Charax in Characene on the northern end of the present Persian Gulf. However, the Greek \"charax\" merely means \"palisade\" and there were several fortified towns that bore the name.\n\nIsidore's best known work is \"The Parthian Stations\" (, \"Stathmœ́ Parthicœ́\"; ), an itinerary of the overland trade route from Antioch to India along the caravan stations maintained by the Arsacid Empire. He seems to have given his distances in schoeni (\"ropes\") of debated value. Isidore must have written it some time after for it refers to the revolt of Tiridates II against Phraates IV, which occurred in that year. In its surviving form, \"The Parthian Stations\" appears to be a summary from some larger work. A reference in Athenaeus suggests that the title of the greater work was \"A Journey around Parthia\" (, \"tò tês Parthías periēgēticón\"). Athenaeus's reference, not included in the present text of \"The Parthian Stations\", is a description of pearl fishing.\n\nThe 1st-century historiographer Pliny the Elder refers to a \"description of the world\" commissioned by the Emperor Augustus \"to gather all necessary information in the east when his eldest son was about to set out for Armenia to take the command against the Parthians and Arabians\"; this occurred Pliny refers to the author as a \"Dionysius\", but it is assumed by Schoff that this is a mistake and Isidore was meant. It is Isidore who is cited for the relevant measurements of geographic distances.\n\nThe 2nd-century satirist Lucian of Samosata also cites an Isidore (although not necessarily this one) for claims of longevity.

It is best known historically for its refugee camp with many Tuareg people. \nThe camp became the largest in the Sahel during the extreme drought of 1973-1975.\n\nThe Sahel is a belt of grassland and savanna, with areas of woods and shrubs, that runs along the southern rim of the Sahara desert.\nIt includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.\nThe people of the region mostly live through herding, farming and fishing. Farming in most areas depends on the rain that falls during a three-month period of the summer,\nalthough irrigation is practiced along the banks of rivers and lakes.\nThe region is subject to periodic droughts.\n\nA long period of below-average rainfall occurred in the Sahel between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. The drought was extreme between 1968 and 1974, with around 100,000 people dying. Farmers and pastoralists were forced to move, with many ending up in refugee camps.\nThe Lazaret camp was mostly occupied by Tuareg nomads who had moved south from Mali, and held up to 20,000 people.\nTraditionally breeders, the Tuaregs had been forced to seek refuge in the camps when the drought killed their herds.\nThe nomads at Lazaret had lost at least one sixth of their strength before resigning themselves to move to the camp.\nSome of them, suffering from acute malnutrition, died after reaching the camp from diseases such as measles or pneumonia.\n\nLazaret was one of the most extended of the Sahelian camps, situated north of Niamey, the capital of Niger, on the road to Ouallam.\nThe local authorities largely delegated management of the camps to charitable organizations, the Catholic Mission in the case of Lazaret. This organization relied on people among the refugees who were recognized as chiefs to handle distribution of supplies and to maintain a degree of order. \n\nEach quarter of the camp was named after the place of origin of the refugees and reproduced the social structure of that region.\nSome of the housing was made of mats purchased by the Catholic mission while the rest were made from cardboard, rags or other material recovered by the refugees from the streets of the capital.\n\nThe Red Cross undertook many of the camp operations, supplying a clinic, tents and food.\nMany of the refugees lacked such basic equipment as pots in which to store water.\nThe Red Cross feared that an epidemic of cholera would break out in the camps once the 1974 rainy season began.\nThe nomad refugees in the Lazaret camp were most at risk.\nThey were in poor health and the crowded conditions were ideal for the spread is disease.\n\nIn October 1974 the camp was moved to a new location, Lazaret II, from Niamey in order to limit contact between the refugees and the capital.\nThe new camp remained full, with the families grouped by place of origin: Gao, Bourem, Timbuktu or Kidal.\nThe French Red Cross renewed its aid for another year.\nIn April 1975 UNESCO reported that 13,000 nomads had been counted in the Lazaret camp.\nLater the whole population had to move again to the Gao plateau in Mali, where nothing had been prepared for their reception.\nNormal rainfall arrived in 1976. Goats and sheep gave birth and livestock levels began to return to normal. \nThe refugees from Lazaret began to return to their grazing lands.\n\nDespite the drought, the period from 1970 to 1988 was one in which the economy of Niger boomed, driven by revenue from the uranium mines at Arlit. In this period, the population of Niamey grew from 108,000 to 398,365 inhabitants.\nThe city expanded from in 1970 to by 1977, in the process annexing the peripheral villages.\nThe flimsy huts of Lazaret were replaced by solid buildings of baked mud.\nOne of the first bilingual (French and Hausa) schools in Niger was founded in Lazaret in October 1983.\nAs of 2003 Lazaret was the location for a major market, mostly for animals and animal products brought from the countryside for sale to the butchers and industrial users of Niamey.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52028", "title": "Niagara Falls", "text": "Niagara Falls\n\nNiagara Falls is the collective name for three waterfalls that straddle the international border between the Canadian province of Ontario and the American state of New York. They form the southern end of the Niagara Gorge.\n\nFrom largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls lies on the border of the United States and Canada with the American Falls entirely on the United States' side, separated by Goat Island. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also on the United States' side, separated from the American Falls by Luna Island.\n\nLocated on the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls form the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than . During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m (six million cubic feet) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate.\n\nThe falls are north-northwest of Buffalo, New York, and south-southeast of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNiagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.\n\nThe Horseshoe Falls drop about , while the height of the American Falls varies between because of the presence of giant boulders at its base. The larger Horseshoe Falls are about wide, while the American Falls are wide. The distance between the American extremity of the Niagara Falls and the Canadian extremity is .\n\nThe peak flow over Horseshoe Falls was recorded at per second. The average annual flow rate is per second. Since the flow is a direct function of the Lake Erie water elevation, it typically peaks in late spring or early summer. During the summer months, at least per second of water traverses the falls, some 90% of which goes over the Horseshoe Falls, while the balance is diverted to hydroelectric facilities. This is accomplished by employing a weir – the International Control Dam – with movable gates upstream from the Horseshoe Falls. The falls' flow is further halved at night, and, during the low tourist season in the winter, remains a minimum of per second. Water diversion is regulated by the 1950 Niagara Treaty and is administered by the International Niagara Board of Control (IJC).\n\nThe verdant green colour of the water flowing over the Niagara Falls is a byproduct of the estimated 60 tonnes/minute of dissolved salts and \"rock flour\" (very finely ground rock) generated by the erosive force of the Niagara River itself.\n\nThe features that became Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The same forces also created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River. All were dug by a continental ice sheet that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form lakes, and damming others with debris. Scientists argue there is an old valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.\nWhen the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and Lockport dolostone. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall.\n\nImmediately below the hard-rock formation, comprising about two-thirds of the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian). This formation was composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers. It also contains ancient fossils. In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks. This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls.\n\nSubmerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation (Upper Ordovician), which is composed of shales and fine sandstones. All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea.\n\nAbout 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was between present-day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat approximately southward. The Horseshoe Falls, which are approximately wide, have also changed their shape through the process of erosion; evolving from a small arch, to a horseshoe bend, to the present day gigantic V. Just upstream from the falls' current location, Goat Island splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the mostly Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east. Engineering has slowed erosion and recession.\n\nThe current rate of erosion is approximately 30 centimeters (1 ft) per year, down from a historical average of 0.91 m (3 ft) per year. According to the timeline of the far future, in roughly 50,000 years Niagara Falls will have eroded away the remaining to Lake Erie and cease to exist.\n\nTheories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, \"Niagara\" is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as being called the \"Niagagarega\" people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area. According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called \"Onguiaahra\", meaning \"point of land cut in two\".\n\nHenry Schoolcraft reported:\n\nNiagara Falls. This name is Mohawk. It means, according to Mrs. Kerr, the neck; the term being first applied to the portage or neck of land, between lakes Erie and Ontario. By referring to Mr. Elliott's vocabulary, (chapter xi) it will be seen that the human neck, that is, according to the concrete vocabulary, \"his\" neck, is \"onyara\". Red Jacket pronounced the word Niagara to me, in the spring of 1820, as if written O-ne-au-ga-rah.\n\nA number of figures have been suggested as first circulating a European eyewitness description of Niagara Falls. The Frenchman Samuel de Champlain visited the area as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada, and members of his party reported to him the spectacular waterfalls, which he described in his journals. The Finnish-Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm explored the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the first scientific description of the falls. The consensus honoree for the first description is the Belgian missionary Louis Hennepin, who observed and described the falls in 1677, earlier than Kalm, after traveling with the explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans. Further complicating matters, there is credible evidence the French Jesuit missionary Paul Ragueneau visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin's visit, while working among the Huron First Nation in Canada. Jean de Brébeuf also may have visited the falls, while spending time with the Neutral Nation.\n\nIn 1762, Captain Thomas Davies, a British Army officer and artist, surveyed the area and painted the watercolor, \"An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara\", the first eyewitness painting of the falls.\n\nDuring the 19th century, tourism became popular, and by mid-century, it was the area's main industry. Theodosia Burr Alston (daughter of Vice President Aaron Burr) and her husband Joseph Alston were the first recorded couple to honeymoon there in 1801. Napoleon Bonaparte's brother Jérôme visited with his bride in the early 19th century.\n\nIn 1837 during the Caroline affair, a rebel supply ship, the \"Caroline\", was burned and sent over the falls. In March 1848, ice blockage caused the falls to stop; no water (or at best a trickle) fell for as much as 40 hours. Waterwheels stopped, mills and factories shut down for having no power.\n\nLater that year, demand for passage over the Niagara River led to the building of a footbridge and then Charles Ellet's Niagara Suspension Bridge. This was supplanted by German-born John Augustus Roebling's Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge in 1855. After the American Civil War, the New York Central Railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits. With increased railroad traffic, in 1886, Leffert Buck replaced Roebling's wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, it carries passenger vehicles and trains between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S.A. just downstream of the falls.\n\nIn about 1840, the English industrial chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson travelled to Canada, stopping at the Niagara Falls long enough to make the earliest known photograph of the falls, a daguerreotype in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is left-right inverted, and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours' \"Excursions Daguerriennes\" (Paris, 1841–1864).\n\nAfter the First World War, tourism boomed again, as automobiles made getting to the falls much easier. The story of Niagara Falls in the 20th century is largely that of efforts to harness the energy of the falls for hydroelectric power, and to control the development on both sides that threaten the area's natural beauty.\n\nIn 1941, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission completed the third current crossing in the immediate area of Niagara Falls with the Rainbow Bridge, carrying both pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the two countries and Canadian and U.S. customs for each country.\n\nA team from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created a dam on the American Falls in June 1969 to clear rock from the base of the falls. Rock slides caused a significant buildup of rock at the bottom of the American side of the falls, and the engineers were to clean up the rock and repair some faults to prevent eventual erosion of the American side of the waterfall. A temporary dam was built to divert the flow of water to the Canadian side; the dam measured across and was made of nearly 30,000 tons of rock. The engineers cleared the rock debris and tested for safety, finishing the project in November of that year. Water flow was restored on November 25, 1969.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in the United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which were once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955, the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether, of the Horseshoe Falls were eliminated, including on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada. Other sources say \"most of\" Horseshoe Falls is in Canada.\n\nThe only recorded freeze up of the river and falls was due to an ice jam on March 29, 1848. Although the falls commonly ices up most winters, the river and the falls do not freeze completely. The years 1885, 1902, 1906, 1911, 1932, 1936, 2014 and 2017 are noted for the falls icing up. In 1912, much of the water coming over the American Falls froze, though a trickle still ran and the falls ran at the other two sites.\n\nThe enormous energy of Niagara Falls has long been recognized as a potential source of power. The first known effort to harness the waters was in 1759, when Daniel Joncaire built a small canal above the falls to power his sawmill. Augustus and Peter Porter purchased this area and all of American Falls in 1805 from the New York state government, and enlarged the original canal to provide hydraulic power for their gristmill and tannery. In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals that would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob F. Schoellkopf, the Niagara River's first hydroelectric generating station was built. The water fell and generated direct current electricity, which ran the machinery of local mills and lit up some of the village streets.\n\nThe Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, formed the Cataract Company headed by Edward Dean Adams, with the intent of expanding Niagara Falls' power capacity. In 1890, a five-member International Niagara Commission headed by Sir William Thomson among other distinguished scientists deliberated on the expansion of Niagara hydroelectric capacity based on seventeen proposals, but could not select any as the best combined project for hydraulic development and distribution. In 1893, Westinghouse Electric (which had built the smaller-scale Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant near Ophir, Colorado, two years earlier) was hired to design a system to generate alternating current on Niagara Falls, and three years after that this large-scale AC power system was created (activated on August 26, 1895). The Adams Power Plant Transformer House remains as a landmark of the original system.\n\nBy 1896, financing from moguls including J.P. Morgan, John Jacob Astor IV, and the Vanderbilts had fueled the construction of giant underground conduits leading to turbines generating upwards of , sent as far as Buffalo, away. Some of the original designs for the power transmission plants were created by the Swiss firm Faesch & Piccard, which also constructed the original 5,000 hp waterwheels.\n\nPrivate companies on the Canadian side also began to harness the energy of the falls. The Government of Ontario eventually brought power transmission operations under public control in 1906, distributing Niagara's energy to various parts of the Canadian province.\n\nOther hydropower plants were also being built along the Niagara River. But in 1956, disaster struck when the region's largest hydropower station was partially destroyed in a landslide. This drastically reduced power production and put tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs at stake. In 1957, Congress passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act, which granted the New York Power Authority the right to fully develop the United States' share of the Niagara River's hydroelectric potential.\n\nIn 1961, when the Niagara Falls hydroelectric project went online, it was the largest hydropower facility in the Western world. Today, Niagara is still the largest electricity producer in New York state, with a generating capacity of 2.4 gigawatts (million kilowatts). Up to of water a second is diverted from the Niagara River through conduits under the city of Niagara Falls to the Lewiston and Robert Moses power plants. Currently between 50% and 75% of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through hydroelectric turbines that supply power to nearby areas of Canada and the United States before returning to the river well past the falls. This water spins turbines that power generators, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. When electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units can operate as pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant's reservoir, allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and actually become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant.\n\nTo preserve Niagara Falls' natural beauty, a 1950 treaty signed by the U.S. and Canada limited water usage by the power plants. The treaty allows higher summertime diversion at night when tourists are fewer and during the winter months when there are even fewer tourists. This treaty, designed to ensure an \"unbroken curtain of water\" flowing over the falls, states that during daylight time during the tourist season (April 1 to October 31) there must be 100,000 cubic feet per second (2,800 m/s) of water flowing over the falls, and during the night and off-tourist season there must be 50,000 cubic feet per second (1,400 m/s) of water flowing over the falls. This treaty is monitored by the International Niagara Board of Control, using a NOAA gauging station above the falls. During winter, the Power Authority of New York works with Ontario Power Generation to prevent ice on the Niagara River from interfering with power production or causing flooding of shoreline property. One of their joint efforts is an ice boom, which prevents the buildup of ice, yet allows water to continue flowing downstream. In addition to minimum water volume, the crest of the Horseshoe falls was reduced to maintain an uninterrupted \"curtain of water.\"\n\nThe most powerful hydroelectric stations on the Niagara River are the Sir Adam Beck 1 and 2 on the Canadian side and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant on the American side. Together, Niagara's generating stations can produce about 4.4 gigawatts of power.\n\nIn August 2005 Ontario Power Generation, which is responsible for the Sir Adam Beck stations, started a major civil engineering project, called the Niagara Tunnel Project, to increase power production by building a new diameter, water diversion tunnel. It was officially placed into service in March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's nameplate capacity by 150 megawatts. It did so by tapping water from farther up the Niagara River than was possible with the preexisting arrangement. The tunnel provided new hydroelectricity for approximately 160,000 homes.\n\nShips can bypass Niagara Falls by means of the Welland Canal, which was improved and incorporated into the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the mid-1950s. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby Buffalo and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished with the help of the electric power produced by the river. However, since the 1970s the region has declined economically.\n\nThe cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges. The Rainbow Bridge, just downriver from the falls, affords the closest view of the falls and is open to non-commercial vehicle traffic and pedestrians. The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge lies north of the Rainbow Bridge and is the oldest bridge over the Niagara River. Nearby Niagara Falls International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport were named after the waterfall, as were Niagara University, countless local businesses, and even an asteroid.\n\nNiagara Falls have long been a source of inspiration for explorers, travelers, artists, authors, filmmakers, residents and visitors, few of whom realize the falls were nearly devoted solely to industrial and commercial use. In the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay for a glimpse, and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as Hudson River School artist Frederic Edwin Church, landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Church approached Lord Dufferin, governor-general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park.\n\nGoat Island was one of the inspirations for the American side of the effort. William Dorsheimer, moved by the scene from the island, brought Olmsted to Buffalo in 1868 to design a city park system and helped promote Olmsted's career. In 1879, the New York state legislature commissioned Olmsted and James T. Gardner to survey the falls and to create the single most important document in the Niagara preservation movement, a Special Report on the preservation of Niagara Falls. The report advocated for State purchase, restoration and preservation through public ownership of the scenic lands surrounding Niagara Falls. Restoring the former beauty of the falls was described in the report as a \"sacred obligation to mankind.\" In 1883, New York Governor Grover Cleveland drafted legislation authorizing acquisition of lands for a state reservation at Niagara, and the Niagara Falls Association, a private citizens group founded in 1882, mounted a great letter-writing campaign and petition drive in support of the park. Professor Charles Eliot Norton and Olmsted were among the leaders of the public campaign, while New York Governor Alonzo Cornell opposed.\n\nPreservationists' efforts were rewarded on April 30, 1885, when Governor David B. Hill signed legislation creating the Niagara Reservation, New York's first state park. New York State began to purchase land from developers, under the charter of the Niagara Reservation State Park. In the same year, the province of Ontario established the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park for the same purpose. On the Canadian side, the Niagara Parks Commission governs land usage along the entire course of the Niagara River, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.\n\nIn 1887, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux issued a supplemental report detailing plans to restore the falls. Their intent was \"to restore and conserve the natural surroundings of the Falls of Niagara, rather than to attempt to add anything thereto,\" and the report anticipated fundamental questions. How would preservationists provide access without destroying the beauty of the falls? How would they restore natural landscapes damaged by man? They planned a park with scenic roadways, paths and a few shelters designed to protect the landscape while allowing large numbers of visitors to enjoy the falls. Commemorative statues, shops, restaurants, and a 1959 glass and metal observation tower were added later. Preservationists continue to strive to strike a balance between Olmsted's idyllic vision and the realities of administering a popular scenic attraction.\n\nPreservation efforts continued well into the 20th century. J. Horace McFarland, the Sierra Club, and the Appalachian Mountain Club persuaded the United States Congress in 1906 to enact legislation to preserve the falls by regulating the waters of the Niagara River. The act sought, in cooperation with the Canadian government, to restrict diversion of water, and a treaty resulted in 1909 that limited the total amount of water diverted from the falls by both nations to approximately 56,000 cubic feet (1,600 m) per second. That limitation remained in effect until 1950.\n\nErosion control efforts have always been of extreme importance. Underwater weirs redirect the most damaging currents, and the top of the falls has also been strengthened. In June 1969, the Niagara River was completely diverted from the American Falls for several months through construction of a temporary rock and earth dam (clearly visible in the photo at right). During this time, two bodies were removed from under the falls, including a man who had been seen jumping over the falls, and the body of a woman, which was discovered once the falls dried.\n\nWhile the Horseshoe Falls absorbed the extra flow, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted and strengthened any faults they found; faults that would, if left untreated, have hastened the retreat of the American Falls. A plan to remove the huge mound of talus deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was dynamited, restoring flow to the American Falls. Even after these undertakings, Luna Island, the small piece of land between the main waterfall and the Bridal Veil, remained off limits to the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge.\n\nCommercial interests have continued to encroach on the land surrounding the state park, including the construction of several tall buildings (most of them hotels) on the Canadian side. The result is a significant alteration and urbanisation of the landscape. One study indicated it has caused the airflow near the falls to change direction. Students at the University of Guelph demonstrated, using scale models, that as air passes over the top of the new hotels it causes a breeze to roll down the south sides of the buildings and spill into the gorge below the falls, where it feeds into a whirlpool of moisture and air. The inference was that a documented rise in the number of \"mist days\" was a result of these breezes, where mist days refers to the mist plume of the falls reaching landside. In 1996 there were 29 mist days recorded, but by 2003 that number had risen to 68. Another study has discounted this opinion and linked mist production to the difference in air and water temperature at the falls. However, this study does not offer opinion as to why mist days have been increasing, just that the hotel breezes are an unlikely cause.\n\nIn 2013, New York State began an effort to renovate The Sisters Islands located on Goat Island. New York State used funds from the re-licensing of the New York Power Authority hydroelectric plant downriver in Lewiston, New York, to rebuild walking paths on the Three Sisters Islands and to plant native vegetation on the islands. The state also renovated the area around Prospect Point at the brink of the American Falls in the state park.\n\nIn October 1829, Sam Patch, who called himself \"the Yankee Leapster\", jumped from a high tower into the gorge below the falls and survived; this began a long tradition of daredevils trying to go over the falls.\n\nOn October 24, 1901, 63-year-old Michigan school teacher Annie Edson Taylor became the first person to go over the falls in a barrel as a publicity stunt; she survived, bleeding, but otherwise unharmed. Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, \"No one ought ever do that again.\" Before Taylor's attempt, on October 19 her domestic cat named Iagara was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength. Contrary to rumours at the time, the cat survived the plunge unharmed and later posed with Taylor in photographs. Since Taylor's historic ride, 14 people have intentionally gone over the falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the falls.\n\nIn 1918, there was a near disaster when a barge, known locally as the Niagara Scow, working upriver broke its tow, and almost plunged over the falls. The two workers on board saved themselves by grounding the vessel on rocks just short of the falls, where it has remained ever since.\n\nEnglishman Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel, drowned in 1883 trying to swim the rapids downriver from the falls.\n\nIn the \"Miracle at Niagara\", Roger Woodward, a seven-year-old American boy, was swept over the Horseshoe Falls protected only by a life vest on July 9, 1960, as two tourists pulled his 17-year-old sister Deanne from the river only from the lip of the Horseshoe Falls at Goat Island. Minutes later, Woodward was plucked from the roiling plunge pool beneath the Horseshoe Falls after grabbing a life ring thrown to him by the crew of the \"Maid of the Mist\" boat.\n\nOn July 2, 1984, Canadian Karel Soucek from Hamilton, Ontario, plunged over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel with only minor injuries. Soucek was fined $500 for performing the stunt without a license. In 1985, he was fatally injured while attempting to re-create the Niagara drop at the Houston Astrodome. His aim was to climb into a barrel hoisted to the rafters of the Astrodome and to drop into a water tank on the floor. After his barrel released prematurely, it hit the side of the tank and he died the next day from his injuries.\n\nIn August 1985, Steve Trotter, an aspiring stuntman from Rhode Island, became the youngest person ever (age 22) and the first American in 25 years to go over the falls in a barrel. Ten years later, Trotter went over the falls again, becoming the second person to go over the falls twice and survive. It was also the second-ever \"duo\"; Lori Martin joined Trotter for the barrel ride over the falls. They survived the fall but their barrel became stuck at the bottom of the falls, requiring a rescue.\n\nOn September 28, 1989, Niagara natives Peter DeBernardi (age 42) and Jeffery James Petkovich (age 25) became the first \"team\" to make it over the falls in a two-person barrel. The stunt was conceived by DeBenardi, who wanted to discourage youth from following in his path of addictive drug use. The pair emerged shortly after going over with minor injuries and were charged with performing an illegal stunt under the Niagara Parks Act.\n\nOn June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a whitewater canoeist from Tennessee paddled over the falls in a closed deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his face more visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a life vest because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics at the base of the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found.\n\nOn September 27, 1993, John \"David\" Munday, of Caistor Centre, Ontario, completed his second journey over the falls.\n\nOn October 1, 1995, Robert Douglas \"Firecracker\" Overacker went over the falls on a Jet Ski to raise awareness for the homeless. His rocket-propelled parachute failed to open and he plunged to his death. Overacker's body was recovered before he was pronounced dead at Niagara General Hospital.\n\nKirk Jones of Canton, Michigan, became the first known person to survive a plunge over the Horseshoe Falls without a flotation device on October 20, 2003. Though Jones had attempted to commit suicide, he survived the 16-story fall with only battered ribs, scrapes, and bruises. Jones died in another attempt to go over the falls in an inflatable ball in 2017.\n\nA second person survived an unprotected trip over the Horseshoe Falls on March 11, 2009, and when rescued from the river, was reported to be suffering from severe hypothermia and a large wound to his head. His identity has not been released. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the man intentionally enter the water.\n\nOn May 21, 2012, an unidentified man in his early 40s became the third person to survive an unprotected trip over the Horseshoe Falls. Eyewitness reports show he \"deliberately jumped\" into the Niagara River after climbing over a railing.\n\nOther daredevils have made crossing the gorge their goal, starting with the successful passage by Jean François \"Blondin\" Gravelet, who crossed Niagara Gorge in 1859. Between 1859 and 1896 a wire-walking craze emerged, resulting in frequent feats over the river below the falls. One inexperienced walker slid down his safety rope. Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.\n\nThese tightrope walkers drew huge crowds to witness their exploits. Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall itself. Among the many was Ontario's William Hunt, who billed himself as \"The Great Farini\" and competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge. On three occasions Blondin carried his manager, Harry Colcord, on his back—on the final time being watched by the Prince of Wales.\n\nIn 1876, 23-year-old Italian Maria Spelterini was the only woman ever to cross the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope, making four crossings over 18 days. On July 12, she crossed wearing peach baskets strapped to her feet, on July 19 blind-folded, on July 22 with her ankles and wrists manacled and finally on July 26. Tightrope crossings of the falls ended—by law—in 1896, when James Hardy crossed.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, high wire artist Nik Wallenda became the first person to walk across the falls in 116 years, after receiving special permission from both governments. The full length of his tightrope was . Wallenda crossed near the brink of the Horseshoe Falls, unlike walkers who had crossed farther downstream. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it upon arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.\n\nAlready a huge tourist attraction and favorite spot for honeymooners, Niagara Falls visits rose sharply in 1953 after the release of \"Niagara\", a movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten. In 1956, the \"Woody Woodpecker\" series released the episode \"Niagara Fools\". The 1974 ABC Movie of the Week, \"The Great Niagara,\" featuring Richard Boone and Randy Quaid and filmed on location, told the story of a family of daredevils who challenged the falls. The falls was a featured location in the 1980 movie \"Superman II\", and was itself the subject of a popular IMAX movie, \"\". Much of the episode \"Return of the Technodrome\" in the 1987 \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" cartoon series takes place near the Niagara Falls and its hydroelectric plant. Illusionist David Copperfield performed a trick in which he appeared to travel over the Horseshoe Falls in 1990.\n\nThe falls, or more particularly, the tourist-supported complex near the falls, was the setting of the short-lived Canadian-shot US television show \"Wonderfalls\" in early 2004. Location footage of the falls was shot in October 2006 to portray \"World's End\" of the movie \"\". Professional kayaker Rafa Ortiz's preparation to paddle over the falls in a kayak is documented in the 2015 film \"Chasing Niagara\".\n\nComposer Ferde Grofé was commissioned by the Niagara Falls Power Generation project in 1960 to compose the Niagara Falls Suite in honor of the completion of the first stage of hydroelectric work at the falls. Each movement is dedicated to the falls, or to the history of the greater Buffalo region. In 1997, composer Michael Daugherty composed \"Niagara Falls\", a piece for concert band inspired by the falls.\n\nThe Niagara Falls area features as the base camp for a German aerial invasion of the United States in the H. G. Wells novel \"The War in the Air\".\n\nMany poets have been inspired to write about the falls. Among them was the Cuban poet José Maria Heredia, who wrote the poem \"Niagara\". There are commemorative plaques on both sides of the falls recognising the poem.\n\nIn the original 1920s and 1930s \"Buck Rogers\" stories and newspaper cartoons, Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that take place on Earth, helps in the fight for a free Northern America from the liberated zone around Niagara, New York (which by then has grown to a large metropolis—the capital of the liberated zone—that includes Niagara Falls, New York, Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York), against the Red Mongol Empire, a Chinese empire of the future which in the 25th century rules most of North America.\n\nPart of Mark Twain's 1893 short story, \"Extract from Adam's Diary\" is set at Niagara Falls.\n\nThe Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov portrays the impressiveness of the Niagara Falls in his book, \"To Chicago and Back\".\n\nIn 2014, the writer Alessandro Baricco published the book ‘Smith & Wesson’ counting the story of Rachel Green going over the falls.\n\nThe Niagara Falls were such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were \"the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting\". Church's 1857 \"Niagara\" was exhibited on two continents to thousands of paying customers.\n\nPeak visitor traffic occurs in the summertime, when Niagara Falls are both a daytime and evening attraction. From the Canadian side, floodlights illuminate both sides of the falls for several hours after dark (until midnight). The number of visitors in 2007 was expected to total 20 million, and by 2009 the annual rate was expected to top 28 million tourists.\n\nThe oldest and best known tourist attraction at Niagara Falls is the \"Maid of the Mist\" boat cruise, named for an ancient Ongiara Indian mythical character, which has carried passengers into the rapids immediately below the falls since 1846. Cruise boats operate from boat docks on both sides of the falls, with the Maid of the Mist operating from the American side and Hornblower Cruises from the Canadian side.\n\nFrom the U.S. side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the Prospect Point Observation Tower and a boat dock for the \"Maid of the Mist\". Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above the American Falls. From Goat Island, the Cave of the Winds is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls. Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a huge statue of Nikola Tesla (the inventor whose patents for the AC induction motor and other devices for AC power transmission helped make the harnessing of the falls possible) can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls. Most of these attractions lie within the Niagara Falls State Park.\n\nThe Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along the American Falls and around Goat Island. Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed by helicopter. The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge. A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe. The Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center. The new hotel is the first addition to the city's skyline since completion of the United Office Building in the 1920s.\n\nOn the Canadian side, Queen Victoria Park features manicured gardens, platforms offering views of both the American and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms that yield the illusion of being within the falling waters. The observation deck of the nearby Skylon Tower offers the highest view of the falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as Toronto. Along with the Minolta Tower (formerly the Seagrams Tower and the Konica Minolta Tower, and since 2010 called the Tower Hotel), it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the falls.\n\nAlong the Niagara River, the Niagara River Recreational Trail runs from Fort Erie to Fort George, and includes many historical sites from the War of 1812.\n\nThe Whirlpool Aero Car, built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, is a cable car that takes passengers over the Niagara Whirlpool on the Canadian side. The Journey Behind the Falls consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.\n\nThere are two casinos on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although many different such offices existed primarily throughout the Imperial German and Nazi periods in a number of different fields (ranging from public infrastructure and spatial planning to ethnic cleansing) it is most commonly used to refer to the quasi-colonial administrative territorial entity established by Nazi Germany in several occupied countries during World War II. While officially located outside the German Reich in a legal sense, these entities were directly controlled by their supreme civil authorities (the \"Reichskommissars\"), who ruled their assigned territories as German governors on behalf of and as direct representatives of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe introduction of these territorial administrations served a number of purposes. Those established or planned to be established in Western and Northern Europe were in general envisioned as the transitional phases for the future incorporation of various Germanic countries outside pre-war Germany into an expanded Nazi state. Their eastern counterparts served primarily colonialist and imperialist purposes, as sources of future \"Lebensraum\" for German settlement and the exploitation of natural resources.\n\nAnother contrast was the level of administrative overhaul implemented in these two types. As in most other territories conquered by the Germans, local administrators and bureaucrats were pressured to continue their regular day-to-day operations (especially at the middle and lower levels) albeit under German oversight. Throughout the war the \"Reichskommissariate\" in Western and Northern Europe simply retained the previously existing administrative structure however, while in the eastern ones completely new such structures were introduced.\n\nAll of these entities were nonetheless intended for eventual integration into a Greater Germanic Reich () encompassing the general area of Europe stretching from the North Sea to the Ural mountains, for which Germany was to form the basis.\n\n\nIn summer 1941, German Nazi-ideologist Alfred Rosenberg suggested that to facilitate the break-up of the Soviet Union and Russia as a geographical entity, conquered Soviet territory should be administered in the following five Reichskommissariate:\n\n\nAt Hitler's request the Turkestan project was shelved by Rosenberg for the immediate future, who was instead ordered to focus on Europe for the time-being. Central Asia was determined to be a future target for German expansion, as soon as its armies would be ready to move further east after the consolidation of present victories in Soviet Russia. The interest in part of the area of Germany's major Axis partner, the Empire of Japan (see Axis power negotiations on the division of Asia during World War II), could have become a topic of discussion regarding their own contemporaneous establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nAdditional units that were under discussion at different points in time include \"Reichskommissariat Don-Wolga\" but, by the second half of May 1941, the number of administrative units that were to be established in the east were limited to four; as well as a \"Reichskommissariat Ural\" for the central and southern Ural region.\n\n"}

Its establishment is associated with the Syriac Union Party (SUP).\n\nWith the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War and the Rojava conflict, Sutoro units were first organized in town of al-Qahtaniyah (Qabre Hewore), and soon thereafter in al-Malikiyah (Dayrik). The Syriac Union Party maintains warm and friendly relations with its Kurdish neighbours, and it was one of numerous organisations to join the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) in establishing a formal administration for self-governance in northern Syria called Rojava. Following this policy, the Sutoro has sought to align itself with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) from an early juncture. Although the Kurds were initially suspicious when it started organising and wanted its members to either disarm or join Kurdish formations, the Sutoro was soon accepted and welcomed by Kurdish forces. It became fully integrated in the administration of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, operating alongside the general Rojavan Asayish police force, manning joint checkpoints and patrolling neighbourhoods together, while its paramilitary counterpart, the Syriac Military Council (MFS), joined an alliance with the YPG in January 2014.\n\nThe Sutoro Police should not be confused with the Sootoro which has the same name in the Syriac language, but uses the English translation \"Syriac Protection Office\" and the transliteration \"Sootoro\".

{"id": "5434703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5434703", "title": "Terminology of the Low Countries", "text": "Terminology of the Low Countries\n\nThe Low Countries is the coastal Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta region in Western Europe whose definition usually includes the modern countries of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Both Belgium and the Netherlands derived their names from earlier names for the region, due to \"nether\" meaning \"low\" and \"Belgica\" being the Latinized name for all the Low Countries, a nomenclature that went obsolete after Belgium's secession in 1830.\n\nThe Low Countries—and the Netherlands and Belgium—had in their history exceptionally many and widely varying names, resulting in equally varying names in different languages. There is diversity even within languages: the use of one word for the country and another for the adjective form is common. This holds for English, where \"Dutch\" is the adjective form for the country \"the Netherlands\". Moreover, many languages have the same word for both the country of the Netherlands and the region of the Low Countries, e.g., French (\"les Pays-Bas\") and Spanish (\"los Países Bajos\"). The complicated nomenclature is a source of confusion for outsiders, and is due to the long history of the language, the culture and the frequent change of economic and military power within the Low Countries over the past 2000 years.\n\nIn general, the names for the language, for the region, and for the countries within the region, and the adjective forms can all be arranged in five main groups according to their origin: it is a reference to a non-Latin, Germanic language—\"þiudisk\"—(\"Dietsc\", \"Dutch\", \"Nederduits\"), whose speakers are ancestral to local Germanic tribes (Belgae, Batavi, Frisii); these tribes dissolved into confederations (Franconian, Frisian) which consolidated into local, economic powerful polities (Flanders, Brabant, Holland) in the low-lying, down river land at the North Sea (Germania Inferior, Lower Lorraine, Low Countries, Netherlands).\nThe historic Low Countries made up much of Frisia, home to the Frisii, and the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior, home to the Belgae and Germanic peoples like the Batavi. Throughout the centuries, the names of these ancestors have been in use as a reference to the Low Countries, in an attempt to define a collective identity. But it was in the fourth and fifth centuries that a Frankish confederation of Germanic tribes significantly made a lasting change by entering the Roman provinces and starting to build the Carolingian Empire, of which the Low Countries formed a core part.\n\nBy the eighth century, most of the Franks had exchanged their Germanic Franconian languages for the Latin-derived Romances of Gaul. However, the Franks that stayed in the Low Countries had kept their original language, i.e., Old Dutch, also known as \"Old Low Franconian\" among linguists. At the time the language was spoken, it was known as *\"þiudisk\", meaning \"of the people\"—as opposed to the Latin language \"of the clergy\"—which is the source of the English word \"Dutch\". Now an international exception, it used to have in the Dutch language itself a cognate with the same meaning, i.e., \"Diets(c)\" or \"Duuts(c)\".\n\nThe designation \"low\" to refer to the region has also been in use many times. First by the Romans, who called it Germania \"Inferior\". After the Frankish empire was divided several times, most of it became the Duchy of Lower Lorraine in the tenth century, where the Low Countries politically have their origin. Lower Lorraine disintegrated into a number of duchies, counties and bishoprics. Some of these became so powerful, that their names were used as a \"pars pro toto\" for the Low Countries, i.e., Flanders, Holland and to a lesser extent Brabant. Burgundian, and later Habsburg rulers added one by one the Low Countries' polities in a single territory, and it was at their francophone courts that the term \"les pays de par deçà\" arose, that would develop in \"Les Pays-Bas\" or in English \"Low Countries\" or \"Netherlands\".\n\nEnglish is the only language to use the adjective \"Dutch\" for the language of the Netherlands and Flanders or something else from the Netherlands. The word is derived from Proto-Germanic . The stem of this word, , meant \"people\" in Proto-Germanic, and was an adjective-forming suffix, of which is the Modern English form. \" was its Latinised form and used as an adjective referring to the Germanic vernaculars of the Early Middle Ages. In this sense, it meant \"the language of the common people\", that is, the native Germanic language. The term was used as opposed to Latin, the \"non\"-native language of writing and the Catholic Church. It was first recorded in 786, when the Bishop of Ostia writes to Pope Adrian I about a synod taking place in Corbridge, England, where the decisions are being written down \"tam Latine quam theodisce\" meaning \"in Latin as well as Germanic\". So in this sense \"theodiscus\" was referred to the Germanic language spoken in Great Britain, that was later replaced by the name Englisc.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the Old English variant \"þeodisc\" was subsequently influenced from Middle Dutch \"duutsc/duitsc/dietsc\", and was then mainly used to refer to the inhabitants of the Low Countries, with whom there was extensive trade. Though initially also encompassing a broader definition signifying \"speakers of Germanic languages on the continent\" or \"Non-Romance speakers\" the use of the word \"Dutch\" in this sense was rare and would become obsolete following the growing and intensive rivalry between England and the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. An exception are the Pennsylvania Dutch, who were originally German immigrants, speak a German dialect and refer to themselves as \"Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch\".\n\nIn the Dutch language itself, \"Diets(c)\" (later \"Duyts and Duits\") was used as one of several autonyms until the 18th century, when it became obsolete and \"Duits\" became the sole Dutch exonym for German.\n\nFrom the second half of the 16th until the middle of the 18th century, \"Nederduits\" appears as the nomenclature for the Dutch language among both scholars and writers of literature. Not only because it was perceived as modern, but also because \"nederig\" also means \"humble\" in Dutch, thus invoking the sense of a humble language, forming a wordplay, which appealed to the highly religious Dutch people of the time and the low lying features of their country. However, the early 19th century, saw the emergence of modern Germanic linguistics, and German linguists used the term \"Niederdeutsch\" for the German varieties spoken in the North of Germany which did not experience the High German consonant shift. Dutch linguists subsequently calqued the terminology, and used \"Nederduits\" as its translation for these German dialects. As a result, \"Nederduits\" started to have two meanings. To avoid this confusion \"Nederlands\" as a reference to the Dutch language prevailed over \"Nederduits\". \"The Nederduits Hervormde Kerk in Nederland\" changed in the 19th century its name in \"Nederlands Hervormde Kerk\", however in South Africa, offshoots of this church kept their old name in the Dutch-related Afrikaans. Thus the \"Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk van Afrika\" is translated in English as \"Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK)\" and the \"Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk\" as \"Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)\".\n\nPlace names with \"low(er)\" or \"neder\", \"lage\", \"nieder\", \"nether\", \"nedre\", \"bas\" and \"inferior\" are used everywhere in Europe. They are often used as a place deixis, opposed to either an upstream or higher ground that consecutively is indicated as \"upper\" or \"boven\", \"oben\", \"superior\" and \"haut\". Both downstream at the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta, and low at the plain near the North Sea apply to the Low Countries. However, the related geographical location of the \"upper\" ground changed over time tremendously, and rendered over time several names for the area now known as the Low Countries:\n\n\"Pays d'embas\" and later \"Les Pays-Bas\" was translated as \"Neder-landen\" in contemporary Dutch official documents. From the mid-sixteenth century on, this became a commonly used name and lost its deictic meaning of a low-lying land as opposed to a high-lying land. But the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern Dutch Republic (Latin: \"Belgica Foederata\") and the southern Spanish Netherlands (Latin: \"Belgica Regia\"), introducing a new deixis, i.e. Northern vs. Southern Netherlands, the latter being roughly present-day Belgium. \"Nederlands\", as a name for the language, was first attested in a work printed at Gouda in 1482. Since the 15th century it slowly replaced the Dutch autonym \"Diets\" and \"Duyts\".\n\nThe English adjective \"Netherlandish\", meaning \"from the Low Countries\", derived directly from the Dutch adjective \"Nederlands\". It is typically used in reference to paintings or music produced anywhere in the Low Countries during the 15th and early 16th century, which are collectively called Early Netherlandish painting (, \"Flemish primitives\" — also common in English before the mid 20th century), or (regarding music) the Netherlandish School. Later art and artists from the southern Catholic provinces of the Low Countries are usually called Flemish and those from the northern Protestant provinces Dutch, but art historians sometimes use \"Netherlandish art\" for art of the Low Countries produced before 1830, i.e., until the secession of Belgium from the Netherlands.\n\nApart from its use to describe paintings, it is as adjective not common in English. Many languages however, do have a cognate or calque derived from the Dutch adjective \"Nederlands\":\n\nToponyms:\n\nThe Low Countries () refers to the historical region \"de Nederlanden\": those principalities located on and near the mostly low-lying land around the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta. That region corresponds to all of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, forming the Benelux. The name \"Benelux\" is formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country's name Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. It was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944) and is now used more generally to refer to the geopolitical and economical grouping of the three countries, while \"Low Countries\" is used in a more cultural or historical context.\n\nIn many languages the nomenclature \"Low Countries\" can both refer to the cultural and historical region comprising present-day Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, as to \"the Netherlands\" alone, i.e., \"Les Pays-Bas\" in French, \"Los Países Bajos\" in Spanish and \"i Paesi Bassi\" in Italian. Several other languages have literally translated \"Low Countries\" in their own language to refer to the Dutch language:\n\n\nFlemish () is derived from the name of the County of Flanders (), in the early Middle Ages the most influential county in the Low Countries, and the residence of the Burgundian dukes. Due to its cultural importance, \"Flemish\" became in certain languages a \"pars pro toto\" for the Low Countries and the Dutch language. This was certainly the case in France, since the Flemish are the first Dutch speaking people for them to encounter. In French-Dutch dictionaries of the 16th century, \"Dutch\" is almost always translated as \"Flameng\".\n\nA calque of \"Vlaams\" as a reference to the language of the Low Countries was also in use in Spain. In the 16th century, when Spain inherited the Habsburg Netherlands, the whole area of the Low Countries was indicated as \"Flandes\", and the inhabitants of \"Flandes\" were called \"Flamencos\". For example, the Eighty Years' War between the rebellious Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire was called \"Las guerras de Flandes\" and the Spanish army that was based in the Low Countries was named the Army of Flanders (). \n\nThe English adjective \"Flemish\" (first attested as \"flemmysshe\", c. 1325; cf. \"Flæming\", c. 1150), was probably borrowed from Old Frisian. The name \"Vlaanderen\" was probably formed from a stem \"flām-\", meaning \"flooded area\", with a suffix \"-ðr-\" attached. The Old Dutch form is \"flāmisk\", which becomes \"vlamesc\", \"vlaemsch\" in Middle Dutch and \"Vlaams\" in Modern Dutch. Flemish is now exclusively used to describe the majority of Dutch dialects found in Flanders, and as a reference to that region. Calques of \"Vlaams\" in other languages:\n\nIn many languages including English, (a calque of) \"Holland\" is a common name for the Netherlands as a whole. Even the Dutch use this sometimes. Strictly speaking, Holland is only the central-western region of the country comprising two of the twelve provinces, North Holland and South Holland, and thus linguistically a \"pars pro toto\" similar to use of Russia for the (former) Soviet Union, and England for the United Kingdom.\n\nThe use is sometimes discouraged. For example, the \"Holland\" entry in the style guide of \"The Guardian\" and \"The Observer\" newspapers states: \"Do not use when you mean the Netherlands (of which it is a region), with the exception of the Dutch football team, which is conventionally known as Holland\".\n\nFrom the 17th century onwards, the County of Holland was the most powerful region in the current Netherlands. The counts of Holland were also counts of Hainaut, Friesland and Zeeland from the 13th to the 15th centuries. Holland remained most powerful during the period of the Dutch Republic, dominating foreign trade, and hence most of the Dutch traders encountered by foreigners were from Holland, which explains why the Netherlands is often called Holland overseas.\n\nAfter the demise of the Dutch Republic under Napoleon, that country became known as the Kingdom of Holland (1806–1810), and the former countship of Holland was split up and became two of its eleven provinces, later known as North Holland and South Holland, because one Holland province by itself was considered too dominant in area, population and wealth compared to the other provinces. Today the two provinces making up Holland, including the cities of Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam, remain politically, economically and demographically dominant – 37% of the Dutch population live there. In most other Dutch provinces and also Flanders, the word \"Hollander\" is sometimes used in a pejorative sense to refer to the perceived superiority or supposed arrogance of people from the Randstad – the main conurbation of Holland proper and of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2009, members of the First Chamber drew attention to the fact that in Dutch passports, for some EU-languages a translation meaning \"Kingdom of Holland\" was used, as opposed to \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\". As replacements for the Estonian \"Hollandi Kuningriik\", Hungarian \"Holland Királyság\", Romanian \"Regatul Olandei\" and Slovak \"Holandské kráľovstvo\", the parliamentarians proposed \"Madalmaade Kuningriik\", \"Németalföldi Királyság\", \"Regatul Țărilor de Jos\" and \"Nizozemské Kráľovstvo\", respectively. Their reasoning was that \"if in addition to Holland a recognisable translation of the Netherlands does exist in a foreign language, it should be regarded as the best translation\" and that \"the Kingdom of the Netherlands has a right to use the translation it thinks best, certainly on official documents\". Although the government initially refused to change the text except for the Estonian, recent Dutch passports feature the translation proposed by the First Chamber members. Calques derived from \"Holland\" to refer to the Dutch language in other languages:\nToponyms:\n\nAs the Low Country's prime duchy, with the only and oldest scientific centre (the University of Leuven), Brabant has served as a pars pro toto for the whole of the Low Countries, for example in the writings of Desiderius Erasmus in the early 16th century.\n\nPerhaps of influence for this pars pro toto usage is the Brabantian holding of the ducal title of Lower Lorraine. In 1190, after the death of Godfrey III, Henry I became Duke of Lower Lorraine, where the Low Countries have their political origin. However, by that time the title had lost most of its territorial authority. According to protocol, all his successors were thereafter called Dukes of Brabant and Lower Lorraine (often called Duke of Lothier).\n\nBrabant symbolism served again a role as national symbols during the formation Belgium. The national anthem of Belgium is called the Brabançonne (English: \"the Brabantian\"), and the Belgium flag has taken its colors from the Brabant coat of arms: black, yellow and red. This was influenced by the Brabant Revolution (, ), sometimes referred to as the \"Belgian Revolution of 1789–90\" in older writing, that was an armed insurrection that occurred in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) between October 1789 and December 1790. The revolution led to the brief overthrow of Habsburg rule and the proclamation of a short-lived polity, the United Belgian States. Some historians have seen it as a key moment in the formation of a Belgian nation-state, and an influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830.\n\nHolland, Flanders and 15 other counties, duchies and bishoprics in the Low Countries were united as the Seventeen Provinces in a personal union during the 16th century, covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, which freed the provinces from their archaic feudal obligations.\n\nThe nomenclature \"Belgica\" is harking back to the ancient local tribe of the Belgae and the Roman province named after that tribe Gallia Belgica. Although a derivation of that name is now reserved for the Kingdom of Belgium, from the 15th to the 17th century the name was the usual Latin translation to refer to the entire Low Countries, which was on maps sometimes heroically visualised as the Leo Belgicus.\nOther use:\n\nThroughout the centuries the Dutch attempted to define their collective identity by looking at their ancestors, the Batavi. As claimed by the Roman historian Tacitus, the Batavi where a brave Germanic tribe living in the Netherlands, probably in the Betuwe region. In Dutch, the adjective \"Bataafs\" (\"Batavian\") was used from the 15th to the 18th century, meaning \"of, or relating to the Netherlands\" (but not the southern Netherlands).\n\nOther use:\n\nFrankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between the 4th and 8th century. Between the fifth and ninth centuries, the languages spoken by the Salian Franks in Belgium and the Netherlands evolved into Old Dutch (), which formed the beginning of a separate Dutch language and is synonymous with Old Dutch. Compare the near-synonymous usage, in a linguistic context, of Old English versus Anglo-Saxon.\n\nFrisii were an ancient tribe who lived in the coastal area of the Netherlands in Roman times. They left the land abandoned due to deteriorating climate conditions. Anglo-Saxons, coming from the east, repopulated the region. Franks in the south, who were familiar with Roman texts, called the coastal region Frisia, and hence its inhabitants \"Frisians\", even though they had no ancestry with the old Frisii. After a Frisian Kingdom emerged in the mid-7th century in the Netherlands, with its center of power the city of Utrecht, the Franks conquered the Frisians and converted them to Christianity. From that time on a colony of Frisians was living in Rome and thus the old name for the people from the Low Countries who came to Rome has remained in use in the national church of the Netherlands in Rome, which is called the Frisian church (; ). In 1989, this church was granted to the Dutch community in Rome.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41495872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41495872", "title": "Yepachic", "text": "Yepachic\n\nYepáchic, sometimes spelled Yepáchi, is a community in the western part of the Mexican State of Chihuahua, approximately east of the boundary with the State of Sonora. It is located in the Municipio de Temósachic at an altitude of in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Many of the people of the region are members of the indigenous ethnic group called Mountain Pima or the Pima Bajo. They are related to the Pima and Papago (Tohono O'odham) of Arizona and northern Sonora, speaking a similar but distinct language.\n\nMost maps give the name as Yepáchic, but the citizens in the town and the road signs in the vicinity spell it Yepachi. The population in 2010 was officially listed as 851, but this number swells to a few thousand on the holidays when people from small hamlets in the surrounding region congregate in Yepáchic.\n\nThe climate of the region is one of the coolest in all of Mexico. Snow is not uncommon for the region in the winter. Spring and Fall are dry seasons, with thunderstorms prevalent in late summer. Predominant vegetation in the region is a mixed forest of pine and oak. Mountains are frequently rather steep, often with loose crumbling soil preventing easy travel. South of Yepáchic, there is a deep canyon with thorny, scrub vegetation characteristic of more arid regions.\n\nSome of the flatter regions have been cleared for farming. The people of the region plant maize, beans, squash, potatoes, and various other crops. They also raise cattle, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and other livestock. The local people eat most of the crops themselves, but most of the cattle raised is sold to buyers from the lowlands. There is also lumbering in the region, a needed source of income for the people of the area.\n\nYepáchic traces its recorded history to 1677, when Jesuit (Compañía de Jésus) missionaries settled in the area. The rugged terrain had prevented Spanish attempts at pacification of the region before that date. The old mission church built in Yepáchic is still in use today, the only such mission church still standing in the region.\n\nYepáchic was affected in the 17th Century by anti-Spanish uprisings by the Tarahumara to the south, and later in the 19th Century by Apache raids from the north. The town was briefly abandoned several times because of these conflicts.\n\nAs recently as the 1890s, virtually all the residents of Yepáchic were of Pima heritage. In more recent decades, mestizos from the Mexican lowlands have migrated into the area, and now own most of the homes and nearly all the shops in the center of town. Pima continue to inhabit outlying areas.\n\nThe region continued to be isolated and largely untouched by the outside world through the middle of the 20th Century. There was no road into the area until the 1930s, when a primitive dirt road was built. A much better gravel road replaced this in the 1970s, crossing the mountains and allowing traffic to cross the mountains for the first time. This road was paved in 1990, resulting in regular bus service and a large amount of commercial trucking between Chihuahua and Hermosillo passing through the Pima region.\n\nThere have been several anthropological and ethnobotanical studies in Yepáchic and in the surrounding area. Estrada-Fernández studied the traditional indigenous Pima language, publishing an overview of their grammar, syntax and vocabulary. She identified consistent dialectical differences between communities in the region, especially between villages in Sonora and those in Chihuahua.\n\nDunnigan studied relations between the Pima and their mestizo neighbors. He wrote that traditional rituals such as Semana Santa [Holy Week] play an important role in inter-ethnic relations. This is because the Pima control the elaborate traditional celebrations, reinforcing their identity as a distinct group.\n\nPennington gathered information on use of medicinal plants by the people of Yepáchic Laferrière continued the ethnobotanical work in the area. He investigated the use of wild and cultivated plants in Yepachic and in the outlying hamlet of Nabogame, to the northwest. Wild plants eaten by the Pima include 3 species not previously described by modern science \"(Hymenocallis pimana\", \"Berberis pimana\" and \"Prionosciadium saraviki\").\n\nMost of the people in Yepáchic are Roman Catholics, practicing an antiquated form of the faith taught to them by missionaries centuries ago. This is mixed with remnants of the older indigenous beliefs, mostly in the form of folk tales. Jehovah's Witnesses have been actively recruiting new members in the region.\n\nSemana Santa (Holy Week) practices are quite elaborate. The people decorate the town with flowers and wreaths. They also set up 14 small shrines set up along the streets, representing the 14 stations of the Cross, as per Catholic custom. Each consists of an old print depicting a scene from the Bible. People walk along the route, stopping at each of the 14 shrines and praying at each one. On Good Friday, men carry around the town a platform laden with adobe bricks, along a route that begins and ends at the church. This is a symbolic reenactment of the funeral of Jesus.\n\nOn Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), people congregate in the town cemetery. People locate the graves of lost relatives, clean the weeds off them, and decorate them with flowers, crosses and candles. Some of the mestizos use artificial flowers purchased at the local stores, but most of the Pima use freshly cut flowers from gardens. A priest them performs mass in the cemetery.\n"}
