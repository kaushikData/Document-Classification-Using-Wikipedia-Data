Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, Afghan is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan—Pashtuns, and a large number of Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \"Encyclopædia Iranica\", the word Afghan (afḡān) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aimaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qizilbash, Gurjar, Brahui, and members of other tribes.\n\nAs an adjective, the word Afghan also means \"of or relating to Afghanistan or its people, language, or culture\".\n\nThe term \"Afghani\" refers to the unit of Afghan currency. It is often improperly used for a person or thing related to Afghanistan. The Afghani was created in 1925. Between 1925 and 1993 varieties of Afghani coins and banknotes were in circulation through Afghanistan. Coins issued during this period consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25 pul in bronze, brass, copper nickel, and aluminum-bronze; silver ½, 1, and 2½ Afghani; and gold ½, 1, and 2½ amani. Banknotes issued were in: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 Afghani. In 1958 bank notes worth 2 and 5 were switched with coins.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25323415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25323415", "title": "Afghanistanism", "text": "Afghanistanism\n\nAfghanistanism is a term, first recorded in the United States, for the practice of concentrating on problems in distant parts of the world while ignoring controversial local issues. In other contexts, the term has referred to \"hopelessly arcane and irrelevant scholarship,\"\n\"fascination with exotic, faraway lands,\" or \"Railing and shaking your fist at an unseen foe who is quite unaware of your existence, much less your fury.\"\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary lists Afghanistanism as a U.S. colloquialism; the first written citation it provides is from 1948: J. Lloyd Jones in Probl. Journalism (American Society of Newspaper Editors Convention) 73, \"I don't wish to belabor this subject of Afghanistanism, this business of taking forthright stands on elections in Costa Rica, while the uncollected local garbage reeks beneath the editor's window.\"\n\nRobert H. Stopher and James S. Jackson, writing in their column \"Behind the Front Page,\" said the \"new term\" was coined by Jenkin Lloyd Jones of Oklahoma's \"Tulsa Tribune\" at that same convention, in Washington, D.C. They quoted Jones as saying:\nThe tragic fact is that many an editorial writer can't hit a short-range target. He's hell on distance. He can pontificate about the situation in Afghanistan with perfect safety. It takes more guts to dig up the dirt on the sheriff.\nBut columnist Joe Klein wrote in \"Time\" magazine in 2010 that the term originated in the 19th century when \"the British press defined \"Afghanistanism\" as the obsession with obscure foreign wars at the expense of domestic priorities,\" adding that \"Afghanistanism seems likely to become a national debate [in the United States] before long: Is building roads and police stations in Afghanistan more important than doing so at home?\"\n\nThe concept earlier came to have several applications. On one hand it was applied in North American journalism to newspaper articles about faraway places that were irrelevant to local readers. Other writers said, though, that Afghanistanism was the tendency of some editors to avoid hard local news by writing opinion pieces about events happening in distant lands. As \"New York Times\" writer James Reston put it about journalists, \"Like officials in Washington, we suffer from Afghanistanism. If it's far away, it's news, but if it's close to home, it's sociology.\"\n\nEarlier, educator Robert M. Hutchins used the expression in a speech at the California Institute of Technology in 1955:\n\nAfghanistanism, as you know, is the practice of referring always to some remote country, place, person or problem when there is something that ought to be taken care of near at home that is very acute. So you say to a professor at Caltech, \"What about smog?\" and he says, \"Have you heard about the crisis in Afghanistan?\"\n\nIn 1973, the concept was adapted to reporting on environmentalism, which was said by journalism researchers Steven E. Hungerford and James B. Lemert to deal with environmental problems of distant communities rather than local ones. This observation was echoed in 2004 by B.A. Taleb, who called it \"displacing the [environmental] problems and issues to other places and ignoring their existence in one's own community or country.\"\n\nAfter the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, the concept resurfaced, with some writers asserting that it was no longer applicable to contemporary events. For example, Stuart H. Loory, chair in Free-Press Studies at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, wrote on December 1, 2001:\n\nA primary mission of the news business is to work as a distant early warning signal of impending problems for the public and those who can deal with those problems. It must work in a convincing way, and that means news organizations must train and educate journalists to work in various parts of the world knowledgably. They cannot fit the image now in vogue — that of parachutists jumping into an area to cover disaster on short notice. That perpetuates “Afghanistanism,” a concept that has long since outlived its usefulness, if it ever had any at all.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1509102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1509102", "title": "Assisted GPS", "text": "Assisted GPS\n\nAssisted GPS or Augmented GPS (abbreviated generally as A-GPS and less commonly as aGPS) is a system that often significantly improves the startup performance—i.e., time-to-first-fix (TTFF)—of a GPS satellite-based positioning system. A-GPS is extensively used with GPS-capable cellular phones, as its development was accelerated by the U.S. FCC's 911 requirement to make cell phone location data available to emergency call dispatchers.\n\nStandalone/self-ruling GPS devices depend solely on information from satellites. A-GPS augments that by using cell tower data to enhance quality and precision when in poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, for example in urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit multipath propagation where signals skip off structures, or are weakened by meteorological conditions or tree canopy. Some standalone GPS navigators used in poor conditions can't fix a position because of satellite signal fracture and must wait for better satellite reception. A regular GPS unit may need as long as 12.5 minutes (the time needed to download the GPS almanac and ephemerides) to resolve the problem and be able to provide a correct location.\n\nAn assisted GPS system can address these problems by using external data. Utilizing this system can come at a cost to the user. For billing purposes, network providers often count this as a data access, which can cost money, depending on the plan.\n\nTo be precise, A-GPS features depend mostly on an internet network or connection to an ISP (or CNP, in the case of CP/mobile-phone device linked to a cellular network provider data service). A mobile (cell phone, smart phone) device with just an L1 front-end radio receiver and no GPS acquisition, tracking, and positioning engine only works when it has an internet connection to an ISP/CNP, where the position fix is calculated offboard the device itself. It doesn't work in areas with no coverage or internet link (or nearby base transceiver station (BTS) towers, in the case on CNP service coverage area). Without one of those resources, it can't connect to the A-GPS servers usually provided by CNPs. On the other hand, a mobile device with a GPS chipset requires no data connection to capture and process GPS data into a position solution, since it receives data directly from the GPS satellites and is able to calculate a position fix itself. However, the availability of a data connection can provide assistance to improve the performance of the GPS chip on the mobile device. \n\nAssistance falls into two categories:\n\nAs an additional benefit, in mobile station assisted implementations, the amount of processing and software required for a GPS receiver can be reduced by offloading most of the work onto the assistance server.\n\nA typical A-GPS-enabled receiver uses a data connection (Internet or other) to contact the assistance server for aGPS information. If it also has functioning autonomous GPS, it may use standalone GPS, which is sometimes slower on time to first fix, but does not depend on the network, and therefore can work beyond network range and without incurring data-usage fees. Some A-GPS devices do not have the option of falling back to standalone or autonomous GPS.\n\nMany mobile phones combine A-GPS and other location services, including Wi-Fi Positioning System and cell-site multilateration and sometimes a hybrid positioning system.\n\nHigh-Sensitivity GPS is an allied technology that addresses some of these issues in a way that does not require additional infrastructure. However, unlike some forms of A-GPS, high-sensitivity GPS cannot provide a fix instantaneously when the GPS receiver has been off for some time.\n\nStandalone GPS provides first position in approximately 30–40 seconds. A standalone GPS needs orbital information of the satellites to calculate the current position. The data rate of the satellite signal is only 50 bit/s, so downloading orbital information like ephemerides and the almanac directly from satellites typically takes a long time, and if the satellite signals are lost during the acquisition of this information, it is discarded and the standalone system has to start from scratch. In A-GPS, the network operator deploys an A-GPS server, a cache server for GPS data. These A-GPS servers download the orbital information from the satellite and store it in the database. An A-GPS-capable device can connect to these servers and download this information using mobile-network radio bearers such as GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, LTE or even using other radio bearers such as Wi-Fi. Usually the data rate of these bearers is high, hence downloading orbital information takes less time.\n\nA-GPS has two modes of operation:\n\nA-GPS protocols are part of Positioning Protocol defined by two different standardization bodies, 3GPP and Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).\n\nDefined by the OMA to support positioning protocols in Packet Switched Networks. Two generations of User Plane Protocol have been defined.\n\n\nGPS assisted with Indoor Location Technologies\n"}

Its name was given by early explorers sighting elephant seals on its shores. The island is situated north-northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, west-southwest of South Georgia, south of the Falkland Islands, and southeast of Cape Horn. It is within the Antarctic claims of Argentina, Chile and the UK. Brazil has a shelter on the island, Goeldi, supporting the work of up to six researchers each during the summer and another (Wiltgen), which was dismantled in the summer of 1997/98.\n\nThe island is oriented approximately east-west, with a maximum elevation of at Pardo Ridge. Significant named features are Cape Yelcho, Cape Valentine and Cape Lookout at the northeastern and southern extremes, and Point Wild, a spit on the north coast. The Endurance Glacier is the main discharge glacier. Due to slow recoveries and illegal whaling by Soviet Union with support from Japan, numbers of southern right whales visiting Elephant island are still on low level.\nThe island supports no significant flora or native fauna although migratory gentoo penguins and seals may be found, and chinstrap penguins nest in season. A lack of safe anchorage has prevented any permanent human settlement, despite the island being well placed to support scientific, fishing and whaling activities.\n\nElephant Island's name can be attributed to both its elephant head-like appearance and the sighting of elephant seals by Captain George Powell in 1821, one of the earliest sightings. The weather is normally foggy with much snow, and winds can reach .\n\nThe First Russian Antarctic expedition led by Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on the 985-ton sloop-of-war Vostok (\"East\") and the 530-ton support vessel Mirny (\"Peaceful\") discovered the Island on 29 January 1821 and named it \"Остров Мордвинова\" (Mordvinov Island) in honour of .\n\nThe island is most famous as the desolate refuge of British explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew in 1916. Following the loss of their ship \"Endurance\" in Weddell Sea ice, the 28 exhausted men reached Cape Valentine on Elephant Island after a harrowing ordeal on drifting ice floes. The first of Shackleton's crew to set foot here, and presumably the first person ever to make landfall, was Perce Blackborow, originally a stowaway on \"Endurance\". Since Blackborow was the youngest crew member, Shackleton commanded that he make the first landfall on the island. After camping at Cape Valentine for two nights, Shackleton and his crew moved westwards to a location which offered better protection from rockfalls and from the sea, and which they called \"Point Wild\".\n\nRealizing that there was no chance of passive rescue, Shackleton decided to sail to South Georgia where he knew there were several whaling stations. Shackleton sailed with five other men on a voyage in the open lifeboat \"James Caird\" beginning on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916 and arriving at South Georgia 16 days later. His second-in-command, Frank Wild, was left in charge of the men on Elephant Island, waiting for Shackleton's return with a rescue ship.\n\nThere was much work for the stranded men. Because the island had no natural source of shelter, they constructed a shack and wind blocks from their remaining two lifeboats and pieces of canvas tents. Blubber lamps were used for lighting. Expedition physicist Reginald James composed the following verses out of gratitude for Wild's leadership:\n\nThey hunted for penguins and seals, neither of which were plentiful in autumn or winter. Many of the crew were already ill and frostbitten, and they were now also in danger of starvation. After four and a half months, one of the men spotted a ship on August 30, 1916. The ship, with Shackleton on board, was the tug \"Yelcho\", from Punta Arenas, Chile, commanded by Luis Pardo, which rescued all the men who had set out on the original expedition. It was the fourth attempt to rescue the men. The first three attempts were turned back due to a heavy ice pack surrounding the island.\n\nAccording to Frank Worsley, Shackleton's captain, the men pronounced the island's name with an 'H' prefixed and a silent 't', \"Hell-of-an-Island\".\n\nA Joint Services Expedition led by Commander Malcolm Burley was dropped off on Elephant Island by HMS Endurance. The party then spent six months carrying out a survey of the island and other scientific research for the British Antarctic Survey and climbing some of the peaks on the island. The expedition visited Point Wild but found no trace of the \"Endurance\" expedition; it found the wreckage of the large sailing vessel referred to below, and also landed on and climbed the highest peak on Clarence Island.\n\nPoint Wild contains the Endurance Memorial Site, an Antarctic Historic Site (HSM 53), with a bust of Captain Pardo and several plaques. Hampson Cove on the south-west coast of the island, including the foreshore and intertidal area, contains the wreckage of a large wooden sailing vessel; it has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 74), following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "489492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489492", "title": "Hindustan", "text": "Hindustan\n\nHindustan () is the Persian name for India, broadly the Indian subcontinent, which later became an endonym.\nAfter the Partition of India, it continues to be used as a historic name for the Republic of India.\n\nA secondary meaning of Hindustan is as a geographic term for the Indo-Gangetic Plain in northern India.\n\nHindustan is derived from the Persian word \"Hindū\" cognate with the Sanskrit \"Sindhu\".\nThe Proto-Iranian sound change \"*s\" > \"h\" occurred between 850–600 BCE, according to Asko Parpola. Hence, the Rigvedic \"sapta sindhava\" (the land of seven rivers) became \"hapta hindu\" in the Avesta. It was said to be the \"fifteenth domain\" created by Ahura Mazda, apparently a land of 'abnormal heat'.\nIn 515 BCE, Darius I annexed the Indus valley including \"Sindhu\", the present day Sindh, which was called \"Hindu\" in Persian. During the time of Xerxes, the term \"Hindu\" was also applied to the lands to the east of Indus.\n\nIn middle Persian, probably from the first century CE, the suffix \"-stān\" was added, indicative of a country or region, forming the present word \"Hindūstān\". Thus, Sindh was referred to as \"Hindūstān\" in the Naqsh-e-Rustam inscription of Shapur I in 262 CE.\n\nHistorian B. N. Mukherjee states that from the lower Indus basin, the term \"Hindūstān\" got gradually extended to \"more or less the whole of the subcontinent\". The Greco-Roman name \"India\" and the Chinese name \"Shen-tu\" also followed a similar evolution.\n\n\"Hindustan\" is often used to refer to the modern day Republic of India. Slogans involving the term are commonly heard at sports events and other public programmes involving teams or entities representing the modern nation state. In marketing, it is also commonly used as an indicator of national origin in advertising campaigns and is present in many company names. Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and his party the Muslim League, insisted on calling the modern day Republic of India 'Hindustan' in reference to its Hindu majority population.\n\nIn one usage among Hindustani speakers in India, the term 'Hindustani' refers to an Indian, irrespective of religious affiliation. Among non-Hindustani speakers e.g. Bengali-speakers, \"Hindustani\" is sometimes used to describe persons who are from the upper Ganges, also regardless of religious affiliation, but rather as a geographic term.\n\n\"Hindustani\" is sometimes used as an ethnic term applied to South Asia (\"e.g.\", a Mauritian or Surinamese man with roots in South Asia might describe his ethnicity by saying he is \"Hindustani\"). For example, \"Hindoestanen\" is a Dutch word used to describe people of South Asian origin, in the Netherlands and Suriname.\n\n\"Hindustani\" is also used to refer to the Hindustani language (not to be confused with Hindi, which is a register of Hindustani alongside Urdu, another register of the same language), which derives from the Khariboli dialect under the Delhi Sultanate of present-day Western Uttar Pradesh, Southern Uttarakhand and Delhi areas.\n\nEarly Persian scholars had limited knowledge of the extent of India. After the advent of Islam and the Muslim conquests, the meaning of \"Hindustan\" interacted with its Arabic variant \"Hind\" and almost became synonymous with it. The Arabs, enagaing in oceanic trade, included all the lands from \"Tis\" in western Balochistan (near modern Chabahar) to the Indonesian archipelago, in their idea of \"Hind\", especially when used in its expansive form as \"Al-Hind\". \"Hindustan\" did not acquire this elaborate meaning. It also did not acquire the distinction between \"Sind\" (roughly modern Pakistan) and \"Hind\" (the lands to the east of it). The 10th century text \"Hudud al-Alam\" defined \"Hindustan\" as roughly the Indian subcontinent, with its western limit formed by the river Indus, southern limit going up to the Great Sea and the eastern limit at Kamarupa, the present day Assam. For the next ten centuries, both \"Hind\" and \"Hindustan\" were used within the subcontinent with exactly this meaning, along with their adjectives \"Hindawi\" and \"Hindustani\".\n\nWith the Turko-Persian conquests starting in the 11th century, a narrower meaning of \"Hindustan\" also took shape. The conqueres were liable to call the lands under their control as \"Hindustan\" ignoring the rest of the subcontinent.\nIn the early 11th century a satellite state of the Ghaznavids in the Punjab with its capital at Lahore was called \"Hindustan\". After the Delhi Sultanate was established, north India, especially the Gangetic plains, came to be called \"Hindustan\".\nScholar Bratindra Nath Mukherjee states that this narrow menaing of \"Hindustan\" existed side by side with the wider meaning, and some of the authors used both of them simultaneously.\n\nThe Mughal Empire (1526–1857) called its lands 'Hindustan'. The term 'Mughal' itself was never used to refer to the land. As the empire expanded, so too did 'Hindustan'. At the same time, the meaning of 'Hindustan' as the entire Indian subcontinent is also found in \"Baburnama\" and \"Ain-i-Akbari\".\n\nThe last Gorkhali King Prithvi Narayan Shah self proclaimed the newly unified Kingdom of Nepal as Asal Hindustan (Real Hindustan) due to North India being ruled by the Islamic Mughal rulers. The self proclamation was done to enforce Hindu social code Dharmashastra over his reign and refer to his country as being inhabitable for Hindus. He also referred Northern India as \"Mughlan\" (Country of Mughals) and called the region infiltrated by Muslim foreigners.\n\nThese dual meanings persisted with the arrival of Europeans. Rennel produced an atlas titled the \"Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan or the Mogul Empire\" in 1792, which was in fact a map of the Indian subcontinent. Rennel thus conflated the three notions, 'India', 'Hindustan' and the Mughal Empire. J. Bernoulli, to whom \"Hindustan\" meant the Mughal Empire, called his French translation \"La Carte générale de l'Inde\" (General Map of India).\nThis 'Hindustan' of British reckoning was divided into British-ruled territories (sometimes referred to as 'India') and the territories ruled by native rulers. The British officials and writers, however, thought that the Indians used 'Hindustan' to refer to only North India. An \"Anglo-Indian Dictionary\" published in 1886 states that, while \"Hindustan\" means India, in the \"nativa parlance\" it had come to represent the region north of Narmada River excluding Bihar and Bengal.\n\nDuring the independence movement, the Indians referred to their land by all three names: 'India', 'Hindustan' and 'Bharat'. Mohammad Iqbal's poem\n<poem>\n\"Sare jahāṃ se acchā Hindustāṃ hamārā\"\n</poem>\nwas a popular patriotic song among independence activists.\n\nThe 1940 Lahore Resolution of the All-India Muslim League demanded sovereignty for the Muslim-majority areas in the northwest and northeast of India, which came to be called 'Pakistan' in popular parlance and the remaining India came to be called 'Hindustan'. The British officials too picked up the two terms and started using them officially.\n\nHowever, this naming did not meet the approval of Indian leaders due to the implied meaning of 'Hindustan' as the land of Hindus. They insisted that the new Dominion of India should be called 'India', not 'Hindustan'. Probably for the same reason, the name 'Hindustan' did not receive official sanction of the Constituent Assembly of India, whereas 'Bharat' was adopted as an official name. It was recognised however that 'Hindustan' would continue to be used unofficially.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12188902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12188902", "title": "Kumtor Gold Mine", "text": "Kumtor Gold Mine\n\nThe Kumtor gold mine (, ; ) is an open-pit gold mining site in Issyk-Kul Region of Kyrgyzstan located about 350 km (220 mi) southeast of the capital Bishkek and 80 km (50 mi) south of Lake Issyk-Kul near the border with China. Located in Tian Shan mountains at more than 4,000 m (14,000 ft) above sea level, Kumtor is the second-highest gold mining operation in the world after Yanacocha gold mine in Peru.\n\nKumtor is 100% owned by the Canadian mining company, Centerra Gold. Centerra Gold Inc. is a Canadian-based gold mining and exploration company engaged in the operation, exploration, development and acquisition of gold properties in North America, Asia and other markets worldwide. Centerra’s shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbol CG. The Company is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (4). The Kyrgyz Republic, via Kyrgyzaltyn JSC, is Centerra's largest shareholder owning 77,401,766 shares (5), or more than 26 % of the issued shares of Centerra (6). Kumtor Gold Company is the operator of the Kumtor project responsible for the entire production cycle. \n\nThe deposit is mined by open-pit mining techniques utilizing typical drill, blast and truck/loader or truck/shovel operations. The ore is delivered to the crusher and further to the mill, where the gold is extracted using carbon-in-leach technology\nThe mill's rated throughput is approximately 16,000 tonnes of ore per day. After the ore treatment is complete, the gold is poured in the form of Dore bars containing about 80 percent of gold. \nAs of December 31, 2017, Kumtor had produced approximately 11.5 million ounces or 357 tonnes of gold since the start of commercial production in May 1997. (7). \nThe Dore bars produced by the Kumtor mine are purchased by Kyrgyzaltyn JSC for processing at the Kara-Balta refinery pursuant to a Gold and Silver Sales Agreement signed by Kumtor Gold Company, Kyrgyzaltyn and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. Kyrgyzaltyn JSC enjoys the exclusive right to sell refined gold and silver both in and outside the Kyrgyz Republic.\nIn 2017, gold production at the Kumtor mine was 562,749 ounces or 17,503.46 kg. Gold sales were 550,134 ounces or 17,111.09 kg (8).\n\nDespite the fact that the Kumtor gold deposit was discovered in 1978 and the feasibility study was drafted by GINALMAZZOLOTO of the Chief Directorate of Precious Metals and Diamonds of the USSR Council of Ministers in 1989, the development of the mine was delayed as the project was seen as being too costly: 995.4 million Soviet rubles (an approximate equivalent of 1.46 billion USD as it stood in those days).\nIt was not until after Kyrgyzstan gained independence that it found itself in a position to attract western investment to start developing its own mineral resources. After thoroughly examining several investment offers, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic favored those made by Canadian Cameco Corporation, one of the world’s largest uranium producers. On December 4, 1992, in Toronto the sides signed the Kumtor Master Agreement (9).\n\nThe Mine's construction commenced in 1993, and commercial gold production at Kumtor started in May 1997 so that as soon as one year later, the company poured its first million gold ounces. Mining operations in the open pit are expected to be completed in 2023 while milling operations are thought to continue until 2026 (10). \n\n3.1. Dates\n\n3.2. Controversies\nIn 1992, Cameco Corporation became the owner of the Kumtor mine with no tender or competition ever announced. The Master Agreement between Cameco and the Government of Kyrgyzstan said that Kyrgyzstan's laws were applicable to the corporation insofar as they didn't contradict the Master Agreement. (13) \n\nOne of the worst accidents relating to the mine occurred on May 20, 1998, when a truck overturned while carrying a load of sodium cyanide, used for extracting gold from ore. The spill necessitated evacuation of approximately 5,000 residents of the village of Barskoon. In late 1998, a joint Russian-Canadian expert commission concluded that toxic concentrations in the Barskoon and Tamga irrigation water was too insignificant to cause any harm to human health (14). A series of analyses, including chemical ones, conducted by a laboratory of the national sanitary-epidemiological station under the Agency for Geology and Natural Resources, showed that cyanide concentration in the river, diversion ditches and the lake was under MAC (the maximum allowable concentration) as soon as May 27, 1998. (15) Nor cyanide was ever detected in the vegetables or fruits. (16) Moreover, no follow-up medical examinations discovered any growth in cancer rates or gene mutations among the residents of Jety-Oguz district, Issyk-Kul Province. (17) \n\nAfter Cameco sold all of its shares to Centerra Gold Inc. in 2009, Kyrgyzstan became the major shareholder of the company. (18) That same year, when Kurmanbek Bakiyev was President of the Kyrgyz Republic, a new project agreement was signed between the company and Kyrgyzstan. Deposed in 2010, he was blamed for accepting terms that he knew were against the interests of the country. (19)\n\nIn this context, a temporary parliamentary commission was formed by Jogorku Kenesh in February 2012 to review the Kumtor mine's activities (20). Based on its findings, in June 2012, a State Commission was formed to carry out a comprehensive audit of Kumtor Operating Company. The Commission was chaired by Temir Sariyev, Minister of the Economy and Antimonopoly Policy (21).\n\nIn February 2013, the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan supported the State Commission's recommendation that the 2009 Kumtor Agreement should be reviewed. The Government was ordered to have the Agreement with Centerra Gold Inc. revised in favor of Kyrgyzstan. Otherwise, the Government was instructed to terminate the Agreement (22).\n\nAs a result of the Commission's efforts, On May 22, 2013, the State Inspectorate Office for Environmental and Engineering Safety filed a claim against Kumtor Operating Company to an amount of 6.8 billion soms. On May 24, the claim was dismissed by the court. On June 7, claims were filed again by the said Inspectorate Office which were rejected by the court decisions dated June 11 and 13, 2013. (23) \n\nAgainst this background, on May 28, 2013, about 500 village residents in Jety-Oguz district, Issyk-Kul Province blocked the road to the mine demanding that the 2009 Agreement should be terminated. In the evening May 30, a few dozens of protesters seized an electric power substation and shut down the grid power supply to the gold mill. Electricity supply was resumed early in the morning on May 31 after police forced out the protesters from the electric power substation. President of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev declared the state of emergency in Jety-Oguz district. (24) As the result of the outage, the gold mill suffered more than $4 million in losses (25).\n\nBy October 2013, the Kyrgyz Republic's Government had completed negotiations with the Canadian company and submitted to Parliament a draft Memorandum creating a 50/50 joint venture company, which, however, was rejected by Parliament as it demanded that Kyrgyzstan's equity interests in the company should be increased to 67% (26, 27).\n\nIn 2014, the Kyrgyz Republic's Government sponsored amendments to the existing Water Code which banned any activities that might affect the status of glaciers. However, it made an exception for the Davydov and Lysyi glaciers located within Kumtor's concession area. In its explanatory notes, the Government proved that Kumtor was critically important for the economy of Kyrgyzstan (28).\n\nIn the meantime, the Government came up with a modified version of the Kumtor restructuring Memorandum which it submitted to Parliament in February 2014. The restructuring program for Kumtor was approved by Parliament(29). In December 2015, however, it was announced that the Kyrgyz Republic's Government was pulling out of the talks as it was going to provide a new restructuring program(30). In that situation, a risk of operations being shut down at Kumtor arose as the Water Code amendments permitting Kumtor's operations had still to be adopted by Parliament(35).\n\nThat same year, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic affirmed the State Inspectorate Office's appeal and brought the case back to the Inter-District Court. A second stage of litigation began. In 2016, the court made a ruling in favor of the Inspectorate Office. The principal difference between the ways the Inspectorate Office's claims were considered in 2013 and 2016 was that in 2013 court proceedings were purposefully slowed down by Kyrgyzstan's authorities in anticipation of the results of the ongoing negotiations with Centerra Gold Inc. about the restructuring of the Kumtor Project. (31)\n\nThen legal proceedings were transferred to international courts and continued until the Strategic Environment and Investment Agreement was signed between Centerra Gold Inc. and the Kyrgyz Republic's Government (32, 33). The said Agreement settled all disputes and the existing arbitration and environmental claims. (34) On November 16, 2016, were also adopted amendments to the Water Code permitting commercial activities near the Davydov and Lysyi glaciers (28).\n\n3.3 Kumtor's Contribution to Kyrgyzstan's Economy\nAccording to preliminary reports of the Kyrgyz Republic's National Statistics Committee, Kumtor's impact on Kyrgyzstan's macroeconomic indicators in 2017 looks as follows:\n\n- Kumtor's contribution to Kyrgyzstan's GDP accounted for 9.7%;\n\n- Kumtor's contribution to the aggregate industrial output amounted to 21.1%;\n\n- contributions made within the Kyrgyz Republic in 2017 (including taxes, refining, domestic suppliers, infrastructure, charities, etc.) exceeded US $269,731,000.\n\nKumtor's total payments made within Kyrgyzstan between 1994 and 2017 exceeded US $3.472 billion. (33) \n\nKumtor’s 2018 gold production forecast is expected to be in the range of 450,000 to 500,000 ounces or 14.15 to 15.55 tonnes. Total capital expenditures, excluding capitalized stripping, are forecast to be US $63 million. Growth capital investment is forecast at US $14 million primarily related to tailings dam construction ($9 million). Capitalized stripping costs are expected to be approximately $122 to $168 million.

{"id": "10432412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10432412", "title": "Natural resource management", "text": "Natural resource management\n\nNatural resource management refers to the management of natural resources such as land, water, soil, plants and animals, with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations (stewardship).\n\nNatural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural landscapes interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, biodiversity conservation, and the future sustainability of industries like agriculture, mining, tourism, fisheries and forestry. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.\n\nNatural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and ecology and the life-supporting capacity of those resources. Environmental management is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the sociology of natural resources is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.\n\nThe emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of North American rangelands in the late 19th century, and the resource conservation movement of the same time. This type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist conservation strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources. A more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social, cultural, economic and political aspects of resource management. A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the Brundtland Commission and the advocacy of sustainable development.\n\nIn 2005 the government of New South Wales, established a \"Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management\", to improve the consistency of practice, based on an adaptive management approach.\n\nIn the United States, the most active areas of natural resource management are wildlife management often associated with ecotourism and rangeland management. In Australia, water sharing, such as the Murray Darling Basin Plan and catchment management are also significant.\n\nNatural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of stakeholders, natural resources:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder analysis originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into natural resource management in ever growing popularity. Stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources.\n\nThere is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below. Especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder.\n\nDifferent approaches to who is a stakeholder:\nTherefore, it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised.\n\nBillgrena and Holme identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:\n\n\nThis gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions.\nThere are numerous stakeholder theories such as Mitchell et al. however Grimble created a framework of stages for a Stakeholder Analysis in natural resource management. Grimble designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management.\n\nStages in Stakeholder analysis:\n\nApplication:\n\nGrimble and Wellard established that Stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as;\n\n\nCase studies:\n\nIn the case of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the Batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people's livelihoods and loss of life.\n\nNepal, Indonesia and Koreas' community forestry are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources. This allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests.\n\nCriticisms:\n\n\nAlternatives/ Complementary forms of analysis:\n\n\nNatural resource management issues are inherently complex. They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.\n\nAfter the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.\n\nThe various approaches applied to natural resource management include:\n\n\nThe community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life. When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced. Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of subsidiarity.\n\nThe United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Unless clearly defined, decentralised NRM can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e.g. forest communities in central Kalimantan (Indonesia).\n\nA problem of CBNRM is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation. The concept and conflicting interests of CBNRM, show how the motives behind the participation are differentiated as either people-centred (active or participatory results that are truly empowering) or planner-centred (nominal and results in passive recipients). Understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based NRM. Locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits.\n\nCBNRM is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities, on the one hand, and national and transnational organizations, on the other, to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues, employment, diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity. Ecological and societal successes and failures of CBNRM projects have been documented. CBNRM has raised new challenges, as concepts of community, territory, conservation, and indigenous are worked into politically varied plans and programs in disparate sites. Warner and Jones address strategies for effectively managing conflict in CBNRM.\n\nThe capacity of indigenous communities to conserve natural resources has been acknowledged by the Australian Government with the Caring for Country Program. Caring for our Country is an Australian Government initiative jointly administered by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. These Departments share responsibility for delivery of the Australian Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs, which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of ‘natural resource management’. These programs have been delivered regionally, through 56 State government bodies, successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions.\n\nMore broadly, a research study based in Tanzania and the Pacific researched what motivates communities to adopt CBNRM's and found that aspects of the specific CBNRM program, of the community that has adopted the program, and of the broader social-ecological context together shape the why CBNRM's are adopted. However, overall, program adoption seemed to mirror the relative advantage of CBNRM programs to local villagers and villager access to external technical assistance. There have been socioeconomic critiques of CBNRM in Africa, but ecological effectiveness of CBNRM measured by wildlife population densities has been shown repeatedly in Tanzania. \n\nGovernance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management. In the State of NSW, the 13 catchment management authorities (CMAs) are overseen by the Natural Resources Commission (NRC), responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs.\n\nThe primary methodological approach adopted by catchment management authorities (CMAs) for regional natural resource management in Australia is adaptive management.\n\nThis approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of ‘plan-do-review-act’. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice:\n\nIntegrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. The conceptual basis of INRM has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use, participatory planning, integrated watershed management, and adaptive management. INRM is being used extensively and been successful in regional and community based natural management.\n\nThere are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management.\n\nGeographic Information Systems (GIS)\n\nGIS is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links. A bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall, cleared land and erosion. In Australia, Metadata Directories such as NDAR provide data on Australian natural resources such as vegetation, fisheries, soils and water. These are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation.\n\nNatural Resources Management Audit Frameworks\n\nThe NSW Government in Australia has published an audit framework for natural resource management, to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management. This audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies, including performance audit, environmental audit and internal audit. Audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders, identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public.\n\nThe Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements.\n\nThe Australian Government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management, focussing on the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.\n\n\nThe issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer (p. 3) point out that biodiversity is \"the variety of life\" and relate to different kinds of \"biodiversity organization\". According to Gray (p. 154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.\n\n\nThe \"threats\" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; habitat fragmentation, putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of \"alien species\" and \"climate change\"( p. 2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.\n\n\nCooney claims that the policy making is dependent on \"evidences\", relating to \"high standard of proof\", the forbidding of special \"activities\" and \"information and monitoring requirements\". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of \"activities\" is regarded as a critical and \"irreversible\" endangerment, these \"activities\" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to \"catch fish\" by using explosives and toxicants.\n\n\nAccording to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;\n\n\n\nIn order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young emphasises some important points of land management:\n\n\nDale et al. (2000) study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them. The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways.It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:\n\n"}

Padewakang were used for long distance voyages serving the south Sulawesi kingdoms. \n\nNo-one quite seems to know the origin of the name \"padewakang,\" though some have suggested that it stems from Dewakang Island, an important navigational landmark between Sulawesi and Java. Dutch records from the 1735 mention letters from Sulawesi arriving in Batavia ‘per Paduakkang’.\n\nAccording to Horridge, the word “\"padewakang\", \"paduwakang\"” (Sulawesi) and “\"paduwang\"” (Madura) have its roots from word \"wa\", \"wangka\", \"waga\", \"wangga\", and \"bangka\" of Austronesian languages. The term is associated with outrigger perahu or small perahu.\n\nIt typically weights between 20 to 50 tons, had one or two masts with tanja sails. Like other traditional vessels of the archipelago, it is steered using 2 quarter rudders. Between the end of the 16th century to early 20th century they routinely sailed for the coasts of northern Australia in search of teripang, armed with cannon of ancient origin, probably cetbang or lantaka. Padewakang were the biggest craft of South Sulawesi as trading vessel and as war fleets, used for hundreds of years sailing the seas between western New Guinea, the southern parts of the Philippines, and the Malayan peninsula. There is even a Dutch publication of padewakang under full sail in Persian gulf. They are used until the production stopped in favor of the famous Pinisi by the 20th century. The pinisi evolved from basic padewakang hull with fore-and-aft sails to its own hull model with indigenous \"pinisi rig\".\n\nAccording to Horst Liebner, a Mandar maritime expert, pinisi sail originally mounted onto the hull of a padded boat and the like; however, when the sailors and craftsmen are increasingly aware of the way they are used, they selected only the \"palari\" (derived from \"lari\" - \"to run\") hull - a very pointed hull type and it is indeed the one that best suits the secondary sail.\n\nThis evolution takes place in several stages: The hull type is designed with more pointed and enhanced with some additional boards that causing the deck of the bow becomes lower than the main deck and the stern, and that the construction of the rolling beams seems to 'fly' behind stern boat (Konjo language : \"palari salompong ambeng rua kali\"); the next part of the stern deck (\"ambeng\") is continued until the steering beams merge with it (\"palari salompong\"); and the last step is to increase the bow height so that the entire deck becomes straight.\n\nThis last type of hull is used until the pinisi boat is replaced with PLM (motorized sailboat) type. In the early 1970s thousands of pinisi-palari ships measuring up to 200 tonnes of cargo, the world's largest commercial sailing fleet at the time, had contacted all corners of the Indian Ocean and became the trading backbone of the people.\n\n\n"}

The territory hosts a blend of green and brown to yellowish tones, featuring hilly terrain altogether. The Basque Country spreads from the rough coastal landscape to the semi-desert of the Bardenas on the south-eastern fringes of Navarre.\n\nThe main natural limits of the Basque Country are the Cantabrian Sea (south Bay of Biscay) in the north and in the west side, and in the south side, the Ebro river. The highest point in the Basque Country is the Hiru Erregeen Mahaia peak (2438 m high).\n\nThe coast of the Basque Country has three sides. The coast of Biscay is rough but in general there are big beaches. There are also at least two big estuaries, that of Ibaizabal (known also as the Ría de Bilbao) and Urdaibai.\n\nThe coast of Gipuzkoa shows a more rugged terrain and in general the slopes are steeper. From the limit of Biscay to Zumaia there are smaller beaches and they are more rocky. East of Zumaia, they are larger and longer. When different rivers join the sea, small estuaries can be found (Oria), and in the others, maritime branches (Urumea, Bidasoa).\n\nThe coast of Lapurdi is flatter. The beaches are longer and the slopes gentler. The rivers Bidasoa and Adour join the ocean in Lapurdi.\n\nThe Basque country is mountainous. Most of the mountains are along an east-west axis, at the west of the Pyrenees.\n\nThe most important rock there is limestone, but there are also mountains composed of other materials. For example, Aiako Harria is composed of granite.\n\nThe highest mountain is Hiru Errege Maila.\n\nThe south of Álava and Navarre is the middle east limit of Cantabrian Mountains. There are mountains like Kodes and Toloño. Between those importants mountains there are Euskal mendiak: Urbasa, Andia, Aralar, Anboto, Ordunte or Aizkorri.\n\nThe Ebro is the largest river which crosses the Basque Country. It is 910 km long, and flows along the southern boundary of the Basque Country before it joins the Mediterranean sea. On its way east, the Ebro harvests the water of a string of tributaries, such as Zadorra, Baias, Ega and Aragon. Aragon's course is the longest, at 192 km. The river rises in Astun, located in Aragon; it flows down past the Esa reservoir, and crosses thereafter eastern Navarre until it joins the river of Ebro.\n\nAturri, which joins the sea in the coast of Basque Country, is the largest river and has the biggest water flow. Its source is in Tourmalet and it joins the sea in Baiona, crosses 335 km of land, the last 30 km of which are in Basque Country. It has several tributaries from the Pyrenees, including the Biduze, Errobi, and Aran. Like Aturri, other Basque rivers join the sea in the Bay of Biscay, such as Nerbioi, Bidasoa, Oria, Deba, Urola, and Urumea. The Nerbioi is the longest such river in the Basque Country, with a length of 75 km.\n\nThe forest of Irati is the largest in the Basque Country, and one of the main beech forests in Europe. It covers parts of Lower Navarre, Zuberoa and Spanish Navarre.\n\nOtherwise, from Sakana to Aezkoa extending all over the north of Navarre, deciduous forests abound. These breed of trees can be also found on the east of Álava, in the region called Mendialdea and Araialdea, and in Zuberoa and Lower Navarre. They exist in Gipuzkoa too, in the middle of Urola and in Aralar.\n\nIn Biscay, there are evergreen forests throughout 66% of the province. The main exceptions of this are some places of Enkarterri and in Durango (Urkiola Natural Park). In Gipuzkoa, 56% of the trees there are conifers, but in Álava they consist of only 28% of the trees.\n\nCurrently, 55% of Basque Country is covered by trees, and in Navarre the figure is 45%.\n\nThe natural park of Barde is the biggest desert, and is located in the south east of Navarre. It is 41.845 hectares in area. It is 45 km from north to south, and 24 km from west to east.\n\n\n"}

It is useful as a method in fluid mechanics to compare true velocities, such as the velocity of a flow in a stream, to a velocity that relates shear between layers of flow.\n\nShear velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe:\n\nShear velocity also helps in thinking about the rate of shear and dispersion in a flow. Shear velocity scales well to rates of dispersion and bedload sediment transport. A general rule is that the shear velocity is between 5% to 10% of the mean flow velocity.\n\nFor river base case, the shear velocity can be calculated by Manning's equation.\n\nInstead of finding formula_2 and formula_3 for your specific river of interest, you can examine the range of possible values and note that for most rivers, formula_4 is between 5% and 10% of formula_5:\n\nFor general case\n\nwhere \"τ\" is the shear stress in an arbitrary layer of fluid and \"ρ\" is the density of the fluid.\n\nTypically, for sediment transport applications, the shear velocity is evaluated at the lower boundary of an open channel:\n\nwhere \"τ\" is the shear stress given at the boundary.\n\nShear velocity can also be defined in terms of the local velocity and shear stress fields (as opposed to whole-channel values, as given above).\n\nThe friction velocity is often used as a scaling parameter for the fluctuating component of velocity in turbulent flows. One method of obtaining the shear velocity is through non-dimensionalization of the turbulent equations of motion. For example, in a fully developed turbulent channel flow or turbulent boundary layer, the streamwise momentum equation in the very near wall region reduces to:\n\nBy integrating in the \"y\"-direction once, then non-dimensionalizing with an unknown velocity scale \"u\" and viscous length scale , the equation reduces down to:\n\nor\n\nSince the right hand side is in non-dimensional variables, they must be of order 1. This results in the left hand side also being of order one, which in turn give us a velocity scale for the turbulent fluctuations (as seen above):\n\nHere, \"τ\" refers to the local shear stress at the wall.\nWithin the lowest portion of the planetary boundary layer a semi-empirical log wind profile is commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds.\nThe simplified equation that describe it is\n\nformula_12\n\nwhere formula_13 is the Von Kármán constant (~0.41), formula_14 is the zero plane displacement (in metres).\n\nThe zero-plane displacement (formula_14) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings. It can be approximated as / to / of the average height of the obstacles. For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.\n\nThus, you can extract the friction velocity by knowing the wind velocity at two levels (z).\n\nformula_16\n"}

A vessel of the same name and size traveled to the New World seventeen years prior as the flagship of the first expedition of Martin Pring.\n\n\"Speedwell\" was built in 1577, under the name \"Swiftsure\", as part of English preparations for war against Spain. She participated in the fight against the Spanish Armada. During the Earl of Essex's 1596 Azores expedition she served as the ship of his second in command, Sir Gelli Meyrick. After hostilities with Spain ended, she was decommissioned in 1605, and renamed \"Speedwell\".\n\n The Leiden Separatist, a Captain Blossom, bought \"Speedwell\" in Holland, and embarked from Delfshaven on 22 July 1620. They then sailed under the command of Captain Reynolds to Southampton, England to meet the sister ship, \"Mayflower\", which had been chartered by merchant investors (again Captain Blossom). In Southampton they joined with other Separatists and the additional colonists hired by the investors. \"Speedwell\" was already leaking. The ships lay at anchor in Southampton almost two weeks while \"Speedwell\" was being repaired and the group had to sell some of their belongings, food and stores, to cover costs and port fees.\n\nThe two ships began the voyage on 5 August 1620, but \"Speedwell\" was found to be taking on water, and the two ships put into Dartmouth for repairs. On the second attempt, \"Mayflower\" and \"Speedwell\" sailed about 100 leagues (about ) beyond Land's End in Cornwall, but \"Speedwell\" was again found to be taking on water. Both vessels returned to Dartmouth. The Separatists decided to go on to America on \"Mayflower\". According to Bradford, \"Speedwell\" was sold at auction in London, and after being repaired made a number of successful voyages for her new owners. At least two of her passengers, Captain Thomas Blossom and a son, returned to Leiden.\n\nPrior to the voyage, \"Speedwell\" had been refitted in Delfshaven and had two masts. Nathaniel Philbrick theorizes that the crew used a mast that was too big for the ship, and that the added stress caused holes to form in the hull. William Bradford wrote that the \"overmasting\" strained the ship's hull, but attributes the main cause of her leaking to actions on the part of the crew. Passenger Robert Cushman wrote from Dartmouth in August 1620 that the leaking was caused by a loose board approximately two feet long.\n\nEleven people from \"Speedwell\" boarded \"Mayflower\", leaving 20 people to return to London (including Cushman) while a combined company of 102 continued the voyage. For a third time, \"Mayflower\" headed for the New World. She left Plymouth on 6 September 1620 and entered Cape Cod Harbor on 11 November. \"Speedwell's\" replacement, \"Fortune\", eventually followed, arriving at Plymouth Colony one year later on 9 November 1621. Philippe de Lannoy on \"Speedwell\" made the trip.\n\n In 1837, Robert Walter Weir was commissioned by the United States Congress to paint an historical depiction of the Pilgrims. This painting was placed in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Washington, D.C. in December 1843. Known as \"The Embarkation of the Pilgrims\", the remarkable painting is a scene on board \"Speedwell\" while harbored in Delfs [or Delft] Haven, Holland. The historical event dramatized took place on July 22, 1620. Weir would later paint another, much smaller oil on canvas that is now displayed in the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The paintings are similar except for lighting and a few minor changes. The 1857 work measures about . \"The Embarkation of the Pilgrims\" is depicted on the reverse of the 10,000 dollar bill (Federal Reserve Note) issued in 1918. Only five examples of this bill are known, and \"none exist outside of institutional collections.\"\n\nA fiction based on fact novel, \"A Spurious Brood\" outlines a possible explanation for the sabotage of \"Speedwell\", based on the true story of Katherine More, whose children were sent to America on board \"Mayflower\". In \"Hornblower and the Atropos\", one of the C. S. Forester novels about fictional British naval officer Horatio Hornblower, a treasure ship named \"Speedwell\" has sunk in Turkey's Marmorice Bay, and Hornblower's mission is to recover the treasure from the bottom of the bay. \"Speedwell\" is also mentioned several times in battle-action scenes in the historical fiction novel, \"Armada: A Novel\", written by Charles Gidley Wheeler and published in 1987.\n\n"}
{"id": "25964293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25964293", "title": "Tel Kabri", "text": "Tel Kabri\n\nTel Kabri (; , Tell al-Qahweh, \"the mound of coffee\") is an archaeological site of a \"tell\" (hill city), containing one of the largest Middle Bronze (MB) Age (2,100–1,550 BC) Canaanite palaces in ancient Palestine, and the largest such palace excavated as of 2014. Kabri is named for the abundance of its perennial springs – as described in the Etymology section below – the presence of which has led to the site's occupation and use as a water source from the Pottery Neolithic (PN) period (6,400–4,500 BC) to the present day. Located in the Western Upper Galilee, the site was at the height of its power in the MB, controlling much of the surrounding region. Kabri declined as a local power at the end of the MB, but the site continued to be occupied at times, on a much reduced level, up until the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nSince 1957, Tel Kabri has been excavated by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), formerly the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (IDAM), as well as Israeli and American universities. Among the discoveries at the site by the two full-scale archaeological expeditions, two have attracted particular attention from the archaeological community. The first finding to come to international attention was the discovery of Minoan-style frescoes in the palace at Kabri. , these are the only Minoan-style frescoes ever discovered in Israel. Second, in 2013, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project uncovered the oldest and largest known palatial wine cellar in the Ancient Near East in Kabri's palace.\n\n, the original Canaanite name of Tel Kabri is unknown. Aharon Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might have been the same city as Rehov, referred to in the Execration Texts, an Ancient Egyptian list of enemy polities. Amihai Mazar once believed that Tel Kabri – or the site of Tel Rehov – might be the Rehov from the Execration Texts, or Tel Kabri might be a different Rehov mentioned in topographic lists by Pharaoh Thutmose III. No definitive evidence has been found to support any of these hypotheses. By the Iron Age, 1200-500BC (IA), the site is known to have been called Rehov, and this continued into the period – a period of Phoenician dominance over the area, which was concurrent with the Iron Age.\n\nEarly in the Roman Period (64 BC–500s AD), the town of Kabrita had been established to the east of the tel. The site is mentioned in the 3rd century Mosaic of Rehob, as marking one of the northernmost bounds of Jewish resettlement after their return from Babylonian exile. Kabrita became the Arab village of el-Kabira, which by the late 1200s AD was called al-Kabrah by the Arabs and Le Quiebre by the Crusaders who controlled the area at the time. By 1880, both the village and the ruins on the tel had come to be associated and bear the same names. Al-Kabrah eventually became al-Kabri, and this name lasted until the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when the village was depopulated. Both the post-war kibbutz, Kabri, on whose grounds the archaeological site is located, and the tel itself, are named for al-Kabri. The name of Kabrita, and the later names, were derived from the triconsonantal Semitic root, כבר, meaning 'great or powerful', in reference to the plentiful water from Kabri's springs.\n\nTel Kabri is at the eastern end of the Western Galilee coastal plain, located on the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri. It is less than from the sea, and the Ga'aton River is nearby to the south, with the closest major city being Nahariyya to the west. The tel is home to four springs, Ein Shefa, Ein Giah, Ein Tzuf, and Ein ha-Shayara. It is these springs that have brought people to Kabri since the Neolithic.\n\nNatural resources such as trees on the hills to the east and stone quarries near the coast were important for the inhabitants of the site. Kabri's height is partly a result of human activity: Over the centuries, material remains created layers that built up thetel. During Kempinski's excavations, it was found that the original surface in the Neolithic would have been up to lower than the present surface.\n\nThe tel and its surrounding area have been inhabited since the Pottery Neolithic (PN). Kabri was at the height of its power in the MB, when the polity there controlled a significant portion of the Upper Galilee. After the MB, Tel Kabri was occupied by later peoples – though on a much reduced scale – up to the founding of the State of Israel, when the kibbutz of Kabri was created.\n\nThe area of Kabri was first settled during the PN by members of the Yarmoukian culture. In the early Chalcolithic period (4500–3500 BC), Kabri was a major centre of the Wadi Raba culture. In the Early Bronze (EB) Age (3500-2100 BC), there was a town on the side of the tel that was destroyed as part of the region-wide systems collapse that characterised the EB collapse. In the early and middle MB I, Tel Kabri – along with Megiddo, Aphek, and Akko – was one of the earliest cities in the Levant to rebuild its fortifications following the EB collapse. The new city was confined to the northern part of the earlier EB tel.\n\nPrior to the ongoing excavations at Kabri that began in 2005, archaeologists thought that there was only one palace at the site, and that it was built in the period between the late MB I (2200–1950 BC) and MB IIA (1950–1700 BC). It was also thought that the MB I period had been a transition phase. However, the palace found by Kempinski has been dated to the MB IIB (1700–1550 BC), and in 2010, a second, earlier, palace – an MB IIA palace – was identified beneath the MB IIB palace. The remains of the earlier MB IIA palace appear to show that it was expanded to create the later MB IIB palace. The discovery of the earlier palace pushes the dates for palatial occupation of the site to the MB IIA, 150 years earlier than originally believed. The earlier MB IIA palace may have been \"the most impressive structure in the Upper Galilee\" at the time, and was possibly the oldest palace in Canaan.\n\nEarlier still, at the transition between the MB I and MB II, a large-scale restructuring programme was undertaken in a possible effort to transform Kabri into an idealised Syrian-style city – a powerful city-state centred around a magnificent and well-fortified palace. The area was fortified, and an additional were enclosed within a large glacis, a type of earthwork fortification that was wide with a stone core and that encircled the tel as it appears today. The glacis was topped by mudbrick and stone. There was an MB I palace and this was expanded into the MB II palaces. This restructuring programme resulted in some parts of the tel being flattened out and a large portion of the population having to find new homes in the city, as a result of part of the MB IIA palace – along with certain parts of the rampart – being built in an area previously occupied by private houses. Kabri's ancillary sites (such as Achziv and Avdon) were also built up, and migration from the hinterland to Kabri – and its secondary sites – increased dramatically as a result of these projects. Kabri became the capital of a major polity, with the newly expanded MB II palace at its centre.\n\nAt the peak of its power, Kabri may have controlled a domain that stretched from Mount Carmel in the south to the Sulam range in the north, with as many as 31 vassal sites and 30,000 subjects. Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might be the Bronze Age settlement of Rehov, a polity mentioned in the Execration Texts and the biblical Book of Joshua.During this period, Kabri maintained significant contacts with neighbouring regions in the form of trade and exchange of ideas.\n\nCounting the MB I, MB IIA, and MB IIB stages, the palace was continuously occupied for three centuries. This is longer than any other palace in ancient Israel.\n\nBy 1500 BC, the site was abandoned for reasons unknown as of the 2015. Some time after the abandonment, during the Late Bronze (LB) Age (1550–1200 BC), a small village occupied the tel.\nIn the Iron Age, the site was reoccupied by Greek mercenaries under hire from the Phoenician city-state of Tyre. The mercenaries were based in a citadel there. Close to the citadel, in the Iron Age and Phoenician periods, the later Phoenician city of Rehov was sited at Kabri. The Phoenician town was fortified by a casemate wall. This town was destroyed by the armies of the Neo-Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II around 585 BC, and his rule was extended over Phoenicia. After this destruction, the town was rebuilt and this new town grew during the Persian period (538–332 BC). Remains from this time have been found near the tel's spring of Ein Shefa. Habitation at the tel itself ends at this point. Early in the Hellenistic period (332–64 BC), the ruins of the Iron Age citadel were used for burials, but the tel was not resettled until the Ottoman period (1517-1917 AD).\n\nSome time during the Early Roman period, a Jewish settlement is mentioned, named Kabrita, located east of the tel in the area that was occupied by the later Arab village, eventually named al-Kabri. Kabri, appearing under the name of al-Kabrah, is mentioned in the last hudna, or peace treaty, between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Mamluks. In the treaty, the village and its surrounding fields, are shown as belonging to the ruler of Akko.\n\nIn addition to al-Kabri which is located east of the site, during the Ottoman Period, two additional Arab villages were founded on the actual site – en-Nahr and et-Tell – in the southern and western portions of the tel, respectively. All three villages were close to the major springs, but during most of their existence, they were sparsely populated – in the low hundreds. Al-Kabri appears as \"Kabli\" and En-Nahr appears as \"el-Qahweh\" in the first topographic map of the region made in 1799 by Napoleon's cartographer, Pierre Jacotin. This same map does not show Et-Tell, and only shows a mill in that location. Et-Tell does appear in the later Palestine Exploration Fund map of 1880, and is talked about by Victor Guérin in his travelogue of the area, published that same year, which described all three villages. Karmon hypothesised that the new village of et-Tell might have been founded by villagers from el-Qahweh as a home for mill workers. The three villages existed up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when they were depopulated.\n\nMuch of Kabri's recorded history also deals with its springs and, starting in the Hellenistic period, the springs' relationship to the city of Akko. The springs of Kabri have fed Akko for centuries, and aqueducts have been built from Kabri to Akko by local rulers. In the Hellenistic period, an aqueduct was constructed at Kabri, and another was built during the governorship of Jezzar Pasha, the Ottoman ruler of Akko who also ruled the Eyalet of Sidon (1775-1804). Later, a new aqueduct was built by Jezzar's successor, Sulaymán Páshá in the Ottoman Period, and this aqueduct functioned up until the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Portions of the structure still stand today.\n\nFollowing the War, the tel was incorporated into the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri and was made into agricultural land. Soon after, the ancient remains of the site were rediscovered and on-and-off archaeological work began which continues to the present day alongside the agricultural work of the kibbutz.\n\nTel Kabri has been a subject of archaeological study since 1957, following the discovery of Late Neolithic vessels at the site in 1956 by members of the kibbutz. After 1961, most of the focus on the site shifted to Bronze Age material remains. Surveys and excavations have taken place at the site to explore its past.\n\nTel Kabri is a multi-period site, meaning that it has layers, or \"strata\", of occupation dating from different time periods. The tel itself operates as an agricultural area of Kibbutz Kabri, and certain layers have been subject to damage as a result of agriculture activity.\n\nThe tel is located on the grounds of the kibbutz, and contains the remains of the Canaanite city from the MB period and the partially excavated later Iron Age citadel. Tel Kabri is the only Canaanite city that can be excavated in its entirety because no other city with monumental architecture was built on the site after the MB city. In 2013, it was estimated that the palace would have occupied , and in 2006, it was estimated that the ancient city as a whole would have occupied .\n\nAs a result of farming and erosion, Stratum 1 of the tel, the uppermost layer, has been heavily damaged. Prior to agricultural activities by the \"kibbutzniks\" in 1976, there still existed large towers on the tel, which may have been gates. The entire site is cut across by a British Mandate period (1920–1948 AD) road that originally led from the coastal city of Nahariyya to the \"moshav\" of Me'ona. Most of the tel was also covered over with a metre of sterile top-soil (containing no archaeological remains) laid down for the purpose of farming by the kibbutz between Kempinski's excavations ending in 1993 and the beginning of the ongoing expedition in 2005. According to Tel Kabri Archaeological Project co-Director Assaf Yasur-Landau: \"The city's preservation enables us to get a complete picture of political and social life in the Canaanite period. We can reveal whether or not it had a central government, whether taxes were levied, what sort of agriculture there was and how politics were conducted at the time.\"\n\nKempinski identified twelve stratigraphic layers at Tel Kabri. Stratigraphy is the layering of soil with the more recent soil layers higher up and the older soil layers further down. Archaeologists and geologists use stratigraphy to date artefacts found in the soil relative to each other. The artefacts – in particular, sherds of pottery – can, in turn, be used to date the layer of soil and its contents to a specific date range. The 1986-1993 Tel Kabri Expedition did not find a continuous stratigraphic sequence in any one excavation trench, and so Kempinski based the identification of the layers at Tel Kabri on finds in different areas. He arranged the layers as follows:\n\nTel Kabri is divided up into areas (some of which are shown in the table above) for practical purposes of organisation. The first areas – A, B, and C – were designated during the 1975–1976 excavations by Kempinski and Prausnitz. Later Areas D, E, F, and T were opened by the 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition, and Area D was subdivided by the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project starting in 2005.The following areas have been investigated as of the 2013 season.\n\n\nArchaeological work has taken place at Tel Kabri since 1956. The work at Tel Kabri has consisted of a survey, five minor excavations, and two major excavations, although prior to 1986, much of the activity was salvage excavations and surveys. , Tel Kabri is being excavated by an international consortium, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project. Among the finds that have been discovered at Tel Kabri, are Minoan-style wall frescoes – of which there are four known at Kabri – and the oldest and largest known palatial wine cellar in the Ancient Near East.\n\nIn the years before the first large-scale excavations by Aharon Kempinski (1986-1993), surveys and smaller excavations were conducted to rescue artefacts and get an idea of the nature of Tel Kabri. This began when the archaeological remains of the tel were first discovered in the 1950s after kibbutzniks started coming across Neolithic artefacts near the local spring of Ein Giah. In 1956, on behalf of IDAM, the forerunner of today's Israel Antiquities Authority, David Alon and Daniel Rosolio conducted a survey in the area where the Neolithic artefacts had first been found earlier in the same year. They came across fortifications from the MB, and this survey led to salvage excavations in the following two years of what would later become Area A. In 1961, public works by the national water company revealed Bronze Age architectural remains in the form of a palace floor. In 1969, another rescue excavation was launched to investigate MB IIA tombs revealed as a result of agricultural activity by the kibbutz. From 1975 to 1976, a salvage excavation was conducted to examine areas exposed in 1957, 1958, 1961, and 1969 \n\nFrom 1957 to 1958, The first rescue excavations were carried out by Moshe Prausnitz working with the IDAM, who was joined by Robert Stigler of Brandeis University. Prausnitz focused on Area A of the site where the surveyors, Alon and Rosoliyo, had first investigated the Neolithic implements found by the kibbutzniks in 1956. His expedition found Neolithic 'cist' tombs as well as round and rectangular dwellings from the lower part of the city.\n\nIn 1961, after Prausnitz's excavation, a large trench was cut into the tel by the national water company, Mekorot, so as to incorporate the local springs into the national water system. This inadvertently led to the start of exploration into the EB and MB archaeological remains at Kabri. The stratigraphy from the Mekorot trench was photographed and revealed the existence of the Bronze Age settlements. It also revealed the plaster floors – the first evidence of what would later be identified as the MB II palaces. The trench also cut into – and revealed the existence of – the MB II rampart.\n\nIn 1969, as a result of the kibbutz removing an orchard from the tel, MB II tombs containing grave goods were found in what had been the lower city. Their findspot was excavated by Y. Ben-Yosef for the IDAM that same year.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1976, salvage excavations were carried out by Prausnitz representing the IDAM, Kempinski of Tel Aviv University (TAU), and Ruth Amiran of the Israel Museum, to explore the area where the MB II tombs had been found, the lower city, the earthen rampart, and the Neolithic layers of the site. Among their finds was a tall stela that had a polished face, but no inscription. Following this excavation, Kempinski, focused his work on Tel Kabri and applied for permits from the IDAM and permission from Kibbutz Kabri to conduct large-scale excavation of the site.\n\nIn 1986, large-scale excavations began at Tel Kabri, initially under the direction of Kempinski for TAU, and then, from 1989 onwards, Kempinski and Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier for Heidelberg University, until Kempinski died in July 1994, and the expedition was discontinued. Between 1986 and 1988, the first remains of the MB palaces were discovered near the spring of Ein Shefa, along with a contemporaneous residential area. The portion of the palace initially excavated included a hall, with a Minoan-style decorated plaster floor. The style of the floor is closest to what is referred to as the 'Cretan-Theran Late Minoan IA' tradition of wall painting. They also found more than 2,000 Aegean-style painted plaster fragments. It was during the course of Kempinski's excavations that an Iron Age Phoenician citadel was also discovered. The site's excavators believed this fortification was occupied by Greek mercenaries, based on the pottery found there.\n\nIn the first year of excavation by the Kempinski expedition, work was carried out in Area C, and continued each year through the 1991 season. In 1986, Areas D and E were opened, and excavated, for the first time. Area D was, and is, home to the MB palace, which became the focus of Kempinski's excavations for the duration of his expedition, which was the first to excavate the palace intentionally (after the accidental excavation by the Mekorot water company in 1961). Area D was excavated each year by Kempinski's team. In 1987, the Kempinski expedition discovered the entranceway to what would be designated as Hall 611 in the palace, the ceremonial hall with the painted plaster floor. Area E was excavated every year except 1987, 1988, and 1991, and in the first year, 1986, yielded Iron Age Greek pottery. In 1987, new work was carried out in Prausnitz's Area B and continued each year through 1992. During the 1988 excavation, a large family tomb was discovered in Area C, and MB II bronze artefacts, such as a \"duck-billed axe\" from Area B (see picture to the right), were also recovered from tombs in both Areas B and C.\n\nAt the start of the 1989 season, German Archaeologist, Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, joined Kempinski's Tel Kabri Expedition as his co-director. Along with the excavations in Areas B, C, D, and E, additional work was carried out in the new Area F, which continued each year excluding the 1991 season, and in Area T, which was excavated in 1990. Area T was an area at the northern part of the tel opened to explore what looked like a surviving tower but the exploration of which resulted in finding well-preserved fortifications. In 1990, finds included a Phoenician seal impression which had both the name of the official who owned it and the year according to the Tyrian calendar. Also in 1990, the western portion of Hall 611 was completely revealed in Area D, and preliminary preservation efforts were completed on the hall's painted plaster floor. Work by the Kempinski expedition continued up though 1993. In Area E, work was done to investigate occupation of the site after the Iron Age – prior focus having been on the Bronze Age aspects of the site.\n\nAt the end of the 1993 season, the painted plaster floor in Hall 611 was covered over with geotextile, as the team expected to return the following summer in 1994. However, Kempinski's excavations never resumed past 1993, as Kempinski died in June the following year. In accordance with his wishes, Kempinski was buried at Tel Kabri.\n\nBetween the major excavations by Kempinski and the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, two separate minor excavations were conducted by Dina Shalem and Howard Smithline. In 1999, Shalem headed up a salvage excavation ahead of a construction project on the Mandate period road running through the tel. Her team worked in Area D and came across EB architecture, as well as some Chalcolithic sherds and a possible surface from that period. In 2004, the Israeli telecommunications company, Cellcom, was laying down new telephone cable near Area E, and Smithline was asked to conduct a salvage excavation before the work started. He used this as an opportunity to investigate further the Iron Age aspects of the site. His team did not make any new discoveries, but did add to the collection of Iron Age I (1,200–1,000 BC) and Iron Age II (1,000–586 BC) pottery from the site.\n\nIn 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau, and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, conducted an investigation to see if Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated the size of the palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted electric resistivity and magnetometric soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to dig trenches. Their findings showed that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought. With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former Megiddo Expedition colleague, Prof. Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University, the following year and asked whether he would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.\n\nSince 2005, the renewed excavations have been conducted by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, an international team co-directed by Yasur-Landau, now of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at the University of Haifa, Cline on behalf of The George Washington University, and Prof. Andrew Koh of Brandeis University, which officially joined the consortium in 2013. The majority of these excavation seasons have taken place at the MB palaces in Area D of the tel, and, since 2009, have been semi-annual.\n\nThe first four seasons at Tel Kabri were dedicated to investigating the site's potential for future large-scale excavation. As a result, the 2005 season was exploratory in nature, featuring assessment of the site and minor excavations to determine the viability of conducting future work at the site.During the course of the season, additional palatial architecture was uncovered, and the palace was found to be twice as large as previously thought by Kempinski, thus confirming the results of the 2003 soundings by Yasur-Landau and Makovsky. Along with this, another structure – possibly communal or another palace – was discovered below the MB II palace. It was during the 2005 season that the first find of a gold artefact at Kabri was made.\n\nThe team also found that in the time between the end of Kempinski's excavations and the start of the new expedition, there had been significant damage done to the site by the elements. The most apparent example of this was the geotextile that had been placed by Kempinski to cover the painted plaster floor in the palace hall. Since 1993, the geotextile had bonded to the plaster, and this made it impossible to remove the geotextile without destroying the floor. As a result of this, much of the work done in the 2005 season was also conservation work.\n\nThe following 2006 season was a series of surveys of the region around Kabri. The goals of this season were only partially fulfilled during the original timeframe though, as the 2006 season coincided with the 2006 Lebanon War. The team was able to survey MB II sites in the area around the site and see how they would have interacted with Kabri in that time period. However, as a result of the war, they had to postpone any aerial photography of the tel – by order of the Israeli Air Force – and access to the pottery from previous excavations – held in the IAA storerooms at Kibbutz Beit HaEmek – was restricted for the duration of the war. In that time period, the IAA did allow the team to remove the relevant pottery from Beit HaEmek to Tel Aviv for study, where the pottery could also be kept safe. The team had to wait until mid-September to achieve its goals fully. As a result of the dangers posed by the rockets from the north, some members of the team had to return to their home countries, without completing their work.\n\nThe 2007 season was partly devoted to finishing the work that had to be halted in the 2006 season, as well as preparing the site for excavation the following season. Through comparative studies of pottery, the team was able to map out Kabri's rise to regional power in the MB II. The architecture of the palace was mapped out using a total station, and a digital topographic map was made of the tel using aerial photography and measurements on the ground.\n\nThe 2008 season saw a return to excavation at the site, with a focus on the palace in Area D that had been discovered by Kempinski. The team wanted to go deeper and explore the possibility of there being a palace beneath the one Kempinski found. They managed to get a clearer picture of the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time for contact with the Aegean and Cyprus to the MB I period. At the close of the dig season, the site was covered up to preserve it in the off-season.\n\n2009 was the first year of large-scale excavation by the expedition, and the first year that the system of semi-annual excavation – with the off-years devoted to data-processing – was implemented and was in use as of the 2013 season. The 2009 season was also the only year that two separate seasons of excavations were conducted: a summer large-scale excavation, and a winter minor excavation. During the summer season of 2009, additional Aegean style frescoes were found at the site. In Area D-West, the northern bounds of the palace were successfully determined, and a corridor was discovered that held restorable pottery. During the winter season, the corridor in D-West was revisited, so that its use could be determined. As a result of these excavations, the date for the construction of the earliest palace was revised and estimated to be in the MB I period in the 1800s BC, making the palace at Kabri one of the oldest palaces in Canaan.\nThe main finds of the 2011 season included an orthostat building close to the palace, further pieces of painted plaster, and a scarab of the Second Intermediate Period.\nDuring the 2013 season, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project discovered the first known complete MB storage room in Canaan. On 22 November 2013, the team announced that this storage room had been found to be the oldest palatial wine cellar in the Ancient Near East, with 40 large ceramic jars, totalling 2,000 litres in capacity, containing traces of wine dating to 1700 BC. During the latter half of the season, the dig shifted its focus to Area D-West, where the wine cellar was located. To speed up the process of uncovering the vessels in the wine cellar, for part of the time, the team adopted the atypical practice of working in morning and afternoon shifts of 05:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, respectively, almost exclusively in Area D-West. Prior to the actual removal of the vessels, LiDAR work was done on the site, for the first time, in this area. Near the end of the season, red plaster fragments were discovered while the area was being cleaned. However, the finds were not restricted to Area D-West. In Area D-South, a deposit was discovered that held additional pieces of wall plaster. In Area D-West-East, the area of D-North was linked up with the areas excavated by Kempinski, thus unifying the whole area from D-North to D-West, exposing further architecture, and bringing the estimate of the size of the palace to approximately . As a result of the discovery of two doorways in D-West at the end of the 2013 season, part of the 2015 season will be devoted to exploring where – and to what – these doorways lead.\nBelow are the site reports that could be located for the archaeological work at Tel Kabri. They have been arranged chronologically, with internet links where available, for reference.\n\nThe reports for the 1957–1958, 1975–1976, 1999, and 2004 excavations were all published in journals, some in English and some in Hebrew. It was not until the Tel Kabri Expedition of Tel Aviv University under Kempinski that stand-alone excavation reports for Tel Kabri were published, and then Kempinski made sure to publish a report for each year – a practice that has continued with the ongoing excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project of The George Washington University and the University of Haifa.

{"id": "283764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=283764", "title": "Thule", "text": "Thule\n\nThule (; , \"Thoúlē\"; ) was the place located furthest north, which was mentioned in ancient Greek and Roman literature and cartography.\n\nIn classical and medieval literature, ultima Thule (Latin \"furthermost Thule\") acquired a metaphorical meaning of any distant place located beyond the \"borders of the known world\".\n\nBy the late middle ages and early modern era, the Greco-Roman Thule was often identified with the real Iceland or Greenland. Sometimes \"Ultima Thule\" was a Latin name for Greenland, when \"Thule\" was used for Iceland. By the late 19th century, however, \"Thule\" was frequently identified with Norway.\n\nIn 1910, the explorer Knud Rasmussen established a missionary and trading post in north-western Greenland, which he named \"Thule\" (later Qaanaaq).\n\nModern interpretations of the ancient Greek and Roman place name have included Orkney, Shetland, the island of Saaremaa (Ösel) in Estonia, and the Norwegian island of Smøla.\n\nThe Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia (now Marseille, France) is the first to have written of Thule, after his travels between 330–320 BCE. Pytheas mentioned going to Thule in his now lost work, \"Things about the Ocean\" Τὰ περὶ τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ (\"ta peri tou Okeanou\"). He supposedly was sent out by the Greek city of Massalia to see where their trade goods were coming from. Descriptions of some of his discoveries have survived in the works of later, often skeptical, authors. Polybius in his \"Histories\" (c. 140 BC), Book XXXIV, cites Pytheas as one \"who has led many people into error by saying that he traversed the whole of Britain on foot, giving the island a circumference of forty thousand stadia, and telling us also about Thule, those regions in which there was no longer any proper land nor sea nor air, but a sort of mixture of all three of the consistency of a jellyfish in which one can neither walk nor sail, holding everything together, so to speak.\"\n\nThe 1st century BCE Greek astronomer Geminus of Rhodes claimed that the name Thule went back to an archaic word for the polar night phenomenon – \"the place where the sun goes to rest\". Dionysius Periegetes in his \"De situ habitabilis orbis\" also touched upon this subject as did Martianus Capella. Avienus in his \"Ora Maritima\" added that during the summer on Thule night lasted only two hours, a clear reference to the midnight sun.\n\nStrabo in his \"Geographica\" (c. 30 CE), mentions Thule in describing Eratosthenes' calculation of \"the breadth of the inhabited world\" and notes that Pytheas says it \"is a six days' sail north of Britain, and is near the frozen sea\". But he then doubts this claim, writing that Pytheas has \"been found, upon scrutiny, to be an arch falsifier, but the men who have seen Britain and Ireland do not mention Thule, though they speak of other islands, small ones, about Britain\". Strabo adds the following in Book 5: \"Now Pytheas of Massilia tells us that Thule, the most northerly of the Britannic Islands, is farthest north, and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic Circle. But from the other writers I learn nothing on the subject – neither that there exists a certain island by the name of Thule, nor whether the northern regions are inhabitable up to the point where the summer tropic becomes the Arctic Circle.\" Strabo ultimately concludes, \"Concerning Thule, our historical information is still more uncertain, on account of its outside position; for Thule, of all the countries that are named, is set farthest north.\" The inhabitants or people of Thule are described in most detail by Strabo (citing Pytheas): \"the people (of Thule) live on millet and other herbs, and on fruits and roots; and where there are grain and honey, the people get their beverage, also, from them. As for the grain, he says, since they have no pure sunshine, they pound it out in large storehouses, after first gathering in the ears thither; for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains\".\n\nThe mid-1st century Roman geographer Pomponius Mela placed Thule north of Scythia.\n\nIn 77 CE, Pliny the Elder published his \"Natural History\" in which he also cites Pytheas' claim (in Book II, Chapter 75) that Thule is a six-day sail north of Britain. Then, when discussing the islands around Britain, he writes: \"The farthest of all, which are known and spoke of, is Thule; in which there be no nights at all, as we have declared, about mid-summer, namely when the Sun passes through the sign Cancer; and contrariwise no days in mid-winter: and each of these times they suppose, do last six months, all day, or all night.\" Finally, in refining the island's location, he places it along the most northerly parallel of those he describes: \"Last of all is the Scythian parallel, from the Rhiphean hills into Thule: wherein (as we said) it is day and night continually by turns (for six months).\"\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his book chronicling the life of his father-in-law, Agricola, describes how the Romans knew that Britain (in which Agricola was Roman commander) was an island rather than a continent, by circumnavigating it. Tacitus writes of a Roman ship visiting the Orkneys and claims the ship's crew even sighted Thule. However their orders were not to explore there, as winter was at hand. Some scholars believe that Tacitus was referring to Shetland. \n\nThe 3rd Century, Latin grammarian Gaius Julius Solinus wrote in his \"Polyhistor\" that \"Thyle, which was distant from Orkney by a voyage of five days and nights, was fruitful and abundant in the lasting yield of its crops\". The 4th century Virgilian commentator Servius also believed that Thule sat close to Orkney: \"Thule; an island in the Ocean between the northern and western zone, beyond Britain, near Orkney and Ireland; in this Thule, when the sun is in Cancer, it is said that there are perpetual days without nights...\"\n\nOther late classical writers and post-classical writers, such as Orosius (384–420) and the Irish monk Dicuil (late 8th and early 9th century), describe Thule as being north and west of both Ireland and Britain, strongly suggesting that it was Iceland. In particular, Dicuil described Thule as being beyond islands that seem to be the Faroe Islands (which are between Shetland and Iceland).\n\nSolinus (d. 400 CE) in his \"Polyhistor\", repeated these descriptions, noting that the people of Thule had a fertile land where they grew a good production of crop and fruits.\n\nIn the writings of the historian Procopius, from the first half of the 6th century, Thule is a large island in the north inhabited by 25 tribes. It is believed that Procopius is really talking about a part of Scandinavia, since several tribes are easily identified, including the Geats (\"Gautoi\") in present-day Sweden and the Sami people (\"Scrithiphini\"). He also writes that when the Herules returned, they passed the Warini and the Danes and then crossed the sea to Thule, where they settled beside the Geats.\n\nThe British surveyor Charles Vallancey (1731–1812) was one of many antiquarians to argue that Ireland was Thule, as he does in his book \"An essay on the antiquity of the Irish language\".\n\nAnother hypothesis, first proposed by Lennart Meri in 1976, holds that the island of Saaremaa (which is often known by the exonym Osel) in Estonia, could be Thule. That is, there is a phonological similarity between Thule and the root \"tule-\" \"of fire\" in Estonian (and other Finnic languages). A crater lake named Kaali on the island appears to be have been formed by a meteor strike in prehistory. This meteor strike is often linked to Estonian folklore which has it that Saaremaa was a place where the sun at one point \"went to rest\".\n\nIn 2010, scientists from the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation Science at the Technical University of Berlin, claimed to have identified persistent errors in calculation that had occurred in attempts by modern geographers to superimpose geographic coordinate systems upon Ptolemaic maps. After correcting for these errors, the scientists claimed, Ptolemy's Thule could be mapped to the Norwegian island of Smøla.\n\nIn 1775, during his second voyage, Captain Cook named an island in the high southern latitudes of the South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Thule. The name is now used for a group of three southernmost islands in the South Sandwich Islands, one of which is called Thule Island. The island group became a British overseas territory of the United Kingdom , albeit also claimed by Argentina (in Spanish \"Islas Tule del Sur\").\n\nIn 1910, the explorer Knud Rasmussen established a missionary and trading post, which he named Thule (Inuit: \"Avanaa\") on Greenland. The Thule people, the predecessor of modern Inuit Greenlanders, were named after the Thule region. In 1953, Avanaa became Thule Air Base, operated by United States Air Force. The population was forced to resettle to New Thule (Qanaaq), to the north ( only 840 NM from the North Pole).\nThe Scottish Gaelic for Iceland is \"Innis Tile\", which literally means the \"Isle of Thule\".\n\nThule lends its name to the 69th element in the periodic table, thulium.\n\nUltima Thule is the name of a location in the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky, United States. It was formerly the terminus of the known-explorable southeastern (upstream) end of the passage called \"Main Cave\", before discoveries made in 1908 by Ed Bishop and Max Kaemper showed an area accessible beyond it, now the location of the Violet City Entrance. The Violet City Lantern tour offered at the cave passes through Ultima Thule near the conclusion of the route.\n\nThe Southern Thule islands were occupied by Argentina in 1976. The occupation was not militarily contested by the British until the 1982 Falklands War, during which time British sovereignty was restored by a contingent of Royal Marines. Currently the three islands are uninhabited.\n\nIn March 2018, following a naming competition, the Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69, a fly-by target of the NASA probe \"New Horizons\" was nicknamed \"Ultima Thule\". The pass is scheduled for 1 January 2019, and will be the most distant encounter between a spacecraft and a planetary body. An official name for the body will be assigned by the International Astronomical Union after the fly-by.\n\nIn the metaphorical sense of a far-off land or an unattainable goal, Virgil coined the term \"Ultima Thule\" (Georgics, 1. 30) meaning furthest land.\n\nSeneca the Younger writes of a day when new lands will be discovered past Thule. This was later quoted widely in the context of Christopher Columbus' voyages.\n\nThe Roman poet Silius Italicus (25 – 101 CE), who wrote that the people of Thule were painted blue: \"the blue-painted native of Thule, when he fights, drives around the close-packed ranks in his scythe-bearing chariot\". , implying a link to the Picts (whose exonym is derived from the Latin \"pictus\" \"painted\"). Martial (40 – 104 CE ) talks about \"blue\" and \"painted Britons\", just like Julius Caesar. Claudian (370 – 404 CE) also believed that the inhabitants of Thule were Picts.\n\nA work of prose fiction in Greek by Antonius Diogenes entitled \"The Wonders Beyond Thule\" appeared c. 150 CE or earlier. (Gerald N. Sandy, in the introduction to his translation of Photius' 9th century summary of the work,\nnotes that this Thule most closely matches Iceland.)\n\nCleomedes referenced Pytheas' journey to Thule, but added no new information.\n\nEarly in the 5th century AD Claudian, in his poem, \"On the Fourth Consulship of the Emperor Honorius\", Book VIII, rhapsodizes on the conquests of the emperor Theodosius I, declaring that the \"Orcades\" \"ran red with Saxon slaughter; Thule was warm with the blood of Picts; ice-bound Hibernia [Ireland] wept for the heaps of slain Scots\". This implies that Thule was Scotland. But in \"Against Rufinias\", the Second Poem, Claudian writes of \"Thule lying icebound beneath the pole-star\". Jordanes in his \"Getica\" also wrote that Thule sat under the pole-star.\n\nThe \"known world' of the Europeans came to be viewed as bounded in the east by India and in the west by Thule, as expressed in the \"Consolation of Philosophy\" (III, 203 = metrus V, v. 7) by Boethius. \"For though the earth, as far as India's shore, tremble before the laws you give, though Thule bow to your service on earth's farthest bounds, yet if thou canst not drive away black cares, if thou canst not put to flight complaints, then is no true power thine.\"\n\nIn the early 7th century, Isidore of Seville wrote in his \"Etymologies\" that:Ultima Thule (\"Thyle ultima\") is an island of the Ocean in the northwestern region, beyond Britannia, taking its name from the sun, because there the sun makes its summer solstice, and there is no daylight beyond (\"ultra\") this. Hence its sea is sluggish and frozen.Isidore distinguished this from the islands of Britannia, Thanet (\"Tanatos\"), the Orkneys (\"Orcades\"), and Ireland (\"Scotia\" or \"Hibernia\"). Isidore was to have a large influence upon Bede, who was later to mention Thule.\n\nBy the late Middle Ages, scholars were linking Iceland and/or Greenland to the name Thule and/or places reported by the Irish mariner Saint Brendan (in the 6th century) and other distant or mythical locations, such as Hy Brasil and Cockaigne. These scholars included works by Dicuil (see above), the Anglo-Saxon monk Venerable Bede in \"De ratione temporum\", the Landnámabók, by the anonymous \"Historia Norwegie\", and by the German cleric Adam of Bremen in his \"Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church\", where they cite both ancient writers' use of Thule as well as new knowledge since the end of antiquity. All these authors also understood that other islands were situated to the north of Britain.\n\nEustathius of Thessalonica, in his 12th century commentary on the \"Iliad,\" wrote that the inhabitants of Thule were at war with a tribe whose members dwarf-like, only 20 fingers in height. The American classical scholar Charles Anthon believed this legend may have been rooted in history (although exaggerated), if the dwarf or pygmy tribe were interpreted as being a smaller aboriginal tribe of Britain the people on Thule had encountered.\n\nPetrarch, in the 14th century, wrote in his \"Epistolae familiares\" (\"Familiar Letters\"\") that Thule lay in the unknown regions of the far north-west.\n\nA madrigal by Thomas Weelkes, entitled \"Thule\" (1600), describes it thus: Hekla is an Icelandic volcano.\n\nThe English poet Ambrose Philips began, but did not complete, a poem concerning \"\" which he published in 1748.\n\nThule is referred to in Goethe's poem \"Der König in Thule\" (1774), famously set to music by Franz Schubert (D 367, 1816) and Robert Schumann (Op.67, No.1), and in the collection \"\" (1880) by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" (1844) begins with the following stanza: \n\nJohn Henry Wilbrandt Stuckenberg wrote on the subject in 1885: \n\n\"Ultima Thule\" is the title of the 1929 novel by Henry Handel Richardson, set in colonial Australia.\n\n\"Ultima Thule\" is a short story written by author Vladimir Nabokov and published in \"New Yorker\" magazine on April 7, 1973.\n\nIn Germany, extreme right occultists believed in a historical Thule, or Hyperborea, as the ancient origin of the \"Aryan race\" (a term which they believed had been used by the Proto-Indo-European people). The Thule Society, which had close links to the \"Deutsche Arbeiter Partei\" (DAP), known later as the \"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\" (NSDAP or Nazi party) was, according to its own account, founded on August18, 1918. In his biography of Lanz von Liebenfels (1874–1954), \"Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab\", Munich 1985 – \"The Man who Gave Hitler the Ideas\", the Viennese psychologist and author Wilfried Daim claimed that the Thule Gesellschaft name originated from mythical Thule. In his history of the SA (\"Mit ruhig festem Schritt\", 1998 – \"With Firm and Steady Step\"), Wilfred von Oven, Joseph Goebbels' press adjutant from 1943 to 1945, confirmed that Pytheas' Thule was the historical Thule for the \"Thule Gesellschaft\".\n\nMuch of this fascination was due to rumours surrounding the \"Oera Linda Book\", falsely claimed to have been found by Cornelis Over de Linden during the 19th century. The \"Oera Linda Book\" was translated into German in 1933 and was favored by Heinrich Himmler. The book has since been thoroughly discredited. Professor of Frisian Language and Literature Goffe Jensma wrote that the three authors of the translation intended it \"to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34494", "title": "Zheng He", "text": "Zheng He\n\nZheng He (; 1371–1433 or 1435) was a Chinese mariner, explorer, diplomat, fleet admiral, and court eunuch during China's early Ming dynasty. He was originally born as Ma He in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. These carried hundreds of sailors on four tiers of decks.\n\nAs a favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whose usurpation he assisted, Zheng rose to the top of the imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing (the capital was later moved to Beijing by the Yongle Emperor). His voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qichao's \"Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng He\" in 1904. A trilingual stele left by the navigator was discovered on the island of Ceylon shortly thereafter.\n\nZheng He was born Ma He (馬和) to a Muslim family of Kunyang, Kunming, Yunnan, China. He had an older brother and four sisters.\n\nMa He's religious beliefs became all-embracing and eclectic in his adulthood. According to Dreyer (2007), the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that Zheng He's devotion to Tianfei (the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers) was the dominant faith to which he adhered, reflecting the goddess' central role to the treasure fleet. John Guy mentions, \"When Zheng He, the Muslim eunuch leader of the great expeditions to the 'Western Ocean' (Indian Ocean) in the early fifteenth century, embarked on his voyages, it was from the Divine Woman that he sought protection, as well as at the tombs of the Muslim saints on Lingshan Hill, above the city of Quanzhou.\"\n\nZheng He was a great-great-great-grandson of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, who served in the administration of the Mongol Empire and was the governor of Yunnan during the early Yuan dynasty. His great-grandfather was named Bayan and may have been stationed at a Mongol garrison in Yunnan. Zheng He's grandfather carried the title \"hajji\", while his father had the sinicized surname Ma and also the title \"hajji\", which suggests that they had made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Peterson (1994) suggests that the \"Hajji\" of both his father and grandfather indicated that Zheng He may have had Mongol-Arab ancestry and that he could speak Arabic.\n\nIn the autumn of 1381, a Ming army invaded and conquered Yunnan, which was then ruled by the Mongol prince Basalawarmi, Prince of Liang. In 1381, Ma Haji (Zheng He's father) died in the fighting between the Ming armies and Mongol forces. Dreyer (2007) states that Zheng He's father died at age 39 while resisting the Ming conquest. Levathes (1996) states Zheng He's father died at age 37, but it is unclear if he was helping the Mongol army or just caught in the onslaught of battle. Wenming, the oldest son, buried their father outside of Kunming. In his capacity as Admiral, Zheng He had an epitaph engraved in honor of his father, composed by the Minister of Rites Li Zhigang on the Duanwu Festival of the 3rd year in the Yongle era (1 June 1405).\n\nMa He was captured by the Ming armies at Yunnan in 1381. General Fu Youde saw Ma He on a road and approached him in order to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender. Ma He responded defiantly by saying that the Mongol pretender had jumped into a lake. Afterwards, the general took him prisoner. One source states that he was castrated at the age of 10 and then was placed in the service of the Prince of Yan, while another source indicates that the castration occurred in 1385.\n\nMa He was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, who later became the Yongle Emperor. Zhu Di was eleven years older than Ma. While enslaved as a eunuch servant, Ma He eventually gained the confidence of Zhu Di, while Zhu Di as his benefactor would gain the allegiance and loyalty of the young eunuch. Since 1380, the prince had been governing Beiping (later Beijing), which was located near the northern frontier where the hostile Mongol tribes were situated. Ma would spend his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier. He often participated in Zhu Di's military campaigns against the Mongols. On 2 March 1390, Ma accompanied the Prince when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory as the Mongol commander Naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception.\n\nEventually, he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince. Ma was also known as \"sān bǎo\" during the time of service in the household of the Prince of Yan. This name was a reference to the Three Jewels (, \"triratna\") in Buddhism. There is also a document saying his name could be ( \"Three Protections\", also pronounced \"sān bǎo\"). Ma received a proper education while at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital Nanjing, as the Hongwu Emperor did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate. Meanwhile, the Hongwu Emperor purged and exterminated many of the original Ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority, especially those in the north like the Prince of Yan.\n\nMa He's appearance as an adult was recorded: he was seven \"chi\". tall, had a waist that was five \"chi\" in circumference, cheeks and a forehead that was high, a small nose, glaring eyes, teeth that were white and well-shaped as shells, and a voice that was as loud as a bell. It is also recorded that he had great knowledge about warfare and was well-accustomed to battle.\n\nThe young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the Jianwen Emperor's hostility to his uncle's feudal bases prompted the 13991402 Jingnan Campaign which ended with the emperor's apparent death and the ascension of the Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, as the Yongle Emperor. In 1393, the Crown Prince had died, thus the deceased prince's son became the new heir apparent. By the time the emperor died (24 June 1398), the Prince of Qin and the Prince of Jin had perished, which left Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, as the eldest surviving son of the emperor. However, Zhu Di's nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the Jianwen Emperor. In 1398, he issued a policy known as \"xuēfān\", or \"reducing the feudatories\", which entails eliminating all the princes by stripping their power and military forces. In August 1399, Zhu Di openly rebelled against his nephew. In 1399, Ma He successfully defended Beiping's city reservoir Zhenglunba against the imperial armies. In January 1402, Zhu Di began with his military campaign to capture the imperial capital Nanjing. Zheng He would be one of his commanders during this campaign.\n\nIn 1402, Zhu Di's armies defeated the imperial forces and marched into Nanjing on 13 July 1402. Zhu Di accepted the elevation to emperor four days later. After ascending the throne as the Yongle Emperor, Zhu Di promoted Ma He as the Grand Director (, \"tài jiàn\") of the Directorate of Palace Servants. During the New Year's day on 11 February 1404, the Yongle Emperor conferred the surname \"Zheng\" to Ma He, because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir Zhenglunba against imperial forces in the Siege of Beiping of 1399, Another reason was that the eunuch commander also distinguished himself during the 1402 campaign to capture the capital Nanjing. It is believed that his choice to confer the surname \"Zheng\" was because the eunuch's horse had been killed during the battle at Zhenglunba near Beiping at the onset of his rebellion.\n\nIn the new administration, Zheng He served in the highest posts, as Grand Director and later as Chief Envoy (, \"zhèngshǐ\") during his sea voyages. Over the next three decades he conducted seven of these voyages on behalf of the emperor, trading and collecting tribute in the eastern Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\nIn 1424, Admiral Zheng He traveled to Palembang to confer an official seal and letter of appointment upon Shi Jisun, who was placed in the office of Pacification Commissioner. The \"Taizong Shilu\" 27 February 1424 entry reports that Shi Jisun had sent Qiu Yancheng as envoy to petition the approval of the succession from his father Shi Jinqing, who was the Pacification Commissioner of Palembang, and was given permission from the Yongle Emperor. On 7 September 1424, Zhu Gaozhi had inherited the throne as the Hongxi Emperor after the death of the Yongle Emperor on 12 August 1424. When Zheng He returned from Palembang, he found that the Yongle Emperor had died during his absence.\n\nAfter the ascension of Zhu Di's son as the Hongxi Emperor, the ocean voyages were discontinued and Zheng He was instead appointed as Defender of Nanjing, the empire's southern capital. In that post, he was largely responsible for the completion of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, an enormous pagoda still described as a wonder of the world as late as the 19th century.\n\nOn 15 May 1426, the Xuande Emperor ordered the Directorate of Ceremonial to send a letter to Zheng He to reprimand him for a transgression. Earlier, an official petitioned the emperor to reward workmen who had built temples in Nanjing. The Xuande Emperor responded negatively to the official for placing the costs to the court instead of the monks themselves, but he realized that Zheng He and his associates had instigated the official. Dreyer (2007) noted that the nature of the emperor's words indicated that Zheng He's behaviour in this situation was the last straw, but that there's too little information about what had transpired beforehand. Nevertheless, the Xuande Emperor would eventually come to trust Zheng He.\n\nIn 1430, the new Xuande Emperor appointed Zheng He to command over a seventh and final expedition into the \"Western Ocean\" (Indian Ocean). In 1431, Zheng He was bestowed with the title \"Sānbǎo Tài Jiàn\" (), using his informal name Sanbao (\"Three Treasures\") together with the title of Grand Director.\n\nOne theory is that Admiral Zheng He died in 1433. It may have happened during or shortly after the seventh voyage. Another belief is that Zheng He continued to serve as the defender of Nanjing, dying in 1435.\n\nA tomb was built for Zheng He at the southern slope of Cattle Head Hill, Nanjing. The original tomb was a horseshoe-shaped grave. It is a cenotaph believed to contain his clothes and headgear. In 1985, the tomb was rebuilt following a Muslim style.\n\nHe adopted the eldest son of his elder brother, who was awarded a hereditary officer rank in the imperial guard.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty and expanding Sino-Arab trade during the 14th century had gradually expanded Chinese knowledge of the world: \"universal\" maps previously only displaying China and its surrounding seas began to expand further and further into the southwest with much more accurate depictions of the extent of Arabia and Africa. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored seven naval expeditions. The Yongle Emperor disregarding the Hongwu Emperor's expressed wishes designed them to establish a Chinese presence and impose imperial control over the Indian Ocean trade, impress foreign peoples in the Indian Ocean basin, and extend the empire's tributary system. It has also been inferred from passages in the History of Ming that the initial voyages were launched as part of the emperor's attempt to capture his escaped predecessor, which would have made the first voyage the \"largest-scale manhunt on water in the history of China\".\n\nZheng He was placed as the admiral in control of the huge fleet and armed forces that undertook these expeditions. Wang Jinghong was appointed his second in command. Preparations were thorough and wide-ranging, including the use of such numerous linguists that a foreign language institute was established at Nanjing. Zheng He's first voyage departed 11 July 1405, from Suzhou and consisted of a fleet of 317 ships holding almost 28,000 crewmen.\n\nZheng He's fleets visited Brunei, Java, Thailand and Southeast Asia, India, the Horn of Africa, and Arabia, dispensing and receiving goods along the way. Zheng He presented gifts of gold, silver, porcelain, and silk; in return, China received such novelties as ostriches, zebras, camels, and ivory from the Swahili. The giraffe he brought back from Malindi was considered to be a \"qilin\" and taken as proof of the favor of heaven upon the administration.\n\nWhile Zheng He's fleet was unprecedented, the routes were not. Zheng He's fleet was following long-established, well-mapped routes of trade between China and the Arabian peninsula employed since at least the Han dynasty. This fact, along with the use of a more than abundant number of crew members that were regular military personnel, leads some to speculate that these expeditions may have been geared at least partially at spreading China's power through expansion. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the king of Wu sent a twenty year long diplomatic mission led by Zhu Ying and Kang Tai along the coast of Asia, which reached as far as the Eastern Roman Empire. After centuries of disruption, the Song dynasty restored large-scale maritime trade from China in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, reaching as far as the Arabian peninsula and East Africa. When his fleet first arrived in Malacca, there was already a sizable Chinese community. The \"General Survey of the Ocean Shores\" (, \"Yíngyá Shènglǎn\") composed by the translator Ma Huan in 1416 gave very detailed accounts of his observations of people's customs and lives in the ports they visited. He referred to the expatriate Chinese as \"Tang\" people (, \"Tángrén\").\n\nZheng He generally sought to attain his goals through diplomacy, and his large army awed most would-be enemies into submission. But a contemporary reported that Zheng He \"walked like a tiger\" and did not shrink from violence when he considered it necessary to impress foreign peoples with China's military might. He ruthlessly suppressed pirates who had long plagued Chinese and southeast Asian waters. For example, he defeated Chen Zuyi, one of the most feared and respected pirate captains, and returned him back to China for execution. He also waged a land war against the Kingdom of Kotte on Ceylon, and he made displays of military force when local officials threatened his fleet in Arabia and East Africa. From his fourth voyage, he brought envoys from thirty states who traveled to China and paid their respects at the Ming court.\n\nIn 1424, the Yongle Emperor died. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor (r. 14241425), stopped the voyages during his short reign. Zheng He made one more voyage during the reign of Hongxi's son, the Xuande Emperor (r. 1426–1435) but, after that, the voyages of the Chinese treasure ship fleets were ended. Xuande believed his father's decision to halt the voyages had been meritorious and thus \"there would be no need to make a detailed description of his grandfather's sending Zheng He to the Western Ocean.\" The voyages \"were contrary to the rules stipulated in the Huang Ming Zuxun\" (), the dynastic foundation documents laid down by the Hongwu Emperor:\nSome far-off countries pay their tribute to me at much expense and through great difficulties, all of which are by no means my own wish. Messages should be forwarded to them to reduce their tribute so as to avoid high and unnecessary expenses on both sides.\nThey further violated longstanding Confucian principles. They were only made possible by (and therefore continued to represent) a triumph of the Ming's eunuch faction over the administration's scholar-bureaucrats. Upon Zheng He's death and his faction's fall from power, his successors sought to minimize him in official accounts, along with continuing attempts to destroy all records related to the Jianwen Emperor or the manhunt to find him.\n\nAlthough unmentioned in the official dynastic histories, Zheng He probably died during the treasure fleet's last voyage. Although he has a tomb in China, it is empty: he was buried at sea.\n\nZheng He led seven expeditions to the \"Western\" or Indian Ocean. Zheng He brought back to China many trophies and envoys from more than thirty kingdoms – including King Vira Alakeshwara of Ceylon, who came to China as a captive to apologize to the Emperor for offenses against his mission.\n\nZheng himself wrote of his travels:\n\nWe have traversed more than 100,000 \"li\" of immense water spaces and have beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising in the sky, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds day and night, continued their course [as rapidly] as a star, traversing those savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare...\n\nZheng He's sailing charts, the Mao Kun map, were published in a book entitled the \"Wubei Zhi\" (\"A Treatise on Armament Technology\") written in 1621 and published in 1628 but traced back to Zheng He's and earlier voyages. It was originally a strip map 20.5 cm by 560 cm that could be rolled up, but was divided into 40 pages which vary in scale from 7 miles/inch in the Nanjing area to 215 miles/inch in parts of the African coast.\n\nInvestigation into folios 19V to 20R of the Mao Kun Map which covers the Indian Ocean including South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and East Africa suggests that it is a composite of four maps, one for Sri Lanka, one for South India one for the Maldives and one for around 400 km of the East African coast, no further south than 6 degrees south of the Equator. Each of these maps is positioned at a different orientation to fit with the ocean currents and winds required of a sailing chart, rather than a formal map. The analysis also suggests that Arabic-speaking pilots with a detailed knowledge of the African coast were involved in the cartography.\n\nThere is little attempt to provide an accurate 2-D representation; instead the sailing instructions are given using a 24-point compass system with a Chinese symbol for each point, together with a sailing time or distance, which takes account of the local currents and winds. Sometimes depth soundings are also provided. It also shows bays, estuaries, capes and islands, ports and mountains along the coast, important landmarks such as pagodas and temples, and shoal rocks. Of 300 named places outside China, more than 80% can be confidently located. There are also fifty observations of stellar altitude.\n\nTraditional and popular accounts of Zheng He's voyages have described a great fleet of gigantic ships, far larger than any other wooden ships in history.\n\nChinese records state that Zheng He's fleet sailed as far as East Africa. According to medieval Chinese sources, Zheng He commanded seven expeditions. The 1405 expedition consisted of 27,800 men and a fleet of 62 treasure ships supported by approximately 190 smaller ships. The fleet included:\n\nSix more expeditions took place, from 1407 to 1433, with fleets of comparable size.\n\nIf the accounts can be taken as factual Zheng He's treasure ships were mammoth ships with nine masts, four decks, and were capable of accommodating more than 500 passengers, as well as a massive amount of cargo. Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1,000 passengers in their translated accounts. Niccolò Da Conti, a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen 5 masted junks weighing about 2,000 tons. There are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as 600 feet. On the ships were navigators, explorers, sailors, doctors, workers, and soldiers along with the translator and diarist Gong Zhen.\n\nThe largest ships in the fleet, the Chinese treasure ships described in Chinese chronicles, would have been several times larger than any other wooden ship ever recorded in history, surpassing \"l'Orient\", long, which was built in the late 18th century. The first ships to attain long were 19th century steamers with iron hulls. Some scholars argue that it is highly unlikely that Zheng He's ship was in length, some estimating that they were long and wide instead while others put them as small as in length, which would make them smaller than the equine, supply, and troop ships in the fleet.\n\nOne explanation for the seemingly inefficient size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely used by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats to travel along the Yangtze for court business, including reviewing Zheng He's expedition fleet. The Yangtze river, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable by these treasure ships. Zheng He, a court eunuch, would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships, seaworthy or not. The main ships of Zheng He's fleet were instead 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons.\n\nIn the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the Yongle and Xuande Emperors' official annals was incomplete and even erroneous; other official publications omitted them completely. Although some have seen this as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages, it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions unauthorized by (and in fact, counter to) the injunctions of the dynastic founder presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty.\n\nState-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the surviving Yuan Mongols from the north. The relocation of the capital north to Beijing exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for these land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress, less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. This battle had two salient effects. First, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Second, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new Jingtai era. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor did political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the Great Wall of China. In this environment, funding for naval expeditions simply did not happen.\n\nHowever, missions from Southeast Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them: the \"History of Ming\" records imperial edicts forbidding Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years.\n\nAmong the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, Zheng He became a figure of folk veneration. Even some of his crew members who happened to stay in this or that port sometimes did as well, such as \"Poontaokong\" on Sulu. The temples of this cult called after either of his names, Cheng Hoon or Sam Po are peculiar to overseas Chinese except for a single temple in Hongjian originally constructed by a returned Filipino Chinese in the Ming dynasty and rebuilt by another Filipino Chinese after the original was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. (The same village of Hongjian, in Fujian's Jiaomei township, is also the ancestral home of Corazon Aquino.)\n\nThe oldest and most important Chinese temple in Malacca is the 17th-century Cheng Hoon Teng, dedicated to Guanyin. During Dutch colonial rule, the head of the Cheng Hoon Temple was appointed chief over the community's Chinese inhabitants.\n\nFollowing Zheng He's arrival, the sultan and sultana of Malacca visited China at the head of over 540 of their subjects, bearing ample tribute. Sultan Mansur Shah (r. 14591477) later dispatched Tun Perpatih Putih as his envoy to China, carrying a letter from the sultan to the Ming emperor. The letter requested the hand of an imperial daughter in marriage. Malay (but not Chinese) annals record that, in the year 1459, a princess named Hang Li Po or Hang Liu was sent from China to marry the sultan. The princess came with 500 high-ranking young men and a few hundred handmaidens as her entourage. They eventually settled in Bukit Cina. It is believed that a significant number of them married into the local populace, creating the descendants now known as the Peranakan. Owing to this supposed lineage, the Peranakan still use special honorifics: \"Baba\" for the men and \"Nyonya\" for the women.\n\nIndonesian Chinese have established temples to Zheng He in Jakarta, Cirebon, Surabaya, and Semarang.\n\nIn 1961, the Indonesian Islamic leader and scholar Hamka credited Zheng He with an important role in the development of Islam in Indonesia. The \"Brunei Times\" credits Zheng He with building Chinese Muslim communities in Palembang and along the shores of Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. These Muslims allegedly followed the Hanafi school in the Chinese language. This Chinese Muslim community was led by Hajji Yan Ying Yu, who urged his followers to assimilate and take local names. The Chinese trader Sun Long even supposedly adopted the son of the king of Majapahit and his Chinese wife, a son who went on to become Raden Patah. Amid this assimilation (and loss of contact with China itself), the Hanafi Islam became absorbed by the local Shafi'i school and the presence of distinctly ethnic Chinese Muslims dwindled to almost nothing. The \"Malay Annals\" also record a number of Hanafi mosques in Semarang and Ancol, for instance were converted directly into temples of the Zheng He cult during the 1460s and '70s. The Sam Poo Kong temple in Semarang was built to commemorate Zheng He's voyage to Java.\n\nIn the 1950s, historians such as John Fairbank and Joseph Needham popularized the idea that after Zheng He's voyages China turned away from the seas due to the \"Haijin\" edict and was isolated from European technological advancements. Modern historians point out that Chinese maritime commerce did not totally stop after Zheng He, that Chinese ships continued to participate in Southeast Asian commerce until the 19th century, and that active Chinese trading with India and East Africa continued long after the time of Zheng. Moreover, revisionist historians such as Jack Goldstone argue that the Zheng He voyages ended for practical reasons that did not reflect the technological level of China. Although the Ming dynasty did ban shipping with the \"Haijin\" edict, this was a policy of the Hongwu Emperor that long preceded Zheng He and the ban so obviously disregarded by the Yongle Emperor was eventually lifted entirely. However, the ban on maritime shipping did force countless numbers of people into smuggling and piracy. Neglect of the imperial navy and Nanjing dockyards after Zheng He's voyages left the coast highly vulnerable to Japanese Wokou during the 16th century.\n\nRichard von Glahn, a UCLA professor of Chinese history, commented that most treatments of Zheng He present him wrongly: they \"offer counterfactual arguments\" and \"emphasize China's missed opportunity.\" This \"narrative emphasizes the failure\" instead of the accomplishments, despite his assertion that \"Zheng He reshaped Asia.\" Glahn argues that maritime history in the 15th century was essentially the Zheng He story and the effects of his voyages.\n\nDespite the official neglect, the adventures of the fleet captured the imagination of some Chinese and novelizations of the voyages occurred, such as the \"Romance of the Three-Jeweled Eunuch\" in 1597.\n\nOn his travels, Zheng He built mosques while also spreading the worship of Mazu. He apparently never found time for a pilgrimage to Mecca but did send sailors there on his last voyage. He played an important part in developing relations between China and Islamic countries. Zheng He also visited Muslim shrines of Islamic holy men in the Fujian.\n\nIn modern times, interest in Zheng He revived substantially. In Vernor Vinge's 1999 science-fiction novel \"A Deepness in the Sky\", an interstellar society of commercial traders in human space are named the Qeng Ho after the admiral. The expeditions featured prominently in Heather Terrell's 2005 novel \"The Map Thief\". For the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages in 2005, the China's CCTV produced a special television series \"Zheng He Xia Xiyang\", starring Gallen Lo as Zheng He. He is also mentioned in part of the main storyline of the first-person shooter game Far Cry 3.\n\nZheng He built the Tianfei Palace (天妃宫, \"Tiānfēigōng\", \"Palace of the Celestial Wife\"), a temple in honor of the goddess Mazu, in Nanjing after the fleet returned from its first western voyage in 1407.\n\nThe \"Deed of Foreign Connection and Exchange\" (通番事跡) or \"Tongfan Deed Stele\" is located in the Tianfei Palace in Liuhe, Taicang, whence the expeditions first departed. The stele was submerged and lost, but has been rebuilt.\n\nIn order to thank the Celestial Wife for her blessings, Zheng He and his colleagues rebuilt the Tianfei Palace in Nanshan, Changle county, in Fujian province as well prior to departing on their last voyage. At the renovated temple, they raised a stele entitled \"A Record of Tianfei Showing Her Presence and Power\" (天妃靈應之記, \" Tiānfēi Líng Yīng zhī Jì\"), discussing their earlier voyages.\n\nThe Galle Trilingual Inscription in Sri Lanka was discovered in the city of Galle in 1911 and is preserved at the National Museum of Colombo. The three languages used in the inscription were Chinese, Tamil and Persian. The inscription praises Buddha and describes the fleet's donations to the famous Tenavarai Nayanar temple of Tondeswaram frequented by both Hindus and Buddhists.\n\nZheng He's tomb in Nanjing has been repaired and a small museum built next to it, although his body was buried at sea off the Malabar Coast near Calicut in western India. However, his sword and other personal possessions were interred in a Muslim tomb inscribed in Arabic.\n\nThe tomb of Zheng He's assistant Hong Bao was recently unearthed in Nanjing, as well.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, 11 July is Maritime Day (, \"Zhōngguó Hánghǎi Rì\") and is devoted to the memory of Zheng He's first voyage.
