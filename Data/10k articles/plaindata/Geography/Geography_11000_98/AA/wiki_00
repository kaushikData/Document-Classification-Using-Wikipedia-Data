The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, the Armenian Plateau to the east, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.\n\nTraditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea to the Armenian Highlands (Armenia Major). This region is now named and largely situated in the Eastern Anatolia Region of the far north east of Turkey and converges with the Lesser Caucasus – an area that was incorporated in the Russian Empire region of Transcaucasia in the 19th century. Thus, traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey.\n\nAnatolia is often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, which comprises almost the entire country; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the Turkish borders with neighboring Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, in clockwise direction.\n\nThe ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages, which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. Major Anatolian languages included Hittite, Luwian, and Lydian among other more poorly attested relatives. The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the early 14th and early 20th centuries. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Neo-Aramaic, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian and Greek. Other ancient peoples in the region included Galatians, Hurrians, Assyrians, Hattians, Cimmerians, as well as Ionian, Dorian, and Aeolian Greeks.\n\nThe Anatolian peninsula, also called Asia Minor, is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, the Aegean Sea to the west, and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe. The Encyclopedia Britannica defines it as \"the peninsula of land that today constitutes the Asian portion of Turkey.\"\n\nTraditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the Gulf of Alexandretta to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used, for example, in the latest edition of \"Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary\", Under this definition, Anatolia is bounded to the east by the Armenian Highlands, and the Euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter Mesopotamia. To the southeast, it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in Syria (region) and the Mesopotamian plain.\n\nFollowing the Armenian Genocide and establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the Armenian Highlands (or Western Armenia) were renamed \"Eastern Anatolia\" (literally \"The Eastern East\") by the Turkish government, being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's First Geography Congress in 1941 created two regions to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the Eastern Anatolia Region and the Southeastern Anatolia Region, the former largely corresponding to the western part of the Armenian Highland, the latter to the northern part of the Mesopotamian plain. Vazken Davidian terms the expanded use of \"Anatolia\" to apply to territory formerly referred to as Armenia as \"an historical imposition\", and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the Ottoman East as \"Eastern Anatolia\".\n\nThe oldest known reference to Anatolia – as “Land of the Hatti” – appears on Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets from the period of the Akkadian Empire (2350–2150 BC). The first recorded name the Greeks used for the Anatolian peninsula, Ἀσία (Asía), presumably echoed the name of the Assuwa league in western Anatolia. As the name \"Asia\" broadened its scope to apply to other areas east of the Mediterranean, Greeks in Late Antiquity came to use the name Μικρὰ Ἀσία (\"Mikrá Asía\") or Asia Minor, meaning \"Lesser Asia\" to refer to present-day Anatolia.\n\nThe English-language name \"Anatolia\" itself derives from the Greek (\"\") meaning “the East” or more literally “sunrise” (comparable to the Latin-derived terms \"levant\" and \"orient\"). The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring to the Aeolian, Ionian and Dorian colonies on the west coast of Asia Minor. In the Byzantine Empire, the Anatolic Theme (Ἀνατολικόν θέμα) was a \"theme\" covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day Central Anatolia Region.\n\nThe term \"Anatolia\" is Medieval Latin.\n\nThe modern Turkish form of Anatolia, \"Anadolu\", derives from the Greek name Aνατολή (\"Anatolḗ\"). The Russian male name Anatoly and the French Anatole share the same linguistic origin.\n\nIn English the name of \"Turkey\" for ancient Anatolia first appeared c. 1369. It derives from the Medieval Latin \"Turchia\" (meaning “Land of the Turks”, Turkish \"Türkiye\"), a name originally used by Europeans to designate those parts of Anatolia controlled by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum after the Battle of Manzikert (1071).\n\nHuman habitation in Anatolia dates back to the Paleolithic. Neolithic Anatolia has been proposed as the homeland of the Indo-European language family, although linguists tend to favour a later origin in the steppes north of the Black Sea. However, it is clear that the Anatolian languages, the oldest attested branch of Indo-European, have been spoken in Anatolia since at least the 19th century BC.\n\nThe earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the Mesopotamian-based Akkadian Empire during the reign of Sargon of Akkad in the 24th century BC. Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the Hattians and Hurrians. The Hattians spoke a language of unclear affiliation, and the Hurrian language belongs to a small family called Hurro-Urartian, all these languages now being extinct; relationships with indigenous languages of the Caucasus have been proposed but are not generally accepted. The region was famous for exporting raw materials, and areas of Hattian- and Hurrian-populated southeast Anatolia were colonised by the Akkadians.\n\nAfter the fall of the Akkadian Empire in the mid-21st century BC, the Assyrians, who were the northern branch of the Akkadian people, colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries BC and claimed its resources, notably silver. One of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of Kanesh, uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.\n\nUnlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in Mesopotamia, the Hittites were centred at Hattusa (modern Boğazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the Hittite language, or \"nesili\" (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of Nesa around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted Kurgan theory on the Proto-Indo-European homeland, however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European ancient Anatolians) were themselves relatively recent immigrants to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically, they would rather assimilate into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language however.\n\nThe Hittites adopted the cuneiform script, invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the Hittite New Kingdom, which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of Kizzuwatna in the south-east and the defeat of the Assuwa league in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern Syria and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal Kaskians, had established themselves there, displacing earlier Palaic-speaking Indo-Europeans. Much of the history of the Hittite Empire concerned war with the rival empires of Egypt, Assyria and the Mitanni.\n\nThe Egyptians eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the Hittites and becoming wary of the power of Assyria, which had destroyed the Mitanni Empire. The Assyrians and Hittites were then left to battle over control of eastern and southern Anatolia and colonial territories in Syria. The Assyrians had better success than the Egyptians, annexing much Hittite (and Hurrian) territory in these regions.\n\nAfter 1180 BC, during the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Hittite empire disintegrated into several independent Syro-Hittite states, subsequent to losing much territory to the Middle Assyrian Empire and being finally overrun by the Phrygians, another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the Balkans. The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.\n\nArameans encroached over the borders of south central Anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the Hittite empire, and some of the Syro-Hittite states in this region became an amalgam of Hittites and Arameans. These became known as Syro-Hittite states.\n\nIn central and western Anatolia, another Indo-European people, the Luwians, came to the fore, circa 2000 BC. Their language was closely related to Hittite. The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken—to a greater or lesser degree—across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) Wilusa (Troy), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the Hermos and/or Kaikos valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley. From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as Lydia, Caria and Lycia, all of which had Hellenic influence.\n\nFrom the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the east, central, and southeastern regions) fell to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, including all of the Syro-Hittite states, Tabal, Kingdom of Commagene, the Cimmerians and Scythians and swathes of Cappadocia.\n\nThe Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by Medes, Persians, Scythians and their own Babylonian relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was Harran in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of Babylon, the Assyrian Nabonidus and his son and regent Belshazzar. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based Median Empire, with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.\n\nFrom the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the Cimmerians and Scythians. The Cimmerians overran Phrygia and the Scythians threatened to do the same to Urartu and Lydia, before both were finally checked by the Assyrians.\n\nThe north-western coast of Anatolia was inhabited by Greeks of the Achaean/Mycenaean culture from the 20th century BC, related to the Greeks of south eastern Europe and the Aegean. Beginning with the Bronze Age collapse at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by Ionian Greeks, usurping the area of the related but earlier Mycenaean Greeks. Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek city-states were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia (Pre-Socratic philosophy).\n\nIn classical antiquity, Anatolia was described by Herodotus and later historians as divided into regions named after tribes such as Lydia, Lycia, Caria, Mysia, Bithynia, Phrygia, Galatia, Lycaonia, Pisidia, Paphlagonia, Cilicia, and Cappadocia. By that time, the populations were a mixture of the ancient Anatolian or \"Syro-Hittite\" substrate and post-Bronze-Age-collapse \"Thraco-Phrygian\" and more recent Greco-Macedonian incursions.\n\nAnatolia is known as the birthplace of minted coinage (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in Mesopotamia at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the Greek and Roman eras.\n\nDuring the 6th century BC, all of Anatolia was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, the Persians having usurped the Medes as the dominant dynasty in Iran. In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The Ionian Revolt, as it became known, though quelled, initiated the Greco-Persian Wars, which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence, alongside the withdrawal of the Persian forces from their European territories.\n\nIn 334 BC, the Macedonian Greek king Alexander the Great conquered the peninsula from the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence.\nFollowing the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the Attalids of Pergamum and the Seleucids, the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful Hellenization followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Republic, and western and central Anatolia came under Roman control, but Hellenistic culture remained predominant. Further annexations by Rome, in particular of the Kingdom of Pontus by Pompey, brought all of Anatolia under Roman control, except for the eastern frontier with the Parthian Empire, which remained unstable for centuries, causing a series of wars, culminating in the Roman-Parthian Wars.\n\nAfter the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or Byzantine Empire. Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world. Byzantine control was challenged by Arab raids starting in the eighth century (see Arab–Byzantine wars), but in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories, including even long lost territory such as Armenia and Syria (ancient Aram).\n\nIn the 10 years following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Seljuk Turks from Central Asia migrated over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim. The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced.\n\nIn 1255, the Mongols swept through eastern and central Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The Ilkhanate garrison was stationed near Ankara. After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the Mongol Empire's legacy in the region was the Uyghur Eretna Dynasty that was overthrown by Kadi Burhan al-Din in 1381.\n\nBy the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various Anatolian beyliks. Smyrna fell in 1330, and the last Byzantine stronghold in Anatolia, Philadelphia, fell in 1390. The Turkmen Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk sultans. The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the Mongol Ilkhanids. The Osmanli ruler Osman I was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s, for it bears the legend \"Minted by Osman son of Ertugul\". Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to a sovereign, it can be considered that the Osmanli, or Ottoman Turks, became formally independent from the Mongol Khans.\n\nAmong the Turkish leaders, the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman I and his son Orhan I. The Anatolian beyliks were successively absorbed into the rising Ottoman Empire during the 15th century. It is not well understood how the Osmanlı, or Ottoman Turks, came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known. The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum) from the Knights of Saint John.\n\nWith the acceleration of the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of the Russian Empire in the Caucasus, many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly Circassians, Tatars, Azeris, Lezgis, Chechens and several Turkic groups left their homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the Balkan regions and then fragmented during the Balkan Wars, much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, Albanians, Turks, Muslim Bulgarians and Greek Muslims such as the Vallahades from Greek Macedonia), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.\n\nA continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, Constantinople and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.\n\nAnatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire). During World War I, the Armenian Genocide, the Greek genocide (especially in Pontus), and the Assyrian genocide almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Many more have left Turkey since, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. Since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, Anatolia has been within Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see demographics of Turkey and history of Turkey).\n\nAnatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central massif composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded troughs, covered by recent deposits and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the Kızıl River, the coastal plains of Çukurova and the valley floors of the Gediz River and the Büyük Menderes River as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around Lake Tuz (Salt Lake) and the Konya Basin (\"Konya Ovasi\").\n\nAnatolia has a varied range of climates. The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters. The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers. The Black Sea and Marmara coasts have a temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.\n\nThere is a diverse number of plant and animal communities.\n\nThe mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia experiences humid and mild climate. There are temperate broadleaf, mixed and coniferous forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier continental climate, has deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a Mediterranean climate, contain Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions.\n\nAlmost 80% of the people currently residing in Anatolia are Turks. Kurds constitute a major community in southeastern Anatolia, and are the largest ethnic minority. Abkhazians, Albanians, Arabs, Arameans, Armenians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Bosnian Muslims, Circassians, Gagauz, Georgians, Serbs, Greeks, Hemshin, Jews, Laz, Levantines, Pomaks, Zazas and a number of other ethnic groups also live in Anatolia in smaller numbers.\n\nBamia is a traditional Anatolian-era stew dish prepared using lamb, okra and tomatoes as primary ingredients.\n\n"}

Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Persian Empire in the Parthian and Sasanian eras for over eight hundred years. Ctesiphon remained the capital of the Sasanian Empire until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD.\n\nCtesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as \"The Cities\" (Aramaic: \"Mahuza\", , \"al-Mada'in\"). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was one of the largest cities in the world.\n\nDuring the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century, its place as a political and economic center taken by the Abbasid capital at Baghdad. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.\n\nThe Latin name ' derives from Ancient Greek ' () is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as \"Tisfōn\" or \"Tisbōn\". In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as \"tyspwn\", which can be read as \"Tīsfōn\", \"Tēsifōn\", etc. in Manichaean Parthian, in Middle Persian and in Christian Sogdian (in Syriac alphabet) languages. The New Persian form is \"Tisfun\" ().\n\nTexts from the Assyrian Church of the East's synods referred to the city as ' () or some times ' () when referring to the metropolis of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.\n\nIn modern Arabic, the name is usually \"Ṭaysafūn\" () or \"Qaṭaysfūn\" () or as \"al-Mada'in\" ( \"The Cities\", referring to Greater Ctesiphon). \"According to Yāqūt [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn.\" The Armenian name of the city was \"Tizbon\" (). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the Book of Ezra of the Old Testament as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name, Cas, and a cognate of Caspian and Qazvin).\n\nCtesiphon is located approximately at Al-Mada'in, southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial Rome.\n\nThe archway of Chosroes (\"Taq Kasra\") was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD. It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of Salman Pak.\n\nCtesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by Mithridates I of Parthia. The reign of Gotarzes I saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58 BC during the reign of Orodes II. Gradually, the city merged with the old Hellenistic capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.\n\nThe reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals (Mithradatkirt, and Hecatompylos at Hyrcania) to the Scythian incursions.\n\nStrabo abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:\n\nIn ancient times Babylon was the metropolis of Assyria; but now Seleucia is the metropolis, I mean the Seleucia on the Tigris, as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the Scythian folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at Ecbatana and in Hyrcania because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.\n\nBecause of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the Roman Empire in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor Trajan captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, Hadrian, decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general Avidius Cassius captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor Septimius Severus sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.\n\nBy 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the Sasanian Empire, who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as al-Mada'in, and in Aramaic as Mahoze. The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Arabic sources is called \"the Old City\", where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace, was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Aspanbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths.\n\nThe western side was known as Veh-Ardashir (meaning \"the good city of Ardashir\" in Middle Persian), known as Mahoza by the Jews, Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the Nestorian patriarch. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was Valashabad. Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.\n\nSeverus Alexander advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by Herodian, his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against Ardashir I. In 283, emperor Carus sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. In 295, emperor Galerius was defeated outside the city. However, he returned a year later with a vengeance and won a victory which ended in the fifth and final capture of the city by the Romans in 299. He returned it to the Persian king Narses in exchange for Armenia and western Mesopotamia. In c.325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the Church of the East.\nAfter the conquest of Antioch in 541, Khosrau I built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city \"Weh Antiok Khusrau\", or literally, \"better than Antioch Khosrau built this.\" Local inhabitants of the area called the new city \"Rumagan\", meaning \"town of the Romans\" and Arabs called the city \"al-Rumiyya\". Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrau built a number of fortified cities. Khosrau I deported 292,000 citizens, slaves, and conquered people to the new city of Ctesiphon in 542.\n\nIn 590, a member of the House of Mihran, Bahram Chobin repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler Khosrau II from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrau II, with aid from the Byzantine Empire, reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrau's new winter residence, Dastagerd. In 627, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrau's son and successor, Kavadh II.\n\nIn 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper Shahrbaraz, but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrau II's daughter Borandukht. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the House of Ispahbudhan and the Parsig (Persian) faction under Piruz Khosrow.\n\nIn 636, the Muslim Arabs, who had since 633 invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in early 637.\n\nThe Muslim military officer Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas quickly seized Valashabad and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau and Veh-Ardashir. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (\"jizya\"). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the Sasanian royal family, nobles, and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops. Furthermore, the throne hall in Taq Kasra was briefly used as a mosque.\n\nStill, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the Abbasid capital at Baghdad in the 8th century, and soon became a ghost town. Caliph Al-Mansur took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast.\n\nIt is believed to be the basis for the city of Isbanir in \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\nThe ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of a major battle of World War I in November 1915. The Ottoman Empire defeated troops of Britain attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some before trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender.\n\nUnder Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch Mar Babai I, fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the Merv metropolis as pivot. The population also included Manicheans, a Dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during Umayyad rule fixing their 'patriarchate of Babylon' there. Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after the Arab capture of the metropolis. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided Ali with presents, which he, however, refused to take. After the Battle of Siffin, the Persian population of Ctesiphon disappeared. In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk road, in Samarkand.\n\nA German Oriental Society led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site. In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma'aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za'tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the University of Turin directed by Antonio Invernizzi and worked at the site, which they identified not as Ctesiphon but as Veh Ardashir. Work mainly concentrated on restoration at the palace of Khosrau II. In 2013, the Iraqi government contracted to restore the Taq Kasra, as a tourist attraction.\n\n\n\n"}

It proposes a redrawing of European borders in a way that more resembles a map of the region during the Middle Ages, including the creation of states for Basques, Bretons, and Kosovars. These regions would be designed to promote regionalism and European federalism as a replacement for nationalism, and redefine extreme European boundaries more strictly in terms of ethnically homogeneous \"authentic\" historic regions. These individually ethnically \"pure\" states would then be incorporated under a \"post-liberal-pan-European framework\".\n\nIt has been embraced by many in the far-right, such as those among the Identitarian movement and the \"Nouvelle Droite\" – the French New Right – and has been described as a \"multiculturalism of the right\", one based on exclusion, homogeneity, and ethnoregionalism. The \"Oxford Handbook of the Radical Right\" describes it as a minor exception to the radical right's preference for ethnic nationalism. Political scientist Alberto Spektorowski described it as a way for the radical-right to publicly recognize outsiders while preventing them from assimilating or gaining political power. It has also been described as a form of \"ultra-regionalism\" as a re-framing of the ultra-nationalism common to fascism.\n\nThe radical federalist concept of breaking Europe up into small self-administering regions was raised by Count Helmuth James Moltke, one of the members of the Kreisau Circle – a clandestine group which opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime – as a possible post-Nazi political system for the continent.\n\n"}

A 'geo' URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional coordinate reference system in a compact, simple, human-readable, and protocol-independent way.\n\nThe current revision of the vCard specification supports geo URIs in a vCard's \"GEO\" property, and the GeoSMS standard uses geo URIs for geotagging SMS messages. Android based devices support geo URIs, although that implementation is based on a draft revision of the specification, and supports a different set of URI parameters and query strings.\n\nA geo URI is not to be confused with the site GeoUrl (which implements ICBM address).\n\nA simple geo URI might look like:\n\nwhere the two numerical values represent latitude and longitude respectively, and are separated by a comma. They are coordinates of an horizontal grid (2D). If a third comma-separated value is present, it represents altitude; so, coordinates of a 3D grid. Coordinates in the Southern and Western hemispheres as well as altitudes below the coordinate reference system (depths) are signed negative with a leading dash. \n\nThe geo URI also allows for an optional \"uncertainty\" value, separated by a semicolon, representing the uncertainty of the location in meters, and is described using the \"u\" URI parameter.

Coordinate conversion is composed of a number of different types of conversion: format change of geographic coordinates, conversion of coordinate systems, or transformation to different geodetic datums. Geographic coordinate conversion has applications in cartography, surveying, navigation and geographic information systems.\n\nIn geodesy, geographic coordinate \"conversion\" is defined as translation among different coordinate formats or map projections all referenced to the same geodetic datum. A geographic coordinate \"transformation\" is a translation among different geodetic datums. Both geographic coordinate conversion and transformation will be considered in this article.\n\nThis article assumes readers are already familiar with the content in the articles geographic coordinate system and geodetic datum.\n\nInformally, specifying a geographic location usually means giving the location's latitude and longitude. The numerical values for latitude and longitude can occur in a number of different formats:\n\n\nThere are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, to convert from a degrees minutes seconds format to a decimal degrees format, one may use the formula\n\nTo convert back from decimal degree format to degrees minutes seconds format,\n\nwhere the notation formula_3 means take the integer part of formula_4 and is called a floor function.\n\nA coordinate system conversion is a conversion from one coordinate system to another, with both coordinate systems based on the same geodetic datum. Common conversion tasks include conversion between geodetic and ECEF coordinates and conversion from one type of map projection to another.\n\nGeodetic coordinates (latitude formula_5, longitude formula_6, height formula_7) can be converted into ECEF coordinates using the following equation:\n\nwhere\n\nand formula_10 and formula_11 are the equatorial radius (semi-major axis) and the polar radius (semi-minor axis), respectively. formula_12 is the square of the first numerical eccentricity of the ellipsoid. The \"prime vertical radius of curvature\" formula_13 is the distance from the surface to the Z-axis along the ellipsoid normal (see \"Radius of curvature on the Earth\"). The parameter formula_7 is eliminated by subtracting\nand\nso the following equation holds:\nwhere formula_18.\n\nThe orthogonality of the coordinates is confirmed via differentiation:\n\nwhere\n(see also \"Meridian arc on the ellipsoid\").\n\nThe conversion of ECEF coordinates to geodetic coordinates (such WGS84) involves more trigonometry but is sensitive to small accuracy due to Rn and h being maybe 10^6 apart, but longitude is same as geocentric, formula_21.\nThere are several methods that solve the equation; two are shown.\n\nThe following Bowring's irrational geodetic-latitude equation is efficient to be solved by Newton–Raphson iteration method:\n\nwhere formula_23 and formula_24 The height is calculated as:\n\nThe iteration can be transformed into the following calculation:\n\nwhere formula_28\n\nThe constant formula_29 is a good starter value for the iteration when formula_30. Bowring showed that the single iteration produces a sufficiently accurate solution. He used extra trigonometric functions in his original formulation.\n\nThe quartic equation of formula_31, derived from the above, can be solved by Ferrari's solution to yield:\n\nA number of techniques and algorithms are available but the most accurate according to Zhu, is the following 15 step procedure summarised by Kaplan. It is assumed that geodetic parameters formula_33 are known\n\nNote: arctan2[Y,X] is the four-quadrant inverse tangent function.\n\nFor small the power series\nstarts with\n\nTo convert from geodetic coordinates to local coordinates is a two-stage process:\n\n\nTo transform from ECEF coordinates to the local coordinates we need a local reference point, typically this might be the location of a radar. If a radar is located at formula_39 and an aircraft at formula_40 then the vector pointing from the radar to the aircraft in the ENU frame is\n\nNote: formula_5 is the \"geodetic\" latitude. A prior version of this page showed use of the \"geocentric\" latitude (formula_43). The \"geocentric\" latitude is \"not\" the appropriate \"up\" direction for the local tangent plane. If the original \"geodetic\" latitude is available it should be used, otherwise, the relationship between \"geodetic\" and \"geocentric\" latitude has an altitude dependency, and is captured by:\n\nObtaining \"geodetic\" latitude from \"geocentric\" coordinates from this relationship requires an iterative solution approach, otherwise the \"geodetic\" coordinates may be computed via the approach in the section above labeled \"From ECEF to geodetic coordinates.\"\nThe geocentric and geodetic longitude have the same value. This is true for the Earth and other similar shaped planets because their latitude lines (parallels) can be considered in much more degree perfect circles when compared to their longitude lines (meridians).\n\nNote: Unambiguous determination of formula_5 and formula_6 requires knowledge of which quadrant the coordinates lie in.\n\nThis is just the inversion of the ECEF to ENU transformation so\n\nConversion of coordinates and map positions among different map projections reference to the same datum may be accomplished either through direct translation formulas from one projection to another, or by first converting from a projection formula_49 to an intermediate coordinate system, such as ECEF, then converting from ECEF to projection formula_50. The formulas involved can be complex and in some cases, such as in the ECEF to geodetic conversion above, the conversion has no closed-form solution and approximate methods must be used. References such as the \"DMA Technical Manual 8358.1\" and the USGS paper \"Map Projections: A Working Manual\" contain formulas for conversion of map projections. It is common to use computer programs to perform coordinate conversion tasks, such as with the DoD and NGA supported GEOTRANS program.\n\nTransformations among datums can be accomplished in a number of ways. There are transformations that directly convert geodetic coordinates from one datum to another. There are more indirect transforms that convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates, transform the ECEF coordinates from one datum to the another, then transform ECEF coordinates of the new datum back to geodetic coordinates. There are also grid-based transformations that directly transform from one (datum, map projection) pair to another (datum, map projection) pair.\n\nGrid-based transformations directly convert map coordinates from one (map-projection, geodetic datum) pair to map coordinates of another (map-projection, geodetic datum) pair. An example is the NADCON method for transforming from the North American Datum (NAD) 1927 to the NAD 1983 datum. The High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN), a high accuracy version of the NADCON transforms, have an accuracy of approximately 5 centimeters. The National Transformation version 2 (NTv2) is a Canadian version of NADCON for transforming between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983. HARNs are also known as NAD 83/91 and High Precision Grid Networks (HPGN). Subsequently, Australia and New Zealand adopted the NTv2 format to create grid-based methods for transforming among their own local datums.\n\nLike the multiple regression equation transform, grid-based methods use a low-order interpolation method for converting map coordinates, but in two dimensions instead of three. The NOAA provides a software tool (as part of the NGS Geodetic Toolkit) for performing NADCON transformations.\n\nThe Molodensky transformation converts directly between geodetic coordinate systems of different datums without the intermediate step of converting to geocentric coordinates (ECEF). It requires the three shifts between the datum centers and the differences between the reference ellipsoid semi-major axes and flattening parameters.\n\nThe Molodensky transform is used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in their standard TR8350.2 and the NGA supported GEOTRANS program. The Molodensky method was popular before the advent of modern computers and the method is part of many geodetic programs.\n\nDatum transformations through the use of empirical multiple regression methods were created to achieve higher accuracy results over small geographic regions than the standard Molodensky transformations. MRE transforms are used to transform local datums over continent-sized or smaller regions to global datums, such as WGS 84. The standard NIMA TM 8350.2, Appendix D, lists MRE transforms from several local datums to WGS 84, with accuracies of about 2 meters.\n\nThe MREs are a direct transformation of geodetic coordinates with no intermediate ECEF step. Geodetic coordinates formula_51 in the new datum formula_50 are modeled as polynomials of up to the ninth degree in the geodetic coordinates formula_53 of the original datum formula_49. For instance, the change in formula_55 could be parameterized as (with only up to quadratic terms shown)\n\nwhere\n\nwith similar equations for formula_58 and formula_59. Given a sufficient number of formula_60 coordinate pairs for landmarks in both datums for good statistics, multiple regression methods are used to fit the parameters of these polynomials. The polynomials, along with the fitted coefficients, form the multiple regression equations.\n\nUse of the Helmert transform in the transformation from geodetic coordinates of datum formula_49 to geodetic coordinates of datum formula_50 occurs in the context of a three-step process:\n\n\nIn terms of ECEF XYZ vectors, the Helmert transform has the form\n\nThe Helmert transform is a seven-parameter transform with three translation (shift) parameters formula_69, three rotation parameters formula_70 and one scaling (dilation) parameter formula_71. The Helmert transform is an approximate method that is accurate when the transform parameters are small relative to the magnitudes of the ECEF vectors. Under these conditions, the transform is considered reversible.\n\nA fourteen-parameter Helmert transform, with linear time dependence for each parameter, can be used to capture the time evolution of geographic coordinates dues to geomorphic processes, such as continental drift. and earthquakes. This has been incorporated into software, such as the Horizontal Time Dependent Positioning (HTDP) tool from the U.S. NGS.\n\nTo eliminate the coupling between the rotations and translations of the Helmert transform, three additional parameters can be introduced to give a new XYZ center of rotation closer to coordinates being transformed. This ten-parameter model is called the \"Molodensky-Badekas transformation\" and should not be confused with the more basic Molodensky transform.\n\nLike the Helmert transform, using the Molodensky-Badekas transform is a three-step process:\n\nThe transform has the form\n\nwhere formula_78 is the origin for the rotation and scaling transforms and formula_79 is the scaling factor.\n\nThe Molodensky-Badekas transform is used to transform local geodetic datums to a global geodetic datum, such as WGS 84. Unlike the Helmert transform, the Molodensky-Badekas transform is not reversible due to the rotational origin being associated with the original datum.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16722133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16722133", "title": "Hajji Ahmed", "text": "Hajji Ahmed\n\nHacı Ahmet was a purported Muslim cartographer linked to a 16th-century map of the world. Ahmet appended a commentary to the map, outlining his own life and an explanation for the creation of the map. But it is not clear whether Ahmet created the map, or whether he simply translated it into Turkish for use in the Ottoman world.\n\nHacı Ahmet appended a lengthy commentary to a 16th-century map of the world annotated in the Turkish language, known as \"The Ottoman Mappa Mundi of Hacı Ahmet\", amongst other titles, which opens with \"Whoever wishes to know the true shape of the world, their minds shall be filled with light and their breast with joy.\"\n\nThe map is heart shaped, otherwise known as a \"cordiform projection,\" a style that was popular in sixteenth century Europe, and the extant copy was printed from wooden blocks in Venice, Italy, in 1559. It was kept until the late 18th century in the archives of the Venetian Council of Ten. The map is now part of the Heritage Library in the Qatar National Library.\n\nKnown as the \"Mappamondo Hacı Ahmet\", the map outlines legends and place-names in Turkish, and it may be the first map in Turkish ever published for sale to an Ottoman audience. Whether the map is original, or was simply a translation into Turkish, it helps show how the people of the Ottoman Empire perceived themselves in relation to the wider world. Three small spheres appear below the main map at the bottom of the page - the central graphic represents Earth and a number of satellite planets, while the left and right depict constellations.\n\nWithin the accompanying text of the map, Hacı Ahmet explains that the map was created to share knowledge of the shape of the world, especially of the New World. Specifically, Ahmet points out that the classical philosophers, such as Plato and Socrates, did not know about the newly discovered continent, which he says shows that the world is round. He says that the New World demonstrates the \"extent to which the Ottomans were participants in their own right in the process of physical expansion abroad and intellectual ferment at home that characterized the period of history commonly referred to as the Age of Exploration\". Ahmet also assigns the Ottoman Empire's rulers and kingdoms to the celestial bodies represented in the lower quadrant of the map, a maneuver which has been interpreted as an effort to impose a hierarchical geopolitical system that preferences Ottoman rule above all other world powers.\n\nThe map is considered unlikely to be original, and was probably translated into Turkish by Ahmet.\n\nThe map has specific European characteristics, in that it includes the use of Western terms, suggesting Ahmet translated an older map into Turkish. In fact, throughout the map’s accompanying text, Ahmet emphasizes translation, stating that he “translated it from the language and alphabet of the Europeans into that of the Muslims”. A further argument made against Ahmet's authorship is that the “heart-shaped form of the map had already been used by earlier European cartographers”.\n\nThe map is \"heart-shaped\" and is constructed by a cordioform projection developed by 16th century cartographers and mathematicians including Johannes Werner (1468-1522), a German mathematician and geographer.\n\nThe map has been tentatively linked to several other geographers, including Giovanni Battista Ramusio (1485-1557). It has also been argued that it shares similarities with a map by the French cartographer Orontius (1494-1555), published in 1534.\n\nAhmet claimed the map was made for Ottoman princes, and some of the sons of Suleyman the Magnificent were interested in maps of the world and had looked to Venice for their production. This resulted in the development of Ottoman-Venetian relations, which offered \"new interpretations of Venetian attitudes to the production of world maps for Ottoman clients\".\n\nThe map's printing in Venice helps to highlight aspects of Ottoman-Venetian relations. In the minds of Venetian publishers, it would be “a promising venture to produce a world-map for sale in the Muslim world”, and so the production of world maps was financially rewarding for European publishers. Maps in the Turkish language were in demand by the Ottoman Empire, and maps were translated into Turkish to satisfy that market.\n\nNothing is known of Hacı Ahmet himself, other than his own account of his life recorded in the map text.\n\n“I, this poor, wretched and downtrodden Hacı Ahmet of Tunis studied since I was a small child in the Maghrib, in the city of Fez\", says Ahmet in the text, which briefly describes his origins, saying that he was captured from the infidels and described how, in creating the map, he would regain his liberty.\n\nAccording to the story, Ahmet was educated in Fez, and when a European nobleman purchased him, he was able to continue to practice his Islamic religion.\n\n"}

It is a private resort leased to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., for the exclusive use of passengers of its three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara Club Cruises, until 2050. Royal Caribbean has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986, employing 300 locals, allowing another 200 to sell their wares on the premises for a fee and paying the Haitian government $12 USD per tourist. \n\nThe resort is completely tourist-oriented, and is guarded by a private security force. The site is fenced off from the surrounding area, and passengers are not allowed to leave the property. Food available to tourists is brought from the cruise ships. A controlled group of Haitian merchants are given sole rights to sell their merchandise and establish their businesses in the resort. Although sometimes described as an island in advertisements, it is actually a peninsula contiguous with the island of Hispaniola. The cruise ship moors to the pier at Labadee capable of servicing the Oasis class ships, which was completed in late 2009. \n\nAttractions include a Haitian flea market, beaches, watersports, a water-oriented playground, an alpine coaster, and the largest zip-line over water.\n\nThe location is named after the Marquis de La Badie, a Frenchman who first settled the area in the 17th century. The peninsula and a village were named Labadie. The cruise company spells the name \"Labadee\" to make it easier for English-speakers to pronounce.\n\nIn 1991, a journalist revealed that passengers who disembarked at the location were not informed they were in Haiti.\n\nIn November 2001, a crew member from the cruise line Royal Caribbean was attacked on Labadee in an apparent robbery. The assailants were arrested by Haitian police. \nIn February 2004, Royal Caribbean temporarily suspended use of the stop due to political unrest in the country. However, Royal Caribbean has since returned to using this private port.\n\nIn 2009, Royal Caribbean made US$55 million improvements to the facilities, including upgrading port facilities to allow docking of their largest cruise ships.\n\nIn January 2010, just after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Royal Caribbean decided to continue its luxury cruises to the private port. The corporation announced it would be donating US$1 million to fund relief efforts in Haiti, and to use cruise ships to ferry relief supplies and personnel.\n\nIn January 2016, local Haitians in boats peacefully but noisily blocked the port, in protests against the current Haitian government and upcoming elections. Royal Caribbean's \"Freedom of the Seas\" cancelled their port stop on January 19 as a result.\n\n"}

{"id": "33543971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33543971", "title": "Mazovia", "text": "Mazovia\n\nMazovia () is a historical region in mid-north-eastern Poland. It spans across the North European Plain, roughly between Lodz and Bialystok, with Warsaw being the unofficial capital and largest city. Throughout the centuries, Mazovia developed a separate sub-culture featuring diverse folk songs, architecture, dress and traditions different to those of other Poles. \n\nHistorical Mazovia existed from the Middle Ages until the partitions of Poland and consisted of three voivodeships with the capitals in Warsaw, Płock and Rawa. The main city of the region was Płock, however, in the Early Modern Times it lost its importance to Warsaw, which became the capital of Poland. From 1138, Mazovia was governed by a separate branch of the Piast dynasty and when the last ruler of the independent Duchy of Mazovia died, it was fully incorporated to the Polish Crown in 1526. During the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth over 20% of Mazovian population was categorized as petty nobility. Between 1816 and 1844, the Mazovian Governorate was established, which encompassed the south of the region along with Łęczyca Land and south-eastern Kuyavia. The former inhabitants of Mazovia are the Masurians, who, as Protestants, took refuge in neighboring East Prussia in the later so-called region of Masuria. \n\nThe borders of contemporary Mazovian Voivodeship (province), which was created in 1999, do not reflect exactly its original size as they don't include the historically Mazovian cities of Łomża and Łowicz, but include the Lesser Polish Radom and Siedlce.\n\nMazovia has a landscape without hills (in contrast to Lesser Poland) and without lakes (in contrast to Greater Poland). It is spread over the Mazovian Lowland, on both sides of the Vistula river and its confluence with Narew and Bug. Forests (mainly coniferous) cover one-fifth of the region, with the large Kampinos Forest, Puszcza Biała and Puszcza Zielona.\n\nIn the north Mazovia borders on the Masurian subregion of former Prussia, in the east on Podlachia, in the south on Lesser Poland and in the west on Greater Poland (subregions of Łęczyca Land, Kujawy and Dobrzyń Land). The area of Mazovia is 33,500 km. It has population of 5 million (3 million of them inhabit the metropolis of Warsaw).\n\nWhen the Slavs came to this region from the surrounding area of Polesie, they mingled with the descendants of Vistula Veneti and with other people who had settled here such as the Wielbark people. This created a Lechitic tribe: Mazovians.\n\nThe historical region of Mazovia (\"Mazowsze\") in the beginning encompassed only the territories on the right bank of Vistula near Płock and had strong connections with Greater Poland (through Włocławek and Kruszwica). In the period of the rule of the first monarchs of the Piast State, Płock was one of their seats, and on the Cathedral Hill (Wzgórze Tumskie) they raised palatium. In the period 1037–1047 it was the capital of the independent, Mazovian state of Masław. Between 1079 and 1138 this city was \"de facto\" the capital of Poland. Since 1075 it has been the seat of the diocese encompassing northern Mazovia; the south formed the archdeaconate of Czersk belonging to Poznań, and the Duchy of Łowicz was part of the Gniezno archdiocese (this division remained as long as until the Partitions of Poland).\n\nDuring the 9th century Mazovia was perhaps inhabited by the tribe of Mazovians, and it was incorporated into the Polish state in the second half of 10th century under the Piast ruler Mieszko I. In 1138 the duchy of Mazovia was established, and during the 12th and 13th centuries it joined temporarily various adjacent lands and endured invasions of Prussians, Yotvingians, and Ruthenians. To protect its northern section Conrad I of Mazovia called in the Teutonic Knights in 1226 and granted them the Chełmno Land.\n\nAfter the reunification of the Polish state by Władysław I in the early 14th century, Mazovia became its fief in 1351. In the second half of 15th century western Mazovia and in 1526/1529 the main part (with its capital in Warsaw) was incorporated into the Polish state. In the 15th century the eastern part of the region (Łomża) was settled, mainly by the yeomanry (\"drobna szlachta\"). Mazovia was considered underdeveloped in comparison with Greater Poland and Lesser Poland, with the lowest urban population.\n\nIn the Early Modern Times Mazovia was known for exporting grain, timber, and fur. It was also distinct because there was no reformation here. Mazovia was divided into three voivodeships, each of them divided into lands (, ), each of them divided into counties (, ). The Polish-Lithuanian Union of Lublin (1569) established Mazovia as the central region of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with Warsaw rising to prominence as the seat of the state legislature (\"sejm\"). In 1596 King Sigismund III Vasa moved the Polish capital from Kraków to Warsaw. During the 17th and 18th centuries Swedish, Transylvanian, Saxon, and Russian invasions wreaked havoc on the region.\n\nIn 1793 western Mazovia, and two years later the rest of the region became part of Prussia (only the south-eastern portion was annexed by Austria). In 1807 it became part of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 the region was incorporated into the Congress Kingdom of Poland, which was dependent on Russia. In the 19th century Mazovia was the site of Polish rebellions against Russian rule. In that era pre-partition Mazovia was divided among Warsaw, Płock and Augustów (the last one replaced later by Łomża).\n\nSince 1918 Mazovia has been a part of the resurrected Poland, being roughly equivalent to the Warsaw Voivodeship. Under the German occupation of Warsaw during World War II, the city’s population decreased sharply as a result of executions, the extermination of the city’s Jews, the deaths of some 200,000 inhabitants during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, and the deportation of the city’s left-bank population following the uprising. Shortly after the uprising, Adolf Hitler ordered German troops to destroy the city. The rebuilding of the Polish capital was the main task of the postwar period. Those times Warsaw Voivodeship was still roughly similar to historical Mazovia and used to be informally called so, but in 1975 it was divided into several little voivodeships. However, in 1999 Mazovian Voivodeship was created as one of 16 administrative regions of Poland.\n\nThe Mazovian language probably existed as a separate dialect until the 20th century. The ethnonym \"Mazur\" has given the name for a phonetic phenomenon known as mazurzenie (although it is common in the Lesser Polish dialect as well).\n\nThere is no specific regional cuisine of Mazovia. Formerly, dairy foods dominated the peasant cuisine. Nobles used poultry, geese, chickens, ducks. Most separate Mazovian culinary region's is Kurpie and Łowicz, where traditional dishes survive to the present day. In Kurpie traditional dishes are prepared with ingredients collected in the forest: berries, honey and mushrooms. There are several traditional Polish dishes, e.g. flaki, kluski, which are prepared in different way than in other parts of Poland.\n\nMazovian Voivodeship is ranked decidedly first in Poland according to the Gross Domestic Product. This is thanks to Warsaw, which is a financial centre of East-Central Europe. The majority of state enterprises are headquartered in this metropolis. It is a hub for both rail and vehicular traffic, with access throughout Poland and across Europe. Warsaw Chopin Airport is the nation’s busiest. There are many branches of industry and sercives well developed in this city. The other eonomical center is Płock, where large petrochemical plants PKN Orlen operate. The rest of Mazovia belongs to the poorest parts of Poland. In the agriculture the most typical Mazovian crops are potatoes and rye, but the most popular (as in whole Poland) is wheat. Others are barley, sugar beets, fruits (with their biggest Polish \"basin\" in the south of the region), and vegetables. Pigs are commonly bred, often also cows and chickens.\n\nKampinos National Park is one of Poland’s largest national parks and is popular with tourists making day trips from Warsaw to hike among the park’s primeval forests, sand dunes, and marshland. The main cultural centre of the region, and, alongside Kraków, in all of Poland, is Warsaw, which is home to dozens of theatres, the National Philharmonic, the National Opera House, the National Library, the National Museum, Centrum Nauki Kopernik, Muzeum Powstania Warszawskiego, Temple of Divine Providence, and the Sanctuary of Blessed Jerzy Popiełuszko. Warsaw has many magnificent historic buildings and monuments, including those in the Old Town and the New Town, both of which were almost completely demolished during World War II but were meticulously restored and were designated UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1980. Several important edifices has been built at the adjacent street Krakowskie Przedmieście. There are also royal palaces and gardens of Łazienki and Wilanów. The most interesting building from post-war period is Pałac Kultury i Nauki. \n\nHistorical monuments elsewhere include the manor house in Żelazowa Wola where composer Frédéric Chopin was born and his museum is located nowadays. Płock, once the seat of the Mazovian princes, and Łowicz, the residence of the archbishops of Gniezno, are noted for their cathedrals. There are also palaces and parks in Nieborów and Arkadia, the Modlin Fortress, castles in Czersk, Pułtusk, Ciechanów, Opinogóra, Rawa Mazowiecka, Sochaczew and Liw, as well as churches in Niepokalanów, Góra Kalwaria, Warka, Skierniewice, Czerwińsk, Wyszogród, Zakroczym, Szreńsk, Przasnysz, Ostrołęka, Łomża, Szczuczyn, Wizna, Brok, Zuzela, Rostkowo, and Boguszyce. Interesting folklore is found in the subregion of Kurpie; another skansen has been established in Sierpc.\n\nThe following table lists the cities in Mazovia with a population greater than 20,000 (2015):\n\n"}
{"id": "21485670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21485670", "title": "Names of Rus', Russia and Ruthenia", "text": "Names of Rus', Russia and Ruthenia\n\nOriginally, the name Rus' (Русь) referred to the people, regions, and medieval states (9th to 12th centuries) of the Kievan Rus'. In Western culture, it was better known as Ruthenia from the 11th century onwards, Its territories are today distributed among Belarus, Northern Ukraine, and the European section of Russia. The term Россия (Rossija), comes from the Byzantine Greek designation of the Rus', Ρωσσία \"Rossía\"—spelled Ρωσία (\"Rosía\" ]) in Modern Greek.\n\nOne of the earliest written sources mentioning the people called Rus' (as \"Rhos\") dates to 839 in the \"Annales Bertiniani\". This chronicle identifies them as a Germanic tribe called the Swedes. According to the Kievan Rus' \"Primary Chronicle\", compiled in about 1113, the Rus' were a group of Varangians, Norsemen who had relocated somewhere from the Baltic region (literally \"from beyond the sea\"), first to Northeastern Europe, then to the south where they created the medieval Kievan state.\nIn the 11th century, the dominant term in the Latin tradition was \"Ruscia\". It was used, among others, by Thietmar of Merseburg, Adam of Bremen, Cosmas of Prague and Pope Gregory VII in his letter to Izyaslav I. \"Rucia\", \"Ruzzia\", \"Ruzsia\" were alternative spellings.\nDuring the 12th century, \"Ruscia\" gradually made way for two other Latin terms, \"Russia\" and \"Ruthenia\". \"Russia\" (also spelled \"Rossia\" and \"Russie\") was the dominant Romance-language form, first used by Liutprand of Cremona in the 960s and then by Peter Damian in the 1030s. It became ubiquitous in English and French documents in the 12th century. \"Ruthenia\", first documented in the early 12th century Augsburg annals, was a Latin form preferred by the Apostolic Chancery of the Latin Church.\n\nThe modern name of Russia (\"Rossija\"), which came into use in the 15th century, is derived from the Greek \"Ρωσία\", which in turn derives from \"Ῥῶς\", an early Greek name for the people of Rus'.\n\nA hypothetical predecessor of Kievan Rus' is the 9th-century Rus' Khaganate, whose name and existence are inferred from a handful of early medieval Byzantine and Persian and Arabic sources that mention that the Rus' were governed by a khagan.\n\nAccording to the most prominent theory, the name Rus', like the Finnish name for Sweden (\"Ruotsi\"), is derived from an Old Norse term for \"the men who row\" (\"rods-\") as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (the rowing crews) or \"Roden\", as it was known in earlier times.\nThe name Rus' would then have the same origin as the Finnish, Estonian, Võro and Northern Sami names for Sweden: \"Ruotsi\", \"Rootsi\", \"Roodsi\" and \"Ruoŧŧa\". It is remarkable enough that the local Finnic and Permic peoples in northern Russia proper use the same (\"Rus\"-related) name both for Sweden and Russia (depending on the language): thus the Veps name for Sweden and Swedish is \"Ročinma\" / \"Ročin\", while in the neighboring Komi language the etymologically corresponding term \"Ročmu\" / \"Roč\" means already Russia and Russian instead.\n\nThe Danish scholar has pointed out that the territory of present-day Uppland, Södermanland and East Gothland in ancient times was known as \"Roðer\" or \"roðin\". Thomsen accordingly has suggested that \"Roðer\" probably derived from \"roðsmenn\" or \"roðskarlar\", meaning seafarers or rowers. Ivar Aasen, the Norwegian philologist and lexicographer, noted Norwegian dialect variants \"Rossfolk\", \"Rosskar\", \"Rossmann\".\n\nGeorge Vernadsky theoretized about the association of Rus and Alans. He claimed that \"Ruxs\" in Alanic means \"radiant light\", thus the ethnonym \"Roxolani\" could be understood as \"bright Alans\". He theorized that the name \"Roxolani\" a combination of two separate tribal names: the Rus and the Alans. Rus were closely associated with the Alans in the Sarmatian period.\n\nIn Old East Slavic literature, the East Slavs refer to themselves as \"[muzhi] ruskie\" (\"Rus' men\") or, rarely, \"\"rusichi\".\" The East Slavs are thought to have adopted this name from the Varangian elite, which was first mentioned in the 830s in the \"Annales Bertiniani\". The \"Annales\" recount that Louis the Pious's court at Ingelheim am Rhein in 839 (the same year as the first appearance of Varangians in Constantinople), was visited by a delegation from the Byzantine emperor. The delegates included two men who called themselves \"Rhos\" (\"Rhos vocari dicebant\"). Louis inquired about their origins and learned that they were Swedes. Fearing that they were spies for their brothers the Danes, he jailed them. They were also mentioned in the 860s by Byzantine Patriarch Photius under the name, \"\"Rhos\".\"\n\n\"Rusiyyah\" was used by Ahmad ibn Fadlan for Varangians near Astrakhan, and by the Persian traveler Ahmad ibn Rustah who visited Veliky Novgorod and described how the Rus' exploited the Slavs.\nWhen the Varangians arrived in Constantinople, the Byzantines considered and described the \"Rhos\" (Greek \"Ῥῶς\") as a different people from the Slavs.\n\nThe earliest written mention of the word \"Rus\" or \"Rus'ian/Russian\" appears in the \"Primary Chronicle\" under the year 912. When describing a peace treaty signed by the Varangian Oleg of Novgorod during his campaign on Constantinople, it contains the following passage, \"Oleg sent his men to make peace and sign a treaty between the Greeks and the Rus', saying thus: [...] \"We are the Rus': Karl, Inegeld, Farlaf, Veremud, Rulav, Gudi, Ruald, Karn, Frelav, Ruar, Aktevu, Truan, Lidul, Vost, Stemid, sent by Oleg, the great prince of Rus', and all those under him[.]\"\n\nLater, the Primary Chronicle tells us, they conquered Kiev and created Kievan Rus'. The territory they conquered was named after them as were, eventually, the local people (\"cf\". Normans).\n\nHowever, the Synod Scroll of the \"Novgorod First Chronicle\", which is partly based on the original list of the late 11th Century and partly on the Primary Chronicle, does not name the Varangians asked by the Chuds, Slavs and Krivichs to reign their obstreperous lands as the \"Rus'\". One can assume that there was no original mention of the Varangians as the Rus' due to the old list predating the Primary Chronicle and the Synod Scroll only referred to the Primary Chronicle if the pages of the old list were blemished.\n\nOther spellings used in Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries were as follows: \"Ruzi\", \"Ruzzi\", \"Ruzia\" and \"Ruzari\". But perhaps the most popular term to refer to the Rus' was \"Rugii\", a name of the ancient East Germanic tribe related to the Goths. Olga of Kiev, for instance, was called in the Frankish annals \"regina Rugorum\", that is, \"the Queen of the Rugi.\"\n\nA number of alternative etymologies have been suggested. These are derived from the \"anti-Normanist\" school of thought in Russian historiography during the 19th century and in the Soviet era. These hypotheses are considered unlikely in Western mainstream academia.\nSlavic and Iranian etymologies suggested by \"anti-Normanist\" scholars include:\n\nThe name \"Rus\"' may have originated from the Iranian name of the Volga River (by F. Knauer, Moscow 1901), as well as from the Rosh of Ezekiel. Prof. George Vernadsky has suggested a derivation from the Roxolani or from the Aryan term \"ronsa\" (moisture, water). River names such as Ros are common in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Russian linguist Igor Danilevsky, in his \"Ancient Rus as Seen by Contemporaries and Descendants\", argued against these theories, stating that the anti-Normanists neglected the realities of the Ancient Slavic languages and that the nation name \"Rus<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" could not have arisen from any of the proposed origins.\n\nDanilevskiy further argued that the term followed the general pattern of Slavic names for neighboring Uralic peoples—the \"Chud'\", \"Ves'\", \"Perm'\", \"Sum'\", etc.—but that the only possible word that it could be based on, \"Ruotsi\", presented a historical dead-end, since no such tribal or national name was known from non-Slavic sources. \"Ruotsi\" is, however, the Finnish name for Sweden.\nDanilevskiy shows that the oldest historical source, the \"Primary Chronicle\", is inconsistent in what it refers to as the \"Rus'\": in adjacent passages, the Rus' are grouped with Varangians, with the Slavs, and also set apart from the Slavs and Varangians. Danilevskiy suggests that the \"Rus<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" were originally not a nation but a social class, which can explain the irregularities in the \"Primary Chronicle\" and the lack of early non-Slavic sources.\n\nIn modern English historiography, Kievan Rus is the most common name for the ancient East Slavic state (usually retaining the apostrophe in \"Rus\", a transliteration of the soft sign, ь) followed by \"Kievan Rus\", \"Kievan Russia\", \"ancient Russian state\", and, extremely rarely, \"Kievan Ruthenia\". It is also called the \"Princedom\" or \"Principality of Kiev\", or just \"Kiev\".\n\nThe term \"Kievan Rus\"' was established by modern historians to distinguish the period from the 9th century to the beginning of the 12th century, when Kiev was the center of a large state.\n\nThe vast political state was subsequently divided into several parts. The most influential were, in the south, Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia and in the north, Vladimir-Suzdal and the Novgorod Republic. The southern part fell under Polish and Lithuanian influence; the northern part, under much weaker Mongol influence, went on to become a loose federation of principalities.\n\nPatriarch Callistus I of Constantinople in 1361 created two metropolitan sees with their own names (in Greek) for the northern and southern parts: respectively, (\"Megálē Rhōssía\", Great Russia) in Vladimir and Kiev and (\"Mikrà Rhōssía\", Russia Minor or Little Russia) with the centers in Galich (Halych) and Novgorodok (Navahrudak).\n\nIn the 14th-16th centuries most Russian principalities were united under the power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, once a part of Vladimir-Suzdal, and formed a large state. While the oldest endonyms of the Grand Duchy of Moscow used in its documents were \"Rus\"' () and the \"Russian land\" (), a new form of its name, \"Rusia\" or \"Russia\", appeared and became common in the 15th century. In the 1480s Russian state scribes Ivan Cherny and Mikhail Medovartsev mention Russia under the name \"Росиа\", Medovartsev also mentions \"the sceptre of Russian lordship (Росийскаго господства)\". In the following century \"Russia\" co-existed with the old name \"Rus' \" and appeared in an inscription on the western portal of the Transfiguration Cathedral of the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery in Yaroslavl (1515), on the icon case of the Theotokos of Vladimir (1514), in the work by Maximus the Greek, the \"Russian Chronograph\" written by Dosifei Toporkov (?–1543/44) in 1516–22 and in other sources.\n\nBy the 15th century, the rulers of the Grand Duchy of Moscow had reunited the northern parts of the former Kievan Rus'. Ivan III of Russia was the first local ruler to be proclaimed \"Grand Prince of all Rus'\" (similarly, see Ivan I of Moscow and the Mongol invasion of Rus'). This title was used by the Grand Dukes of Vladimir since the early 14th century, and the first prince to use it was Mikhail of Tver. Ivan III was styled by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor as and . Later, \"Rus’\" — in the Russian language specifically — evolved into the Byzantine-influenced form, \"Rossiya\" (Russia is (\"Rhōssía\") in Greek).\n\nIn 1547, Ivan IV assumed the title of “Tsar and Grand Duke of all Rus'” (Царь и Великий князь всея Руси) and was crowned on 16 January, thereby turning the Grand Duchy of Moscow into Tsardom of Russia, or \"the Great Russian Tsardom\", as it was called in the coronation document, by Constantinople Patriarch Jeremiah II and in numerous official texts, but the state partly remained referred to as \"Moscovia\" () throughout Europe, predominantly in its Catholic part, though this Latin term was never used in Russia. The two names \"Russia\" and \"Moscovia\" appear to have co-existed as interchangeable during the later 16th and throughout the 17th century with different Western maps and sources using different names, so that the country was called \"\"Russia, or Moscovia\" () or \"Russia, popularly known as Moscovia\"\" (). In England of the 16th century, it was known both as Russia and Muscovy. Such notable Englishmen as Giles Fletcher, author of the book \"Of the Russe Common Wealth\" (1591), and Samuel Collins, author of \"The Present State of Russia\" (1668), both of whom visited Russia, were familiar with the term \"Russia\" and used it in their works. So did numerous other authors, including John Milton, who wrote \"A brief history of Moscovia and of other less-known countries lying eastward of Russia\", published posthumously, starting it with the words: \"The Empire of Moscovia, or as others call it, Russia...\"\n\nIn the Russian Tsardom, the word \"Russia\" replaced the old name \"Rus' \" in official documents, though the names \"Rus\"' and \"Russian land\" were still common and synonymous to it, and often appeared in the form \"Great Russia\" (), which is more typical of the 17th century, whereas the state was also known as \"Great-Russian Tsardom\" ().\n\nAccording to historians like Alexander Zimin and Anna Khoroshkevich, the continuous use of the term \"Moscovia\" was a result of traditional habit and the need to distinguish between the Muscovite and the Lithuanian part of the Rus', as well as of the political interests of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which competed with Moscow for the western regions of the Rus'. Due to the propaganda of the Commonwealth, as well as of the Jesuits, the term \"Moscovia\" was used instead of Russia in many parts of Europe where prior to the reign of Peter the Great there was a lack of direct knowledge of the country. In Northern Europe and at the court of the Holy Roman Empire, however, the country was known under its own name, \"Russia\" or \"Rossia\". Sigismund von Herberstein, ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor in Russia, used both \"Russia\" and \"Moscovia\" in his work on the Russian tsardom and noted: \"The majority believes that Russia is a changed name of Roxolania. Muscovites (\"Russians\" in the German version) refute this, saying that their country was originally called Russia (Rosseia)\". Pointing to the difference between Latin and Russian names, French captain Jacques Margeret, who served in Russia and left a detailed description of \"L’Empire de Russie\" of the early 17th century that was presented to King Henry IV, stated that foreigners make \"a mistake when they call them Muscovites and not Russians. When they are asked what nation they are, they respond 'Russac', which means 'Russians', and when they are asked what place they are from, the answer is Moscow, Vologda, Ryasan and other cities\". The closest analogue of the Latin term \"Moscovia\" in Russia was “Tsardom of Moscow”, or “Moscow Tsardom” (), which was used along with the name \"Russia\", sometimes in one sentence, as in the name of the 17th century Russian work \"On the Great and Glorious Russian Moscow State\" ().\n\nThe southern territories of the Rus' fell under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century.\nWhile Russian descendants of the Rus' called themselves Russkiye, the residents of these lands called themselves Rusyny or Ruskiye. The name \"Ruthenia\" arises as a latinized form of the name \"Rus' \" in Western European documents at about this time.\n\nThe territories under Lithuanian rule retained the name \"Rus' \", specifically\n\nApplication of the name \"Ruthenia\" became narrowed to Carpathian Ruthenia (\"Karpats’ka Rus’\"), south of the Carpathian Mountains in the Kingdom of Hungary, where many local Slavs consider themselves \"Rusyns\". Carpathian Ruthenia incorporated the cities of Mukachevo (), Uzhhorod () and Prešov (\"Pryashiv\"; ). Carpathian Rus' had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary since 907, and had been known as \"Magna Rus'\" but was also called \"Karpato-Rus’\" or \"Zakarpattya\".\n\nIn 1654, under the Pereyaslav Agreement, the Cossack lands of the Zaporozhian Host were signed into the protectorate of the Tsardom of Russia, including the Cossack Hetmanate of Left-bank Ukraine, and Zaporozhia. In Russia, these lands were referred to as Little Russia (\"Malorossiya\"). Colonies established in lands ceded from the Ottoman Empire along the Black Sea were called Novorossiya \"New Russia\".\n\n\n"}

Novi Zagreb forms a distinct whole because it is separated from the northern part of the city both by the river and by the levees around Sava. At the same time, it is divided on urban and rural part.\n\nIt is mostly residential, consisting of blocks of flats and tower blocks that were built during the Socialist era (1945–1990). Although it is not as prestigious as downtown Zagreb, it has been praised for its good road network, public transportation connections and abundance of parks.\n\nBy 2009 administrative division it is divided into three administrative city districts (\"četvrti\"): \"Novi Zagreb - istok\" (East Novi Zagreb), \"Novi Zagreb - zapad\" (West Novi Zagreb) and \"Brezovica\".\n\nExpansion of Novi Zagreb was started by the Zagreb mayor Većeslav Holjevac, when he moved the Zagreb Fair from the downtown Savska Road to the southern bank of the Sava river in 1953. In 1957 first plans for developing Novi Zagreb were introduced, depicting what would later be known as Savski Gaj. The first complete solution for habitation with public and commercial contents was made for the neighborhood Trnsko by urbanists Zdenko Kolacio, Mirko Maretić and Josip Uhlik with horticulturist Mira Wenzler-Halambek in 1959-1960. It was followed by plans for neighborhood Zapruđe in 1962-1963, also made by Josip Uhlik.\n\nThe revitalization of Novi Zagreb began in early 2000 with numerous projects that are either completed or still ongoing. Completed projects include the construction of Arena Zagreb in the Lanište neighborhood in Novi Zagreb - zapad, along with the Arena Centar shopping and entertainment complex and the numerous adjacent new residential and commercial buildings, parks and plazas, the construction of the new building of the Museum of Modern Art, construction of the Avenue Mall shopping center, renovation of the Bundek park and lake along with the organization of the Bundekfest festival, and the construction of the \"Bundek Centar\" residential and commercial complex. Projects that are still in the planning stages are the construction of a new hospital center in Blato neighborhood, construction of a new bridge spanning the Sava river and connecting the Jarun neighborhood with Novi Zagreb, expansion of the public transportation network with new tram lines, construction of a new and larger city zoo and the construction of a new office zone with highrise buildings.\n\n"}

It served the same purpose as the later Roman itinerarium of road stops; however, the Greek navigators added various notes, which if they were professional geographers (as many were) became part of their own additions to Greek geography.\n\nThe form of the \"periplus\" is at least as old as the earliest Greek historian, the Ionian Hecataeus of Miletus. The works of Herodotus and Thucydides contain passages that appear to have been based on \"peripli\".\n\n\"Periplus\" is the Latinization of the Greek word περίπλους (\"periplous\", contracted from περίπλοος \"periploos\"), is \"a sailing-around.\" Both segments, \"peri-\" and \"-plous\", were independently productive: the ancient Greek speaker understood the word in its literal sense; however, it developed a few specialized meanings, one of which became a standard term in the ancient navigation of Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans.\n\nSeveral examples of \"peripli\" that are known to scholars:\n\n\n\nPersian sailors had long had their own sailing guide books, called \"Rahnāmag\" in Middle Persian (\"Rahnāmeh\" رهنامه in Modern Persian).\n\nThey listed the ports and coastal landmarks and distances along the shores.\n\nThe lost but much-cited sailing directions go back at least to the 12th century.

{"id": "547235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=547235", "title": "Pole of inaccessibility", "text": "Pole of inaccessibility\n\nA pole of inaccessibility with respect to a geographical criterion of inaccessibility marks a location that is the most challenging to reach according to that criterion. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline, implying a maximum degree of continentality or oceanity. In these cases, pole of inaccessibility can be defined as the center of the largest circle that can be drawn within an area of interest without encountering a coast. Where a coast is imprecisely defined, the pole will be similarly imprecise.\n\nThe northern pole of inaccessibility, sometimes known as the Arctic pole of inaccessibility, or just Arctic pole, is located on the Arctic Ocean pack ice at a distance farthest from any land mass. It lies at , from the three closest landmasses: Ellesmere Island, Komsomolets Island, and Henrietta Island. Due to constant motion of the pack ice, no permanent structure can exist at this pole.\n\nUntil a 2013 review of satellite cartography, the northern pole of inaccessibility was thought to lie at , which was away from Ellesmere, Franz-Josef Land, and the New Siberian Islands, north of Utqiagvik, Alaska, and away from the actual northern pole of inaccessibility.\n\nThe first attempt to reach this false northern pole of inaccessibility was made by Sir Hubert Wilkins, who flew by aircraft in 1927. \n\nIn 1941, the first Soviet expedition using an airplane landed 350 kilometers north of the false northern pole, thus actually becoming the first expedition to reach the real pole.\n\nIgnoring Soviet results, Sir Wally Herbert claimed to be the first to reach what was then considered to be the northern pole of inaccessibility on foot, arriving by dogsled in 1968. Explorer Jim McNeill claimed in 2006 that Herbert did not quite make the pole, and launched his own unsuccessful attempt to reach it.\n\nIn 1986, an expedition of Soviet polar scientists led by Dmitry Shparo reached the pole of inaccessibility by foot during a polar night.\n\nAs of 2010, McNeill said that no one had reached the false northern pole of inaccessibility.\n\nThe southern pole of inaccessibility is the point on the Antarctic continent most distant from the Southern Ocean. A variety of coordinate locations have been given for this pole. The discrepancies are due to the question of whether the \"coast\" is measured to the grounding line or to the edges of ice shelves, the difficulty of determining the location of the \"solid\" coastline, the movement of ice sheets and improvements in the accuracy of survey data over the years, as well as possible topographical errors.\n\nThe pole of inaccessibility commonly refers to the site of the Soviet Union research station mentioned below, which was constructed at (though some sources give ). This lies from the South Pole, at an elevation of . Using different criteria, the Scott Polar Research Institute locates this pole at .\n\nAccording to \"ThePoles.com\", the point farthest from the sea accounting only for the Antarctic land surface proper is at , and the farthest point when ice sheets are taken into account is . These points, calculated by the British Antarctic Survey, are quoted as being \"the most accurate measure available\" (as of 2005).\n\nThe southern pole of inaccessibility is far more remote and difficult to reach than the geographic South Pole. On 14 December 1958, the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition for International Geophysical Year research work, led by Yevgeny Tolstikov, established the temporary Pole of Inaccessibility Station (\"Polyus Nedostupnosti\") at . A second Russian team returned there in 1967. Today, a building still remains at this location, marked by a bust of Vladimir Lenin that faces towards Moscow, and protected as a historical site. Inside the building, there is a golden visitors' book for those who make it to the site to sign.\n\nOn 4 December 2006, Team N2i, consisting of Henry Cookson, Rupert Longsdon, Rory Sweet and Paul Landry, embarked on an expedition to be the first to reach the historic pole of inaccessibility location without direct mechanical assistance, using a combination of traditional man hauling and kite skiing. The team reached the old abandoned station on 20 January 2007, rediscovering the forgotten statue of Lenin left there by the Soviets some 48 years previously. The explorers were picked up from the spot by a plane from Vostok base, flown to Progress Base and taken back to Cape Town on the \"Akademik Fyodorov\", a Russian polar research vessel. The team found that only the bust on top of the building remained visible; the rest was buried under the snow.\n\nOn 11 December 2005, at 7:57 UTC, Ramón Hernando de Larramendi, Juan Manuel Viu, and Ignacio Oficialdegui, members of the Spanish Transantarctic Expedition, reached for the first time in history the southern pole of inaccessibility at , updated that year by the British Antarctic Survey. The team continued their journey towards the second southern pole of inaccessibility, the one that accounts for the ice shelves as well as the continental land, and they were the first expedition to reach it, on 14 December 2005, at . Both achievements took place within an ambitious pioneer crossing of the eastern Antarctic Plateau that started at Novolazerevskaya Base and ended at Progress Base after more than . This was the fastest polar journey ever achieved without mechanical aid, with an average rate of around per day and a maximum of per day, using kites as their power source.\n\nOn 27 December 2011, Sebastian Copeland and partner Eric McNair-Laundry also reached the southern pole of inaccessibility. They were the first to do so without resupply or mechanical support, departing from Novolazerevskaya Base on their way to the South Pole to complete the first East/West crossing of Antarctica through both poles, over 4,000 km.\n\nAs mentioned above, due to improvements in technology and the position of the continental edge of Antarctica being debated, the exact position of our best estimate of the pole of inaccessibility may vary. However, for the convenience of sport expeditions, a fixed point is preferred, and the Soviet station has been used for this role. This has been recognised by \"Guinness World Records\" in regard to Team N2i's expedition in 2006–2007.\n\nThe oceanic pole of inaccessibility () is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land. It lies in the South Pacific Ocean, from the nearest lands: Ducie Island (part of the Pitcairn Islands) in the north, Motu Nui (part of the Easter Islands) in the northeast, and Maher Island (near the larger Siple Island, off the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica) in the south.\n\nKnown as \"Point Nemo\", Nemo being Latin for \"no one\" and also a reference to Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, it lies more than 1,400 nautical miles from the nearest land. This point was featured in the short story, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", by H. P. Lovecraft as the location of the fictional city of R'lyeh. \n\nThe area is also known as a \"spacecraft cemetery\" because hundreds of decommissioned satellites, space stations, and other spacecraft have been deposited there upon re-entering the atmosphere to lessen the risk of hitting inhabited locations or maritime traffic. Point Nemo is relatively lifeless; its location within the South Pacific Gyre blocks nutrients from reaching the area, and being so far from land it gets little nutrient run-off from coastal waters.\n\nIn Eurasia, the Continental Pole of Inaccessibility is the place on land that is farthest from the ocean, and it lies in northwestern China, near the Kazakhstan border. \n\nEarlier calculations suggested that it is from the nearest coastline, located at , approximately north of the city of Ürümqi, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in the Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert. The nearest settlements to this location are Hoxtolgay Town at , about to the northwest, Xazgat Township () at , about to the west, and Suluk at , about to the east.\n\nHowever, the previous pole location disregards the Gulf of Ob as part of the oceans, and a recent study proposes two other locations as the ones farther from any ocean (within the uncertainty of coastline definition): EPIA1 and EPIA2 , located respectively at 2,510±10 km (1560±6 mi) and 2,514±7 km (1,562±4 mi) from the oceans. These points lie in a close triangle about the Dzungarian Gate, a significant historical gateway to migration between the East and West. EPIA2 is located near a settlement called \"K̂as K̂îr Su\" in a region named \"K̂îzîlk̂um\" (قىزىلقۇم) in the , Burultokay County.\n\nElsewhere in Xinjiang, the location in the southwestern suburbs of Ürümqi (Ürümqi County) was designated by local geography experts as the \"center point of Asia\" in 1992, and a monument to this effect was erected there in the 1990s. The site is a local tourist attraction.\n\nCoincidentally, the continental and oceanic poles of inaccessibility have a similar radius; the Eurasian poles EPIA1 and EPIA2 are about closer to the ocean than the oceanic pole is to land.\n\nIn North America, the continental pole of inaccessibility is in southwest South Dakota about north of the town of Allen, located from the nearest coastline at . The Canadian pole of inaccessibility is allegedly in Jackfish River, Alberta , a few kilometres up the Peace River from where the Jackfish River (one of six Canadian rivers of that name) flows through it.\n\nIn South America, the continental pole of inaccessibility is in Brazil at , near Arenápolis, Mato Grosso. In 2017, the Turner Twins became the first adventurers to trek to the South American Pole of Inaccessibility.\n\nIn Australia, the continental pole of inaccessibility is located either at or at , from the nearest coastline, approximately 161 km (100 miles) west-northwest of Alice Springs. The nearest town is Papunya, Northern Territory, about to the southwest of both locations.\n\nIn Africa, the pole of inaccessibility is at , from the coast, near the town of Obo in the Central African Republic and close to the country's tripoint with South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7999492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7999492", "title": "Sediment transport", "text": "Sediment transport\n\nSediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment), typically due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained. Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay; the fluid is air, water, or ice; and the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they are resting. Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in rivers, oceans, lakes, seas, and other bodies of water due to currents and tides. Transport is also caused by glaciers as they flow, and on terrestrial surfaces under the influence of wind. Sediment transport due only to gravity can occur on sloping surfaces in general, including hillslopes, scarps, cliffs, and the continental shelf—continental slope boundary.\n\nSediment transport is important in the fields of sedimentary geology, geomorphology, civil engineering and environmental engineering (see applications, below). Knowledge of sediment transport is most often used to determine whether erosion or deposition will occur, the magnitude of this erosion or deposition, and the time and distance over which it will occur.\n\n\"Aeolian\" or \"eolian\" (depending on the parsing of æ) is the term for sediment transport by wind. This process results in the formation of ripples and sand dunes. Typically, the size of the transported sediment is fine sand (<1 mm) and smaller, because air is a fluid with low density and viscosity, and can therefore not exert very much shear on its bed.\n\nBedforms are generated by aeolian sediment transport in the terrestrial near-surface environment. Ripples and dunes form as a natural self-organizing response to sediment transport.\n\nAeolian sediment transport is common on beaches and in the arid regions of the world, because it is in these environments that vegetation does not prevent the presence and motion of fields of sand.\n\nWind-blown very fine-grained dust is capable of entering the upper atmosphere and moving across the globe. Dust from the Sahara deposits on the Canary Islands and islands in the Caribbean, and dust from the Gobi desert has deposited on the western United States. This sediment is important to the soil budget and ecology of several islands.\n\nDeposits of fine-grained wind-blown glacial sediment are called loess.\n\nIn geology, physical geography, and sediment transport, fluvial processes relate to flowing water in natural systems. This encompasses rivers, streams, periglacial flows, flash floods and glacial lake outburst floods. Sediment moved by water can be larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher density and viscosity. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of sand and gravel size, but larger floods can carry cobbles and even boulders.\n\nFluvial sediment transport can result in the formation of ripples and dunes, in fractal-shaped patterns of erosion, in complex patterns of natural river systems, and in the development of floodplains.\n\nCoastal sediment transport takes place in near-shore environments due to the motions of waves and currents. At the mouths of rivers, coastal sediment and fluvial sediment transport processes mesh to create river deltas.\n\nCoastal sediment transport results in the formation of characteristic coastal landforms such as beaches, barrier islands, and capes.\n\nAs glaciers move over their beds, they entrain and move material of all sizes. Glaciers can carry the largest sediment, and areas of glacial deposition often contain a large number of glacial erratics, many of which are several metres in diameter. Glaciers also pulverize rock into \"glacial flour\", which is so fine that it is often carried away by winds to create loess deposits thousands of kilometres afield. Sediment entrained in glaciers often moves approximately along the glacial flowlines, causing it to appear at the surface in the ablation zone.\n\nIn hillslope sediment transport, a variety of processes move regolith downslope. These include:\n\nThese processes generally combine to give the hillslope a profile that looks like a solution to the diffusion equation, where the diffusivity is a parameter that relates to the ease of sediment transport on the particular hillslope. For this reason, the tops of hills generally have a parabolic concave-up profile, which grades into a convex-up profile around valleys.\n\nAs hillslopes steepen, however, they become more prone to episodic landslides and other mass wasting events. Therefore, hillslope processes are better described by a nonlinear diffusion equation in which classic diffusion dominates for shallow slopes and erosion rates go to infinity as the hillslope reaches a critical angle of repose.\n\nLarge masses of material are moved in debris flows, hyperconcentrated mixtures of mud, clasts that range up to boulder-size, and water. Debris flows move as granular flows down steep mountain valleys and washes. Because they transport sediment as a granular mixture, their transport mechanisms and capacities scale differently from those of fluvial systems.\n\nSediment transport is applied to solve many environmental, geotechnical, and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for coastal engineering. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, also referred to as the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.\n\nMovement of sediment is important in providing habitat for fish and other organisms in rivers. Therefore, managers of highly regulated rivers, which are often sediment-starved due to dams, are often advised to stage short floods to refresh the bed material and rebuild bars. This is also important, for example, in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, to rebuild shoreline habitats also used as campsites.\n\nSediment discharge into a reservoir formed by a dam forms a reservoir delta. This delta will fill the basin, and eventually, either the reservoir will need to be dredged or the dam will need to be removed. Knowledge of sediment transport can be used to properly plan to extend the life of a dam.\n\nGeologists can use inverse solutions of transport relationships to understand flow depth, velocity, and direction, from sedimentary rocks and young deposits of alluvial materials.\n\nFlow in culverts, over dams, and around bridge piers can cause erosion of the bed. This erosion can damage the environment and expose or unsettle the foundations of the structure. Therefore, good knowledge of the mechanics of sediment transport in a built environment are important for civil and hydraulic engineers.\n\nWhen suspended sediment transport is increased due to human activities, causing environmental problems including the filling of channels, it is called siltation after the grain-size fraction dominating the process.\n\nFor a fluid to begin transporting sediment that is currently at rest on a surface, the boundary (or bed) shear stress formula_1 exerted by the fluid must exceed the critical shear stress formula_2 for the initiation of motion of grains at the bed. This basic criterion for the initiation of motion can be written as:\n\nThis is typically represented by a comparison between a dimensionless shear stress (formula_4)and a dimensionless critical shear stress (formula_5). The nondimensionalization is in order to compare the driving forces of particle motion (shear stress) to the resisting forces that would make it stationary (particle density and size). This dimensionless shear stress, formula_6, is called the Shields parameter and is defined as:\n\nAnd the new equation to solve becomes:\n\nThe equations included here describe sediment transport for clastic, or granular sediment. They do not work for clays and muds because these types of floccular sediments do not fit the geometric simplifications in these equations, and also interact thorough electrostatic forces. The equations were also designed for fluvial sediment transport of particles carried along in a liquid flow, such as that in a river, canal, or other open channel.\n\nOnly one size of particle is considered in this equation. However, river beds are often formed by a mixture of sediment of various sizes. In case of partial motion where only a part of the sediment mixture moves, the river bed becomes enriched in large gravel as the smaller sediments are washed away. The smaller sediments present under this layer of large gravel have a lower possibility of movement and total sediment transport decreases. This is called armouring effect. Other forms of armouring of sediment or decreasing rates of sediment erosion can be caused by carpets of microbial mats, under conditions of high organic loading.\n\nThe Shields diagram empirically shows how the dimensionless critical shear stress (i.e. the dimensionless shear stress required for the initiation of motion) is a function of a particular form of the particle Reynolds number, formula_9 or Reynolds number related to the particle. This allows us to rewrite the criterion for the initiation of motion in terms of only needing to solve for a specific version of the particle Reynolds number, which we call formula_10.\n\nThis equation can then be solved by using the empirically derived Shields curve to find formula_5 as a function of a specific form of the particle Reynolds number called the boundary Reynolds number. The mathematical solution of the equation was given by Dey.\n\nIn general, a particle Reynolds Number has the form:\n\nWhere formula_14 is a characteristic particle velocity, formula_15 is the grain diameter (a characteristic particle size), and formula_16 is the kinematic viscosity, which is given by the dynamic viscosity, formula_17, divided by the fluid density, formula_18.\n\nThe specific particle Reynolds number of interest is called the boundary Reynolds number, and it is formed by replacing the velocity term in the Particle Reynolds number by the shear velocity, formula_20, which is a way of rewriting shear stress in terms of velocity.\n\nwhere formula_1 is the bed shear stress (described below), and formula_23 is the von Kármán constant, where\n\nThe particle Reynolds number is therefore given by:\n\nThe boundary Reynolds number can be used with the Shields diagram to empirically solve the equation\n\nwhich solves the right-hand side of the equation\n\nIn order to solve the left-hand side, expanded as\n\nwe must find the bed shear stress, formula_29. There are several ways to solve for the bed shear stress. First, we develop the simplest approach, in which the flow is assumed to be steady and uniform and reach-averaged depth and slope are used. Due to the difficulty of measuring shear stress \"in situ\", this method is also one of the most-commonly used. This method is known as the depth-slope product.\n\nFor a river undergoing approximately steady, uniform equilibrium flow, of approximately constant depth \"h\" and slope angle θ over the reach of interest, and whose width is much greater than its depth, the bed shear stress is given by some momentum considerations stating that the gravity force component in the flow direction equals exactly the friction force. For a wide channel, it yields:\n\nFor shallow slope angles, which are found in almost all natural lowland streams, the small-angle formula shows that formula_31 is approximately equal to formula_32, which is given by formula_33, the slope. Rewritten with this:\n\nFor the steady case, by extrapolating the depth-slope product and the equation for shear velocity:\n\nWe can see that the depth-slope product can be rewritten as:\n\nformula_38 is related to the mean flow velocity, formula_39, through the generalized Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, formula_40, which is equal to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor divided by 8 (for mathematical convenience). Inserting this friction factor,\n\nFor all flows that cannot be simplified as a single-slope infinite channel (as in the depth-slope product, above), the bed shear stress can be locally found by applying the Saint-Venant equations for continuity, which consider accelerations within the flow.\n\nThe criterion for the initiation of motion, established earlier, states that\n\nIn this equation,\n\nFor a particular particle Reynolds number, formula_5 will be an emprical constant given by the Shields Curve or by another set of empirical data (depending on whether or not the grain size is uniform).\n\nTherefore, the final equation that we seek to solve is:\n\nWe make several assumptions to provide an example that will allow us to bring the above form of the equation into a solved form.\n\nFirst, we assume that the a good approximation of reach-averaged shear stress is given by the depth-slope product. We can then rewrite the equation as\n\nMoving and re-combining the terms, we obtain:\n\nwhere R is the submerged specific gravity of the sediment.\n\nWe then make our second assumption, which is that the particle Reynolds number is high. This is typically applicable to particles of gravel-size or larger in a stream, and means that the critical shear stress is a constant. The Shields curve shows that for a bed with a uniform grain size,\n\nLater researchers have shown that this value is closer to\n\nfor more uniformly sorted beds. Therefore, we will simply insert\n\nand insert both values at the end.\n\nThe equation now reads:\n\nThis final expression shows that the product of the channel depth and slope is equal to the Shield's criterion times the submerged specific gravity of the particles times the particle diameter.\n\nFor a typical situation, such as quartz-rich sediment formula_55 in water formula_56, the submerged specific gravity is equal to 1.65.\n\nPlugging this into the equation above,\n\nFor the Shield's criterion of formula_51. 0.06 * 1.65 = 0.099, which is well within standard margins of error of 0.1. Therefore, for a uniform bed,\n\nFor these situations, the product of the depth and slope of the flow should be 10% of the diameter of the median grain diameter.\n\nThe mixed-grain-size bed value is formula_52, which is supported by more recent research as being more broadly applicable because most natural streams have mixed grain sizes. Using this value, and changing D to D_50 (\"50\" for the 50th percentile, or the median grain size, as we are now looking at a mixed-grain-size bed), the equation becomes:\n\nWhich means that the depth times the slope should be about 5% of the median grain diameter in the case of a mixed-grain-size bed.\n\nThe sediments entrained in a flow can be transported along the bed as bed load in the form of sliding and rolling grains, or in suspension as suspended load advected by the main flow. Some sediment materials may also come from the upstream reaches and be carried downstream in the form of wash load.\n\nThe location in the flow in which a particle is entrained is determined by the Rouse number, which is determined by the density \"ρ\" and diameter \"d\" of the sediment particle, and the density \"ρ\" and kinematic viscosity \"ν\" of the fluid, determine in which part of the flow the sediment particle will be carried.\n\nHere, the Rouse number is given by \"P\". The term in the numerator is the (downwards) sediment the sediment settling velocity \"w\", which is discussed below. The upwards velocity on the grain is given as a product of the von Kármán constant, \"κ\" = 0.4, and the shear velocity, \"u\".\n\nThe following table gives the approximate required Rouse numbers for transport as bed load, suspended load, and wash load.\n\nThe settling velocity (also called the \"fall velocity\" or \"terminal velocity\") is a function of the particle Reynolds number. Generally, for small particles (laminar approximation), it can be calculated with Stokes' Law. For larger particles (turbulent particle Reynolds numbers), fall velocity is calculated with the turbulent drag law. Dietrich (1982) compiled a large amount of published data to which he empirically fit settling velocity curves. Ferguson and Church (2006) analytically combined the expressions for Stokes flow and a turbulent drag law into a single equation that works for all sizes of sediment, and successfully tested it against the data of Dietrich. Their equation is\n\nIn this equation \"w\" is the sediment settling velocity, \"g\" is acceleration due to gravity, and \"D\" is mean sediment diameter. formula_16 is the kinematic viscosity of water, which is approximately 1.0 x 10 m/s for water at 20 °C.\n\nformula_66 and formula_67 are constants related to the shape and smoothness of the grains.\n\nThe expression for fall velocity can be simplified so that it can be solved only in terms of \"D\". We use the sieve diameters for natural grains, formula_68, and values given above for formula_16 and formula_70. From these parameters, the fall velocity is given by the expression:\n\nIn 1935, Filip Hjulström created the Hjulström curve, a graph which shows the relationship between the size of sediment and the velocity required to erode (lift it), transport it, or deposit it. The graph is logarithmic.\n\nÅke Sundborg later modified the Hjulström curve to show separate curves for the movement threshold corresponding to several water depths, as is necessary if the flow velocity rather than the boundary shear stress (as in the Shields diagram) is used for the flow strength.\n\nThis curve has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity \"deceleration\" and erosion is caused by flow \"acceleration\". The dimensionless Shields diagram is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers.\n\nFormulas to calculate sediment transport rate exist for sediment moving in several different parts of the flow. These formulas are often segregated into bed load, suspended load, and wash load. They may sometimes also be segregated into bed material load and wash load.\n\nBed load moves by rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves at a small fraction of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.\n\nBed load transport rates are usually expressed as being related to excess dimensionless shear stress raised to some power. Excess dimensionless shear stress is a nondimensional measure of bed shear stress about the threshold for motion.\n\nBed load transport rates may also be given by a ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress, which is equivalent in both the dimensional and nondimensional cases. This ratio is called the \"transport stage\" formula_73 and is an important in that it shows bed shear stress as a multiple of the value of the criterion for the initiation of motion.\n\nWhen used for sediment transport formulae, this ratio is typically raised to a power.\n\nThe majority of the published relations for bedload transport are given in dry sediment weight per unit channel width, formula_75 (\"breadth\"):\n\nDue to the difficulty of estimating bed load transport rates, these equations are typically only suitable for the situations for which they were designed.\n\nThe transport formula of Meyer-Peter and Müller, originally developed in 1948, was designed for well-sorted fine gravel at a transport stage of about 8. The formula uses the above nondimensionalization for shear stress,\n\nand Hans Einstein's nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width\n\nTheir formula reads:\n\nTheir experimentally determined value for formula_80 is 0.047, and is the third commonly used value for this (in addition to Parker's 0.03 and Shields' 0.06).\n\nBecause of its broad use, some revisions to the formula have taken place over the years that show that the coefficient on the left (\"8\" above) is a function of the transport stage:\n\nThe variations in the coefficient were later generalized as a function of dimensionless shear stress:\n\nIn 2003, Peter Wilcock and Joanna Crowe (now Joanna Curran) published a sediment transport formula that works with multiple grain sizes across the sand and gravel range. Their formula works with surface grain size distributions, as opposed to older models which use subsurface grain size distributions (and thereby implicitly infer a surface grain sorting).\n\nTheir expression is more complicated than the basic sediment transport rules (such as that of Meyer-Peter and Müller) because it takes into account multiple grain sizes: this requires consideration of reference shear stresses for each grain size, the fraction of the total sediment supply that falls into each grain size class, and a \"hiding function\".\n\nThe \"hiding function\" takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause \"equal mobility\", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones. As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the \"equal mobility\" portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.\n\nTheir model is based on the transport stage, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with several grain sizes simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each grain size class, formula_84, to be equal to a \"reference shear stress\", formula_85.\n\nThey express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, formula_86 (with the \"formula_87\" indicating nondimensionality and the \"formula_88\" indicating that it is a function of grain size):\n\nformula_90 is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class formula_91 per unit channel width formula_75. formula_93 is the proportion of size class formula_91 that is present on the bed.\n\nThey came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, formula_95. For formula_96:\n\nand for formula_98:\n\nThis equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of formula_86 as formula_95 becomes large.\n\nIn 2002, Peter Wilcock and Kenworthy T.A. , following Peter Wilcock (1998), published a sediment bed-load transport formula that works with only two sediments fractions, i.e. sand and gravel fractions. Peter Wilcock and Kenworthy T.A. in their article recognized that a mixed-sized sediment bed-load transport model using only two fractions offers practical advantages in terms of both computational and conceptual modeling by taking into account the nonlinear effects of sand presence in gravel beds on bed-load transport rate of both fractions. In fact, in the two-fraction bed load formula appears a new ingredient with respect to that of Meyer-Peter and Müller that is the proportion formula_93 of fraction formula_103 on the bed surface where the subscript formula_104 represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction. The proportion formula_93, as a function of sand content formula_106, physically represents the relative influence of the mechanisms controlling sand and gravel transport, associated with the change from a clast-supported to matrix-supported gravel bed. Moreover, since formula_106 spans between 0 and 1, phenomena that vary with formula_106 include the relative size effects producing ‘‘hiding’’ of fine grains and ‘‘exposure’’ of coarse grains.\nThe ‘‘hiding’’ effect takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility\", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones. As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.\n\nTheir model is based on the transport stage,\"i.e.\" formula_95, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with only two fractions simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each of the two grain size classes, formula_85, where formula_104 represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction . The critical shear stress that represents the incipient motion for each of the two fractions is consistent with established values in the limit of pure sand and gravel beds and shows a sharp change with increasing sand content over the transition from a clast- to matrix-supported bed.\n\nThey express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, formula_86 (with the \"formula_87\" indicating nondimensionality and the ‘‘formula_88’’ indicating that it is a function of grain size):\n\nformula_90 is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class formula_91 per unit channel width formula_75. formula_93 is the proportion of size class formula_91 that is present on the bed.\n\nThey came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, formula_95. For formula_122:\n\nand for formula_124:\n\nThis equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of formula_86 as formula_95 becomes large and the symbols formula_128 have the following values:\nIn order to apply the above formulation, it is necessary to specify the characteristic grain sizes formula_131 for the sand portion and formula_132 for the gravel portion of the surface layer, the fractions formula_133 and formula_134 of sand and gravel, respectively in the surface layer, the submerged specific gravity of the sediment R and shear velocity associated with skin friction formula_135 .\n\nFor the case in which sand fraction is transported by the current over and through an immobile gravel bed, Kuhnle \"et al.\"(2013), following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011), provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle \"et al.\" (2013) applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula to their experimental data and found out that predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became near the top of the gravel layer. They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured sand bed load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula was larger than that available for transport within the gravel bed because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.\nTo overcome this mismatch, following Pellachini (2011), they assumed that the variability of the bed shear stress available for the sand to be transported by the current would be some function of the so-called \"Roughness Geometry Function\" (RGF), which represents the gravel bed elevations distribution. Therefore, the sand bed load formula follows as:\nwhere \nthe subscript formula_138 refers to the sand fraction, s represents the ratio formula_139 where formula_140 is the sand fraction density, formula_141 is the RGF as a function of the sand level formula_142 within the gravel bed, formula_143 is the bed shear stress available for sand transport and formula_144 is the critical shear stress for incipient motion of the sand fraction, which was calculated graphically using the updated Shields-type relation of Miller \"et al.\"(1977)formula_145.\n\nSuspended load is carried in the lower to middle parts of the flow, and moves at a large fraction of the mean flow velocity in the stream.\n\nA common characterization of suspended sediment concentration in a flow is given by the Rouse Profile. This characterization works for the situation in which sediment concentration formula_146 at one particular elevation above the bed formula_147 can be quantified. It is given by the expression:\n\nHere, formula_149 is the elevation above the bed, formula_150 is the concentration of suspended sediment at that elevation, formula_151 is the flow depth, formula_152 is the Rouse number, and formula_153 relates the eddy viscosity for momentum formula_154 to the eddy diffusivity for sediment, which is approximately equal to one.\n\nExperimental work has shown that formula_153 ranges from 0.93 to 1.10 for sands and silts.\n\nThe Rouse profile characterizes sediment concentrations because the Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling under the weight of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.\n\nBed material load comprises the bed load and the portion of the suspended load that is sourced from the bed.\n\nThree common bed material transport relations are the \"Ackers-White\", \"Engelund-Hansen\", \"Yang\" formulae. The first is for sand to granule-size gravel, and the second and third are for sand though Yang later expanded his formula to include fine gravel. That all of these formulae cover the sand-size range and two of them are exclusively for sand is that the sediment in sand-bed rivers is commonly moved simultaneously as bed and suspended load.\n\nThe bed material load formula of Engelund and Hansen is the only one to not include some kind of critical value for the initiation of sediment transport. It reads:\n\nwhere formula_158 is the Einstein nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width, formula_159 is a friction factor, and formula_6 is the Shields stress. The Engelund-Hansen formula is one of the few sediment transport formulae in which a threshold \"critical shear stress\" is absent.\n\nWash load is carried within the water column as part of the flow, and therefore moves with the mean velocity of main stream. Wash load concentrations are approximately uniform in the water column. This is described by the endmember case in which the Rouse number is equal to 0 (i.e. the settling velocity is far less than the turbulent mixing velocity), which leads to a prediction of a perfectly uniform vertical concentration profile of material.\n\nSome authors have attempted formulations for the total sediment load carried in water. These formulas are designed largely for sand, as (depending on flow conditions) sand often can be carried as both bed load and suspended load in the same stream or shoreface.\n\n"}

{"id": "5427586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5427586", "title": "Strahler number", "text": "Strahler number\n\nIn mathematics, the Strahler number or Horton–Strahler number of a mathematical tree is a numerical measure of its branching complexity.\n\nThese numbers were first developed in hydrology by and ; in this application, they are referred to as the Strahler stream order and are used to define stream size based on a hierarchy of tributaries. They also arise in the analysis of L-systems and of hierarchical biological structures such as (biological) trees and animal respiratory and circulatory systems, in register allocation for compilation of high-level programming languages and in the analysis of social networks. Alternative stream ordering systems have been developed by Shreve and Hodgkinson et al. A statistical comparison of Strahler and Shreve systems, together with an analysis of stream/link lengths, is given by Smart.\n\nAll trees in this context are directed graphs, oriented from the root towards the leaves; in other words, they are arborescences. The degree of a node in a tree is just its number of children. One may assign a Strahler number to all nodes of a tree, in bottom-up order, as follows:\nThe Strahler number of a tree is the number of its root node.\n\nAlgorithmically, these numbers may be assigned by performing a depth-first search and assigning each node's number in postorder.\nThe same numbers may also be generated via a pruning process in which the tree is simplified in a sequence of stages, where in each stage one removes all leaf nodes and all of the paths of degree-one nodes leading to leaves: the Strahler number of a node is the stage at which it would be removed by this process, and the Strahler number of a tree is the number of stages required to remove all of its nodes. Another equivalent definition of the Strahler number of a tree is that it is the height of the largest complete binary tree that can be homeomorphically embedded into the given tree; the Strahler number of a node in a tree is similarly the height of the largest complete binary tree that can be embedded below that node.\n\nAny node with Strahler number \"i\" must have at least two descendants with Strahler number \"i\" − 1, at least four descendants with Strahler number \"i\" − 2, etc., and at least 2 leaf descendants. Therefore, in a tree with \"n\" nodes, the largest possible Strahler number is log \"n\" + 1. However, unless the tree forms a complete binary tree its Strahler number will be less than this bound. In an \"n\"-node binary tree, chosen uniformly at random among all possible binary trees, the expected index of the root is with high probability very close to log \"n\".\n\nIn the application of the Strahler stream order to hydrology, each segment of a stream or river within a river network is treated as a node in a tree, with the next segment downstream as its parent. When two first-order streams come together, they form a second-order stream. When two second-order streams come together, they form a third-order stream. Streams of lower order joining a higher order stream do not change the order of the higher stream. Thus, if a first-order stream joins a second-order stream, it remains a second-order stream. It is not until a second-order stream combines with another second-order stream that it becomes a third-order stream. As with mathematical trees, a segment with index \"i\" must be fed by at least 2 different tributaries of index 1. Shreve noted that Horton’s and Strahler’s Laws should be expected from any topologically random distribution. A later review of the relationships confirmed this argument, establishing that, from the properties the laws describe, no conclusion can be drawn to explain the structure or origin of the stream network.\n\nTo qualify as a stream a hydrological feature must be either recurring or perennial. Recurring (or \"intermittent\") streams have water in the channel for at least part of the year. The index of a stream or river may range from 1 (a stream with no tributaries) to 12 (globally the most powerful river, the Amazon, at its mouth). The Ohio River is of order eight and the Mississippi River is of order 10. Estimates are that 80% of the streams on the planet are first to third order headwater streams.\n\nIf the bifurcation ratio of a river network is low, then there is a higher chance of flooding, as the water will be concentrated in one channel rather than spread out, as a higher bifurcation ratio would indicate. The bifurcation ratio can also show which parts of a drainage basin are more likely to flood, comparatively, by looking at the separate ratios. Most British rivers have a bifurcation ratio of between 3 and 5.\n\nThe Strahler numbering may be applied in the statistical analysis of any hierarchical system, not just to rivers.\n\nWhen translating a high-level programming language to assembly language the minimum number of registers required to evaluate an expression tree is exactly its Strahler number. In this context, the Strahler number may also be called the register number.\n\nFor expression trees that require more registers than are available, the Sethi–Ullman algorithm may be used to translate an expression tree into a sequence of machine instructions that uses the registers as efficiently as possible, minimizing the number of times intermediate values are spilled from registers to main memory and the total number of instructions in the resulting compiled code.\n\nAssociated with the Strahler numbers of a tree are \"bifurcation ratios\", numbers describing how close to balanced a tree is. For each order \"i\" in a hierarchy, the \"i\"th bifurcation ratio is\nwhere \"n\" denotes the number of nodes with order \"i\".\n\nThe bifurcation ratio of an overall hierarchy may be taken by averaging the bifurcation ratios at different orders. In a complete binary tree, the bifurcation ratio will be 2, while other trees will have smaller bifurcation ratios.It is a dimensionless number.\n\nThe pathwidth of an arbitrary undirected graph \"G\" may be defined as the smallest number \"w\" such that there exists an interval graph \"H\" containing \"G\" as a subgraph, with the largest clique in \"H\" having \"w\" + 1 vertices. For trees (viewed as undirected graphs by forgetting their orientation and root) the pathwidth differs from the Strahler number, but is closely related to it: in a tree with pathwidth \"w\" and Strahler number \"s\", these two numbers are related by the inequalities\nThe ability to handle graphs with cycles and not just trees gives pathwidth extra versatility compared to the Strahler number.\nHowever, unlike the Strahler number, the pathwidth is defined only for the whole graph, and not separately for each node in the graph.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "751489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=751489", "title": "Summit", "text": "Summit\n\nA summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it. Mathematically, a summit is a local maximum in elevation. The topographic terms \"acme\", \"apex\", \"peak\", and \"zenith\" are synonymous.\n\nThe term \"\" is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered \"subsummits\" (or \"subpeaks\") of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top.\nSummit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.\n\nThe highest summit in the world is Everest with height of 8844.43 m above sea level (29,029 ft). The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. They reached the mountain`s peak in 1953. The UIAA definition is that a summit is independent if it has a prominence of or more; it is a mountain if it has a prominence of at least . This can be summarised as follows:\n\nIn many parts of the western United States, the term \"summit\" refers to the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad. For example, the highest point along Interstate 80 in California is referred to as Donner Summit and the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit.\n\nA summit climbing differs from the common mountaineering. Summit expedition requires: 1+ year of training, a good physical shape, and a special gear. Although a huge part of climber’s stuff can be left and taken at the base camps or given to porters, there is a long list of personal equipment. In addition to common mountaineers’ gear, Summit climbers need to take Diamox (anti-altitude sickness medication), masks, and bottles of oxygen. There are also special requirements for crampons, ice axe, rappel device, clothing, etc.\n\n\n"}

The Planetworkshops were created in 2006 by Eric Bazin(founder of \"Satelight\") and George J. Gendelman (former Director of the New York Times and of the International Herald Tribune).\n\nThe Planetworkshops encourage intellectual innovation in order to question societies and develop practical solutions to social, environmental, cultural and economic issues.\n\nThe purpose of the Planetworkshops is to challenge the life of ideas, encourage intellectual innovation and produce expertise to accompany the long term vision of decision makers. Definitely turned towards action, the Planetworkshops also focus on the development of successful and useful experiences and spread good practices in order to favor necessary changes towards sustainable models.\n\nThe Planetworkshops gather politicians, scientists, experts, economists, medias and NGOs in order to guide decision making towards sustainable development and rebuild new societal models.\n\nEric Bazin is a French journalist and founder of \"Satelight\", a consulting and photographic production company. He regurlarly collaborates with European press trusts, such as Paris-Match, GEO, Sunday Times, National Geographic, Airone, and is actively involved in the organisation of photography exhibitions with UNESCO.\n\nGeorge J. Gendelman, American, is the former manager of the international operations of the \"New York Times Syndication Sales\" and former circulation director of the \"International Herald Tribune\"; he founded and still manages the \"International Press Syndicate\" in 1990, a consulting agency dedicated to media strategy and copyright management for international media groups.\n\nConstant provider of solutions for change, the Planetworkshops initiate multi-actors and trans-disciplinary working commissions gathering qualified and recognized experts.\nThese working commissions prepare synthesis notes composed of concrete and realistic proposals to the attention of political and economic decisions-makers. By this work, the Planetworkshops wish to help deepen the debate around very complex topics.\nThe results of these works are presented during the Planetworkshops’ Global Conference in Evian, France.\nSince 2011, six working commissions were undertaken by the Planetworkshops:\n\n- \"Internationalizing the social entrepreneurship model\", in partnership with SOS Group;\n\n- \"Social and environmental responsibility: transforming businesses governance\", in partnership with ;\n\n- \"Mediation as a Solution to Environmental Dispute\"s, in partnership with ;\n\n- “How to reinvent the model of international negotiations on climate change?\", exclusively composed from students issued from school and universities world-wide;\n\n- \"Crossed views on genetic biodiversity resources and their equal sharing\", in partnership with Orée;\n\n- \"What conditions for the emergence of a \"Blue Society\"?\", in partnership with Green Cross France and Territories\n\nYou can find all the publications of Planetworkshops here: Publications and Resources Planetworkshops\n\n« La Revue de la Terre » is a French geopolitical publication on environmental issues, sustainable development and mutation of societies. This French publication was launched by the Planetworkshops, on the occasion of the third edition of the Global Conference.\nThis now quarterly confidential letter is addressed to opinion leaders, elected officials, local authorities, industry, SMEs with growth envisaged through this new economic challenge. Its geopolitical axis analyses the different levers of industry but also highlights mainstream players and initiatives that will shape tomorrow.\nLa Revue de la Terre n°3\n\nIn order to highlight the important trends of a world in transition and to show that the sheer breadth of sustainable development does not exclude prioritizing essential actions, the Planetworkshops, in collaboration with Pricewaterhouse Coopes (PwC), have written this annual report to the use of decision makers. This review is the result of an annual analysis of the progress in the knowledge and understanding of threats to sustainability. It will serve as a guide to ensure the continuity of long-term policies.\nThis report adopts an economical approach combining:\n- An analysis of the situation and the global geopolitical and economic trends favoring progress towards greater sustainability.\n- A global and thematic summary of the major international sustainable development conferences.\n\nThroughout this report, PwC and the Planetworkshops’ have attempted to give perspective and legibility to the multiple issues that must be identified by the decision makers of the 21st century. They must show that they are conscious of the increasing scarcity of the resources for an ongoing increase of human kind.\n\nThe GC 2011 White Book highlights the most important moments of the Planetworkshops' Global Conference.\nThe White book issued from the VIth edition of the Global Conference (September 2011)was part of the documents that contributed to the UN preparation for the 2012 Earth Summit (Rio+20).\n\nThe \"Global Conference – International Forum for a Sustainable Development\", is an international forum which gathers annually decision-makers and opinion leaders committed for a sustainable development. In a few years, the Global Conference has become a major international meeting, gathering during three days more than 900 actors from 70 countries involved in the change for a sustainable society.\nBusiness managers, entrepreneurs, government officials, public authorities, leaders of NGOs and associations, intellectuals, researchers, experts, artists, media and representatives of civil society meet to think together the solutions needed to build a new model of development, more responsible and respectful of humans and the environment. \nIn a friendly and unique atmosphere, \"Planetworkers\" meet to exchange and share their good practices, to highlight innovative initiatives and to participate in the transformation of society.\n\nThe Planetworkshops spread their actions in Morocco and organize the first edition of the \"Global Conference - Rabat Round\", on the 16th and 17 May 2011.\nInternational implementation of the Global Conference abroad, the \"Rabat Round\" tries to preserve an interdisciplinary approach and deals with the specific stakes and challenges of Morocco and in its region. The Planetworkshops maintain their identity: a friendly place of reflection on sustainable development issues and the necessary transformations of our societies; a platform of diverse actors; a transverse approach and the presentation of concrete and existing solutions.\nIn many respects, Morocco is a leader in sustainable development and the country represents today a real open-air laboratory of this new model of development. Renewable energies, conservation of natural resources, smart cities, sustainable mobility, waste management, sustainable agriculture or responsible tourism, are some of the local stakes which were discussed in Rabat in May 2012.\n\nThe green growth and its economic, social and human development potential, central themes of the next Rio+20 Conference, will therefore be at the heart of the reflection.\n\nParticipants from over more than 30 countries come to assert their peculiarity and their desire of a sustainable development applied with ambition to their respective territories, to share good practices and duplicate them all over the world.\n\nThe Planetworkshops is creating a global network of companies and committed organizations, or having begun a process towards sustainability. S.U.N is a network of exchanges which bases its activities on the collection, the treatment and the circulation of information corresponding to precise criteria.\nInformation is designed on the basis of good practices, actions and initiatives, already involved, with innovative potential, which implement social and environmental responsibility and/or sustainable development, and which produce results even if they are experimental.\n\nThe world awareness of the depletion of natural resources and the consequences of the climate change impose a strengthening of the legislation and a progressive change of behaviors. These two phenomena establish opportunities for Green Business for the whole world and of course for Africa specifically. \nThe objective of these three days conference is to combine growth opportunities; sharing experiences and fight against poverty, through Green Economy. This will lead to structure the point of view of Central Africa’s private sector on the way to Rio+ 20 Conference.\n\nThe Rethink Awards stimulate economic growth and innovation through implementable and viable business models by rewarding small companies, students and young journalists who invent and testify of new economic models to face the major challenges of sustainable development today. They will have successfully found a way to turn an important issue of our time into an opportunity of development.\nThe aim of the Rethink Awards is to identify, analyze and value the development of companies striving to find new paths to efficiently respond to the actual issues (global warming, rarefaction of natural resources, social disequilibrium, etc.)\nThey encourage the commitment of the private sector towards a sustainable development, both in OECD and non-OECD countries.\nThey invite students to be creative, to think differently and to dare new business models carrying solutions for change and for the future. \nThey stimulate young journalists to highlight innovations and trends that could revolutionize our economic models, to reflect on the transformation or crucial issues into opportunities of development and to integrate the new techniques of information and communication in this perspective.\n\n\"Meaning and sustainable development\" mobilizes the reflection on the meaning of our actions and our daily commitments in favor of a responsible development.\n\nCrises are consecutive; sustainable development is slowing down, and all because the meaning of actions is not always clear. Promoting exchanges between individuals sensitive to the core values of sustainable development, these meetings aim to make evolve companies and the economy’s vision for a practical and effective mobilization.\n\nBetween sharing experiences and ideas for action through individuals which were able to implement responsible practices, the first edition of \"Meaning and sustainable development\" was held on the 2nd and 3 December 2011 at the Bourdaisière castle in Montlouis-sur-Loire (France), an active laboratory of sustainable development.\n\nThe association \"Edurable\" was created to encourage the establishment of programs dedicated to education for sustainable development in sensitive areas - Priority Education Zones especially in the suburbs of large French cities. It enjoys the support of the Prefecture of Paris and the Ile-de-France to identify geographic areas and populations of young recipients of these experiments.\n\nEducation for sustainable development in sensitive areas and the suburbs is to strengthen the educational component of a comprehensive policy for sustainable development in particular towards people excluded from its scope. This results in the realization of field experiences to an audience of children in primary, middle and high schools.\nNew Technologies of Information and Communication (ICT) are the preferred tool to achieve these initiatives.\nIn this context the association Edurable, with the support of the Prefecture of Paris and IBM France, has launched \"Imagine your town tomorrow” for children from 5 to 7 years. This program aims to promote education for Sustainable Development through ICTs and to bring the perspective of these children on their vision of the city, first in Paris.\n\nOver 1.4 billion people in the world lack access to electricity. Inadequate lighting is not only an impediment to progress and development opportunities, but also has a direct impact on the health, environment, and safety of millions of people,etc. \nRecognizing the need to change this, TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute) with its commitment to creating innovative solutions for a better tomorrow, has undertaken since 2007 an initiative of 'Lighting a Billion Lives' (LaBL) through the use of solar lighting devices to replace kerosene lamps and paraffin candles, and thereby providing opportunities for livelihoods both at the individual and village level. Indeed, bringing clean and affordable sources of lighting into the lives of people facilitates education of children, provides better illumination and kerosene-smoke-free indoor environment for women to do household chores, and has many environmental and socio-economic co-benefits.\n\nLaBL has since 2007 been developed to benefit many more people around the world. It is now in the process of expanding to the African continent, with pilot projects in Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Uganda, Malawi, Kenya, Ethiopia and Mozambique. TERI and Planetworkshops are joining hands in the endeavor of also bringing LaBL into the lives of the villagers of Niger.\n\nThe Planetworkshops opened in May 2011 a center in Niamey (Niger). In Partnership with Point Afrique solidarités and the Pierre Rabhi Foundation, the Planetworkshops initiate a training center in agroecology located 150 km away from Niamey, at the Hotel La Tapoa. This center aims to help farmers free themselves from extensive financial charges created by the annual purchase of input locations and allow them to improve their yield while protecting biodiversity, their productions and their crops.\n\nThe DESS \"Woman, Water and Health\" will be the only one existing on this topic in Togo and Francophone West Africa. It currently involves Burkina Faso, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal and Togo. This Planetworkshops’ chair was founded with the Bolloré Group.\n\nThis chair aims to promote an integrated system of research activities, education, information and documentation in the fields of exact science, natural and human sciences, society science and computer science.\nIt facilitates collaboration between high level researchers, internationally well-known professors of the university and other educational institutions in Togo, and in the sub-regions of West Africa. \nThe objectives of this chair are the re-enforcement of national capacities by assuring equality between gender, equality of rights and equal opportunities and treatment in the field of science, of technology and of development.\n\nFor 6 years now, 60 photographs, taken by authors coming from worldwide are exhibited at Courchevel. This exhibition is seen each year by more than a million visitors. The photographs aim to emphasize the beauty and fragility of the environment. The last edition highlighted the environmental treasures of South Africa.\n\n"}

The Portuguese, English, and later on, the Dutch were the ones to trade with the Mughal empire. As the first Islamic power on the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal empire was more interested in assimilating the land, studying the history, customs and religion of the people occupying this area, and communicating with the other two Islamic empires – the Saffavid and the Ottoman Empires. \nThe Mughal empire was blessed with very strong leaders, however, very different in approach and strategy. Akbar was known for his tolerance towards unorthodox Muslims and Hindus. The Akbarnama, a book written by Abu’l Fazl on the life and rule of Akbar, gives a lot of evidence on how Hinduism was viewed and explained by the Muslims. Along with being tolerant towards his Hindu and Muslim subjects, Akbar welcomed Portuguese Jesuits, which allowed Portugal to enter the trade with Indian goods. At the very end of his rule, the British, Dutch, and Portuguese started trade with the Mughal empire as well. Even though the trade started during the reign of Akbar the Great, his son Jahangir was the one to strengthen this economic activity in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe English and Dutch were granted 21-year permission of monopoly in the “East Indies”, which followed by the retorted answer from the Indian landlords – they encouraged the establishment of coastal posts for trade. Half a century afterwards, the competition for trade in the Indian Ocean was enhanced by the setting up of the British East India Company in 1664. It followed Jean-Baptiste Colbert's theory of Mercantilism that claimed to keep the national exports greater than the imports. In his Memorandum on English Alliances and Memorandum to the King on Finances written in 1669 and 1670 respectively, Jean-Baptiste Colbert defended his theory and tried to figure out a way of how to undercut the Dutch trade. This document gave evidence on the strength of the Netherlands’ trade in the 17th century not only in India but also in the Caribbean. Moreover, it gave the precise numbers of the Dutch superiority over both the British and the French – 15,000 to 16,000 vessels per year versus 3,000 to 4,000 for the British and 500 to 600 for the French. The British managed to increase the trade with textile with 22.7 million square meters over a period of just twenty years. They did that in the same year that France intervened in the Indian trade.\n\nOne of the items traded was alcohol drinks. During Babur’s and Jahangir’s reign the trade was especially directed towards alcohol exchange. It probably was the same during the rest of the Great Mughals' reigns but the autobiographies and court chronicles had very little information about this issue. Moreover, these sources cannot be very reliable because the emperors reviewed them. However, there are records and journals written by individuals that were either travelling or were members of the Mughal court, which strongly suggest the overuse of alcohol and its social connection within the people and castes. The Great Mughals were not only connoisseurs of alcohol, they were often overusing it, too. Jahangir died of alcohol abuse. Alcohol was also considered a gift of goodwill, especially between sailors and merchants. Evidence of that were the records and journals of the British East India company. Its employees often requested for wine supply for themselves and for gifts for the monarch. It was used not only for special occasions but also as a regular act of just revering the emperor. Jahangir was the emperor who was the most associated to alcohol but all the rest of the Great Mughals appreciated it too, with the exception of Aurangzeb (who loathed it). Wine and alcohol in general was as well used for negotiations and, was therefore a very important part of the trading process.\n\nThe trade in India was implemented mainly on the coast. During the 17th century there were two big countries.\n\nTwo and a half centuries of trade between India and Western Europe led to the downfall of an initially agriculturally-orientated empire with strong military forces and tolerance towards its subjects and their different religious beliefs (with the exception of Aurangzeb). All three Islamic empires found either their collapse or a significant weakening by the 19th century. European countries, however, were growing, expanding, developing, coming up with new movements, inventions, technology. Even though they were essentially separated by the Ottoman and Safavid empire, the common interest, the trade, helped Europe to permanently settle into the Indian lands. The most comprehensive and clear sources about the Mughal empire were the factory records of the British East India company, which suggests that trade was the only way of communication between Western Europe and the Mughal empire. The trade was carried out by the same countries, only there were variations of the proportion of import for those countries, depending on what was going on at that time in Europe and on the alliances the countries tight themselves into. The pattern of Globalization and World entanglement was traced in 17th century through trade. This way the European countries found their place in the Mughal empire, gradually gaining more power over the trade and, consequently, over the empire until the British colonized the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century.\nThe European language was primarily spread amongst coastal regions, in particular large trading centres and sometimes throughout big commercial towns which were based inland.\n\nPrimary Sources:\nAndrea, Alfred J. and James H.
