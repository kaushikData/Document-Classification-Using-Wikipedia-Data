{"id": "987107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=987107", "title": "Buenaventura River (legend)", "text": "Buenaventura River (legend)\n\nThe non-existent Buenaventura River, alternatively San Buenaventura River, Río Buenaventura, etc. was once believed to run from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean through the Great Basin region of what is now the western United States. The river was chronologically the last of several imagined incarnations of an imagined Great River of the West which would be for North America west of the Rockies what the Mississippi River was east of the Rockies. The hopes were to find a waterway from coast to coast, sparing the traveling around Cape Horn at the tip of South America.\n\nIn 1776, two Franciscan missionaries Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante sought to find a land route between Santa Fe in Nuevo México to Monterey in Alta California. They were part of what has become known as the Dominguez–Escalante Expedition, a ten-man expedition including Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco (Meira) acting as the cartographer. On September 13, they encountered what is now called the Green River, a southward-flowing tributary of the Colorado and named it \"San Buenaventura\" after the catholic saint Bonaventure.\n\nAt that point in time, there was nothing mythical about the Buenaventura River. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante' journal correctly notes that above their crossing, the river flowed toward the west. It flowed generally southwest where they crossed it and continued southwest as they traveled in its vicinity. Escalante also correctly recorded that after its junction with the Rio San Clemente (today's White River? – which he also named) the Buenaventura River turned to the south. So, the original Buenaventura River is real and exists today under a different name.\n\nAfter establishing contact with a branch of the Ute (Yutahs) Tribe on the south shore of what they called Lake Timpanogos (various spellings), now called \"Utah Lake,\" the expedition turned south-southwest. On September 29, they were surprised to come upon a river (the Sevier River) flowing from the south-southeast and turning toward the west at the point they encountered it. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante noted in their journal that the Native American name for this river suggested it was the same river they had named Buenaventura. They expressed doubts it was the same river because had it been so, it was substantially smaller downstream than it had been upstream-the opposite of the normal pattern. They named this river the Rio San Ysabel. The Native Americans told them it flowed west from there into a lake (Sevier Lake) and beyond. The Sevier Lake has no outlet, the indigenes may have been referencing the west-flowing Humboldt River which originates over 150 miles northwest, and were misinterpreted by the explorers.\n\nDespite Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante's doubts that the Green and Sevier Rivers were one and the same, the maps Miera produced do not include the Rio San Ysabel and depicts the Buenaventura flowing southwest from where they encountered it in northeastern Utah, to the Sevier Lake in west-central Utah. In an accompanying note to king Charles III of Spain, Miera recommended building several missions in the area and mentioned the possibility of a water way to the Pacific Ocean, via the Buenaventura or the Timpanogos River; the river Miera depicts on his map as flowing west from the Great Salt Lake (GSL). Although Miera documented a correct description of the GSL given to them by the indigenes the Spanish assumed that what they thought had been described was incorrect and interpreted their description of the \"extremely salty\" lake as the ocean and assumed the description of the river flowing from \"Lake Timpanogos\" which is the Jordan River flowing between Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, as a waterway to the Pacific.\n\nThe error of depicting the Buenaventura as flowing southwest to a lake was perpetuated by early explorers and cartographers such as Alexander von Humboldt, who used a map from the Dominguez and Escalanté expedition to prepare his maps in 1804 and 1809. and Zebulon Pike used Humboldts maps to prepare his map for his book from 1810 Aaron Arrowsmith in 1814 published a map depicting the Buenaventura flowing to \"Lac Sale\". These cartographers conservatively did not try to chart the area west of that explored by Dominguez and Escalante.\n\nThere had long been a hope that a river flowing west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean would provide an easy route for travel and trade. This dream was the descendant of the long sought Northwest Passage. When Francisco Garcés drew his maps of Alta California, he did not understand the nature of the Sierra Nevada, and he drew the \"San Felipe\" or San Joaquin River heading (originating) beyond the Sierras in the Great Basin to the Pacific Ocean, in or near San Francisco Bay. Then, when Manuel Augustin Mascaro and Miguel Constanso made the first map of the whole Viceroyalty of New Spain (1784), they extended the \"San Felipe\" almost to the Sevier Lake. A similar map was published in 1820 by Sidney E. Morse showing the Rio de San Buenaventura flowing into a lake, the western limits of which are unknown. This map shows the \"Supposed river between the Buenaventura and the Bay of Francisco, which will probably be the communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific\" toward this lake, but quite not connecting with it. A map by J. Finlayson (1822) shows a Rio de S. Buenaventura originating near the \" source of the Rio Colorado\" and emptying into a salt lake the western limits of which \"are unknown\". This same map indicates that an uncharted Rio de San Filipe crosses a range of mountains at 122 degrees west longitude.\n\nOther cartographers began to boldly assert that rivers flowed from Lake Timpanogos and \"Lac Salado\" to the Pacific Ocean. Henry S. Tanner's influential map of 1822 shows the Buenaventura River flowing from the north central Rockies through the Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean south of Monterey Bay. This map also shows two rivers flowing from Lake Timpanogos, (Utah Lake) one to San Francisco Bay (the R. Timpanogos), the other to Port Orford, Oregon (the Los Mongos R.) where the Rogue River enters the Pacific. A similar map by Anthony Finley was published in 1826 A map by Thomas Bradford (1835) shows a river flowing to San Francisco Bay (mislabeled Sir Francis Drake) from the south end of Lake Timpanogos. There is no reference to Rio de San Buenaventura. An 1844 map by James Bowden shows a landlocked Buenaventura wrapping around the southeast side of a \"doubtful\" Lake Timpanogos.\n\nThe Great Salt Lake (GSL) was first seen and reported as very saline by white North Americans in 1824, apparently independently by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Upon learning of the GSL, explorers began equating Lake Timpanogos on the maps with it, and apparently unaware of the fact that saline lakes such as the Great Salt and Sevier Lakes have no outlets; began efforts to find the rivers flowing from them west to the Pacific as promised by maps such as Tanner's.\n\nIn 1825, William H. Ashley attempted to float the Green (Buenaventura) River to either what was called \"Salt Lake\" (actually Sevier Lake) on Tanner's map, or the Colorado River, to which the fur traders suspected it flowed. He started in present-day Wyoming, and after passing through the treacherous Gates of Lodore, aborted the trip prior to entering Desolation Canyon. Despite not having gotten close to the Colorado River, he concluded that the Green did empty into it, and continued his exploration by engaging Provost to lead him on an overland excursion to observe the GSL. The next spring his partner, Jedediah Smith, explored areas the north and west of the GSL, but found no rivers flowing from it. He sent more men to float around the shoreline to the west and south, and they were also unsuccessful in finding the \"Los Mongos R.\" and \"R. Timpanogos\". However, this information was delayed in reaching cartographers, and in 1836 Tanner repeated the depictions of the three rivers, except he identified the \"R. Timpanogos\" as \"R. S. Sacramento ou (or) Timpanogos\". So, when, in 1841, John Bidwell embarked over the Rocky Mountains to California, he was advised to take carpenters tools with them, to build canoes and sail from the GSL to the Pacific.\n\nAfter Ashley retired from the fur trade his partnership with Smith was bought out by Smith and two new partners, Smith focused on finding the Buenaventura. In 1826, he led an expedition south from southern Idaho, and upon reaching the mouth of the Jordan River on the southeast end of the GSL, traveled south along to the east side of Utah Lake. Since he identified the Jordan River as the outlet of Utah Lake, he did not explore the lake further. He encountered the Sevier River on its northeast-flowing stretch, and assuming it continued to flow north to Utah Lake, dismissed it as the possible Buenaventura and continued southwest to Southern California. In 1827 and 1828 he tracked the western flank of the Sierra Nevada in its full length, without registering a river that passed through the range, but he heard the Sacramento River referenced as the \"Buenaventura\" by Luis Antonio Argüello. A map by Albert Gallatin (1836), based on information from Smith's travels, labels the Sacramento River as the Buenaventura and equated Lake Timpanogos with the GSL, but did not try to connect the two.\n\nIn the spring of 1827, Daniel Potts, a fur trader in the employ of Smith, encountered the Sevier River downstream from the point Smith had the previous summer. He continued to follow the river downstream to the Sevier Lake, which he confirmed was a saline lake, but did not try to circumvent it to find an outlet. He instead followed the entire course of the river upstream to its head. \n\nThe Buenaventura River's existence or non-existence was a matter of controversy until 1843, when John Charles Frémont, with Thomas Fitzpatrick and Kit Carson as scouts, led a perilous expedition from the Columbia River to Sacramento, California via the Sierra Nevada. By that time the fact that the Buenaventura River did not flow from the headwaters of the Colorado/Green River was well established among the trappers and guides, but maps continued to show it and other rivers flowing from the region of Great Salt Lake to the sea. On January 27, 1844 at Walker River, he briefly believed himself to have found the mythical river, but it was the result of a faulty measurement. Two days later he discovered his mistake and definitively proved that the Buenaventura did not exist. Upon later finding the Salinas River flowed into the Pacific at about the same point the maps depicted the mouth of the Buenaventura, Frémont concluded that it was the source of the legend and applied the name \"Rio San Buenaventura\" to it.\n\nAfter Frémont established that no rivers flowed across the Great Basin region to the Pacific, President Polk was reluctant to accept his conclusion. However, after the premise was accepted that no east to west waterway flowed across the interior of the western United States, Frémont and his father-in-law and political sponsor, Senator Thomas Hart Benton, directed their ambitions to a transcontinental railway, which was completed in 1869, after the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the American Civil War.\n\n"}
{"id": "947550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=947550", "title": "Burgan field", "text": "Burgan field\n\nThe Burgan field is an oil field situated in the desert of southeastern Kuwait. Burgan field can also refer to the Greater Burgan—a group of three closely spaced fields, which includes Burgan field itself as well as the much smaller Magwa and Ahmadi fields. Greater Burgan is the world's largest sandstone oil field, and the second largest overall, after Ghawar. The burgan Field is bordered by the Persian gulf which played a huge part in the creation of this prominent reservoir formation many million years ago.\n\nA natural surface oil seep above the Burgan field was known to humankind since neolithic time, bituminous material from a reed boat discovered in As-Sabiyah/North Kuwait and dated 5000 BC have been traced back to this seep.(Connan et al., 2005)\nThe subsurface reservoirs of the Burgan oil field were discovered in February, 1938. The US and UK-owned Kuwait Oil Company began commercial oil production at Burgan in 1946.\n\nThe Greater Burgan, a wider area around Burgan, is the world largest sandstone (clastic) oil field with the total surface area of about 1000 km. To put that into perspective, that is about 11,000 football fields. It includes three producing subfields: Burgan itself (500 km), Magwa (180 km) and Ahmadi (140 km). The Burgan field's structure is an anticlinal dome having an elliptical shape and transected by numerous radial faults. Both Magwa and Ahmadi are located on smaller, subsidiary domes north of Burgan \n\nThe oil is contained in the four main horizons of Cretaceous age: Wara (sandstone), Mauddud (limestone), Burgan Third Sand (3S) and Burgan Fourth Sand (4S). Burgan Third Sand is in turn subdivided into Third Sand Upper (3SU), Third Sand Middle (3SM) and Third Sand Lower (3SL). Historically the production has come mainly from the 3SM unit. By 1992 the second and third sand units had been swept by water.\n\nThe Burgan Oil Field is made up of three main subsurface structures known as the Magwa, Ahmadi, And Burgan formation.The deeper reservoirs, namely the Lower Cretaceous Ratawi and Minagish limestones and the Jurassic Marrat Formation also contain significant oil reserves but are less substantial. The Magwa and Ahmadi formation are separated from the Burgan formation by a normal fault cutting horizontally down through the whole structure. This is known as the Burgan Graben. The role of tectonic stresses that have affected this region in Mesozoic and Cenozoic times also play a part in mcuh of the faultings seen in the formation. Looking closer at the Burgan field the formation is made up of several radial faults that help trap the petroleum content in the formation. These faults and the Burgan graben are what cause the compartmentalization of the reservoir. This compartmentalization makes for great petroleum play and holds it in place well over a long period of time. The source rock that caps this formation is known as the Mauddad Limestone.( the above diagrams help give you a better visual on the formation as a whole)\n\nThe Paleo environment of the Greater Burgan Field suggest the field began constructing in the lower and upper Burgan sand based on a fluvial system accommodated by transgressive coastline movements over time. Following the Burgan Formation, the Mauddud Limestone Formation (source Rock) began forming. The Mauddud formation is made up of shallow marine, bioclast wackestone, grainstone, and shoal surrounded by lagoonal dolomite. Lastly, the Wara formation is created by a fluvial system exposed to bio clastic dolomite known as the wara shales. These shales were formed during the falling RSL. Finishing the Wara formation the fluvial valleys are filled with tidal estuaries caused by transgressive and RSL high stand. The formation is capped off by the Ahmadi Cap rock.\n\nAttempts to find deeper oil plays have been made. In 1951 discovery of the Berriasian-age Minagish Oolite Limestone in Burgan was made along with the Jurassic carbonate at Magwa and both proved to be holding oil. However, production did not make way from these subsurface discoveries.\n\n\"The reserves and production data for Burgan are shrouded in a cloud of secrecy, uncertainty, and controversy.\" \n\nBurgan's total potential production of recoverable oil has been estimated as between 66 and 75 billion barrels, plus perhaps 70 trillion cubic ft. of natural gas.Bloomberg estimated remaining reserves of 55 billion barrels as of 2005. Cumulative production through 1996 was estimated by a consulting firm at around 28 billion barrels of oil. \n\nBurgan's production capacity stood at in 2005. It was the fourth most productive oilfield worldwide in 2013, per \nOil Patch Asia. This was lower than it had been in the past—it reached as high as in 1972. The actual oil production from the field in 2005 was between 1,300,000 and 1,700,000 barrels per day. The International Energy Agency then predicted an output of in 2020 and in 2030. In 2005, the Kuwait Oil Co. estimated a remaining life of 30 to 40 years for Burgan, at a production rate of about 1.7 million barrels a day.\n\nIn 2010 the Chief Executive of the Kuwait Oil Company said that Burgan produced half of Kuwait’s oil.\n\nThe possibilities of deeper plays below the known Burgan oil & gas resource appear to be under-explored.\n\nIn 1991, retreating Iraqi soldiers set Burgan Field on fire during the 1st Gulf War. Smoke plumes from the Greater Burgan oil field extended 50 kilometers in width on any given day, and 2.5 km thick. From satellite observations the plume appeared like a black snake in the desert that extended parallel to the Persian Gulf. The Red Adair Service and Marine Company extinguished 117 of the burning well fires, while the Canadian company Safety Boss set the pace with 180 wells extinguished. Declassified 1991 CIA documents claimed that despite the destruction there was no significant depletion of the oil reserves and drop in production capacity at Burgan field. Three gathering stations were, however, too badly damaged to repair.\n\nThe 1st Marine Division destroyed 60 Iraqi tanks in a battle that took place near the Burgan oil field.\n\n\n"}

Flowing through the municipalities of Järfälla, Stockholm, Sundbyberg, and Solna, it empties in the bay Bällstaviken, the innermost part of Ulvsundasjön.\n\nSome 1,4 km of the stream is passing through culverts and long stretches of it have been straitened out to form part of the local stormwater system. Notwithstanding, other sections are furnished with promenades and ponds and therefore considered as of local recreational interest. The municipalities sharing the catchment area, together with the county administrative board, are collaborating to improve water quality and the areas surrounding the stream.\n\nFlowing from Viksjö in Järfälla, the stream starts as a ditch receiving considerable amounts of stormwater from the residential area Jakobsberg. After a bit more than 2 km, near Barkarby Airport, it dives into a short culvert before merging with another ditch (\"Veddsta dike\") bringing water from a golf range, industrial and residential areas. It then passes under the traffic route E18 to continue 1 km through am open grassland in it natural meandering shape past some allotment-gardens near Tensta before reaching the ponds in the park of Hjulsta. The stream is guided under the central commercial district of Spånga through a tunnel 1.4 km long, opening out near Bromsten industrial area, and receiving stormwater from surrounding areas. It then flows past the residential neighbourhood Bällsta before reaching two ponds in a park and receiving water from a second ditch (Nälsta dike) bringing water from residential areas at Nälsta, Flysta, and Solhem. It then flows through the harness racing track Solvalla where the water is used for fountains during races. Downstream Solvalla, it becomes broad with a slow flow occasionally becoming stagnant. Bällstaån finally receives water from Rissne, Duvbo, and Sundbyberg before emptying into Bällstaviken under the bridge Löfströmsbron.\n\nAs most of the inflow comes from settled grounds, including industrial areas and streets, the stream contains high levels of nutrients, metals and bacteria, with sediments contaminated with oil. The river receives 1400 kg/year of phosphorus and 16000 kg/year of nitrogen. Increased levels of pollutants and bacteria downstream Spånga is believed to stem from stormwater pipes but no source have been identified. Increased levels of metals, particularly copper, has been reported, and minor oil discharges are rather common with negative impact on local bird life.\n\nNo inventory of aquatic plants has been made, but greater dodder has been documented around the Lunda Industrial Area. No rare species of bottom fauna were found during an inventory in 1999, the stream being quantitatively dominated by a few species. Noteworthy is the gastropod \"Valvata piscinalis\" found near the residential area Bällsta. The stream is, nonetheless, important for various birds, including black-headed gull, common gull, lesser black-backed gull, herring gull, and Slavonian grebe reported at Hjulsta Water Park. As stretches of the watercourse remain ice-free during winters, it attracts ducks and teal, which have both been spending winters here.\n\n\n"}

Along with the Beidou navigation system, GNGC provides independent intellectual property rights, globally applicable standards and global navigation trellis code.\n\nFrom 2009-2013 a research team (the Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS School of Earth and Space Science located at Peking University), in conjunction with Wuhan University, Information Engineering University, Chinese University of Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, completed the National 973 Project: \"Global Spatial Information Subdivision Theory and Application Method\". As a result of this effort, the team proposed a global subdivision grid frame: Geographic Coordinate Subdivision Grid With One Dimension Integer Coding on 2 Tree (GeoSOT). This work solved the three scientific problems with regards to spatial data organization : basic frame, location code and presentation model.\n\nThis work resulted in 28 patent applications. The results of the project were published in a work entitled: \"Introduction to Spatial Information Subdivision\". \n\nGeoSOT, is a grid system that originates from a center point on earth and climbs to another point at 50,000 km altitude. It subdivides the earth according to 32 levels into millions of grids 1 cm in size. The team proposed a complete area location coding system called \"1+4 basic code, N serial extended codes\". Above these codes, the global subdivision grid code is a basic one and it has been completed.\n\nGNGC is part of research on Global Sub-division Grid (GSG, or global discrete grid, geographic grid or spatial information grid). It subdivides the earth's surface into small cells. The research of GSG covers the methods of how to subdivide the earth into cells of equal size and shape at different levels. GSG improves the proficiency of the spatial information presentation and data organization. GSG is one of the key methods in geo-information science.\n\nMain applications include geographic spatial data fusion, multi-source data fusion and geo-science comprehensive analysis.\n\nIt can mark location and position elements on a grid. The truing number coding design can simplify location area identification, expression and calculation.\n\n"}

The name \"Invar\" comes from the word \"invariable\", referring to its relative lack of expansion or contraction with temperature changes.\n\nIt was invented in 1896 by Swiss physicist Charles Édouard Guillaume. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1920 for this discovery, which enabled improvements in scientific instruments.\n\nLike other nickel/iron compositions, Invar is a solid solution; that is, it is a single-phase alloy, consisting of around 36% nickel and 64% iron.\n\nCommon grades of Invar have a coefficient of thermal expansion (denoted α, and measured between 20 °C and 100 °C) of about 1.2 × 10 K (1.2 ppm/°C), while ordinary steels have values of around 11–15 ppm. Extra-pure grades (<0.1% Co) can readily produce values as low as 0.62–0.65 ppm/°C. Some formulations display negative thermal expansion (NTE) characteristics. Though it displays high dimensional stability over a range of temperatures, it does have a propensity to creep.\n\nInvar is used where high dimensional stability is required, such as precision instruments, clocks, seismic creep gauges, television shadow-mask frames, valves in engines, antimagnetic watches, and large aerostructure molds. \n\nIn land surveying, when first-order (high-precision) elevation leveling is to be performed, the level staff (leveling rod) used is made of Invar, instead of wood, fiberglass, or other metals. Invar struts were used in some pistons to limit their thermal expansion inside their cylinders.\nIn the manufacture of large composite material structures for aerospace carbon fibre layup molds, invar is used to facilitate the manufacture of parts to extremely tight tolerances.\n\nThere are variations of the original Invar material that have slightly different coefficient of thermal expansion such as:\n\nA detailed explanation of Invar's anomalously low CTE has proven elusive for physicists.\n\nAll the iron-rich face-centered cubic Fe–Ni alloys show Invar anomalies in their measured thermal and magnetic properties that evolve continuously in intensity with varying alloy composition. Scientists had once proposed that Invar's behavior was a direct consequence of a high-magnetic-moment to low-magnetic-moment transition occurring in the face centered cubic Fe–Ni series (and that gives rise to the mineral antitaenite); however, this theory was proven incorrect. Instead, it appears that the low-moment/high-moment transition is preceded by a high-magnetic-moment frustrated ferromagnetic state in which the Fe–Fe magnetic exchange bonds have a large magneto-volume effect of the right sign and magnitude to create the observed thermal expansion anomaly.\n\n\n"}

The indentation allows gardeners to add uncooked vegetable scraps, greywater, and manure into a composting basket that sits in the center of the bed. In this way, composting materials can be added to the basket throughout the growing season to provide nutrients for the plants. The upper layer of soil is hilled up against the center basket so the soil slopes gently down from the center to the sides. Most keyhole gardens rise about one meter above the ground and have walls made of stone. The stone wall not only gives the garden its form, but helps trap moisture within the bed. Keyhole gardens originated in Lesotho and are well adapted to dry arid lands and deserts. In Africa they are positioned close to the kitchen and used to raise leafy greens such as lettuce, kale, and spinach; herbs; and root crops such as onions, garlic, carrots, and beets. Keyhole gardens are ideal for intensive planting, a technique in which plants are placed close together to maximize production. Plants with wide reaching root systems such as tomatoes and zucchini may not perform well in a keyhole garden.\n\nThe keyhole garden was developed in Lesotho by the Consortium for Southern Africa Food Security Emergency (C-SAFE), based upon a design that originated with CARE in Zimbabwe. In the mid-1990s Lesotho had one of the highest AIDS/HIV rates in the world. C-SAFE designed the keyhole garden for people who suffered from AIDS or were otherwise unable to tend a traditional garden. They are tall enough that people don’t have to bend over while working in them; sturdy enough that a person who is weak can lean against them while they work; and are small enough that the entire bed is within arm’s reach. The garden is constructed using layers of compost, manure, wood ash and other nutrient rich materials so they are more productive than most home gardens; and they hold water making them drought resistant. The walls can be made of common stones picked up from a field, cinderblocks, bricks, or any material strong enough to hold in the soil. Clean water is used when watering the plants on the surface, while household greywater is poured down into the compost basket.\nWhile they are designed for people who were too sick to tend a traditional garden, because they were so productive, people in good health started building them as kitchen gardens. Here the family could grow its high value crops using succession planting. In the end C-SAFE helped build over 20,000 keyhole gardens, and when they returned a couple of years later, more than 90% were still in use. Today keyhole gardens are found in many places throughout Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Sudan, and Nigeria.\n\nAfrican style keyhole gardens have been built in Texas and other places in the US. The Texas Master Gardeners Association has put on several workshops to promote them. They have modified the basic design, having standardized on a 6-foot wide bed with a 12-inch tube made of rabbit fencing or chicken wire for the compost basket. It is common in Texas to add red-wiggler worms to the compost basket to help break down the organic matter.\n\nThe term \"keyhole garden\" is also used in permaculture to describe a garden bed that has been laid out with one or more paths that dead-end rather than continuing through, in order to reduce the area of paths. Permaculture keyhole gardens tend to be wider and flatter than the African variety and do not generally incorporate a compost basket or compost pile built into the bed. The tall beds that incorporate compost are referred to as \"banana circles\" by permaculturalists.\n\n"}

The list is intended to include entities that have been recognized to have \"de facto\" status as sovereign states, and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms.\n\nThe dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood, which was codified by the Montevideo Convention of 1933. The Convention defines the state as a person of international law if it \"possess[es] the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) a capacity to enter into relations with the other states\" so long as it was not \"obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure\".\n\nDebate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood.

Lithuania is a member of NATO, OECD and of the European Union. Its population is about 2.8 million. The largest city and capital is Vilnius.\n\nDuring the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, as present-day Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the Lublin Union of 1569 Poland and Lithuania formed a new state: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was finally destroyed by its neighboring countries in 1795. Most of Lithuania's territory was annexed by the Russian Empire, until the Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918, which declared re-establishment of a sovereign state. Between 1940 and 1945 Lithuania was occupied by both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany at different times. When World War II was near its end in 1944 and the Nazis retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first Baltic republic to declare its restored independence after 50 years of Soviet occupation.\nLithuania became a full member of the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007.

He was the first to propose the idea of a loxodrome, and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the nonius (from which Vernier scale was derived), named after his Latin surname.\n\nLittle is known about Nunes' early education, life or family background, only that he was born in Alcácer do Sal, his origins are Jewish and that his grandchildren spent a few years behind bars after they were accused by the Portuguese Inquisition of professing and secretly practicing Judaism. He studied at the University of Salamanca, maybe from 1521 until 1522, and at the University of Lisbon (this University later become the University of Coimbra) where he obtained a degree in medicine in 1525. In the 16th century medicine used astrology, so he also learned astronomy and mathematics.\n\nHe continued his medical studies but held various teaching posts within the University of Lisbon, including Moral, Philosophy, Logic and Metaphysics. When, in 1537, the Portuguese University located in Lisbon returned to Coimbra, he moved to the re-founded University of Coimbra to teach mathematics, a post he held until 1562. This was a new post in the University of Coimbra and it was established to provide instruction in the technical requirements for navigation: clearly a topic of great importance in Portugal at this period, when the control of sea trade was the primary source of Portuguese wealth. Mathematics became an independent post in 1544.\n\nIn addition to teaching he was appointed Royal Cosmographer in 1529 and Chief Royal Cosmographer in 1547: a post which he held until his death.\n\nIn 1531, King John III of Portugal charged Nunes with the education of his younger brothers Luís and Henry. Years later Nunes was also charged with the education of the king's grandson, and future king, Sebastian.\n\nWhile at the University of Coimbra, future astronomer Christopher Clavius attended Pedro Nunes' classes, and was influenced by his works. Clavius, proponent of the Gregorian Calendar, the greatest figure of the Colégio Romano, the great center of Roman Catholic knowledge of that period, classified Nunes as “supreme mathematical genius\". Nunes died in Coimbra.\n\nPedro Nunes lived in a transition period, during which science was changing from valuing theoretical knowledge (which defined the main role of a scientist/mathematician as commenting on previous authors), to providing experimental data, both as a source of information and as a method of confirming theories. Nunes was, above all, one of the last great commentators, as is shown by his first published work “Tratado da Esfera”, enriched with comments and additions that denote a profound knowledge of the difficult cosmography of the period. He also acknowledged the value of experimentation.\n\nIn his \"Tratado da sphera\" he argued for a common and universal diffusion of knowledge. Accordingly, he not only published works in Latin, at that time science's lingua franca, aiming for an audience of European scholars, but also in Portuguese, and Spanish (\"Livro de Algebra\").\n\nMuch of Nunes' work related to navigation. He was the first to understand why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a loxodrome. The later invention of logarithms allowed Leibniz to establish algebraic equations for the loxodrome. These lines —also called rhumb lines— maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection —also called navigator connection.\n\nIn his \"Treaty defending the sea chart\", Nunes argued that a nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used.\n\nNunes also solved the problem of finding the day with the shortest twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration. This problem \"per se\" is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes as it was a problem which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli more than a century later with less success. They could find a solution to the problem of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.\n\nHe was probably the last major mathematician to make relevant improvements to the ptolemaic system (a geocentric model describing the relative motion of the Earth and Sun). However, this lost importance because Copernicus introduced his heliocentric system theory around the same time. Nunes knew Copernicus' work but referred only briefly to it in his published works, with the purpose of correcting some mathematical errors.\n\nMost of Nunes' achievements were possible because of his profound understanding of spherical trigonometry and his ability to transpose Ptolemy's adaptations of Euclidean geometry to it.\n\nNunes worked on several practical nautical problems concerning course correction as well as attempting to develop more accurate devices to determine a ship's position.\n\nHe created the nonius to improve the astrolabe's accuracy. This consisted of a number of concentric circles traced on the astrolabe and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. Thus the outermost quadrant would comprise 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the alidade fell was noted. A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.\n\nThe nonius was used by Tycho Brahe, who considered it too complex. The method inspired improved systems by Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius. These were eventually improved further by Pierre Vernier in 1631, which reduced the nonius to the Vernier scale that includes two scales, one of them fixed and the other movable. Vernier himself used to say that his invention was a perfected nonius and for a long time it was known as the “nonius”, even in France. In some languages, the Vernier scale is still named after Nunes, for example \"\" in Swedish.\n\nPedro Nunes also worked on some mechanics problems, from a mathematical point of view.\n\nNunes was very influential internationally e.g. on the work of John Dee and Edward Wright.\n\n\nPedro Nunes translated, commented and expanded some of the major works in his field, and he also published original research.\n\nCommented and expanded translations:\n\nOriginal work:\n\nSome modern reprints:\n\n\n"}

Some geographers restricted it to the portion separating Wales from Leinster, sometimes extending south to the waters between the West Country of England and East Munster; the latter have since the 1970s come to be called the Celtic Sea. In Ireland \"St George's Channel\" is now usually taken to refer only to the narrowest part of the channel, between Carnsore Point in Wexford and St David's Head in Pembrokeshire. However, it remains common in Ireland to talk about a cross-channel trip, cross-channel soccer, etc., where \"cross-channel\" means \"to/from Great Britain\".\n\nThe current (third, 1953) edition of the International Hydrographic Organization's publication \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" defines the southern limit of \"Irish Sea and St. George's Channel\" as \"A line joining St. David's Head () to Carnsore Point ()\"; it does not define the two waterbodies separately.

The US state department recently denied the implementation of any border security force by the US government referring to the new development simply as security training.\n\nOn 23 December 2017, U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, commander of CENTCOM, announced that U.S. forces in Syria were planning an expansion of their current training program for pro-Coalition militias to specialize in border security. The official reasoning for extending support of pro-Coalition Kurdish and Arab militias was preventing the resurgence of ISIL in newly cleared areas under the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control.\n\nOn 31 December 2017, Kurdish Hawar News Agency reported that a \"North Syrian Army\" was in the process of being formed. The role of the new formation was said to be carrying out border security duties in areas under the control of the SDF. This new army was planned to be headed by the Self-Defense Forces (HXP), and composed of Arab, Kurdish, Syriac, Assyrian, Turkmen and Chechen fighters. HXP leader, Siyabend Welat, stated that \"the North Syrian Army will prove the will of people to defend themselves should they ever come under attack.\"\n\nOfficially announced on 13 January 2018, Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) Public Affairs Officer Col. Thomas Veale told the Defense Post website that the force will consist of roughly 30,000 personnel, half of which are Syrian Democratic Forces veterans. The other 15,000 are currently being recruited, with about 230 people undergoing training in the Border Security Force (BSF)'s inaugural class. The Public Affairs Office further stated that Kurdish YPG units would serve in northern Syria, which would be a dividing line between the border of Turkey and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army forces. Syrian Arabs will be deployed along the Euphrates River Valley and close to the border of Iraq to separate themselves from the Russian and Iranian-backed Syrian Armed Forces.\n\nThe spokesman added that the training of BSF troops would include instructions on interrogation, screening and biometric scanning as well as countering improvised explosive devices.\n\nOn 20 January 2018, around 250 fighters graduated as part of the second contingent of the BSF south of Hasaka. Fighters of the unit waved both SDF and HXP flags, and the graduation ceremony was attended by SDF officers and US military personnel.\n\nThe announced creation of the Border Security Force has been met with strong international criticism by Syria, Russia and Turkey.\n\nSyria's Foreign Ministry urged the UN to denounce the U.S.-led coalition's decision, and counter the \"domination mentality and arrogance which dominate the U.S. administration's policies\", saying that this action would lead to consequences for international security. The ministry's office warned that any Syrian citizen that fights on behalf of the U.S.-created border force will be guilty of high treason against the state and people of Syria, and that the person would stand trial as a traitor.\n\nThe Border Security Force announcement immediately triggered a reaction from Ankara, with President Erdoğan's representative İbrahim Kalın, stating the move was unacceptable and worrying. He further mentioned that instead of ceasing the weapon supplies to SDF forces, \"the USA is taking worrying steps to legitimize this organisation and make it lasting in the region.\" On 13 January, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that the Turkish Armed Forces might launch a military operation in YPG-controlled areas of northern Syria, including the cities of Manbij and Afrin.\n\nEarlier on 14 January, a Turkish senior official told Reuters that the U.S. training of the BSF was the real reason as to why the U.S. chargé d'affaires was summoned in Ankara on 10 January, as relations between the U.S. and Turkey are becoming strained due to U.S. military support for the YPG. By 15 January, President Erdoğan strongly condemned the formation of the Border Security Force. In his speech in Ankara, he criticized the U.S., stating that \"a country we call an ally is insisting on forming a terror army on our borders,\" and said that Turkey will try to prevent the BSF from being formed.\n\n"}
{"id": "64205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64205", "title": "Tagus", "text": "Tagus\n\nThe Tagus (; , ; , ) is the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula. It is long, in Spain, along the border between Portugal and Spain and in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon. It drains an area of (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro). The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to places of central Spain and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a wide alluvial valley, prone to flooding. Its mouth is a large estuary near the port city of Lisbon.\n\nThe source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albarracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank. The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nThe first notable city on the Tagus is Sacedón. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama, Henares, Algodor and Tajuña. Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River. Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche. At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the \"Embalse de Valdecañas\", beyond which are the \"Embalse de Torrejon\", into which flow the Tiétar, and the lower reservoir, the Alcántara Dam into which flows the Alagón at the lower end.\n\nThere is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura, the Tagus-Segura Water Transfer.\n\nAfter forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de Ródão, Abrantes, Constância, Entroncamento, Santarém and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is a large bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of is the second longest bridge in Europe. The Port of Lisbon, located at its mouth, is one of Europe's busiest.\n\nThe Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from \"além Tejo\" \"Beyond the Tagus\" and Ribatejo from \"arriba Tejo\", an archaic way of saying \"Upper Tagus\".\n\nIn Spanish Riba means land beside a river or shore along of a river. Then Ribatejo should mean \"The land beside the Tejo\" or \"The shore of the Tejo\" you can see too many samples of towns in Spain with this prefix.\n\nThe lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755.\n\n The Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the \"Nossa Senhora dos Mártires\", is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz.\n\nA major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (\"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young\"). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: \n\nRichard Crashaw's poem \"Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper\" refers to the \"Golden\" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, \"Amores\", 1.15.34, Juvenal, \"Satires\", 3.55, etc.).\n"}
