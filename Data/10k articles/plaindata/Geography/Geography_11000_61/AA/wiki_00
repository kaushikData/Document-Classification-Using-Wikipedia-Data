The realm \"Al-Malakut\" is below \"Alam al Jabarut\", but still higher than \"Alam al Mulk\". The higher realms impinge the realms below and are not separated worlds. Although some scholars were not able to see any difference between \"Alam al Jabarut\" and \"Al-Malakut\", others thought this to be the realm of angels and spirits and the other a realm below. Thus this realm is also considered to be the created aspect of \"Rasul\" and the created reality of Adam, here representing the \"perfect human\" (Al-Insān al-Kāmil).\n\nWhile angels also dwell in \"Al-Malakut\" to encounter humans and perform tasks on earth, the most elected angels inhabit \"Al-Jabarut\". Therefore, this is the domain of angelic manifestations and therefore the realm of \"archetypes\", \"thrones\" and \"powers\" and also the paradise of the afterlife, with the exception of the \"supreme paradise\". This realm is thus eternal existence, while the others are created and limited.\n\n"}

It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with other disciplines including anthropology, ethnology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.\n\nAnthrozoology scholars, such as Pauleen Bennett recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human-nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop \"sui generis\" methods.\n\n\nThere are currently 23 college programs in HAS or a related field in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Israel and the Netherlands, as well as an additional eight veterinary school programs in North America, and over thirty HAS organizations in the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nIn the UK, the University of Exeter runs an MA in Anthrozoology which explores human-animal interactions from anthropological (cross-cultural) perspectives. Human animal interactions (HAI) involving companion animals are also studied by the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, which partners with the US National Institutes of Health to research HAI in relation to child development and aging.\n\nThere are now three primary lists for HAS scholars and students—H-Animal, the Human-Animal Studies listserv, and NILAS, as well as the Critical Animal Studies list.\n\nThere are now over a dozen journals covering HAS issues, many of them founded in the last decade, and hundreds of HAS books, most of them published in the last decade (see for example, \"Humanimalia\"). Brill, Berg, Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Reaktion, Palgrave-McMillan, University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, and Oxford all offer either a HAS series or a large number of HAS books.\n\nIn addition, in 2006, Animals and Society Institute (ASI) began hosting the Human-Animal Studies Fellowship, a six-week program in which pre- and post-doctoral scholars work on a HAS research project at a university under the guidance of host scholars and distance peer scholars. Beginning in 2011, ASI has partnered with Wesleyan Animal Studies, who will be hosting the fellowship in conjunction with ASI. There are also a handful of HAS conferences per year, including those organized by ISAZ and NILAS, and the Minding Animals conference, held in 2009 in Australia. Finally, there are more HAS courses being taught now than ever before. The ASI website lists over 300 courses (primarily in North America, but also including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, and Poland) in twenty-nine disciplines at over 200 colleges and universities, not including over 100 law school courses.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16723690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16723690", "title": "Arasbaran", "text": "Arasbaran\n\nArasbaran ( \"Arasbârân\") or Arasbar ( \"Arasbâr\"), also known as \"Qaradagh\" or \"Karadagh\" ( / , meaning \"black mountain\"), or \"Qaraja dagh\" or \"Karaja dagh\" ( / , meaning \"black mountain\"), is a large mountainous area stretching from the Qūshā Dāgh massif, south of Ahar, to the Aras River in East Azerbaijan Province of Iran. The region is confined to Aras River in the north, Meshgin Shahr County and Moghan in the east, Sarab County in the south, and Tabriz and Marand counties in the west. Since 1976, UNESCO has registered 72,460 hectares of the region, confined to 38°40' to 39°08'N and 46°39' to 47°02'E, as biosphere reserve with the following general description:\nThere is no mention of Arasbaran as a geo-political entity in written sources dating prior to Safavid era. There is a speculation that the region referred to as Syah Kuh by the 10th-century Muslim geographer, Ibn Hawqal, corresponds to the present day Arasbaran. However, the said Syahkoh has more similarities with Manghishlaq in the eastern shores of Caspian Sea. Therefore, Arasbaran's history should be considered in the context of its two main towns, Ahar and Kaleybar.\n\nKaleybar, formerly known as bedh, was the stronghold of Babak Khorramdin who, in 816 AD, revolted against Islamic Caliphate and was defeated in 836 AD. The events of the two decades long tumultuous times have been extensively reported by Islamic historians of the epoch. The first report is by Al-Masudi in The Meadows of Gold: \"Babak revolted in Bedh region with the disciples of Djavidan\" ... \"Following a series of defeats Babak was blockaded in his native town..., which even now is known as Babak's countr\"y. Ibn Athir in his book, The Complete History, has devoted many pages to the description of battles.\n\nYaqut al-Hamawi, writing in early thirteenth century, describes Kaleybar in the following words, \"County between Azerbaijan and Erran... This county produces pomegranates of incomparable beauty, excellent figs and grapes that are dried on fires (because the sun is always obscured by thick clouds).\" In the 12th-13th centuries, Ahar was a minor and short-lived, but prosperous emirate ruled by the Pishteginid dynasty of Georgian origin (1155—1231). Yaqut al-Hamawi, describes Ahar as \"very flourishing despite its small extent\".\n\nBoth towns lost most of their importance during the rule of Ilkhanate. Hamdallah Mustawfi, writing in the-mid fourteenth century, describes Ahar as \"a little town\", and Kaleybar as \"A village of Azerbaijan, in the woods near a mountain which comprises a fortress\".\n\nAhar was in the focus of Safavid dynasty's agenda for casting of Azerbaijan as a Safavid dominion. Thus, Shah Abbas rebuilt the mausoleum of Sheikh Sheikh Shihab-al-din in Ahar. In 1604, as Ottoman forces threatened the area directly to the north of Arasbaran during the Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618), Shah Abbas ordered Maqsud Sultan to evacuate the entire population of the Nakhichevan region (including the Armenians of Jolfa, who, in the following year, were transplanted to Isfahan) to Arasbaran and Dezmar.\n\nArasbaran region suffered enormously during Russo-Persian War (1804–13) and Russo-Persian War (1826–28) due to its proximity to the war zone. Western travellers in 1837-1843 period had found Ahar, a city with around 700 households, in wretched condition.\n\nArasbaran was one of the epicentres of Persian Constitutional Revolution. Arasbaran tribes were heavily involved in armed conflicts; the revolutionary and anti-revolutionary camps were headed, respectively, by Sattar Khan and Rahimkhan Chalabianloo, both from Qaradağ region. When in 1925 Rezā Shāh deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar and founded the Pahlavi dynasty, Arasbaran's gradual decline started. The new king insisting on cultural and ethnic nationalism, and implemented a policy of cultural assimilation. He renamed Qaradağ as Arasbaran to deny the Turkic identity of the inhabitants. Consequently, Arasbaran is no longer in the focus of national politics. Still, many books and articles are being written on the contribution of Arasbaran region, and its inhabitants in the contemporary history of Iran cannot be underestimated. The interested reader may refer to the following scholarly books and articles:\n\nThe declaration by UNESCO of Arasbaran as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve in 1976 was a great endorsement for the region's ecotourism potential. More recently, visitors from places as far away as Canada have expressed their amazement with approving words. The planned promotion of the Biosphere to the National Park status may farther enhance Arasbaran's environmental significance.\n\nArasbaran is home to 215 species of birds, notably the Caucasian black grouse, grey partridge, black francolin, and common pheasant, 29 species of reptiles, 48 species of mammals, notably wild goat, wild boar, brown bear, wolf, lynx, and leopard, and 17 species of fish. There is an effort going on to revitalise the extinct sub-species of Caspian red deer local to the area . The local flora include hornbeam, sumac, and \"Berberis\". A unique characteristic of Arasbaran forests is the ubiquity of edible wild trees. For instance, a patch of forest between Aghaweye and Oskolou includes hazelnut trees. The large walnut and \"Cornus mas\" trees, which grow wild alongside streams, provide an important income source for inhabitants. More exotic plant species, such as redcurrant, truffle and herbs with application in traditional medicine significantly add to the ecological importance of Arasbaran region.\n\nA recent study has indicated that three sites have the highest potential for ecotourism. These sites, which are located alongside the road connecting Kaleybar to Asheqlu (Abbasabad-Aynaloo-Vayqan direction), include Mikandi valley, Aynali forests and Babak Castle. There are, however, more unexplored tourist potentials. One example is a holy mountain located at the coordinate (38°55'16.64\"N,46°47'24.62\"E). Most inhabitants of the now abandoned village, Garmanab, were Izadis, the followers Yârsân religion. They used to slaughter sacrificial animals in the site, which is located at the slopes of a hill. Nobody bothered to ask the reasons behind the holiness of the site. However, the pleasures of an occasional feast was so tempting that the followers of the Shia' sect attended the holy site, too. Nowadays there are few worshipers and the centuries long traditions are almost forgotten. The revival of these rituals may attract cultural visitors.\n\nAnother potential tourist attraction are the summer camps (ییلاق) of semi-settled Tribes of Arasbaran, known as Ilat, who spend five months of the year in uplands for grazing their livestock. A tourist, while enjoying the fresh thin air of the mountains, may get a chance to observe the age-long traditional living styles of the locals. Some of the attractive sites are Aliabad mountains, meadows above Shojaabad, East Azerbaijan village, and Chaparli and Aqdash summer quarters, all located in a driving distance from Kaleybar.\n\nNumerous hot springs, scattered all over the region, have been considered as attractions for promoting tourism. One example is Motaalleq hot spring therapeutic facility, which is the largest of its kind in Iran. The facility, with an area of 12870 m includes bathing areas, coffee-shop, restaurants, prayer room, and gymnasium.\nIn recent years, the local government has organised Zoğal festivals in Kaleybar as a means of promoting tourism. In addition, every year, in the second half of October, a Pomegranate Festival is organised in by the provincial authorities in Mardanaqom village.\n\nNearly every village in the region has a landmark in its territories. Some of these are potential tourism attractions. For instance, there is a landmark ancient plane tree in the Kavanaq village, whose photo is presented here. The tree is about 3 metres in diameter and is said to have lived for 500 years. The villagers have developed interesting oral narratives around the events experienced by the tree.\n\nIn the wake of Russo-Persian War (1804–13) a significant fraction of the inhabitants lived as nomadic tribes. The major tribes included; Chalabianlu 1500 tents and houses, Karacurlu 2500, Haji-Alilu 800, Begdillu 200, and various minor groups 500. At the time Ahar, with 3500 inhabitants, was the only city of Qaradağ. By the beginning of the twentieth century the settlement of tribesman were growing and in 1920 there were more than four hundred villages, less than thirty of which were Armenian. However, the nomadic way of living has survived to the present. The nomadic population at present has been estimated to be about 36000, and is not significantly different from the 30000 estimate of 1960.\n\nThe defeat of Azerbaijan People's Government and the following events, resulted in mass migration of inhabitants to Tabriz and Tehran. Most of these migrants settled in the shanty towns and worked as painters. The land reforms of 1962–1964 accelerated the migration. The case of a typical village, Abbasabad, is a good example to demonstrate the population depletion; the number of families dropped from 60 families at 1970 to 12 at 2006.\n\nAfter the election of Ahmadinezhad as president of Iran, a rumour was circulated that UNESCO will compensate the residents to have the village evacuated for wild-life protection efforts. Some early emigrants returned and built decent houses. At the present the region is undergoing a population boom as more wealthy city residents want to spend their retirement in a cleaner environment. Recently, the deputy governor of the East Azarbaijan province has mentioned the phenomenon of reverse migration to Khoda Afarin and Kaleybar counties. The problem is that the population is aging and the working class adults, in the face of scarce job opportunities, live most of the year in large population centres such as Tehran. The issue is so critical that during recent presidential campaign, Mohsen Rezaee referred to Iranian villages as the \"old age residence\".\n\nThe spoken language is Azerbaijani. It has a high degree of intelligibility with Anatolian Turkish. Most inhabitants are familiar with Persian language, which is the official language of Iran and the sole language of education. Until 1980, the elders of four villages (Chay Kandi, Kalasor, Khoynarood, and Arazin) were communicating in Tati, a language which was the Iranian language of Azerbaijan before the arrival of speakers of Turkish in the time of Mahmud of Ghazni (around 1000 AD).\n\nThe Pahlavi era was a dark period for cultural identity of Arasbaran. Rezā Shāh, insisting on ethnic nationalism and cultural unitarism, implemented his policies of forced detribalisation and sedentarisation. He renamed Qaradağ as Arasbaran to deny the Turkic identity of the inhabitants. Moreover, the education and publication in Azerbaijani Turkish language was banned and writers of Azerbaijan had to write in Persian, a medium which was, perhaps, not adequate for recording the subtleties of Qaradağ's native culture that has evolved under influence of Turkish language. This language, has a rare and unusual point of grammar called the \"hearsay tense\". Consequently, in Turkish speaking society the boundary between the private and shared memories becomes fuzzy, and the magnitude of time lapse between the events shrinks. This is an ideal feature for the generation of oral cultural artifacts, particularly mythology, epics and folkloric music.\n\nA rare opportunity for recording and preserving Qaradağ's culture was provided by the innovative method by which Shahriar in his famous verse book, \"Heydar Babaya Salam\" adopted to summarize the Cultural identity in concise poetic form. A generation of lesser known poets from Arasbaran used similar approach for perpetuating region's oral traditions. Remarkable examples are \"mourning Sabalan\" by Abbas Barez, and \"Hail to Qizil Qala'h\" by Seifollah Delkhon. Another example is Mohamad Golmohamadi's long poem, titled \"I am madly in love with Qareh Dagh\" (قاراداغ اؤلکه‌سینین گؤر نئجه دیوانه‌سی ام), which is a concise description of the region's cultural landscape.\n\nThe inhabitants of every village attribute spiritual importance to at multiple sites, scattered throughout the village territory. These places, generally known as Ojaq, are located in areas with rapid variation on the land topography, and are in some way linked to Djins via established narratives. Most of these sites possess any significantly conspicuous landmark. At some sites, which are considered sacred by many villages, people will occasionally gather to slaughter sacrificial animals or offer a simple meal of freshly baked bread and cheese with tea. At some sites, they have collected medium-sized rocks around some trees and hang coloured threads or ribbons from the trees.\n\nIn most villages, there are sites with narrative associations, which are not considered sacred. These sites are in secluded locations formed by natural topography of the landscape. Often the narratives involve bears as the principal subject. The main theme of the narratives is the following. A male bear kidnaps a blackberry picking pretty girl and takes her to his den. A hybrid child is born, but the girl runs away at the first opportunity leaving the lamenting bear entreatingly crying for his lost wife.\n\nAccording to a myth the wolf is found as a symbol of merciless power that is able to destroy everything. If a human being touches it, whatever frightens him/her will be frustrated.\n\nVergi, meaning gift, is a perceived ability for performing extraordinary feats such as prophesy or healing, which supposedly can only be received from god or from Shia' Imams. It is believed that a Vergi is inherited and not to be learned. For instance, there is a family in Vayqan among whom the Vergi for catching snakes is transmitted from generation to generation. Sometimes, the Vergi is claimed to be received in dreams. But often, it is received in Ojaqs where ghosts show themselves to and talk to gifted. It is believed that there is no escape from Vergi and that, at first, it generates suffering comparable to shamanistic illness.\n\nAshura, the 10th day of the lunar month Muharram, is the day at which the mourning celebrations commemorating Imam Husayns' martyrdom reach their climax. In many villages of Qaradağ, palm sized metallic icons fixed on a medium-sized wooden handles, locally known as Toğs, are harbingers of the exact hour when Husayn was killed; allegedly, they relapse to utter in-animation following ten days of relentless erratic movements at the hands of their carriers (alamdars). The tuğs – believed to be sisters – are housed in the mosques and are greatly revered by the inhabitants of all neighbouring villages. Unfortunately, there are no systematic studies or first hand reports on these fascinating relics. Still, every year, as a ritualistic obligation, expatriates flock to the said villages to receive the blessings of the sacred day in the company of their sacred Toğs. In the accompanying photo two persons holding toğ can be seen, who are surrounded by mourners beating on their legs. One toğ is kept standing still in the centre. It seems that the other toğ is performing erratic motions and is pulling the holder.\n\nOrhan Pamuk in 2001 Turkish novel, \"My Name Is Red\", gives a vivid description of Turkic people's love-hate attitude towards dogs. Every summer, the real life version of this description is in display in Chaparli. Each family has 2-5 dogs, all with characteristic cropped ears and tails. The dogs are fed generous portions of milk soaked bread. When the sheep herds are brought back for milking near tents, dogs sleep around the camp most of the day. The inhabitants treat the beasts with utter respect, a manner which is loathed by more pious villagers of the region as a pagan act. Between dusk and down dogs regain their vicious character; strangers have to avoid crossing a campsite otherwise the attacking dogs cannot be controlled even by their owners. Fending off the dogs by beating is considered an act of aggression towards the owner and should be avoided. In fact most of the feuds between settled villagers and pastoralists are about dogs.\n\nCarpet weaving stands out as the acme of Azeri art and people of Arasbaran have significantly contributed to this artistic tradition. Arabaran carpet was a hybrid between Persian carpet and Azerbaijani rug. There were indigenous styles as well. For instance, carpets known as Balan rugs had a size of approximately 1x4 m and a characteristic pattern.\n\nThe acme of carpet weaving art in Arasbaran is manifested in verni, which was originated in Nagorno-Karabakh. Verni is a carpet-like kilim with a delicate and fine warp and weft, which is woven without a previous sketch, thanks to the creative talents of nomadic women and girls. Verni weavers employ the image of birds and animals (deer, rooster, cat, snake, birds, gazelle, sheep, camel, wolf and eagle) in simple geometrical shapes, imitating the earthenware patterns that were popular in prehistoric times. A key décor feature, which is intrinsic to many vernis, is the S-element. Its shape varies; it may resemble both the figure 5 and letter S. This element means “dragon” among the nomads. At present, verni is woven by the girls of Arasbaran Tribes, often in the same room where the nomadic tribes reside, and is a significant income source for about 20000 families.\n\n<poem>\n\"Bəlkə bu yerlərə birdə gəlmədim\" (I may not come to these mountains again)\n\"duman səlamət qal dağ səlamət qal\" (Farewell to the Mist and to the mountain)\n\"arxamca su səpir göydə bulutlar\" (Clouds sprinkle drops of rain)\n\"leysan səlamət qal yağ səlamət\" qal (Farewell to summer days, farewell to the rain)\n</poem>\nThese opening verses of a contemporary ashug song, composed by Məhəmməd Araz, may well represent the essence of Qaradağ's cultural identity; frequent allusions to a mountain with the intention of arousing an emotional state with a tone of mild melancholy- a state well expressed by the ashughi music.\n\nA century long autocratic nation building policies of Pahlavi era in Iran has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favor of a government sanctioned culture. The mountainous region of Qaradağ, however, relatively escaped the demise due to its remoteness and inaccessibility. Many elements of the indigenous culture, particularly local music, have survived to the present day. More recently a slow but persistent cultural revival has been in progress and the inhabitants along with their city dwelling relatives perceive an awareness of their common cultural roots with the inhabitants of eastern Turkey and Azerbaijan republics,where a cultural renaissance is well underway since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The ashughi music is cornerstone of this shared identity.\n\nThe number of ashughs has significantly increased after Aşiq Imran Heydəri (عاشیق ایمران حیدری) started accepting pupils to his academic style classes in Tabriz. Imran's efforts effectively shifted the general impression of the ashugh music from association to the nomadic life in mountains to a music suited for performances in urban settings. At present, the de facto representative of ashughs is Aşiq Rəsol Qorbani from Abbasabad village.\n\nUp until the Islamic revolution the region had a subsistence economy – all food was produced within the villages and the surplus was bartered with items supplied by travelling salesman. Most women spent winter months weaving carpets using raw material which were locally produced. Rainfed agriculture on the steep slopes had severely eroded the farms and productivity had dropped to an unsustainable low level, and the inhabitants had to supplement their income by taking seasonal construction jobs in Tehran. After the revolution, thanks to the construction of roads giving accessibility to larger town markets, livestock production became the dominant mode of the region's economy. However, the quarrels over grazing rights didn't allow large-scale animal agriculture.\n\nIn recent years beekeeping has emerged as the only occupation that can provide a family with sufficient income. The honey produced in villages close to pastures is renowned for the its quality and has an established niche market. Mardanaqom village is one of the main producers of honey.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27738233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27738233", "title": "Collocation (remote sensing)", "text": "Collocation (remote sensing)\n\nCollocation is a procedure used in remote sensing \nto match measurements from two or more different instruments.\nThis is done for two main reasons: \nfor validation purposes when comparing measurements of the same variable, \nand to relate measurements of two different variables \neither for performing retrievals or for prediction.\nIn the second case the data is later fed into some type of statistical \ninverse method\nsuch as an artificial neural network, statistical classification algorithm, \nkernel estimator or a linear least squares. \nIn principle, most collocation problems can be solved by a nearest neighbor search,\nbut in practice there are many other considerations involved and the best method is\nhighly specific to the particular matching of instruments.\nHere we deal with some of the most important considerations along with specific examples.\n\nThere are at least two main considerations when performing collocations.\nThe first is the sampling pattern of the instrument.\nMeasurements may be dense and regular, such as those from a cross-track\nscanning satellite instrument. In this case, some form of interpolation\nmay be appropriate. On the other hand, the measurements may be\nsparse, such as a one-off field campaign designed for some\nparticular validation exercise.\nThe second consideration is the instrument footprint, which\ncan range from something approaching a point measurement\nsuch as that of a radiosonde, or it might be several\nkilometers in diameter such as that of a satellite-mounted,\nmicrowave radiometer. In the latter case, it is appropriate\nto take into account the instrument antenna pattern when\nmaking comparisons with another instrument having both a smaller\nfootprint and a denser sampling, that is, several measurements\nfrom the one instrument will fit into the footprint of the other.\n\nJust as the instrument has a spatial footprint, it will also have\na temporal footprint, often called the integration time.\nWhile the integration time is usually less than a second,\nwhich for meteorological applications is essentially instantaneous,\nthere are many instances where some form of time averaging can considerably\nease the collocation process.\n\nThe collocations will need to be screened based on both the time\nand length scales of the phenomenon of interest.\nThis will further facilitate the collocation process since \nremote sensing and other measurement data is almost always \nbinned in some way.\nCertain atmospheric phenomena such as clouds or convection are quite transient\nso that we need not consider collocations with a time error of more than an hour or so.\nSea ice, on the other hand, moves and evolves quite slowly, so that\nmeasurements separated by as much as a day or more might still be useful.\n\nThe satellites that most concern us are those with a low-Earth, polar orbit since geostationary satellites view the same point throughout their lifetime.\nThe diagram shows measurements from AMSU-B\ninstruments mounted on three satellites over a period of 12 hours.\nThis illustrates both the orbit path and the scan pattern which runs crosswise.\nSince the orbit of a satellite is deterministic, \nbarring orbit maneuvers, we can predict the location of the\nsatellite at a given time and, by extension, the location of\nthe measurement pixels.\nIn theory, collocations can be performed by inverting the\ndetermining equations starting from the desired time period.\nIn practice, partially processed data (usually referred to as\nlevel 1b, 1c or level 2) contain the coordinates of each of\nthe measurement pixels and \nit is common to simply feed these coordinates to a nearest neighbor search.\nAs mentioned previously, the satellite data is always binned\nin some manner. \nAt minimum, the data will be arranged in \nswaths extending from pole to pole.\nThe swaths will be labelled by time period and the\napproximate location known.\n\nRadiosondes are particularly important for collocation studies\nbecause they measure atmospheric variables more accurately and more\ndirectly than satellite or other remote-sensing instruments.\nIn addition, radiosonde samples are effectively instantaneous point measurements.\nOne issue with radiosondes carried aloft by weather balloons is\nballoon drift. In,\nthis is handled by averaging all the satellite pixels within a 50 km radius\nof the balloon launch.\n\nIf high-resolution sonde data, which normally has a constant\nsampling rate or includes the measurement time, is used,\nthen the lateral motion can be traced from the wind data.\nEven with low-resolution data, the motion can still\nbe approximated by assuming a constant ascent rate.\nExcepting a short bit towards the end, \nthe linear ascent can be clearly seen in the figure above.\nWe can show that the ascent rate of a balloon is given\nby the following equation\n\nwhere \"g\" is gravitational acceleration,\n\"k\" relates the height, \"h\", and surface area, \"A\",\nof the balloon to its volume: \"V\" = \"khA\"; \n\"R\" is the equivalent \"gas constant\" of the balloon, \n\"R\" is the gas constant of the air\nand \"c\" is the drag coefficient of the balloon.\nSubstituting some sensible values for each of the constants,\n\"k\"=1. (the balloon is a perfect cylinder), \"h\"=2. m, \"c\" = 1.\nand \"R\" is the gas constant of helium,\nreturns an ascent rate of 4.1 m/s. Compare this with the\nvalues shown in the histogram which compiles all of the\nradiosonde launches from the Polarstern research vessel\nover a period of eleven years between 1992 and 2003.\n\nFor gridded data such as assimilation or reanalysis data,\ninterpolation is likely the most appropriate method for performing any type of comparison.\nA specific point in both physical position and time is easy to locate\nwithin the grid and interpolation performed between the nearest neighbors.\nLinear interpolation (bilinear, trilinear etc.) is the most common, \nthough cubic is used as well but is probably not worth the extra computational overhead.\nIf the variable of interest has a relatively smooth rate of change (temperature is a good example of this because it\nhas a diffusion mechanism, radiative transfer, not available to other atmospheric variables), \nthen interpolation can eliminate much of the error associated with collocation.\n\nInterpolation may also be appropriate for many types of satellite instruments,\nfor instance a cross-track scanning instrument like Landsat.\nIn data derived from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) are\ninterpolated (although not for the purposes of collocation) using a slight variation\nof trilinear interpolation.\nSince measurements within a single scan track are laid out in an approximately rectangular\ngrid, bilinear interpolation can be performed.\nBy searching for the nearest overlapping scan track both forwards and backwards in time,\nthe spatial interpolates can then be interpolated in time. \nThis technique works better with derived quantities rather than raw brightness temperatures since\nthe scan angle will already have been accounted for.\n\nFor instruments with a more irregular sampling pattern, such as the Advanced Microwave\nScanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) instrument which has a circular scanning pattern,\nwe need a more general form of interpolation such as kernel estimation.\nA method commonly used for this particular instrument, as well as SSM/I,\nis a simple daily average within regularly gridded, spatial bins\n\nTo collocate measurements of a medium- to long-lived atmospheric tracer with a second instrument, running trajectories can considerably improve the accuracy. It also simplifies the analysis somewhat: a trajectory is run both forwards and backwards from the measurement location and between the desired time window. Note that the acceptable time window has now become longer because the error from transport induced changes in the tracer is removed: the tracer lifetime would be a good window to use. Since the trajectories provide a location for every point in time within the time window, there is no need to check multiple measurements from the second instrument. Every time within the trajectory is checked for the distance criterion but within a very narrow window. Alternatively, the exact times of the measurements for the second instrument are interpolated within the trajectory. Only the smallest distance error below the threshold is used and the distance criterion can be made smaller as a consequence.\n\nCollocations of sea ice thickness and brightness temperatures taken during the\nPol-Ice Campaign are an excellent example since they illustrate many of the most important principles as well as demonstrating the necessity of taking into account the individual case. The Pol-Ice campaign was conducted in the N. Baltic in March 2007 as part of the SMOS-Ice project in preparation for the launch of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. \nBecause of the low frequency of the SMOS instrument, it is hoped that it will render\ninformation on sea ice thickness, therefore the campaign comprised measurements\nof both sea ice thickness and emitted brightness temperature.\nBrightness temperatures were measured with the EMIRAD L-band microwave radiometer\n\ncarried on board an airplane. Ice thickness was measured with the E-M Bird ice thickness meter which was carried by a helicopter. The E-M Bird measures ice thickness with a combination of inductance measurements to determine the location of the ice-water interface and a laser altimeter to measure the height of the ice surface.\nThe map above shows the flight tracks of both instruments which were approximately coincident but obviously subject to pilot error.\n\nSince the flight paths of both aircraft were approximately linear, the first step in the collocation process was to convert all the coincident flights to Cartesian coordinates with the \"x\"-axis being lateral distance and the \"y\"-axis transverse distance. In this way, collocations can be performed in two ways: crudely, by matching only the \"x\" distances, and more precisely by matching both coordinates.\n\nMore importantly, the footprint size of the radiometer is many times larger\nthan that of the E-M Bird meter. The figure to the left shows\nthe antenna response function for the radiometer.\nThe full width at half maximum is 31 degrees.\nSince the aircraft was flying at approximately 500 m, this translates\nto a footprint size of 200 m or more.\nMeanwhile, the footprint size of the E-M Bird was roughly 40 m\nwith a sample spacing of only 2 to 4 m.\nRather than looking to nearest neighbors, which would have produced\npoor results, a weighted average of the thickness measurements was\nperformed for each radiometer measurement.\nWeights were calculated based on the radiometer response function which is almost\na perfect Gaussian up to about 45 degrees.\nPoints could be excluded based on distance along the flight\npath.\nFor validation of sea ice emissivity forward model calculations, \nthis was further refined by performing an emissivity calculation\nfor each thickness measurement and averaging over the radiometer\nfootprint.\nThe figure below illustrates relative measurement locations\nfrom each of the instruments used in the Pol-Ice campaign.\nTwo overpasses are shown: one from the airplane carrying the\nEMIRAD radiometer and one from the helicopter carrying the\nE-M Bird instrument.\nThe x-axis is along the line of the flight path.\nEMIRAD footprints are drawn with lines, E-M Bird\ninductance measurements are represented by circles\nand LIDAR measurements with dots.\n"}

The term refers to the longitudinal profile of a glaciated valley that has several consecutive hanging valleys.\n\nThere are a few different ways cyclopean stairs can form.\n\nOne way they form is through plucking. Different bedrock types may be more susceptible to plucking. If a highly jointed layer of bedrock is on the surface, large portions of it will be picked up by the glacier and deposited later as a glacial erratic. The valley formed in this fashion may have a steep wall at its head caused by a change in the bedrock type. The stronger bedrock will remain in the form of a riser at the end of a hanging valley.\n\nCyclopean stairs can also form at points where tributary glaciers feed into larger central glaciers. The tributary glacier causes the central glacier to thicken and downcut more rapidly. This may cause a very sudden drop in the valley floor at the points where the glaciers converged.\n\nThey may also form at the head of a glacier. In an area where the snowline is rising, the cirque in which the glacier forms my recede. A new cirque may form above the previous cirque and carve out a new step. As the snowline continues to rise, new cirques would continue to form the steps of the cyclopean stairs.\n\n\"Surface Processes and Landforms\", Don J. Easterbrook.

The municipality has a border with Albania and the Republic of Macedonia. It was a historic capital of the Serbian Empire.\n\nPrizren municipality with an area of 640 km ( 5.94% of Kosovo’s surface ) located in south-western Kosovo has 76 settlements with 220,776 inhabitants of whom 110,000 are Prizren’s local inhabitants.\n\nThe most populated villages of the municipality of Prizren are:\nGeographical and regional position of Prizren can bestly be examined with analysis of his position in relation to Kosovo, and Dukagjini’s area. Kosovo contains areas of Kosovo and Dukagjini.\n\nGood geographical position, regional and rich natural resources, historical wealth of cultural artifacts form the basis of tourism development in the municipality of Prizren.\n\nPrizren is an ancient city located along Sharri Mountains and along the river Lumbardhi.\n\nThe topography of Prizren has got a corrugated structure. Elevation ranges from 300 to 2,600 m within the boundaries.\n\nWhile the city center is focused on flat surfaces, hilly topography is observed along the western side, especially along the eastern side.\n\nForest surfaces in Prizren are rich with endemic plant reserves especially the Bosnian pine.\n\nForest surfaces in the National Park \"Sharri Mountains \" are known with natural values.\n\nThe total area of the municipality of Prizren is 63,986 ha. 53 % of this surface is agricultural land, 39% of forests and 8 % others.\n\nFrom the total amount of precipitation that falls in the territory of Kosovo, in Dukagjini region fall about 800 mm in 1m of the surface, while in Kosovo, about 600 mm in 1m. With rivers flows about 40 % of precipitation, while about 60 % evaporates its. The amount of water that flows into rivers is greater in late autumn and spring, and lower in summer and winter. The ratio between the maximum and minimum amounts of water flowing into Drini i Bardhe is 8:1.\n\nMaximum flow of water in rivers coming from Sharr Eastern Albanian Alps, can sometimes be in late autumn ( November and December ), when these regions have uninterrupted rainfall for several days. Otherwise, due to the long and dry summer, with autumn rainfalls there is not much water in these rivers, while the underground reserves in the mountains are not filled up.\n\nHydrography of the watercourses of Kosovo is divided into four river basins: \n\nThe longest and the most important river in Prizren is Drini i Bardhe( 122 km ), while Prizren Lumëbardhi is smaller with 31 km. All rivers flow into the Drini i Bardhe river. The average length of the branches of Drini i Bardhe is along the 45.8 km.\n\nAlong the center of Prizren passes the Lumbardhi River which is 35 km long.\n\nToplluha/Topluga River with a length of 37 km was declared as the river with the biggest risk of flooding.\n\nMuch of the territory of Kosovo belongs to the Black Sea basin, the rest, slightly smaller belongs to the Adriatic Sea basin and the remaining part belongs to the Aegean Sea basin.\n\nDespite the larger area that belongs to the Black Sea basin, the rivers of the Adriatic Sea basin have large amounts of water, because on the basin of Drini i Bardhe falls greater amount of rainfall, then because of the high mountains, in which during winter falls even more snow, which melts in the spring months.\n\nPrizren borders with municipalities such as: Gjakovë, Rahovec, Shtërpcë, Suharekë, Dragash and in national borders with Albania and Macedonia. For this reason Prizren’s region is located at an altitude of about 400 meters and some of Sharri Mountains reach the height 2000 m above sea level. They are surrounded by almost all sides with high mountains and present a set of clearly separated. Dukagjini’s and Kosovo’s areas are in the middle part of the Balkans.\n\nPrizren municipality borders in the north with municipalities of Suhareka/Suva Reka and Rahovec/ Orahovac, in the south of this municipality with Dragash, in the east with Shtërrpcë/Štrpce and in west borders with the Republic of Albania.Prizren is located off the European highway network.Many traffic routes pass through its territory.\n\nHowever, natural predispositions provide favorable opportunities for connecting with neighboring regions more distant, while forming qualitative connections Prizren will have a much better position for both tourist and freight flows as more efficient connection and integration into wider spaces such as Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, other border regions, and Europe.\n\nThe climate of the city is extremely varied. In low areas due to the influence of the Mediterranean climate and very hot summers crops are among the first in Eastern Europe with the incomparable advantages for agricultural crops: grape vines, fruit and vegetables.\n\nIn rural regions, Alpine climate dominates, because until June into holes there are still several pieces of snow left where in the middle of the summer the top of mountains are full of snow.\nThis type of configuration gives preconditions for wealth and other resources, for example:\n\nHistorical conditions in earlier periods were not in a very good position relative to major traffic centers. Also there was not enough openness towards neighboring regions like Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, causing Prizren not to use advantages that it has from pedological ground composition, climatic conditions of the Mediterranean climate and hydrological conditions for the development of agriculture and natural conditions for developing tourism and recreational activities. All this has affected the economic structure of Prizren.\nAccording to the Spatial Plan of Kosovo, Prizren is known as a city museum, including antique values, cultural, historic and attractive development activities such as education, trade, tourism, agriculture, light food production, textile, pharmaceutical industry, etc. \nPhysical profile hints that opening communication links with the neighboring regions is one of the main objectives of the development strategy.\n\n\n"}

The Piedras Group rocks date to the period and outcrop in El Oro Province on the western Andean slope in the southwest of the country and includes greenschist and amphibolite with small intercalations of quartz-sericite schist and quartzite,dated to 743 million years ago in the Proterozoic. These high-grade, polymetamorphic rocks often signs of overprinting and green hornblende with a feather-like texture is found in the amphibolite.\n\nContinental and oceanic terranes began to be added to western South America in the Mesozoic. In north-central Ecuador, the Peltetec-Portovelo fault marks the suture between the pre-existing South American craton and the Amotape-Chaucha terrane, which partially subducted beneath a preexisting Mesozoic continental arc system. The Triassic mafic and granitoid rocks of the El Oro metamorphic complex and the component eclogite, blueschist and amphibolite are known as the Raspas metamorphic complex. This section of the terrane was previously subducted but brought to the surface with tectonic activity.\n\nThe breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana is recorded in the Triassic in Ecuador with S-type granite plutons, followed by the intrusion of calc-alkaline batholiths in the Jurassic.\n\nOceanic basalts formed in the Jurassic and Cretaceous were accreted to the edge of the continent as a separate terrane around 130 million years ago, forming a belt of basalt and diabase, together with tuff, metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks running north-south into Ecuador.\n\nFollowing the accretion of new terranes to the Western Cordillera, the Cenozoic brought the extensive uplift of the Andean orogeny. Volcanic rocks vary geochemically between the Western Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera. In the east, they are predominantly rhyolite, andesite and andesitedacite while in the west, they are characteristically andesite and plagidacite. These are inferred to be the result of hydrous partial melting of Basic Igneous Complex garnet amphibolite and amphibolite.\n\nMost mineable deposits in Ecuador are either epithermal gold or porphyry copper hosted in Paleogene rocks, formed from the Eocene to the Miocene. They may have originated from an enriched mid-ocean ridge (MORB) basalt. Compared to other neighboring countries, copper deposits are comparatively small. Explanations have included a lack of development of magma chambers around nine million years ago due to the extent of compression in the Ecuadorian section of the Andes, or perhaps of a lack of exposure of deposits near the surface.\n"}

It was the location of the former Oromo and Sidama kingdoms of Gera, Gomma, Garo, Gumma, Jimma, and Limmu-Ennarea.\n\nTo the north of the Gibe region lay the Macha tribe of the Oromo.\n\nUntil the mid 16th century, this region was part of the Sidama kingdoms of Ennarea, Hadiya, Janjero and Kaffa, tributary states to the Ethiopian Solomonic dynasty. The area was separated however, when the Oromo migrated into the area, destroying Hadiya, isolating Janjero, and reduced the area of Enerea and Kaffa. In the Gibe region, the Oromo came under the cultural influence of the kingdom of Kaffa, from whom they borrowed the concept of hereditary kingship (called Moti in all of the kingdoms except Limmu-Enerea, where for historical reasons the king was known as the \"Supera\"), and the practice of delimiting the boundaries or frontier of their states with a system of physical barriers.\n\nThese barriers consisted of palisades or dead hedges, which could extend for miles, separated from the barriers of the neighboring kingdom by a neutral strip (called \"moga\"), which was left uncultivated and inhabited only by brigands and outlaws. Access into each kingdom was limited to guarded gates known as \"kella\", where tolls were levied\n\nThese kingdoms had an economy based on exports of gold, civet musk, coffee, and slaves. G.W.B. Huntingford explains that slaves were taken in raids on the Macha tribe to the north, and in raids on the Sidamo kingdoms of Kaffa and Janjero; he also cites evidence to show that 7,000 people a year were sold each year, some to people inside Ethiopia, and some outside that country.\n\nThe Gibe region, with the rest of southwestern Ethiopia, was almost entirely annexed between 1886 and 1900 in a series of conquests by the generals of Emperor Menelik II. The kingdom of Jimma, through skillful diplomacy, managed to delay this fate until the death of its king Abba Jifar II in 1932.\n"}

GEOSS seeks to connect the producers of environmental data and decision-support tools with the end users of these products, with the aim of enhancing the relevance of Earth observations to global issues. GEOSS aims to produce a global public infrastructure that generates comprehensive, near-real-time environmental data, information and analyses for a wide range of users. The Secretariat Director of Geoss is Barbara Ryan.\n\nEarth observation systems consist of instruments and models designed to measure, monitor and predict the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the Earth system. Buoys floating in the oceans monitor temperature and salinity; meteorological stations and balloons record air quality and rainwater trends; sonar and radar systems estimate fish and bird populations; seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) stations record movements in the Earth’s crust and interior; some 60-plus high-tech environmental satellites scan the planet from space; powerful computerized models generate simulations and forecasts; and early warning systems issue alerts to vulnerable populations.\n\nThese various systems have typically operated in isolation from one another. In recent years, however, sophisticated new technologies for gathering vast quantities of near-real-time and high-resolution Earth observation data have become operational. At the same time, improved forecasting models and decision-support tools are increasingly allowing decision makers and other users of Earth observations to fully exploit this widening stream of information.\n\nWith investments in Earth observations now reaching a critical mass, it has become possible to link diverse observing systems together to paint a full picture of the Earth’s condition. Because the costs and logistics of expanding Earth observations are daunting for any single nation, linking systems together through international cooperation also offers cost savings.\n\nAs a networked system, GEOSS is owned by all of the GEO Members and Participating Organizations. Partners maintain full control of the components and activities that they contribute to the system of systems. Implementation is being pursued through a Work Plan consisting of over 70 tasks. Each task supports one of the nine societal-benefit or four transverse areas and is carried out by interested Members and Participating Organizations. Governments and organizations have also advanced GEOSS by contributing a variety of “Early Achievements”; these “First 100 Steps to GEOSS” were presented to the 2007 Cape Town Ministerial Summit.\n\nInterlinking observation systems requires common standards for architecture and data sharing. The architecture of an Earth observation system refers to the way in which its components are designed so that they function as a whole. Each GEOSS component must be included in the GEOSS registry and configured so that it can communicate with the other participating systems. In addition, each contributor to GEOSS must subscribe to the GEO data-sharing principles, which aim to ensure the full and open exchange of data, metadata and products. These issues are fundamental to the successful operation of GEOSS.\n\nGEOSS will disseminate information and analyses directly to users. GEO is developing the GEOPortal as a single Internet gateway to the data produced by GEOSS. The purpose of GEOPortal is to make it easier to integrate diverse data sets, identify relevant data and portals of contributing systems, and access models and other decision-support tools. For users without good access to high-speed internet, GEO has established GEONETCast, a system of four communications satellites that transmit data to low-cost receiving stations maintained by the users.\n\nAt present, GEONETCast seems still in its infancy, yet some tools have already been worked out. The GEONETCast toolbox has been made available and contains tools to access some radar altimetry, vegetation, satellite prediction and maritime information. Other useful information available through GEONETCast is vegetation and desert locust information provided under the DevCoCast project, which is a subproject of GEONETCast.\n\nThe growing demand for Earth observation data and information is the driving force behind GEOSS. The GEOSS Implementation Plan identifies nine distinct groups of users and uses, which it calls “Societal Benefit Areas”. The nine areas are disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. Current and potential users include decision makers in the public and private sectors, resource managers, planners, emergency responders and scientists.\n\nGEOSS can be characterized as a contribution towards the establishment of a spatial data infrastructure. \nIt is one of three related initiatives that are the subject of the GIGAS (GEOSS, INSPIRE and GMES an Action in Support) harmonization project under the auspices of the EU 7th Framework Programme.\n\n\n"}

The heliotrope was invented in 1821 by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The word \"heliotrope\" is taken from the Greek: \"helios\" (), meaning \"sun\", and \"tropos\" (), meaning \"turn\". It is a fitting name for an instrument which can be used to \"turn\" incoming sunlight (via reflection).\n\nHeliotropes were used in surveys from Gauss's survey in Germany in 1821 through the late 1980s, when GPS measurements replaced the use of the heliotrope in long distance surveys. Colonel Sir George Everest introduced the use of heliotropes into the Great Trigonometric Survey in India around 1831, and the US Coast and Geographic Survey used heliotropes to survey the United States. The Indian specification for heliotropes was updated in 1981, and the American military specification for heliotropes (MIL-H-20194E) was retired on 8 December 1995.\n\nSurveyors used the heliotrope as a specialized form of survey target; it was employed during large triangulation surveys where, because of the great distance between stations (usually twenty miles or more), a regular target would be indistinct or invisible. Heliotropes were often used as survey targets at ranges of over 100 miles. In California, in 1878, a heliotrope on Mount Saint Helena was surveyed by B.A. Colonna of the USCGS from Mount Shasta, a distance of 192 miles (309 km).\n\nThe heliotrope was limited to use on sunny days and was further limited (in regions of high temperatures) to mornings and afternoons when atmospheric aberration least affected the instrument-man's line of sight. The heliotrope operator was called a \"heliotroper\" or \"flasher\" and would sometimes employ a second mirror for communicating with the instrument station through heliography, a signalling system using impulsed reflecting surfaces. The inventor of the heliograph, a similar instrument specialized for signaling, was inspired by observing the use of heliotropes in the survey of India.\n\n\n"}

This ensures that only the installed app (not the iBeacon transmitter) can track users, potentially against their will, as they passively walk around the transmitters.\n\niBeacon compatible transmitters come in a variety of form factors, including small coin cell devices, USB sticks, and generic Bluetooth 4.0 capable USB dongles.\nAn iBeacon deployment consists of one or more iBeacon devices that transmit their own unique identification number to the local area. Software on a receiving device may then look up the iBeacon and perform various functions, such as notifying the user. Receiving devices can also connect to the iBeacons to retrieve values from iBeacon's GATT (generic attribute profile) service. iBeacons do not push notifications to receiving devices (other than their own identity). However, mobile software can use signals received from iBeacons to trigger their own push notifications.\n\nRegion monitoring is limited to 20 regions and can function in the background (of the listening device) and has different delegates to notify the listening app (and user) of entry/exit in the region - even if the app is in the background or the phone is locked. Region monitoring also allows for a small window in which iOS gives a closed app an opportunity to react to the entry of a region.\n\nAs opposed to monitoring, which enables users to detect movement in-and-out of range of the beacons, ranging provides a list of beacons detected in a given region, along with the estimated distance from the user's device to each beacon. Ranging works only in the foreground but will return (to the listening device) an array (unlimited) of all iBeacons found along with their properties (UUID, etc.)\n\nAn iOS device receiving an iBeacon transmission can approximate the distance from the iBeacon. The distance (between transmitting iBeacon and receiving device) is categorized into 3 distinct ranges:\n\nAn iBeacon broadcast has the ability to approximate when a user has entered, exited, or lingered in region. Depending on a customer's proximity to a beacon, they are able to receive different levels of interaction at each of these three ranges.\n\nThe maximum range of an iBeacon transmission will depend on the location and placement, obstructions in the environment and where the device is being stored (e.g. in a leather handbag or with a thick case). Standard beacons have an approximate range of 70 meters. Long range beacons can reach up to 450 meters.\n\nThe frequency of the iBeacon transmission depends on the configuration of the iBeacon and can be altered using device specific methods. Both the rate and the transmit power have an effect on the iBeacon battery life. iBeacons come with predefined settings and several of them can be changed by the developer, including the rate, the transmit power, and the Major and Minor values. The Major and Minor values are settings which can be used to connect to specific iBeacons or to work with more than one iBeacon at the same time. Typically, multiple iBeacon deployment at a venue will have the same UUID, and use the major and minor pairs to segment and distinguish subspaces within the venue. For example, the Major values of all the iBeacons in a specific store can be set to the same value and the Minor value can be used to identify a specific iBeacon within the store.\n\nThe Bluetooth LE protocol is significantly more power efficient than Bluetooth Classic. Several chipsets makers, including Texas Instruments and Nordic Semiconductor now supply chipsets optimized for iBeacon use. Power consumption depends on iBeacon configuration parameters of advertising interval and transmit power. A study on 16 different iBeacon vendors reports that battery life can range between 1–24 months. Apple's recommended setting of 100 ms advertising interval with a coin cell battery provides for 1–3 months of life, which increases to 2–3 years as advertising interval is increased to 900 ms.\n\nBattery consumption of the phones is a factor that must be taken into account when deploying beacon-enabled apps. A recent report has shown that\nolder phones tend to draw more battery in the vicinity of iBeacons, while the newer phones can be more efficient in the same environment. In addition to the time spent by the phone scanning, number of scans and number of beacons in the vicinity are also significant factors for battery drain, as pointed out by the Aislelabs report. \nIn a follow-up report, Aislelabs found a drastic improvement in battery consumption for iPhone5S, iPhone 5C versus the older model iPhone 4S.\nAt 10 surrounding iBeacons, iPhone 4S can consume up to 11% of battery per hour whereas iPhone5S consumes a little less than 5% battery per hour.\nAn energy efficient iBeacon application needs to consider these aspects in order to strike a good balance between app responsiveness and battery consumption.\n\nIn mid-2013 Apple introduced iBeacons and experts wrote about how it is designed to help the retail industry by simplifying payments and enabling on-site offers. On December 6, 2013, Apple activated iBeacons across its 254 US retail stores. McDonald's has used the devices to give special offers to consumers in its fast-food stores.\n\nAs of May 2014, different hardware iBeacons can be purchased for as little as $5 per device to more than $30 per device.\nEach of these different iBeacons have varying default settings for their default transmit power and iBeacon advertisement frequency. Some hardware iBeacons advertise at as low as 1 Hz while others can be as fast as 10 Hz.\n\niBeacon technology is still in its infancy. One well reported software quirk exists on 4.2 and 4.3 Android systems whereby the system's bluetooth stack crashes when presented with many iBeacons. This was reportedly fixed in Android 4.4.4.\n\nBluetooth low energy devices can operate in an advertisement mode to notify nearby devices of their presence.\nAt the simplest form, an iBeacon is a Bluetooth low energy device emitting advertisement following a strict format, that being an Apple defined iBeacon prefix, followed by a variable UUID, and a major, minor pair. An example iBeacon advertisement frame could look like:\nwhere fb0b57a2-8228-44 cd-913a-94a122ba1206 is the UUID.\nSince iBeacon advertisement is just an application of the general Bluetooth low energy advertisement, the above iBeacon can be emitted by issuing the following command on Linux to a supported Bluetooth 4 Low Energy device on a modern kernel.\nDevices running the Android operating system prior to version 4.3 can only receive iBeacon advertisements but cannot emit iBeacon advertisements. Android 5.0 (\"Lollipop\") added the support for both central and peripheral modes.\n\nFor retransmission interval setting (first of above commands) to work again, the transmission must be stopped with\n\nByte 0-2: Standard BLE Flags\nByte 3-29: Apple Defined iBeacon Data\n\nUnlike iOS, Android does not have native iBeacon support. Due to this, to use iBeacon on Android, a developer either has to use an existing library or create code that parses BLE packets to find iBeacon advertisements.\nBLE support was introduced in Android Jelly Bean with major bug fixes in Android KitKat. Stability improvement and additional BLE features have been progressively added there after, with a major stability improvement in version 6.01 of Android Marshmallow that prevents inter-app connection leaking.\n\nBy design, the iBeacon advertisement frame is plainly visible.\nThis leaves the door open for interested parties to capture, copy and reproduce the iBeacon advertisement frames at different physical locations.\nThis can be done simply by issuing the right sequence of commands to compatible Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongles.\nSuccessful spoofing of Apple store iBeacons was reported in February 2014.\nThis is not a security flaw in the iBeacon per se, but application developers must keep this in mind when designing their applications with iBeacons.\n\nPayPal has taken a more robust approach, where the iBeacon is purely the start of a complex security negotiation (Challenge–response authentication). This is not likely to be hacked, nor is it likely that it would be disrupted by copies of beacons.\n\nListening for iBeacon can be achieved using the following commands with a modern Linux distribution:\nOn another terminal, launch the protocol dump program:\n\nThe MAC address of the iBeacon along with its iBeacon payload is clearly identifiable. The sequence of commands in technical details can then be used to reproduce the iBeacon frame.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1312499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1312499", "title": "Karoo", "text": "Karoo\n\nThe Karoo ( ; from a Khoikhoi word, possibly \"garo\" \"desert\") is a semi desert natural region of South Africa. No exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo is available, so its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo is partly defined by its topography, geology and climate, and above all, its low rainfall, arid air, cloudless skies, and extremes of heat and cold. The Karoo also hosted a well-preserved ecosystem hundreds of million years ago which is now represented by many fossils.\n\nThe Karoo formed an almost impenetrable barrier to the interior from Cape Town, and the early adventurers, explorers, hunters, and travelers on the way to the Highveld unanimously denounced it as a frightening place of great heat, great frosts, great floods, and great droughts. Today, it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 and 250 mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 to 500 mm higher than on the plains. However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible. \nThe xerophytic vegetation consists of aloes, mesembryanthemums, crassulas, euphorbias, stapelias, and desert ephemerals, spaced 50 cm or more apart, and becoming very sparse going northwards into Bushmanland and, from there, into the Kalahari Desert. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the Great Escarpment and the Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges, called the Tankwa Karoo, which receives only 75 mm of rain annually. The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland. The typical Karoo vegetation used to support large game, sometimes in vast herds.\n\nToday, sheep thrive on the xerophytes, though each sheep requires about 4 ha of grazing to sustain itself.\n\nThe Karoo is distinctivly divided into the Great Karoo and the Little Karoo by the Swartberg Mountain Range, which runs east-west, parallel to the southern coastline, but is separated from the sea by another east-west range called the Outeniqua–Langeberg Mountains. The Great Karoo lies to the north of the Swartberg range; the Little Karoo is to the south of it.\n\nThe only sharp and definite boundary of the Great Karoo is formed by the most inland ranges of Cape Fold Mountains to the south and south-west. The extent of the Karoo to the north is vague, fading gradually and almost imperceptibly into the increasingly arid Bushmanland towards the north-west. To the north and north-east, it fades into the savannah and grasslands of Griqualand West and the Highveld. The boundary to the east grades into the grasslands of the Eastern Midlands.\nThe Great Karoo is itself divided by the Great Escarpment into the Upper Karoo (generally above 1200–1500 m) and the Lower Karoo on the plains below at 700–800 m.\nA great many local names, each denoting different subregions of the Great Karoo, exist, some more widely, or more generally, known than others. In the Lower Karoo, going from west to east, they are the Tankwa Karoo, the Moordenaarskaroo, the Koup, the Vlakte, and the Camdeboo Plains. The Hantam, Kareeberge, Roggeveld, and uweveldare the better known subregions of the Upper Karoo, though most of it is simply known as the Upper Karoo, especially in the north.\n\nThe Little Karoo’s boundaries are sharply defined by mountain ranges to the west, north, and south. The road between Uniondale and Willowmore is considered, by convention, to form the approximate arbitrary eastern extremity of the Little Karoo. Its extent is much smaller than that of the Great Karoo. Locally, it is usually called the \"Klein Karoo\", which is Afrikaans for Little Karoo.\n\nThe Great Karoo straddles the 30° S parallel on the west of the continent, in a similar position to other semidesert areas on earth, north and south of the equator. It is furthermore in the rainfall shadow of the Cape Fold Mountains along the western coastline. \nThe western \"Lower Karoo\" (the Tankwa Karoo and Moordenaarskaroo) contain remnants of the Cape Fold Mountains (e.g. the Witteberg and Anysberg Mountains) which give it a moderate hilly appearance, but further east, the Lower Karoo becomes a monotonously flat plain. The \"Upper Karoo\" has been intruded by dolerite sills (see below), creating multiple flat-topped hills, or Karoo Koppies, which are iconic of the Great Karoo.\n\nThe vegetation of the Upper is similar to the Lower Karoo, so few people make a distinction between the two.\n\nThe main highway (the N1) and railway line from Cape Town to the north enter the Lower Karoo from the Hex River Valley just before Touws River and follow a course about 50 km south of the Great Escarpment up to Beaufort West. Thereafter, they gradually ascend the Great Escarpment along a broad valley to Three Sisters on the Central Plateau and the Upper Karoo.\n\nTurning north from the N1 between Touws River and Beaufort West, at Matjiesfontein, the road ascends the Great Escarpment through the Verlatenkloof Pass to reach Sutherland, at 1456 m above sea level, which is reputedly the coldest town in South Africa with average minimum temperatures of -6.1 °C during winter. Parts of eastern the Mpumalangan Highveld do at times experience lower temperatures than Sutherland, but not as consistently as Sutherland does. Snowfalls are not infrequent during the southern winter months. The South African Astronomical Observatory has an emplacement of telescopes about 20 km east of the town, on a small plateau 1798 m above sea level, and is home to the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere. To the north, still on the Plateau, and 75 km north-west of Carnarvon, seven radio dishes form part of the Square Kilometer Array which will, 2500 in total, be scattered in other parts of South Africa and Australia, to survey the southern skies at radio frequencies. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, one of the main targets of this enterprise, is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe Upper Karoo is indeed an ideal site for an astronomical observatory. This is not only because of the clear skies, absence of artificial lights, and high altitude, but it is also tectonically completely inactive, meaning that there are no fault lines or volcanoes are nearby, so no earth tremors or earthquakes occur, even at great distances.\n\nThe Little Karoo is separated from the Great Karoo by the Swartberg Mountain range. \nGeographically, it is a 290-km-long valley, only 40–60 km wide, formed by two parallel Cape Fold Mountain ranges, the Swartberg to the north, and the continuous Langeberg-Outeniqua range to the south. The northern strip of the valley, within 10–20 km from the foot of the Swartberg mountains is least karoo-like, in that it is a well-watered area both from the rain and the many streams that cascade down the mountain, or through narrow defiles in the Swartberg from the Great Karoo. The main towns of the region are situated along this northern strip of the Little Karoo: Montagu, Barrydale, Ladismith, Calitzdorp, Oudtshoorn, and De Rust, as well as such well-known mission stations such as Zoar, Amalienstein, and Dysselsdorp.\nThe southern 30– to 50-km-wide strip, north of the Langeberg range, is as arid as the western Lower Karoo, except in the east, where the Langeberg range (arbitrarily) starts to be called the Outeniqua Mountains.\n\nThe Little Karoo can only be accessed by road through the narrow defiles cut through the surrounding Cape Fold Mountains by ancient, but still flowing, rivers. A few roads traverse the mountains over passes, the most famous and impressive of which is the Swartberg Pass between Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo and Prince Albert on the other side of the Swartberg mountains in the Great Karoo. Also, the main road between Oudtshoorn and George, on the coastal plain, crosses the mountains to the south via the Outeniqua Pass. The only exit from the Little Karoo that does not involve crossing a mountain range is through the 150-km-long, narrow Langkloof valley between Uniondale and Humansdorp, near Plettenberg Bay.\n\nIn geological terms, the Karoo Supergroup refers to an extensive and geologically recent (180–310 million years old) sequence of sedimentary and igneous rocks, which is flanked to the south by the Cape Fold Mountains, and to the north by the more ancient Ventersdorp Lavas, the Transvaal Supergroup and Waterberg Supergroup. It covers two-thirds of South Africa and extends in places to 8000 m below the land surface, constituting an immense volume of rocks which was formed, geologically speaking, in a short period of time.\nAlthough almost the whole of the Great Karoo is situated on Karoo Supergroup rocks, the geological Karoo rocks extend over a very much larger area, both within South Africa and Lesotho, but also beyond its borders and onto other continents that formed part of Gondwana.\n\nThe Karoo Supergroup was formed in vast inland basin starting 320 million years ago, at a time when the part of Gondwana which would eventually become Africa lay over the South Pole. Icebergs that had calved off the glaciers and ice sheets to the north deposited a 1-km-thick layer of mud containing dropstones of varying origins and sizes into this basin. This became the Dwyka Group consisting primarily of tillite, the lowermost layer of the Karoo Supergroup. As Gondwana drifted northwards, the basin turned into an inland sea with extensive swampy deltas along its northern shores. The peat in these swamps eventually turned into large deposits of coal which are mined in KwaZulu-Natal and on the Highveld. This 3-km-thick layer is known as the Ecca Group, which is overlain by the 5.6-km-thick Beaufort Group, laid down on a vast plain with Mississippi-like rivers depositing mud from an immense range of mountains to the south. Ancient reptiles and amphibians prospered in the wet forests, and their remains have made the Karoo famous amongst palaeontologists. The first of these Karoo fossils was discovered in 1838 by Scots-born Andrew Geddes Bain at a road cutting near Fort Beaufort. He sent his specimens to the British Museum, where fellow Scotsman Robert Broom recognised the Karoo fossils' mammal-like characteristics in 1897.\n\nAfter the Beaufort period, Southern Africa (still part of Gondwana) became an arid sand desert with only ephemeral rivers and pans. These sands consolidated to form the Stormberg Group, the remnants of which are found only in the immediate vicinity of Lesotho. Several dinosaur nests, containing eggs, some with dinosaur fetal skeletons in them, have been found in these rocks, near what had once been a swampy pan.\n\nFinally, about 180 million years ago, volcanic activity took place on a titanic scale, which brought an end to a flourishing reptile evolution. These genera represent some of the extinct, mainly predinosaur, animals of the Karoo:\nKaroo Koppies hills are capped by hard, erosion-resistant dolerite sills. This is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the Karoo’s geology. This occurred about 180 million years ago, when huge volumes of lava were extruded over most of Southern Africa and adjoining regions of Gondwana, both on the surface and deep below the surface between the sedimentary strata. Since this massive extrusion of lava, Southern Africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion, exposing the older, softer rocks, except where they were protected by a cap of dolerite. The genera present include:\n\nThe lava outpourings that ended the Karoo deposition of rocks, not only covered the African surface, and other parts of Gondwana with a 1.6 km thick layer basaltic lava, but it also forced its way, under high pressure, between the horizontal layers of sedimentary rocks belonging to the Ecca and Beaufort groups, to solidify into dolerite sills. The long vertical fissures through which the lava welled up solidified into dikes which resemble the Great Wall of China from the air. \nFrom about 150 million years ago the South African surface has been subjected to an almost uninterrupted period of erosion, particularly during the past 20 million years, shaving off many kilometers of sediments. This exposed the dolerite sills, which were more resistant to erosion than the Karoo sediments, forming one of the most characteristic features of the Karoo landscape, namely the flat topped hills, called \"Karoo Koppies\".\n\nThe geology of the region bears no resemblance to that of the Great Karoo (see the diagram on the left, of a NS geological cross-section through the Little and Great Karoos). The valley is an integral part of the Cape Fold Mountain Belt, with the two ranges on either side composed of extremely hard, erosion-resistant, quartzitic sandstone belonging to the 450- to 510-million-year-old Table Mountain Group (i.e. the oldest layer of the Cape Supergroup). The valley floor is covered, in the main, by the next (younger) layer of the Supergroup, namely the much softer Bokkeveld shales. The dolerite of the Great Karoo did not penetrate these rocks, so Karoo Koppies are not seen in the Little Karoo.\n\nThe Little Karoo contains two other geological features that give the landscape a special character. During the erosion of the African interior following the bulging of the continent during the massive lava outpourings that ended the Karoo sedimentation 180 million years ago, some of the eroded material was trapped in the valleys of the Cape Fold Mountains, especially during the Cretaceous period, about to years (Ma) ago. These \"Enon Conglomerates\", as they are known, were deposited by high energy, fast flowing rivers, and are found between Calitzdorp and Oudtshoorn, where they form the strikingly red \"Redstone Hills\".\n\nThe second special geological feature that marks the Little Karoo is the 300-km-long fault line along the southern edge of the Swartberg Mountains. The Swartberg Mountains were lifted up along this fault, to such an extent that in the Oudtshoorn region, the rocks that form the base of the Cape Supergroup are exposed. These are locally known as the Cango Group, but are probably continuous with the Malmesbury Group that forms the base of Table Mountain on the Cape Peninsula, and similar outcrops in the Western Cape. In the Little Karoo, the outcrop is composed of limestone, into which an underground stream has carved the impressively extensive Cango Caves.\n\nThe Great Karoo and Little Karoo lie almost entirely within two of South Africa’s eight botanical biomes,\nnamely the Succulent Karoo biome and the Nama Karoo biome, both of which, like the Karoo Geological System, are more extensive than the geographical or historical Karoo described in South African atlases and guide books (compare the map on the right with the map at the beginning of the article).\n\nThe Succulent Karoo biome runs along the West Coast, from approximately Lamberts Bay northwards to over 200 km into southern Namibia. It starts in the south just north of the Sandveld geographical region, about 250 km north of Cape Town, and continues through Namaqualand, the Richtersveld, immediately south of the Orange River, and on into the Namaqualand or Namaland region of southern Namibia. None of these regions is ever referred to, either geographically or locally, as \"Karoo\". However, it has a major extension inland into the Tankwa Karoo and Moordenaarskaroo regions of the Lower Karoo, and adjoining Upper Karoo region of the geographic Great Karoo. It also occurs to the south, in part of the Breede River Valley, as the Robertson Karoo. From here, it continues eastwards into the western half of the Little Karoo. \n\nThe Succulent Karoo biome is dominated by dwarf, leafy-succulent shrubs, and annuals, predominantly Asteraceae, popularly known as Namaqualand daisies, which put on spectacular flower displays covering vast stretches of the landscape in the southern spring-time (August–September) after good rains in the winter. Grasses are uncommon, making most of the biome unsuitable for grazing. The low rainfall, in fact, discourages most forms of agriculture. An exception is the thriving ostrich-farming industry in the Little Karoo, which is heavily dependent on supplementary feeding with lucerne. The difference between the Succulent Karoo biome and the Nama Karoo biome is that the former receives the little rain that falls as cyclonic rainfall in winter, which has less erosive power than the infrequent but violent summer thunderstorms of the Nama Karoo. Frost is also less common in the Succulent Karoo biome than in the Nama Karoo biome. The number of mainly succulent plant species is very high for an arid area of this size anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Nama Karoo biome is located entirely on the central plateau mostly at altitudes between 1000 and 1500 m. It incorporates nearly the whole of the historical and geographical Great Karoo, but also includes a portion of southern Namibia's Namaqualand, and South Africa's Bushmanland\" (both local geographical names, not names of biomes). It is the second-largest biome in South Africa, and forms the botanical transition between the Fynbos biome to the south and the savannah biome to the north. It is defined primarily by the dominance of dwarf (less than 1 m high) shrubs with a codominance of grasses especially towards the north-east and east where it grades into the grassland biome of the Highveld and the Eastern Midlands. The shrubs and grasses are deciduous, mainly in response to the irregular rainfall. \nMuch of the Nama Karoo biome is used for sheep and goat farming, providing mutton, wool, and pelts for local and international markets, especially since livestock can frequently be provided with a regular supply of water from boreholes. Overgrazing exacerbates the erosion caused by the violent thunderstorms that occur, infrequently, in the summer. It also promotes the replacement of the grasses by shrubs, especially the less edible varieties such as the threethorn (\"Rhigozum trichotomum\"), bitterbos (\"Chrysocoma ciliate\"), and sweet thorn (\"Acacia karroo\"). However, there are few rare or Red Data Book plant species in the Nama Karoo biome.\n\nThe Great Karoo used to support a large variety of antelope (particularly the springbok), the quagga, and other large game, especially on the grassy flats in the east. Francois Le Vaillant, the famous French explorer, naturalist, and ornithologist, who traveled through the Great Karoo in the 1780s, killed a hippopotamus in the Great Fish River in the Karoo (and ate its foot for breakfast). He also recorded that he saw the spoor of a rhinoceros near Cranemere, in the Camdeboo Plains (eastern Lower Karoo). Elephant tusks have been found by farmers in the Camdeboo district, but no records exist of any having been seen alive in that region.\nThe quagga roamed the Karoo in great numbers together with wildebeest and ostriches, which always seemed to accompany them. These quagga seemed gentle and easy to domesticate. (A pair of quagga was used to draw a horse carriage through London, more for curiosity than for any superiority the quagga might have had over a horse.) They were consequently also easy prey for hunters, who hunted them for sport rather than their meat. By the middle of the 1800s, they were almost extinct, and in 1883, the last one died in an Amsterdam zoo.\nProbably the strangest and most puzzling zoological phenomenon in the Great Karoo was the periodic, unpredictable appearance of massive springbok migrations. These migrations always came from the north, and could either go west towards Namaqualand and the sea, south-west through towns such as Beaufort West, or south through the Camdeboo district. These vast herds moved steadily and inexorably across the plains, trampling all before them, including their own kind. Le Vaillant gave the first eye-witness account of such a migration in 1782. He rode through the herd filling the Plains of Camdeboo, seeing neither the beginning nor end of the moving mass.\n\nIn 1849, a massive herd of springbok, amongst which were intermingled wildebeest, blesbok, quagga, and eland, moved through Beaufort West. Early one morning, the town was awakened to a sound like that of a strong wind, and suddenly the town was filled with animals. They devoured every sprig of foliage in the town and surrounding countryside. The last of the continuously moving herd left the town 3 days later, to disappear towards the west. The Karoo looked as if a fire had swept through it. During these migrations, the plains and hillsides on every side were thickly covered by one vast mass of springbok, packed like sheep in a fold. As far as the eye could see, the landscape was alive with them. \nDuring these migrations, the springbok never ran or trotted. On the whole, they were silent, except for the shudder of their stamping hoofs. Nothing could divert them, and hunters could ride amongst them, shooting them at random, without apparently causing alarm. People could move amongst them and kill them with sticks, or cripple them by seizing a leg and breaking it. Not only people followed these herds for the easy meat they provided, but also lions, leopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs, hyenas, and jackals preyed on them.\n\nNo one knew how, why, or where these migrations started, nor where they ended, nor did anyone know if these animals ever returned to where they had started. The migrations were always unidirectional, from north of the Great Karoo.\n\nGreat locust swarms also frequently invaded or arose in the Great Karoo, and still occur from time to time today.\n\nThe riverine rabbit, a critically endangered animal, lives exclusively in seasonal river basins and a very particular set of scrubland in the central semiarid region in the Karoo. It is hunted by falconiformes and Verreaux's eagles. Its numbers have been consistently lowering due to destruction of its habitat. They are unique relative to similar species through how they are polygamous and how each female can only produce one or two offspring per year.\n\nThe introduction of the windpump to tap the Great Karoo’s underground water resources in the late 1800s made permanent human habitation and sheep farming possible over large parts of the Great Karoo for the first time. As a result, the teeming number of large antelope in the Karoo has dwindled into insignificance, and with them, the large carnivores have all but disappeared. Today, the caracal (7–19 kg), black-backed jackal (6–10 kg), Verreaux's eagle (3.0–5.8 kg) and the martial eagle (3.0–6.2 kg) are arguably the largest predators likely to be seen in the Great Karoo today. Leopards (20–90 kg) do occur, especially in the mountains, but are very secretive, so are rarely seen. Many of the animals that formerly inhabited the Karoo in large numbers, including lions, have been reintroduced to the area in nature reserves and game farms.\n\nAs in the Great Karoo, antelope and other big game inhabited the Little Karoo in the past. However, the dominant zebra was not the quagga, but the Cape mountain zebra, (\"Equus zebra zebra\") which is adapted for life on rugged, mountainous terrain. Their hooves are harder and faster-growing than those of Burchell’s zebra (\"Equus quagga burchellii\"), which lives on the plains. The two species are, therefore, rarely seen in the same habitat. The quagga is closely related to Burchell's zebra, and appears also to have been confined to the plains.\n\nThe mountain zebra occurred in the mountain regions of the Cape Fold Belt and along the southern portion of the Great Escarpment. Thus, they were endemic to, amongst others, the western Lower Karoo and the Little Karoo. However, they were hunted to near extinction, leaving fewer than 100 individuals by the 1930s. Conservation efforts since then brought their numbers up to 1200 by 1998, mainly by concentrating these zebra in nature reserves and protected areas, the most well-known of these being the Mountain Zebra National Park near Cradock in the Great Karoo. Cape mountain zebras are still found in protected areas managed by Cape Nature, including the Kamanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserves.\n\nThe ostrich]is found throughout Africa, but the most handsome specimens came from the Little Karoo, where the dry weather, but plentiful water in the streams formed an ideal habitat for these large, flightless birds. Here, they grow to over 2 m in height, and weigh over 100 kg. The male’s feathers have been prized by many cultures in Africa, Europe ,and Asia over thousands of years. In the 1860s, a farmer in the Graaff-Reinet district was apparently the first person to demonstrate that the ostrich could successfully be domesticated, bred in captivity, and the eggs hatched in incubators, while still producing the magnificent feathers. This idea was quickly adopted by farmers in the Little Karoo, where they started growing lucerne as the birds’ favorite food. During 1880, no less than 74,000 kg of feathers were exported, and in 1904, it passed the 210,000-kg mark.\nThe First World War brought about a slump in the ostrich feather market, but the industry recovered in later years, when not only the feathers were sought after, but also ostrich leather, and its meat, which is very tasty, and a major export item. Today, several farms can be visited by tourists, near Oudtshoorn, the center of the ostrich industry.\n\nThe first European settlers landed in the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, and between 1659 and 1664, made several unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the Great Karoo from the south-west. The Europeans who first entered the Great Karoo did so from the south-east (traveling north from Algoa Bay), which is slightly less arid than the western Karoo. These were the \"trekboers\" of the mid-1700s, who led a nomadic existence, enduring great hardships in the relentless aridity, the intense heat (such that even their dogs could not walk on the scorching ground and had to be lifted into the overcrowded wagons), and the bitter cold in winter, especially at night. Before that time, the only inhabitants were the Khoisan, who lived in small family groups and, it is believed, remained largely in their own \"territories\", killing their own game, and gathering bulbs and roots and drinking from a spring or other water source within their territory. Sometimes these territories were very large and the family group moved from one part to the other. Their only domestic animals were dogs. The Bantu people to the east of the Great Karoo did not occupy this arid region due to the scarce rainfall which prevented the farming of cattle.\n\nIn 1854, Daniel Halladay invented the multibladed windpump (windmill) in the USA. It was perfected in 1883, and soon South Africa (and elsewhere) produced them in large numbers. These windpumps transformed the Great Karoo, making permanent settlement and stock farming (predominantly sheep) possible over large parts of the Karoo for the first time. Like the Karoo Koppie, the multibladed windpump became an iconic feature of the Great Karoo.\nSheep farming and the fencing off of the land have meant that antelope numbers have dwindled significantly, and with them, the big carnivores. Leopards still occur in the mountains, but lions now only occur in nature reserves, where they have been recently reintroduced into the Great Karoo.\nIn 1872, construction was started to connect the Cape Colony’s coastal railway system with the diamond fields in Kimberley, The new line started in Worcester and entered the Lower Karoo through the Hex River valley, where it followed a course almost midway between the Swartberg Mountains to the south and the Great Escarpment to the north. Along the way, it passed through the quaint Victorian village of Matjiesfontein, with the historic Lord Miner Hotel, which is still operational today. The railway reached this point in 1878, before proceeding to Beaufort West at the foot of the Great Escarpment. From there, it reached the top of the African Plateau near Three Sisters along a valley with such a low gradient that passengers were (and still are) hardly aware that they were ascending the Great Escarpment. From there it continued through the Upper Karoo, to De Aar, and crossed the Orange River at Hopetown, where South Africa’s first diamond, the Eureka Diamond, was found. The Orange River, at this point, forms the local unofficial boundary between the Great Karoo and the Highveld.\n\nThe line reached Kimberley in 1885, and has since been extended via Botswana (then Bechuanaland) to reach Zimbabwe and Zambia (when they were still known as South and North Rhodesia), and branch lines have been constructed to Namibia and Port Elizabeth through a hub at De Aar, in the Great Karoo. Further branch lines were later built from points further north to Bloemfontein, Durban, and, of course, to Johannesburg.\nDuring the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902, three Republican commando units, reinforced by the sympathizers (\"rebels\") from the Cape Colony, conducted widespread operations throughout the Karoo. Countless skirmishes took place in the region, with the Calvinia magisterial district, in particular, contributing a significant number of fighters to the Republican cause. Fought both conventionally and as a guerrilla struggle over the Karoo's vast expanses, it was a bloody war of attrition wherein both sides used newly developed technologies to their advantage. Numerous abandoned blockhouses can still be seen at strategic locations, especially along the railway line, throughout the Great Karoo. A prime example still \"guards\" a bridge over the Buffels River, to the east of the town of Laingsburg, in the Lower Karoo, between Matjiesfontein and Beaufort West.\n\nRecently, nature reserves and game farms have been established in many parts of the Great Karoo, turning what was once regarded as a forbiddingly desolate and unattractive geographical barrier into a tourist destination.\n\nThis area was explored by European settlers in the late 17th century, who encountered the Khoisan people as the original inhabitants of this area. The latter called the Swartberg Mountains \"kango\" meaning \"a place rich in water\". The Cango Caves in the Swartberg Mountains are named after this Khoisan word.\n\nThe Little Karoo, and especially Oudtshoorn, became synonymous with the ostrich-feather industry in the 1880s. The resulting \"feather millionaires\" built Victorian \"Feather Palaces\" all over town, using the red rocks belonging to the Enon Conglomerate, and related Kirkwood Formation, to build them. These grand red palaces and other buildings in Oudtshoorn can still be admired today.\n\nA railway line was built to connect Calitzdorp and Oudtshoorn, to Willowmore and from there, via Klipplaat, to Port Elizabeth, from where the ostrich feathers from the Little Karoo’s ostrich farms could be exported to Europe. That line is no longer in use today.\n\nThe Swartberg Pass was built, with convict labor, between 1881 and 1888 by Thomas Bain, son of the famous Andrew Geddes Bain, who built Bain's Kloof Pass and many others in the Western Cape. The main motivation for building the pass was to provide an all-weather road connection between the southern Great Karoo, and Oudtshoorn (and from there to the sea). The two alternative roads, through the Meiringspoort and the Seweweekspoort defiles, were subject to periodic flooding, after heavy thunderstorms in the Great Karoo. The Swartberg Pass is not tarred and can be treacherously slippery after rain. It also becomes impassable after heavy snowfalls on the mountain, a not infrequent occurrence in winter.\n\nPoet Thomas Hardy wrote of the Karoo in his poem \"Drummer Hodge\".\n\nIn \"Bridge-Guard in the Karroo\", Rudyard Kipling evoked the loneliness experienced by blockhouse soldiers at Ketting station on the Dwyka River while guarding the Karoo railway track, a lifeline during the South African War (excerpts).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "187230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187230", "title": "Kerch Strait", "text": "Kerch Strait\n\nThe Kerch Strait (, , ) is a strait connecting the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, separating the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea in the west from the Taman Peninsula of Russia's Krasnodar Krai in the east. The strait is to wide and up to deep.\n\nThe most important harbor, the Crimean city of Kerch, gives its name to the strait, formerly known as the Cimmerian Bosporus. The Krasnodar Krai side of the strait contains the Taman Bay encircled by Tuzla Island and the 2003 Russian-built -long dam to the south and Chushka Spit to the north. Russia had started the construction of a major cargo port near Taman, the most important Russian settlement on the strait.\n\nThe straits are about long and are wide at the narrowest and separate an eastern extension of Crimea from Taman, the westernmost extension of the Caucasus Mountains. In antiquity, there seem to have been a group of islands intersected by arms of the Kuban River (\"Hypanis\") and various sounds which have since silted up. The Romans knew the strait as the Cimmerian Bosporus (') from its Greek name, the Cimmerian Strait\"' (, \"Kimmérios Bosporos\"), which honored the Cimmerians, nearby steppe nomads. In ancient times the low-lying land near the Strait was known as the Maeotic Swamp.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Kerch Peninsula became the scene of much desperate combat between forces of the Soviet Red Army and Nazi Germany. Fighting frequency intensified in the coldest months of year when the strait froze over, allowing the movement of troops over the ice.\n\nAfter the Eastern Front stabilized in early 1943, Hitler ordered the construction of a road-and-rail bridge across the Strait of Kerch in the spring of 1943 to support his desire for a renewed offensive to the Caucasus. The cable railway (aerial tramway), which went into operation on 14 June 1943 with a daily capacity of one thousand tons, was only adequate for the defensive needs of the Seventeenth Army in the Kuban bridgehead. Because of frequent earth tremors, this bridge would have required vast quantities of extra-strength steel girders, and their transport would have curtailed shipments of military material to the Crimea. The bridge was never completed, and the Wehrmacht finished evacuating the Kuban bridgehead in September 1943.\n\nIn 1944 the Soviets built a \"provisional\" railway bridge () across the strait. Construction made use of supplies captured from the Germans. The bridge went into operation in November 1944, but moving ice floes destroyed it in February 1945; reconstruction was not attempted.\n\nA territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine in 2003 centred on Tuzla Island in the Strait of Kerch. Ukraine and Russia agreed to treat the strait and the Azov Sea as shared internal waters.\n\nOn Sunday 11 November 2007 news agencies reported a very strong storm on the Black Sea. Four ships sank, six ran aground on a sandbank, and two tankers were damaged, resulting in a major oil spill and the death of 23 sailors.\n\nThe Russian-flagged oil tanker \"Volgoneft-139\" encountered trouble in the Kerch Strait where it sought shelter from the above storm. During the storm the tanker split in half, releasing more than 2000 tonnes of fuel oil. Four other boats sank in the storm, resulting in the release of sulphur cargo. The storm hampered efforts to rescue crew members.\nAnother victim of the storm, the Russian cargo ship \"Volnogorsk\", loaded with sulfur, sank at Port Kavkaz on the same day.\n\nAfter the war, ferry transportation across the strait was established in 1952, connecting Crimea and the Krasnodar Krai (Port Krym – Port Kavkaz line). Originally there were four train ferry ships; later three car-ferry ships were added. Train transportation continued for almost 40 years. The aging train-ferries became obsolete in the late 1980s and were removed from service. In the autumn of 2004, new ships were delivered as replacements and train transportation was re-established.\n\nMoscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov campaigned for a highway bridge to be constructed across the strait. Since 1944, various bridge projects to span the strait have been proposed or attempted, always hampered by the difficult geologic and geographic configuration of the area. Construction of an approach was actually started in 2003 with the -long dam, provoking the 2003 Tuzla Island conflict.\n\nAfter the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea the government of Russia decided to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait. The 19-kilometre Crimean Bridge opened to road traffic in May 2018 and the rail section is expected to be operational in 2019.\n\nRussian state-backed media claims that construction of the bridge caused increases in nutrients and planktons in the waters, attracting large numbers of fish and more than 1,000 of endangered Black Sea bottlenose dolphins. However, Ukraine claims that the acoustic noise and pollution from both the bridge construction and military exercises may actually be killing Black Sea dolphins.\n\nIn order to improve navigational capabilities of the Strait of Kerch, which is quite shallow in its narrowest point, the Kerch–Yenikale Canal was dredged through the strait. The canal can accommodate vessels up to 215 meters long with a draft of up to 8 meters with a compulsory pilot assistance.\n\nSeveral fish-processing plants are located on the Crimean coast of the strait. The fishing season begins in late autumn and lasts for 2 to 3 months, when many seiners put out into the strait to fish. The Taman Bay is a major fishing ground, with many fishing villages scattered along the coast.\n"}

Some Tangut texts, particularly Buddhist sutras, continued to be produced during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), after the fall of the Western Xia state, but the Tangut language became extinct sometime during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), and Tangut literature was only rediscovered in the early 20th century.\n\nMost of the books listed here were discovered hidden in a stupa outside the city walls of the abandoned Western Xia fortress city of Khara-Khoto in Gansu by Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov during his expedition of 1907–1909. A lesser number of texts (mostly fragments) were recovered from Khara-Khoto by Aurel Stein during his expedition of 1913–1916.

It is based on a real superstition of the same name. The arid plain where the \"Pearl\" is beached was filmed at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The shore where the \"Pearl\" reenters the ocean was filmed at the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes in California.\n\nThe Locker is similar to purgatory, and is the destination for souls that die at sea. Davy Jones was entrusted with the task of ferrying the souls of the deceased into the next world by the goddess Calypso. After Jack Sparrow is killed by the Kraken in \"Dead Man's Chest\", Calypso organizes a mission to rescue his soul from the Locker back to the land of the living.\n\nIn the third film, Calypso is accompanied by Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, and Hector Barbossa, among others. They reach the Locker by the use of magical charts leading to World's End. Sao Feng, one of the nine Pirate Lords, was the previous owner of these charts.\n\nAfter the crew reach the Locker, they find Jack and the \"Black Pearl\" stranded in the desert. Jack, unable to move the ship, has begun to hallucinate. The ship is transported to the ocean by many crabs under the control of Calypso. While on the ocean, the crew see the ghost of Governor Weatherby Swann, who has been murdered on the orders of Cutler Beckett.\n\nBy deciphering the clues on Sao Feng's charts, Jack discovers the way to escape the Locker. At sunset, the crew capsizes the ship; this triggers a green flash and returns the \"Pearl\" to the world of the living, effectively reviving Jack.\n\nIsla Cruces is a fictional island. The ruined church, graveyard, and mill were filmed in Vieille Case, Dominica. The beach where Norrington, Sparrow, and Turner duel was filmed near Little Exuma in The Bahamas.\n\nIn \"Dead Man's Chest\", Isla Cruces is a tropical island where Davy Jones buried the Dead Man's Chest. This chest contains his beating heart; stabbing the heart is the only way to kill Jones. The island appears to have been abandoned. The previous occupants are unknown, but there are crumbling buildings indicating that it was once inhabited.\n\nOn the island, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and James Norrington duel for control of the chest. James Norrington escapes with the chest, and gives it to Cutler Beckett in exchange for a full pardon.\n\nIt is not revealed in the film why Davy Jones buried the Dead Man's Chest on Isla Cruces. However, the film's writers, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, imply in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" DVD audio commentary, that Jones chose it because it is a plague island that remains deserted.\n\nIsla de Muerta (\"Island of Death\") is an island featured in \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\". It is a mysterious land where the \"Black Pearl\"s pirate crew hide their looted treasure. It is the location of the Aztec treasure that has cursed Hector Barbossa and the other members of his crew.\n\nAccording to Jack Sparrow, Isla de Muerta is an island that cannot be found, except by those who already know where it is hidden. From the air, the island resembles a human skull. Mysteriously shrouded in fog, the isle is surrounded by a graveyard of sunken ships; its waters swarm with hammerhead sharks and shoaling fish. The island contains a series of connected caves, which contain the crew's loot and the Chest of Cortes.\n\nBefore the events of the film, Hector Barbossa leads a mutiny against Jack Sparrow and becomes the captain of \"Black Pearl\". Later, the crew finds cursed Aztec treasure on Isla de Muerta. By removing the golden medallions from their chest, the crew become undead and lose the ability to feel physical pleasure. In order to remove the curse, the crew collect the medallions and return them.\n\nBarbossa, believing that Elizabeth Swann is the key to breaking his curse, kidnaps her and brings her to Isla de Muerta. Captain Sparrow uses his magical compass, which points to the thing the user wants most, to follow him. With the help of Will Turner, Elizabeth, and Jack fight against the pirates in the caves under the island. James Norrington and his men fight against Barbossa's crew in the bay just offshore. By using Will's blood, the curse is broken and Jack kills Barbossa.\n\nIn \"Dead Man's Chest\", it's learned that the island was reclaimed by the sea, taking with it both the cursed Aztec treasure and the mountains of gold that Barbossa's crew had hoarded while they were cursed. It was with this gold that Jack Sparrow had agreed to pay his new crew.\n\nPelegosto, also known as Cannibal Island, is a fictional island. Scenes set on the island were filmed on Dominica. The Pelegosto tribe's main village was built south of the island's capital, Roseau. Other scenes were filmed in Morne Trois Pitons National Park and Indian River.\n\nIn \"Dead Man's Chest\", Bootstrap Bill Turner, acting as Davy Jones's agent, delivers the Black Spot to Captain Jack Sparrow, a mark indicating that his blood debt to Jones is due. To avoid the monstrous Kraken that is hunting him, Jack commands the crew of the \"Black Pearl\" to land as fast as possible. They alight on Pelegosto, a typical Caribbean island with sandy beaches and lush, mountainous jungles. But it is hardly the paradise it appears to be; it is inhabited by a vicious cannibal tribe that captures the \"Pearl's\" crew. They believe Jack Sparrow is a god in human form and intend to eat him to \"release him from his fleshy prison\". Will Turner arrives and helps them escape.\nJack seeks out Tia Dalma, an obeah woman, for help. Dalma lives in shack on the other side of the island. He trades Barbossa's undead monkey for a jar of dirt, which she claims will protect him from Davy Jones. After Jack's death at the hands of the Kraken, his crew return to Tia Dalma's shack on Pelegosto. Tia Dalma reveals that she has resurrected Barbossa, and they will lead a mission to rescue Jack from Davy Jones's Locker.\n\nPort Royal is a British colony. It is based on the historical Port Royal, a city located at the end of the Palisadoes at the mouth of the Kingston Harbour, in southeastern Jamaica.\n\nScenes set in the harbor of Port Royal were filmed at Wallilabou Bay, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. A replica of Fort Charles was built on the Palos Verdes Peninsula near Los Angeles, as was Governor Swann's mansion. The scenes set inside the mansion were filmed in Manhattan Beach, California.\n\nPort Royal appears in all movies except in .\n\nElizabeth Swann arrives in Port Royal as a child, after her father Weatherby Swann is appointed governor. In the first film, Will Turner works in the town as a blacksmith's apprentice. Port Royal is attacked by the crew of the \"Black Pearl\" after Elizabeth accidentally summons the pirates. Pintel and Ragetti kidnap Elizabeth from her mansion, which is located in the town. Jack is imprisoned in the jail there, but Will Turner helps him escape.\n\nIn \"Dead Man's Chest\", Cutler Beckett uses Port Royal as his base of operations.\n\nThe scenes on Rum-runner's Isle were filmed in Petit Tabac, one of five islands known as the Tobago Cays, in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nBefore the events of the first film, Barbossa leads a mutiny against Jack and strands him on a small island. He leaves Jack a pistol holding a single shot; he could use this to commit suicide before starving to death. For many years, Barbossa assumes that Jack has died; he is surprised to learn of his survival during the events of the first film. Jack repeatedly claims that he used a raft made of sea turtles and his own back hair to escape the island. In reality, the island was a haven for rum-runners. Jack discovers their stash of liquor, lies on a beach drinking rum for three days, and barters passage off the isle when the bootleggers return.\n\nDuring \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\", Barbossa captures Elizabeth and Jack. Will Turner barters for their safety. Barbossa uses a loophole in their agreement to maroon Elizabeth and Jack on the same island. Elizabeth burns the stash of rum in order to create a signal fire, and they are rescued by James Norrington.\n\nShipwreck Cove is an inlet on the fictional Shipwreck Island, appearing in \"At World's End\". Shipwreck Cove is considered to be an impregnable fortress, well-supplied, and able to withstand nearly any siege. It serves as the meeting place for the Brethren Court, which is a gathering of the world's nine Pirate Lords.\n\nScenes set on Shipwreck Island were filmed in Dominica.\n\nThe Fourth Brethren Court meet to discuss the threat of the East India Trading Company and the ways in which to combat this threat. Barbossa insists that the Court must free Calypso, a sea goddess who was trapped in human form by the first Brethren Court. Sparrow and Elizabeth prefer to fight directly against the EITC. Elizabeth is elected Pirate King by the Court, and she declares war on Cutler Beckett.\n\nThe Pirate's Code is kept at Shipwreck Cove. This rulebook serves as the source of law for all pirates. Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague, is the Keeper of the Code.\n\nThe fictionalised Singapore is filled with bridge-covered waterways and crude wooden buildings, and differs markedly from the actual historical Singapore. The sets for the bathhouse, harbor, and stilt houses were constructed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nIt appears in \"At World's End\". Hector Barbossa and Elizabeth Swann visit Sao Feng to steal his navigational charts, which lead to World's End. They request a ship and a crew to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones’s Locker. Sao Feng has captured Will Turner, who attempted to steal the charts from Feng. After a tense standoff, the pirates form a temporary alliance when they are attacked by Ian Mercer and the East India Trading Company. After a series of skirmishes and negotiations, Feng grants them a ship and a crew.\n\nTortuga is an island off the northern coast of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), out of the jurisdiction of the Royal Navy and the East India Trading Company. While it remains a free port where traders can escape the high East India tariffs, it is a dangerous one where illegal transactions are common.\n\nScenes set in Tortuga were filmed in Wallilabou Bay, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nIn the first film, Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner moor their stolen ship, the \"Interceptor\", in Tortuga to recruit a crew. Their crew included Joshamee Gibbs, Anamaria, Cotton, and Marty. Here, Jack Sparrow also encounters Giselle and Scarlett, with whom has he had past romantic relationships.\n\nIn \"Dead Man's Chest\", Will goes to Tortuga to hunt for Jack Sparrow. A denizen tells Will that he saw a ship with black sails (the \"Black Pearl\") beached on Pelegosto. Jack returns to Tortuga to try to enlist ninety-nine unsuspecting sailors to pay off his blood debt to Davy Jones. Although he falls far short of his goal, the new crew proves useful during the final confrontation with the Kraken. Jack is reunited with Elizabeth Swann while in Tortuga and also recruits the disgraced James Norrington, who resigned his commission after losing his ship in a hurricane.\n\nAt the conclusion of \"At World's End\", Barbossa leaves Jack and Gibbs in Tortuga by once again hijacking the \"Black Pearl.\" Gibbs remains in Tortuga with Giselle and Scarlett.\n\nAt the end of \"On Stranger Tides\", Barbossa is in command of Blackbeard's ship, the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". He yells out that they will travel back to Tortuga, although this is not shown onscreen.\n\n"}

Its name is preserved as an Italian region today, the Marches, and it corresponds to almost the entire modern region and not just the Province of Ancona.\n\nThe march was created as a political division of the Papal States during the pontificate of Innocent III in the year 1198. It was initially governed by a papal nominee called a rector. The rector of Ancona, like the rectors of the other papal provinces, was under the authority of a general rector reporting directly to the pope. The province was confirmed by the \"Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ\" in 1357. The march followed the Adriatic as far north as Urbino and contained the cities of Loreto, Camerino, Fermo, Macerata, Osimo, San Severino, and Tolentino\n\nAccording to Paul Sabatier's biography of St. Francis of Assisi, \"The Road to Assisi\", the March of Ancona became the home of the spiritual Franciscans after Francis' death.\n\n\n\n\nThe line of \"Marquesses of Este\"(\"Marchesi d'Este\") rises in 1039 with Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan. The name \"Este\" is related to the city where the family came from, Este. \nThe family was founded by Adalbert the Margrave. who might have been the true first Margrave of Milan of this family. In 1209 Azzo VI is named the first \"Marquess of Ferrara\", and the title passed to his descendants, and Este Marquisate's was delegated to a cadet branch of the family.

They are among the world’s highest mountains.\n\nThe Pamir Mountains lie mostly in the Gorno-Badakhshan province of Tajikistan. To the north, they join the Tian Shan mountains along the Alay Valley of Kyrgyzstan. To the south, they border the Hindu Kush mountains along Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor. To the east, they extend to the range that includes China's Kongur Tagh, in the \"Eastern Pamirs\", separated by the Yarkand valley from the Kunlun Mountains.\n\nSince Victorian times, they have been known as the \"Roof of the World\", presumably a translation from Persian.\n\nIn other languages they are called: Kyrgyz Памир тоолору, \"Pamir Tooloru\", پامىر توولورۇ; ; ; (or ; Uyghur: پامىر ئېگىزلىكى, Памир Езгизлики, \"Pamir Ëzgizliki\"; Sanskrit: \"Sumeru\"; \"Pamir Kuhestan\"; or \"Onion Range\" (after the wild onions growing in the region); , written in Xiao'erjing: پَامِعَر or ڞوْلٍْ. The name \"Pamir\" is used more commonly in Modern Chinese and loaned as .\n\nAccording to Middleton and Thomas, \"pamir\" is a geological term. A pamir is a flat plateau or U-shaped valley surrounded by mountains. It forms when a glacier or ice field melts leaving a rocky plain. A pamir lasts until erosion forms soil and cuts down normal valleys. This type of terrain is found in the east and north of the Wakhan, and the east and south of Gorno-Badakhshan, as opposed to the valleys and gorges of the west. Pamirs are used for summer pasture.\n\nThe Great Pamir is around Lake Zorkul. The Little Pamir is east of this in the far east of Wakhan. The Taghdumbash Pamir is between Tashkurgan and the Wakhan west of the Karakoram Highway. The Alichur Pamir is around Yashil Kul on the Gunt River. The Sarez Pamir is around the town of Murghab. The Khargush Pamir is south of Lake Karakul. There are several others.\n\nThe Pamir River is in the south-west of the Pamirs.\n\nThe three highest mountains in the Pamirs core are Ismoil Somoni Peak (known from 1932–1962 as Stalin Peak, and from 1962–1998 as Communism Peak), ; Ibn Sina Peak (still unofficially known as Lenin Peak), ; and Peak Korzhenevskaya (, \"Pik Korzhenevskoi\"), . In the Eastern Pamirs, China's Kongur Tagh is the highest at .\n\nAmong the significant peaks of the Pamir Mountains are the following:\n\n\"Remark\": The summits of the Kongur and Muztagata Group are in some sources counted as part of the Kunlun, which would make Pik Ismoil Somoni the highest summit of the Pamir.\n\nThere are many glaciers in the Pamir Mountains, including the long Fedchenko Glacier, the longest in the former USSR and the longest glacier outside the polar regions. Approximately 12,500 km² (ca. 10%) of the Pamirs are glaciated. Glaciers in the Southern Pamirs are retreating rapidly. Ten percent of annual runoff is supposed to origin from retreating glaciers in the Southern Pamirs. In the North-Western Pamirs, glaciers have almost stable mass balances.\n\nCovered in snow throughout the year, the Pamirs have long and bitterly cold winters, and short, cool summers. Annual precipitation is about , which supports grasslands but few trees.\n\nThe East-Pamir, in the centre of which the massifs of Mustagh Ata (7620 m) and Kongur Tagh (Qungur Shan, 7578, 7628 or 7830 m) are situated, shows from the W-margin of the Tarim Basin an East-West extension of c. 200 km. Its North-South extension from King Ata Tagh up to the North-West Kunlun foothills amounts to c.170 km. Whilst the up to 21 km long current valley glaciers are restricted to mountain massifs exceeding 5600 m in height, during the Last Glacial Period the glacier ice has covered the high plateau with its set-up highland relief, continuing west of Mustagh Ata and Kongur. From this glacier area an outlet glacier has flowed down to the north-east through the Gez valley up to c.1850 m asl and thus as far as to the margin of the Tarim basin. This outlet glacier received inflow from the Kaiayayilak glacier from the Kongur-north-flank. From the north-adjacent Kara Bak Tor (Chakragil, c. 6800 or 6694 m)-massif the Oytag valley glacier in the same exposition flowed also down up to c. 1850 m asl. At glacial times the glacier snowline (ELA) as altitude limit between glacier nourishing area and ablation zone, was lowered about 820 to 1250 altitude metres against today. Under the condition of comparable proportions of precipitation there results from this a glacial depression of temperature of at least 5 to 7.5 °C.\n\nCoal is mined in the west, though sheep herding in upper meadowlands are the primary source of income for the region.\n\nThe lapis lazuli found in Egyptian tombs is thought to come from the Pamir area in Badakhshan province of Afghanistan. About 138 BC Zhang Qian reached the Fergana Valley northwest of the Pamirs. Ptolemy vaguely describes a trade route through the area. From about 600 AD, Buddhist pilgrims travelled on both sides of the Pamirs to reach India from China. In 747 a Tang army was on the Wakhan River. There are various Arab and Chinese reports. Marco Polo may have travelled along the Panj River. In 1602 Bento de Goes travelled from Kabul to Yarkand and left a meager report on the Pamirs. In 1838 Lieutenant John Wood reached the headwaters of the Pamir River. From about 1868 to 1880, a number of Indians in the British service secretly explored the Panj area. In 1873 the British and Russians agreed to an Afghan frontier along the Panj River. From 1871 to around 1893 several Russian military-scientific expeditions mapped out most of the Pamirs (Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko, Nikolai Severtzov, Captain Putyata and others. Later came Nikolai Korzhenevskiy). Several local groups asked for Russian protection from Afghan raiders. The Russians were followed by a number of non-Russians including Ney Elias, George Littledale, the Earl of Dunmore, Wilhelm Filchner and Lord Curzon who was probably the first to reach the Wakhan source of the Oxus River. In 1891 the Russians informed Francis Younghusband that he was on their territory and later escorted a Lieutenant Davidson out of the area ('Pamir Incident'). In 1892 a battalion of Russians under Mikhail Ionov entered the area and camped near the present Murghab. In 1893 they built a proper fort there (\"Pamirskiy Post\"). In 1895 their base was moved to Khorog facing the Afghans.\n\nIn 1928 the last blank areas around the Fedchenko Glacier were mapped out by a German-Soviet expedition under Willi Rickmer Rickmers.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a deposit of gemstone-quality clinohumite was discovered in the Pamir Mountains. It was the only such deposit known until the discovery of gem-quality material in the Taymyr region of Siberia, in 2000.\n\nThe Pamir Highway, the world's second highest international road, runs from Dushanbe in Tajikistan to Osh in Kyrgyzstan through the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, and is the isolated region's main supply route. The Great Silk Road crossed a number of Pamir Mountain ranges.\n\nIn December 2009, the \"New York Times\" featured articles on the possibilities for tourism in the Pamir area of Tajikistan. 2013 proved to be the most successful year ever for tourism in the region and tourism development continues to be the fastest growing economic sector. The META (Murghab Ecotourism Association) website (www.meta.tj) provides an excellent repository of tourism related resources for the Eastern Pamir region.\n\nHistorically, the Pamir Mountains were considered a strategic trade route between Kashgar and Kokand on the Northern Silk Road and have been subject to numerous territorial conquests. The Northern Silk Road (about in length) connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an over the Pamir Mountains towards the west to emerge in Kashgar before linking to ancient Parthia. In the 20th century, they have been the setting for Tajikistan Civil War, border disputes between China and Soviet Union, establishment of US, Russian, and Indian military bases, and renewed interest in trade development and resource exploration. China has since resolved most of those disputes with Central Asian countries.\n\n\n\n"}

There are 44 public swimming pools in Hong Kong; 9 in Hong Kong Island, 13 in Kowloon, and 22 in the New Territories. LCSD manages public swimming pools according to Law of Hong Kong Chapter 132 sections 42 to 45.\n\nVictoria Park Swimming Pool, built and managed by the Urban Council and funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, was the first public swimming complex in Hong Kong. The 50 by 20 metre pool was officially unveiled on 16 October 1957 by former Governor Sir Alexander Grantham. It was highly popular with residents, and served over 360,000 over its first year of operation. The spectator stand seated 1,700. This facility operated continuously until 2013, when it was closed and replaced by a new indoor swimming pool (of the same name) on the site adjacent. The old pool will consequently be demolished, sparking some mourning of the loss of a piece of the collective memory of many Hong Kong residents. In response, the LCSD stated they would \"explore the possibility\" of displaying some items of historical significance, such as the plaque unveiled by Governor Grantham, at the new facility, and planned to make use of \"3D laser scanning technology\" to record the architecture of the old pool complex.\n\nKowloon Tsai Swimming Pool, in Kowloon Tsai Park, opened in 1964 as the first public swimming pool in Kowloon. The opening of the facility was publicised internationally in a British Pathé newsreel, which stated a construction cost of £125,000 and highlighted the lack of bathing beaches in the densely populated vicinity.\n\nThe first indoor heated public pool, Morrison Hill Swimming Pool in Wan Chai, opened in 1972. While many swimming facilities close in the winter season, the public now has the option of visiting 24 different public heated pools, both indoor and outdoor, which remain open during the colder months.\n\nMany swimming complexes of the 1960s and 1970s were funded, in part or whole, by the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. One of these was the Tsuen Wan Swimming Pool, opened 1975, which was the first public swimming pool in the New Territories. The name was changed to Kwai Shing Swimming Pool in 1978. The standardised design of the complex is typical of the era, incorporating two 50-metre pools, changing rooms and lobby located mostly underneath a covered grandstand, and several other smaller teaching pools.\n\nThe Pao Yue-Kong Swimming Pool complex, the only public pool in Southern District, was officially opened on 9 July 1977 by then-Governor Sir Murray MacLehose. It is named after Yue-Kong Pao, who donated funds toward its establishment.\n\nThe Sha Tin Jockey Club Swimming Pool, the largest pool complex in Sha Tin District, opened in April 1981. The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club funded the $33 million project in its entirety as to commemorate the opening of the nearby Sha Tin Racecourse.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Urban Council announced a policy of building more \"fun pools\" with special free-form designs and water toys. A councilor explained, \"It is felt that these fun pools will provide more fun, excitement and enjoyment for the public who no longer regard swimming as a mere form of exercise.\" In 1985, four such pools were planned for Kowloon and a fifth for Hong Kong Island.\n\nThe Regional Council (RegCo) was founded in 1986. Prior to that date, swimming pools in the New Territories fell under the purview of the Director of Urban Services, as the Urban Services Department, the executive arm of the Urban Council, had been servicing the New Territories since its establishment in 1953. The operation of New Territories swimming pools was subsequently transferred to RegCo, who also built new facilities.\n\nKowloon Park Swimming Pool, opened on 12 September 1989, has undergone several upgrades in recent years. It served as the venue for the aquatics events in the 2009 East Asian Games, and is today has the highest patronage of all pool complexes in Hong Kong, serving over 2000 swimmers per day.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Urban Council and Regional Council at the end of the millennium, operations of all public swimming pools were taken up by the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).\n\nControversy erupted in 2004 after thousands of bloodworms were found in various public swimming pools. The worms reportedly posed no threat to humans, but LCSD management came under fire for not being forthcoming about the issue. A \"massive cleanup\" was undertaken to eliminate the worms.\n\nIn 2004 the LCSD slashed the lifeguard workforce from around 2,400 to 1,580. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Life Guards’ Union has spoken out against this cut in the years since, stating that it is unsafe and puts unreasonable pressure on the lifeguards. Many swimming pools have protest signage about this issue, which the LCSD has asked the lifeguards to remove. The lifeguards have gone on strike in 2004, 2005, and 2014.\n\nIn August 2014, at the height of the summer swimming season, many lifeguards serving Hong Kong's beaches and swimming pools went on strike. About 400 lifeguards staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in Sha Tin.\n\nLifesaving staff complained that since lifeguard numbers were cut drastically in 2004 their workload has been too great, with lifeguards having to look after greater numbers of swimmers, and warned that safety had been compromised by the government cutbacks. They said the situation has been exacerbated by crowding caused by increasing numbers of mainland tourists at Hong Kong pools and beaches. The vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Lifeguards' Union complained, \"some of them urinate everywhere and jump into the pool without wearing swim suits, or bring food to the venue. They don't have the same personal hygiene and safety standards.\" \n\nIt was suggested that the influx of mainland swimmers was a result of poor water quality in mainland Chinese swimming pools. A Shenzhen newspaper, \"Southern Metropolis Daily\", had also published an article highlighting the affordability and good facilities of Hong Kong's pools compared to those in Shenzhen. After the report was published, the number of LCSD pool closures due to contamination of the pool water with vomit or feces reached the highest level in six years. As a result of the staff shortage during the strike, some pools were temporarily closed and certain facilities at others, like toddler pools, shut down to divert staff resources.\n\nIn recent years the LCSD has replaced several older facilities. The new HK$800 million facility at Victoria Park hosts a 50 by 25 metre main pool, a multi-purpose pool with adjustable depth floor and diving platform, and the largest swimming pool spectator stand in Hong Kong, seating 2,500. On 11 May 2011 the first phase of the new Kennedy Town Swimming Pool opened, relocated in order to facilitate West Island Line construction works. On 1 April 2013, the new Kwun Tong Swimming Pool opened on a site directly adjacent to the old pool complex.\n\nSeveral new pools are planned. A new Wan Chai Swimming Pool recently opened to replace an older pool of the same name, which will be demolished to make way for the new Exhibition Station of the Sha Tin to Central Link. Another new pool is planned for Tin Shui Wai North, as the two existing pools in the new town are very crowded. An indoor swimming pool is under construction beside Cheung Hong Estate in Tsing Yi and is expected to open in 2016-17.\n\nThe Public Swimming Pool Monthly Ticket Scheme () began on 5 July 2012 (ticket selling started on 21 June). The Leisure and Cultural Services Department is responsible for this scheme.\n\nThe then Chief executive Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen announced in the 2011-2012 Policy Address the introduction of \"monthly tickets for public swimming pools to encourage \nmembers of the public to swim regularly. Concessionary rates will \nbe available for the elderly, people with disabilities, students and \nchildren. \" \n\nPrices are:\n\nAll public swimming pools in Hong Kong are available except Wan Chai Swimming Pool.\n\n"}
{"id": "3903716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3903716", "title": "Radar altimeter", "text": "Radar altimeter\n\nA radar altimeter, electronic altimeter, reflection altimeter, radio altimeter (RADALT), low range radio altimeter (LRRA) or simply RA, used on aircraft, measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft by timing how long it takes a beam of radio waves to reflect from the ground and return to the plane. This type of altimeter provides the distance between the antenna and the ground directly below it, in contrast to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a defined datum, usually mean sea level.\n\nFrom the legal point of view, a radio altimeter is – according to \"article 1.108\" of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) – defined as «\"Radionavigation equipment, on board an aircraft or spacecraft, used to determine the height of the aircraft or the spacecraft above the Earth's surface or another surface\".» \"Radionavigation equipment\" shall be classified by the \"radiocommunication service\" in which it operates permanently or temporarily. The utilization of radio altimeter equipment is categorised as so-called safety-of-life service, must be protected for Interferences, and is an essential part of Navigation.\n\nAs the name implies, radar (radio detection and ranging) is the underpinning principle of the system. The system transmits radio waves down to the ground and measures the time it takes them to be reflected back up to the aircraft. The altitude above the ground is calculated from the radio waves' travel time and the speed of light.\n\nRadar altimeters normally work in the E band, , or, for more advanced sea-level measurement, S band. Radar altimeters also provide a reliable and accurate method of measuring height above water, when flying long sea-tracks. These are critical for use when operating to and from oil rigs.\n\nConsider a radar pulse emanating from a radar beacon traveling downwards and interacting with a flat ocean surface. The following figure shows an illustration of the vertical cross-section and top-down view of the radar pulse (adapted from ) .\n\nThe radar altimeter measures the return power of the radar pulse that's reflected off the land/ocean surface. The temporal evolution of the reflected radar pulse is interpreted in order to estimate the distance between the radar altimeter and the reflecting surface; surface irregularities can also be estimated. The expected return pulse can be derived from a few basic mathematical considerations.\n\nFrom the previous illustration of the radar pulse vertical cross-section, the radius of the outer edge can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere r is the leading edge of the pulse. If we assume l is small and can be neglected then we can solve for r as:\n\nformula_2\n\nThe time evolution of the return power measured from the footprint of the radar signal reflecting off the ocean/land surface can be described in three parts: (1) the time before the pulse arrives, (2) the time after the beginning of the pulses arrival and before of the tail of the pulse has arrived, and (3) after the tail of the pulse has arrived. The power function can then be expressed functionally as:\n\nformula_3\n\nUsing the equation for r_p and normalizing by the peak power yields:\n\nformula_4\n\nThis following plot demonstrates the power function for a radar wave pulse. The power function should be constant with time after the full pulse reaches the ocean/land surface (at (t-t)/t = 1), however the power will actually decrease with time w.r.t the illumination pattern of the radar on the ocean/land surface.\n\nAlternatively, Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar can be used. The greater the frequency shift the further the distance traveled. This method can achieve much better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and radar altimeters that use frequency modulation are industry standard.\n\nAs of 2010, all commercial radar altimeters use linear frequency modulation - continuous wave (LFM-CW or FM-CW).\nAs of 2010, about 25,000 aircraft in the US have at least one radio altimeter.\nThat includes all commercial transport and all business aircraft licensed to fly for hire, which are required to have at least 2 radio altimeters per aircraft.\n\nThe primary difference between delay-doppler (or Synthetic Aperture Radar) and pulse-limited altimetry is that delay-doppler altimetry looks at a smaller section of the pulse-limited radar footprint, but emits far more pulse signals to give the effect of covering the same footprint as pulse-limited but with better resolution. The top-down view in the figure below shows the decreased footprint size of the delay-doppler signal.\n\nIn order to determine the power signal of the delay-doppler radar as a function of time, we'll need to assume that the footprint of the pulsed radar is small enough to be considered two rectangles of width W. This allows the power function to be similarly (see Pulse-limited section above) written as:\n\nformula_5\n\nUsing the equation for the radius derived in the previous section (see Pulse-limited section above), the power vs. time function, normalized by the time relative to the arrival time at the leading edge, formula_6, becomes:\n\nformula_7\n\nAn illustration of the normalized power vs. time function is shown below:\n\nThere are two primary advantages that the delay-doppler method has over the traditional pulse-limited altimeter. First, the radar footprint is covering less area so the radar pulse emitted by the satellite requires much less power. It covers the radar footprint using more frequent, but less power consuming radar pulses. Secondly, the return waveform has a more complex signature allowing the arrival time of the pulse to be more accurately constrained.\n\nThe following list notes the error sources associated with radar altimetry measurements:\n\nTides - Tidal variations are much larger than the dynamic variations in sea surface height. Because tidal periods can be on the order of diurnal and semidiurnal, the tides create an aliased frequency in the temporal variations in the sea level height that must be removed.\n\nElectromagnetic Bias - There is a sea state bias where the troughs of waves tend to focus waves back to the radar, while the crests of the waves scatter waves away from the radar.\n\nIonosphere - The ionosphere can also impose a delay on the radar return signal, where electron plasma in the ionosphere slow down the group velocity of the radar pulse. The electron density in the ionosphere varies throughout the day, complicating the ionosphere correction.\n\nDry Troposphere - Refraction from the dry gas component of the atmosphere create a signal delay in the radar, but a correction can be approximated using the Saastamoinen formula:\nΔRdry= -0.02277Po*(1+0.0026cos2φ) where Po is the sea level pressure in Pascal and φ the latitude.\n\nWet Troposphere - Water vapor can also cause a delay in the radar signal which can be more difficult to correct. A delay correction for the total water column in the radar measurement can be accounted for using output from meteorological models, like ECMWF and NCEP.\n\nIn 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the radio altimeter. In 1938, Bell Labs put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use. In 1938 in co-operation with Bell Labs, United Air Lines fitted a radar type device to some of its airliners as a terrain avoidance device.\n\nRadar altimeters are frequently used by commercial aircraft for approach and landing, especially in low-visibility conditions (see instrument flight rules) and automatic landings, allowing the autopilot to know when to begin the flare maneuver. Radar altimeters give data to the autothrottle which is a part of the Flight Computer.\n\nRadar altimeters generally only give readings up to above ground level (AGL). \nFrequently, the weather radar can be directed downwards to give a reading from a longer range, up to above ground level (AGL). \n, all airliners are equipped with at least two and possibly more radar altimeters, as they are essential to autoland capabilities. (, determining height through other methods such as GPS is not permitted by regulations.) Older airliners from the 1960s (such as the British Aircraft Corporation BAC 1-11) and smaller airliners in the sub-50 seat class (such as the ATR 42 and BAe Jetstream series) are equipped with them.\n\nRadar altimeters are an essential part in ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low or descending too quickly. However, radar altimeters cannot see terrain directly ahead of the aircraft, only that below it; such functionality requires either knowledge of position and the terrain at that position or a forward looking terrain radar. Radar altimeter antennas have a fairly large main lobe of about 80° so that at bank angles up to about 40°, the radar detects the range from the aircraft to the ground (specifically to the nearest large reflecting object). This is because range is calculated based on the first signal return from each sampling period. It does not detect slant range until beyond about 40° of bank or pitch. This is not an issue for landing as pitch and roll do not normally exceed 20°.\n\nThe altitude specified by the device is not the indicated altitude of the standard barometric altimeter. A radar altimeter measures absolute altitude - the height Above Ground Level (AGL). Absolute altitude is sometimes referred to as height because it is the height above the underlying terrain.\n\nRadar altimeters are also used in military aircraft to fly quite low over the land and the sea to avoid radar detection and targeting by anti-aircraft guns or surface-to-air missiles. A related use of radar altimeter technology is terrain-following radar, which allows fighter bombers to fly at very low altitudes.\n\nThe F-111s of the Royal Australian Air Force and the U.S. Air Force have a forward-looking, terrain-following radar (TFR) system connected via digital computer to their automatic pilots. Beneath the nose radome are two separate TFR antennae, each providing individual information to the dual-channel TFR system. In case of a failure in that system, the F-111 has a back-up radar altimeter system, also connected to the automatic pilot. Then, if the F-111 ever dips below the preset minimum altitude (for example, 15 meters) for any reason, its automatic pilot is commanded to put the F-111 into a 2G fly-up (a steep nose-up climb) to avoid crashing into terrain or water. Even in combat, the hazard of a collision is far greater than the danger of being detected by an enemy. Similar systems are used by F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft operated by Australia and the United States.\n\nThe radio altimeter first showed up in the German Junkers Ju 87 \"Stuka\" dive bomber which was equipped with one for automatic pullouts in the dive bomb run which usually consisted of an 80-90 degree dive. The Stuka pilot would set the radio altimeter to 750m which was connected to the bomb release and automatic pull out. The radio altimeter would drop the bombs and pull the Stuka out of the dive at the set altitude to a level flight. This was invented because the pilots would black out on the pull out, usually for 2 to 5 seconds.\n\n"}

Mongolia and Kazakhstan are kept separate by a 40km stretch of the Sino-Russian border between the Altai Republic, a federal subject of Russia, and Altay Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. To the east, Tavan Bogd Uul in Bayan-Ölgii Province, Mongolia, marks the end of the Sino-Russian border. To the west, is Kazakhstan's East Kazakhstan Province.\n\nThe Altai mountains on the Russian side of the border have been designated a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nAbove the \"Four Corners\" and in the southern part of South Central Siberia is the Altai Republic (not to be confused with the Altai Krai to the northwest). It contains the central knot to the Altai Mountains. The area is very mountainous and has few good roads. It was inhabited by various Turkic groups who gradually became the Altay people. As the surrounding steppes filled with Russians, many of the lowland Turks were Russified or retreated to the mountains. The area only came under definitive Russian control in the 1860s. The M52 highway (Russia) runs northwest from here.\n\nNorthern South Central Siberia includes the Altai Republic, which is a 400 km projection of forested mountains which bends slightly to the west at the tip. It is called the Abakan Range in the south and Kuznetsk Alatau in the north. North of its northern end is the town of Tomsk.\n\nThe west part of South Central Siberia includes the steppe of the Kuznetsk Depression, which contains the large Kuznetsk Basin coal fields, the mountains of the Abakans and Kuznetsk Alatau and the Salair Ridge which ends near Novosibirsk.\n\nIn the Soviet era, the Kuznetsk Basin coal fields were the largest Russian coal field after the Donets Basin. The name Kuznets means \"blacksmith\" and comes from the 'Blacksmith Tatars' or Shors, who were notable metal workers.\n\nThe Russians reached the area as early as 1618. The Abakans, Kuznetsk Alatau and the Kuznetsk Basin form the Kemerovo Oblast with its mostly Russian population. The Tom River drains the basin and joins the Ob River north of Tomsk. The town of Novokuznetsk was founded in 1618.\n\nThe eastern part of South Central Siberia, between the Kuznetsk Alatau and the Sayan Mountains, includes the steppe of the Minusinsk Depression which is the core of Khakassia. The Yenisei River flows north through its center. The Abakan River flows from the base of the depression north and slightly east to the Yenisei at Abakan town, near where another river comes in from the east. Minusinsk town is a few miles east of Abakan. The Chulym River (Ob River) starts in the northwest corner of the depression, arcs into the Taiga north of the Alatau and joins the Ob River. East of the river is the southern tip of Krasnoyarsk Krai.\n\nThis area was a center of the Afanasevo culture, a suggested homeland for the Tocharians. Later it was the home of the Yenisei Kirghiz, who gave their name to the Kirgiz further south. The Khakas of Khakassia may be their descendants.\n\nEast of the Altai and southeast of Minusinsk is Tuva. Tuva is bordered on the south by the Tannu-Ola Mountains, which separate it from the Mongolian Great Lakes Depression, on the west by the Altai, on the northwest by the Western Sayans which separate it from the Minusinsk Depression, on the north by the Eastern Sayans and on the east by mountains on the Mongolian border.\n\nThe core area is the Tuva Depression, where Kyzyl is located, the capital city of the Tuva Republic. The Yenisei River flows west here and then breaks through the Western Sayans in a long narrow gorge which contains the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam north of the Tuva border. \n\nTuva was traditionally part of Mongolia, and only passed to the Soviet Union—Russia in the 20th century.\n\nTo the north, South Central Siberia merges into the Siberian forests.\n\nTo the south, South Central Siberiamerges into the mountains along the former Sino-Soviet border. Dzungaria is directly to the south. \n\nTo the west of South Central Siberia is the agricultural steppe of the Altai Krai with its Russian population. Here the Katun River and the Biya River join to form the Ob River. Further west, between the Ob and Irtysh Rivers are the Baraba steppe in the north and the Kalunda Steppe in the south.\n\nTo the east, the Western and then Eastern Sayan Mountains extend east to the southern tip of Lake Baikal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The concept \"Protection of Life\" is considered to be different from the protection of the environment as it has been used by the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), though that organization was founded as a result of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972.\n\nGünther Schwab is known as the author of the screenplay for the movie \"The Forester of the Silver Wood\" (1954). In his novel \"Der Tanz mit dem Teufel\" (\"Dance with the Devil\") Günther Schwab gives his expressions to sentiments for nature protection and describes the destruction of nature as a plan of a devil who seems really existent. The book was translated in many languages, the first English translation was published 1963. In the year 1958 Schwab started to set up an organization with the name \"World Union for Saving of Life\" which was registered as \"World Union for Protection of Life\" two years later and soon activated branches in more than 30 countries all over the world.\n\nInternational congresses with scientist and church organizations mainly took place in German speaking countries.\nAround the year 1968 the organization had several thousand members in the Federal Republic of Germany. Famous members were the physicist Karl Bechert and the chemist Hans-Adalbert Schweigart.\n\nThe organization played an active role during the foundation of the German Green Party, especially in Lower Saxony.\n\nThe organization was officially registered as \"World Union for Saving of Life\" on 24 September 1958 in Salzburg and is therefore one of the oldest anti-nuclear organization.\nOne of the famous members was the biologist Annie Francé-Harrar. The Austrian anti-nuclear power activist Robert Jungk engaged himself for the WUPL. According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Austria) the national section was dissolved at December 31, 2012.\n\nAccording to its own publications the WUPL had \"sections\" in Australia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, South-Korea, South-Africa, Yugoslavia and USA.\n\nA scientific advisory board of 400 scientists out of 53 countries supported the work of the organization. Among them were 40 Nobel laureates. President of the board was Linus Pauling. Günther Schwab himself held about 1500 public readings.\n\nIn Australia the WUPL tried to ward off the dangers connected with the building of the Atomic Reactor at Jervis Bay, only about 130 miles from Sydney.\n\nThe World Union for Protection of Life gave the Hans-Adalbert-Schweigart-Medal to:\n\nThe seat of the international organization changed over the course of time, for example from Hannover to Bad Reichenhall. \nAfter the death of Günther Schwab in 2006 there was a restructuring.\n\nIn 2008 – 50 years after foundation – the organization pledged for the Global Population Speak Out (GPSO). Since 2009 the international stage was activated by scientists in 13 countries. For many organizations with similar goals has been set up since the 1970er, today the WUPL is only open for elected representatives of organizations with equal goals and members with a scientific qualification. In October 2009 the German text of the foundation document was published in the internet. International Members took part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009.\n\n\n"}

He is one of the key figures in human geography and arguably the most important originator of humanistic geography.\n\nBorn in 1930 in Tianjin, China to an upper-class family, he was educated in China, Australia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. He attended University College, London, but graduated from the University of Oxford with a B.A. and M.A. in 1951 and 1955 respectively. From there he went to California to continue his geographic education. He received his Ph.D. in 1957 from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nFrom New Mexico where he taught at the University of New Mexico from 1959 to 1965, Tuan then moved to Toronto between 1966 to 1968 teaching at University of Toronto. He became a full professor at the University of Minnesota in 1968. In the same year he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. It was while he was at Minnesota that became known for his work in humanistic geography, but his forays into this approach began earlier which an article on topophilia which appeared in the journal \"Landscape\". In a 2004 \"Dear Colleague\" letter he described the difference between human geography and humanistic geography:\n\nAfter 14 years at the University of Minnesota, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin and continued his professional career at University of Wisconsin–Madison as the J.K. Wright and Vilas Professor of Geography (1985–1998). He was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1986, of the British Academy in 2001 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. Tuan was awarded the Cullum Geographical Medal by the American Geographical Society in 1987 and the Vautrin Lud Prize in 2012.\n\nTuan is an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He occasionally gives lectures, continues to write his \"Dear Colleague\" letters and to publish new books on geosophy. His most recent books are \"Human Goodness\" (2008) and \"Religion: From Place to Placelessness\" (2010). He resides in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nYi-Fu Tuan stayed single throughout his life. In his autobiography, Tuan revealed his gay sexuality for the first time:\n\nAs a schoolboy in Australia, I was drawn to another boy. ... But my feeling toward another boy, an athlete with the sleek beauty of a well-oiled machine, was another matter. I couldn't persuade myself even then that it was just displaced longing for female loveliness. ... I was then fifteen.\n\nTuan has not focused on either his ethnicity or his sexual preference in his research. Rather than stress axes of difference or social power relations, he has attempted to capture universal human experiences. He works to show nuances of common phenomena such as the experience of \"home\" that cut across cultural divides even as they reveal distinct manifestations in different places and times.\n\nTuan describes his approach as humanist, however his humanism does not entail replacing spirituality with rationalism or promoting human beings as wholly self-directed. Instead, he sees humanist geography as a way to reveal \"how geographical activities and phenomena reveal the quality of human awareness\" and to show \"human experience in its ambiguity, ambivalence, and complexity.\". To do so requires empathy, and for this he seeks assistance from literature, the arts, history, biography, social science, philosophy, and theology. Tuan’s approach is qualitative, but more narrative and descriptive than philosophical, in light of his concern that a philosophical theory can become \"so highly structured that it seems to exist in its own right, to be almost ‘solid,’ and thus able to cast (paradoxically) a shadow over the phenomena it is intended to illuminate\" whereas he prefers for theories to \"hover supportively in the background.\"\n\nTuan is most interested in ambivalent human experiences that resonate with the opposing pulls of space and place, the intimate and the distant. His approach is suggested by titles such as \"Segmented Worlds and Self, Continuity and Discontinuity, Morality and Imagination, Cosmos and Hearth, Dominance and Affection,\" and above all, \"Space and Place\". These existential dialectics propel people between a pole of experience characterized by rootedness, security and grounding, on the one hand, and a pole characterized by outreach, potentiality and expansiveness, on the other hand. These opposites interact: there is a certain distance in what is nearby and a certain nearness in what is far away. Therefore ambivalence is the norm when it comes to the human experience of dwelling in the world with its existential pulls between space and place, mobility and stasis, the distant view and embodied engagement.\n\nTuan is fundamentally an optimist. Even Tuan’s gloomiest book, \"Landscapes of Fear\", concludes that things were worse in the past. For Tuan, historical changes have been for the better overall: \"In the larger view, the human story is one of progressive sensory and mental awareness… culture, through laborious and labyrinthine paths traversed over millennia, has greatly and variedly refined our senses and mind.\" Progress itself depends on particular ways of dealing with the tensions between space and place, cosmos and hearth, dominance and affection, morality and imagination. The promise of the future lies in recognizing the existential poles of nearness and remoteness and how they are reflected in each other.\n\nTuan has foregrounded the importance of language in the making of place. Throughout his works, texts such as poems, novels, letters, and myths are understood as integral elements in the creation of a sense of place. Human communications form the basis for the social processes of imagining, understanding, planning and conceiving places. Representations guide the human and material interactions creating, sustaining, and destroying places. Tuan's deep reflection on the role of representation in the creation of place forms an important foundation for the geography of media and communication.\n\n\n"}
