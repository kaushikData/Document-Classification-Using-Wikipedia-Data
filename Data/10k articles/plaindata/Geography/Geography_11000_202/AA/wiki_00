{"id": "45995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45995", "title": "Building", "text": "Building\n\nA building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term \"building\" compare the list of nonbuilding structures.\n\nBuildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the (a place of comfort and safety) and the \"outside\" (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).\n\nEver since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.\n\nThe word \"building\" is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it. As a noun, a building is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place'; \"there was a three-storey building on the corner\"; \"it was an imposing edifice\". In the broadest interpretation a fence or wall is a building. However, the word \"structure\" is used more broadly than \"building\" including natural and man-made formations and does not necessarily have walls. Structure is more likely to be used for a fence. Sturgis' Dictionary included that \"[building] differs from architecture in excluding all idea of artistic treatment; and it differs from construction in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment.\" As a verb, building is the act of construction.\n\n\"Structural height\" in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on building from street-level. Depending on how they are classified, spires and masts may or may not be included in this height. Spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included. The definition of a \"low-rise vs. a high-rise\" building is a matter of debate, but generally three storeys or less is considered low-rise.\n\nA report by Shinichi Fujimura of a shelter built 500 000 years ago is doubtful since Fujimura was later found to have faked many of his findings. Supposed remains of huts found at the Terra Amata site in Nice purportedly dating from 200 000 to 400 000 years ago have also been called into question. (See Terra Amata.) There is clear evidence of homebuilding from around 18 000 BC. Buildings became common during the Neolithic (see Neolithic architecture).\n\nSingle-family residential buildings are most often called houses or homes. Residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a duplex, apartment building to differentiate them from 'individual' houses. A condominium is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents. Houses may also be built in pairs (semi-detached), in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side; apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes. Houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or bedsitters; they may also be converted to another use e.g. an office or a shop.\n\nBuilding types may range from huts to multimillion-dollar high-rise apartment blocks able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors. Other common building materials are brick, concrete or combinations of either of these with stone.\n\nResidential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include holiday cottage (vacation home) or timeshare; size such as a cottage or great house; value such as a shack or mansion; manner of construction such as a log home or mobile home; proximity to the ground such as earth sheltered house, stilt house, or tree house. Also if the residents are in need of special care such as a nursing home, orphanage or prison; or in group housing like barracks or dormitories.\n\nHistorically many people lived in communal buildings called longhouses, smaller dwellings called pit-houses and houses combined with barns sometimes called housebarns.\n\nBuildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as houseboats, yurts, and motorhomes are dwellings but not buildings.\n\nA multi-storey is a building that has multiple floors.\nSydney is a city with many multi story buildings:\nOne suburb which has been notorious for poor construction is Lane Cove. \nMany overseas investors have been sucked in a and bought poorly built buildings.\n\nSometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex – for example a \"housing complex\", \"educational complex\", \"hospital complex\", etc.\n\nThe practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of professionals and trades. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:\n\n\nRegardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with zoning ordinances, building codes and other regulations such as fire codes, life safety codes and related standards.\n\nVehicles—such as trailers, caravans, ships and passenger aircraft—are treated as \"buildings\" for life safety purposes.\n\n\nAny building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in commercial buildings (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.\n\nSystems for transport of people within buildings:\n\n\nSystems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:\n\n\nBuildings may be damaged during the construction of the building or during maintenance. There are several other reasons behind building damage like accidents such as storms, explosions, subsidence caused by mining, water withdrawal or poor foundations and landslides. Buildings also may suffer from fire damage and flooding in special circumstances. They may also become dilapidated through lack of proper maintenance or alteration work improperly carried out.\n\n\n"}

Waldseemüller’s maps and book, along with his 1513 edition of Ptolemy’s \"Geography\", were very influential and widely copied at the time.\n\nIt is widely held to have been written by Matthias Ringmann although some historians attribute it to Waldseemüller himself. The book includes the reason for using the name America in the wall map and the globe, and contains a Latin translation of the four journeys of Amerigo Vespucci as an appendix.\n\nThe full title of the book is: \"Cosmographiae introductio cum quibusdam geometriae ac astronomiae principiis ad eam rem necessariis. Insuper quatuor Americi Vespucii navigationes. Universalis Cosmographiae descriptio tam in solido quam plano, eis etiam insertis, quae Ptholomaeo ignota a nuperis reperta sunt.\"\n\nThe map of the world in 1507, entitled \"Universalis cosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi Vespucii aliorumque lustrationes\", was published in an edition of 1000 copies, of which it seems only a single copy survives. The surviving copy was found in the library of Prince von Waldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee in the Castle of Wolfegg in Württemberg. It was bought by the Library of Congress in 2001. This preservation seems to be due the several sheets being bound into a single cover by the cartographer, Johannes Schöner.\n\nThe map consists of twelve sections printed from woodcuts combined with metal types, each measuring 18 x 24.5 inches (46 x 62 cm). Each section is one of four, that form one of three zones. The map uses a modified Ptolemaic coniform projection with curved meridians to depict the entire surface of the Earth.\n\n"}

Its name is derived from the original publishers of Captain Marvel comics, Fawcett Comics. It is also home to Bulletman and Bulletgirl, Spy Smasher, Ibis the Invincible, Mister Scarlet and Pinky the Whiz Kid and Minute-Man; also characters from Fawcett Comics.\n\nFeatures of Fawcett City include radio station WHIZ, which employs Captain Marvel's teenaged alter ego Billy Batson as an on-air and field reporter. Streets in Fawcett City have been named in honor of creators who worked on the \"Shazam!\" property over the decades, including Otto Binder (Binder Boulevard) and Bill Parker.\n\nFawcett City, like other fictional cities that appear in comics published by DC, has no exact location, besides being identified as being located in the Midwest region of the United States. However, in the 1990s series \"The Power of Shazam!\", it was suggested that it was located in Wisconsin, thanks to various clues given by writer Jerry Ordway (who grew up in Milwaukee). A \"Teen Titans\" \"Secret Files & Origins\" special, however, stated that Fawcett City was located in Indiana and a map in \"JSA vs. Kobra\" #4 (November 2009) indicates that the city is in Minnesota. Fawcett City is also a small town compared to Metropolis and Gotham City.\n\nThe city is distinguished in the comic stories by an old-fashioned look and feel. Despite existing in the modern world, with current technologies and events, Fawcett seems old fashioned, as if stuck in the 1940s or 1950s. This timeless feel was explained in the \"Power of Shazam!\" series as being the results of a spell cast over the city in 1955 by Ibis the Invincible. The spell was requested by the wizard Shazam, and was said to have protected Fawcett from the influences of outside evils and slowed the passage of time. For the next forty years within the DC Universe, the city existed as a time-warp of sorts to the 1950s. The spell was shown to be removed in \"Power of Shazam!\" #11 (January 1996), and Fawcett began to slowly become a more modern city, although most of its Art Deco style buildings and generally old-fashioned values remain intact.\n\nOther stories featuring the Captain Marvel/Shazam! characters were set in other locales. The Fawcett-era and 1973-1985 (pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\") DC-era stories were set in a New York in an alternate universe known as Earth-S. The 1987 miniseries \"Shazam! The New Beginning\" was set in San Francisco, and the most recent 2012-2013 \"Shazam!\" story from the pages of \"Justice League\" was set in Philadelphia.

Today, the legislature is made of two elements: the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island, and the unicameral assembly called the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The legislature was first established in 1773.\n\nLike the Canadian federal government, Prince Edward Island uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which members are elected to the Legislative Assembly through general elections. The party with the most seats forms Government. A Premier of Prince Edward Island and Executive Council of Prince Edward Island are formally appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in the name of The Queen. The premier acts as Prince Edward Island's head of government, while the Queen of Canada acts as head of state.\n\nThe legislature was originally bicameral, with an upper house called the Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island and a lower house called the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The Legislative Council also held executive power until 1839. In 1893 the houses were amalgamated into the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. Unlike other provinces that eliminated their upper house, the assembly continued to have a distinction between members elected as Councillors and members elected as Assemblymen. This distinction was eliminated in 1996, giving all members the title Member of the Legislative Assembly, upon the change from dual ridings (two members per district) to single ridings (one member per district) in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n\n"}

He bought a small theodolite, and after a short time independently made expanded measurements of the flow of the river Linth. Later Wild joined the Geometerschule (geometer school) at Winterthur and came in 1899 as a trainee to the Landestopographie (Swisstopo is a popular designation for the Swiss Federal Office of Topography) in Bern. \nDue to his bad experiences with the high mountain triangulation with a theodolite of conventional design, he tried in 1905 to design a new theodolite with rotable circle with coincidence circle-readings.\n\nIn 1907 he left the Landestopographie and moved to Jena, Germany, where he joined the company Carl Zeiss to build up a new department for producing geodetic instruments. \nHe began with the development of levelling instruments and designed later also a new theodolite, the Th I.\n\nIn 1921 Wild returned to Switzerland and founded with Dr. R. Helbling, who operated a measurement office, and with the politician Jacob Schmidheiny, the company Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik (later known as Wild Heerbrugg, Wild-Leitz AG, Leica Geosystems, Leica Microsystems, Leica Camera).\n\nAt this time he developed the first versions of the famous universal theodolite Wild T series and also the stereo autograph Wild A1 for aerial photo interpretation, besides a number of other measurement instruments.\n\nIt may be perhaps typical for the inventors like Wild that he worried little about the financial condition of his company, and this ended finally with the consequence that Wild separated in 1932 from the company he founded, in order to be able to work as a freelance technical designer and inventor. He continued designing up until his death in 1951.

It has been uncovered but, because of its large mass, has never been moved from where it fell. The main mass is estimated at more than 60 tonnes, making it the largest known meteorite (as a single piece) and larger than the 37-tonne fragment of the Campo del Cielo. It is also the most massive naturally occurring piece of iron (actually ferronickel) known on Earth's surface. The name \"Hoba\" comes from Khoekhoegowab word meaning \"gift\".\n\nThe Hoba meteorite impact is thought to have occurred more recently than 80,000 years ago. It is inferred that the Earth's atmosphere slowed the object to the point that it impacted the surface at terminal velocity, thereby remaining intact and causing little excavation. Assuming a drag coefficient of about 1.3, the meteor would have been slowed to about from its speed on entering the Earth's atmosphere, typically in excess of 10 km/s for similar objects. The meteorite is unusual in that it is flat on both major surfaces.\n\nThe Hoba meteorite left no preserved crater and its discovery was a chance event. The owner of the land, Jacobus Hermanus Brits, encountered the object while ploughing one of his fields with an ox. During this task, he heard a loud metallic scratching sound and the plough came to an abrupt halt. The obstruction was excavated, identified as a meteorite and described by Mr. Brits, whose report was published in 1920 and can be viewed at the Grootfontein Museum in Namibia.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Kegel took the first published photograph of the Hoba meteorite.\n\nHoba is a tabloid body of metal, measuring . In 1920 its mass was estimated at 66 tonnes. Erosion, scientific sampling and vandalism reduced its bulk over the years. The remaining mass is estimated at just over 60 tonnes. The meteorite is composed of about 84% iron and 16% nickel, with traces of cobalt. It is classified as an ataxite iron meteorite belonging to the nickel-rich chemical class IVB. A crust of iron hydroxides is locally present on the surface, owing to weathering.\n\nIn an attempt to control vandalism and with permission from Mrs. O. Scheel, owner of the farm at the time, the government of South West Africa (now Namibia) on March 15, 1955, declared the Hoba meteorite to be a national monument. In 1979 the proclamation was changed to include not only the meteorite but also 25 m x 25 m land on which it is situated. In 1985 Rössing Uranium Ltd. made resources and funds available to the Namibian government to provide additional protection against vandalism. In 1987 Mr. J. Engelbrecht, the owner of Hoba West farm, donated the meteorite and the site where it lies to the state for educational purposes. Later that year, the government opened a tourist centre at the site. As a result of these developments, vandalism of the Hoba meteorite has ceased and it is now visited by thousands of tourists every year.\n\n\n"}

It was within the territory of the former Russian Empire and the former Soviet Union, and was the highest mountain in the Soviet Union before the area became independent as Tajikistan. The mountain is named after Ismail Samani, a ruler of the Samanid dynasty.\n\nWhen the existence of a peak in the Soviet Pamir Mountains higher than Lenin Peak was first established in 1928, the mountain was tentatively identified with Garmo Peak. However, as the result of the work of further Soviet expeditions, it became clear by 1932 that they were not the same, and in 1933 the new peak, in the Academy of Sciences Range, was named Stalin Peak (), after Joseph Stalin. In 1962, as part of Khrushchev's nationwide de-Stalinization process, the name was changed to Communism Peak ( ), a name by which it is still commonly known. The name Communism Peak was officially dropped in 1998 in favour of the current name, commemorating the 9th century Samanid emir, Ismail Samani.\n\nThe first ascent was made 3 September 1933 by the Soviet mountaineer Yevgeniy Abalakov.\n\n\n"}

The park was opened in 2004. The park borders the Junkerdalsura nature reserve.\n\nThe park is known for a varied flora. Some mountains and highlands have a large number of arctic-alpine species of plants. The lower altitudes in the park are forested. Several of the plant species are generally rare, such as the white Arctic mountain heather (\"Cassiope tetragona\"). The white mountain saxifrage (\"Saxifraga paniculata\") is found in only three places in Norway, and it is most widely distributed in Junkerdal National Park. Many of the plants in this park are normally only found further north, or on other continents entirely. Some of the specialized plants are bullrush sedge (\"Carex scirpoidea\"), snow fleabane (\"Erigeron humilis\") and alpine arnica (\"Arnica angustifolia\"), all of which are at their southernmost limit here. Other rare plants found in the national park are Arctic bellflower (\"Campanula uniflora\"), upright lousewort (\"Pedicularis flammea\") and hairy lousewort (\"Pedicularis hirsuta\").\n\nThere are wolverines, lynx, and brown bears that live in the park. Moose and reindeer are both common in the area. A wide variety of rare and threatened wetland birds also nest inside the national park, among them include the gerfalcon, golden eagle, red-throated loon, Arctic loon, and long-tailed duck.\n\nThe first element is \"junker\" means \"nobleman\". The valley is allegedly named after Preben von Ahlen (1606-1675), called \"the junker\", who went through the valley in 1658 to raid and destroy the Swedish Nasa silver mine.

Gjessing obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with a study on Norway’s hydrology during deglaciation. One year later he was appointed full professor. In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation so that in the 1970s shifted the focus of his research into environmental impact assessments. This meant leaving behind his work on pure fluvial geomorphology that had previously brought him acclaim. Following this interest he joined in 1967 the Oslo University’s Commission for Watercourse Regulation. In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation, of which he was a member until 1981. He co-authored various notable books including \"Beste Store Norge Atlas\" (1983) and the five volume work \"Norge\" (1984–1986) and the journal \"Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift\" from 1979 to 1987. In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to West and North Africa where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.\nGjessing’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so-called “rejectionist” even within his own department at the University of Oslo. Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985, attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management.\n\n"}

MIKE 3 was developed by DHI. MIKE 3 provides the simulation tools if you need to model 3D free surface flows and associated sediment or water quality processes. MIKE 3 is widely recognized as the gold standard for environmental and ecological studies. MIKE 3 can be used for assessment of hydrographic conditions for design, construction and operation of structures and plants in stratified waters, environmental impact assessment studies, coastal and oceanographic circulation studies, including fine sediment dynamics, sea ice simulations, lak hydrodynamics, water pollution studies and restoration projects, analysis of cooling water recirculation and desalination, water quality and ecological forecasting, phenomena whenever 3D flow structures is important.\n\nMIKE 3 is a generalised mathematical modelling system designed for a wide range of applications in areas such as oceanography,coastal regions and estuaries and lakes. The system is fully three-dimensional solving the momentum equation and continuity equationsin the three Cartesian directions.MIKE 3 simulates unsteady flow taking into account density variations, bathymetry and external forcing such as meteorology, tidal elevations, currents and other hydrographic conditions. MIKE 3 can be applied to oceanographic studies,coastal circulation studies, water pollution studies,environmental impact assessment studies,heat and salt recirculation studies and sedimentation studies. MIKE 3 is composed of three fundamental modules: The hydrodynamic (HD) module, the turbulence module and the advection-dispersion (AD) module. Various features such as free surface description, laminar flow description and density variations are optionally invoked within the three fundamental modules. A number of application modules have been implemented and can be invoked optionally. These are advection-dispersion of conservative or linearly decaying substances, a water quality (WQ)module describing BOD-DO relations, nutrients and hygienic problems, a eutrophication (EU) module simulating algae growth and primary production, and a mud transport (MT) module simulating transport along with erosion and deposition of cohesive material. A Lagrangian-based particle (PA) module can also be invoked for simulating e.g. tracers, sediment transport or the spreading and decay of E-Coli bacteria. The modelling system is based on the conservation of mass and momentum in three dimensions of a Newtonian fluid. The flow is decomposed into mean quantities and turbulent fluctuations. The closure problem is solved through the Boussinesq eddy viscosity concept relating the Reynold stresses to the mean velocity field. To handle density variations, the equations for conservation of salinity and temperature are included. An equation of state constitutes the relation between the density and the variations in salinity and temperature and ñ if the MT calculations are invoked ñ mud concentration. In the hydrodynamic module, the prognostic variables are the velocity components in the three directions and the fluid pressure. The model equations are discretised in an implicit, finite difference scheme on a staggered grid and solved non-iteratively by use of the alternating directions' implicit technique. A phase and amplification analysis neglecting effects of viscosity, convective terms, rotation, density variations, etc. has been performed. Under these circumstances, the finite difference scheme is unconditionally stable.\n\nThe transport of scalar quantities, such as salinity and temperature, is solved in the advectiondispersion module using an explicit, finite difference technique based on quadratic upstream interpolation in three dimensions. The finite difference scheme, which is accurate to fourth order, has attractive properties concerning numerical dispersion, stability and mass conservation. The decomposition of the prognostic variables into a mean quantity and a turbulent fluctuation leads to additional stress terms in the governing equations to account for the non-resolved processes both in time and space. By the adoption of the eddy viscosity concept these effects are expressed through the eddy viscosity, which is optionally determined by one of the following five closure models:a constant eddy viscosity; the Smagorinsky sub-grid (zero-equation) model; the k- (one-equation) model; the standard k-ε (two-equation) model; and a combination of the Smagorinsky model for the horizontal direction and a k-ε model for the vertical direction.\n\nIn a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for flow of Newtonian fluids, the following elements are required:namely mass conservation; momentum conservation; conservation of salinity and temperature; equation of state relating local density to salinity, temperature and pressure as well as to possible mud concentration. Thus, the governing equations consist of seven (possibly eight) equations with seven (eight)\nunknowns.\n\nMIKE 3 is applicable to flow problems in which density variations and turbulence are important features. The mathematical modelling of such flows requires the solution of partial differential equations of the advective-diffusive type. The flow modelling will require the solution of the transport equation for salinity,temperature (heat),turbulent kinetic energy (k-equation),dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (ε-equation). The latter two equations form the well-known k and k-ε turbulence models. For the k-model and the standard k-ε model, the non-linear transport equations are solved by explicit UPWIND scheme. The one-dimensional (vertical) k-ε model essentially forms two one-dimensional diffusion equations, which are efficiently solved by an implicit scheme. The partial differential equations describing transport of salinity and temperature as well as transport of concentrations of substances, water quality and eutrophication components and mud concentration are all linear advective-diffusive type equations, and accordingly the same solution scheme is applied to all these components. A large number of methodologies for solving the advection-diffusion problem are reported in the literature. However, in order to be consistent with the HD module, a finite difference approach was chosen. The QUICKEST (Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics with Estimated Streaming Terms, Leonard (1979)) is applied. The method is based on a conservative control volume formulation. Upstream interpolation is used to determine higher order derivatives. This procedure avoids the stability problems of central differencing while remaining free of the inaccuracies of numerical diffusion associated with the usual upstream differencing. The extension of this scheme to two and three dimensions is given in Justesen et al. (1989), EkebjÊrg and Justesen (1991) and Vested et al. (1992). For use in situations where resolution of steep fronts are important, the scheme has been further improved by implementation of an exponential interpolation at steep fronts, the so-called QUICKEST-SHARP scheme, see also Leonard (1988). Alternatively, the so-called QUICKEST-ULTIMATE scheme, using operator splitting, may optionally be invoked, see e.g. Leonard (1991). This scheme is advantageous in cases with more than one advection-diffusion component, since in MIKE 3 it has been implemented such that the CPU time consumption is practically independent of the number of components.\n"}

It is located on Laurie Island, one of the South Orkney Islands (), at above sea level and from the coastline. Established by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition in 1903 and transferred to the Argentine government in 1904, the base has been permanently populated since, being one of six Argentine permanent bases in Argentina's claim to Antarctica, and the first permanently inhabited base in Antarctica.\n\nThe nearest port is the Argentine city of Ushuaia, which is away. The base has 11 buildings and four main topics of research: continental glaciology, seismology, sea-ice-zone glaciology (since 1985) and meteorological observations (since 1903).\n\nOrcadas was the only station on the islands for 40 years until the British established a small summer base, Cape Geddes Station in Laurie Island in 1946, replaced by Signy Research Station in Signy Island in 1947. It also had the first radiotelegraph in the continent in 1927. The 11 buildings of the station house up to 45 people during the summer, and an average of 14 during winter.\n\nIn 1903 Dr William S. Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition established \"Omond House\", a meteorological station on Laurie Island. During the expedition, however, the crew became stuck in the ice and, unable to sail off, were trapped in the station for the winter.\n\nBruce left the station in December of that year for Buenos Aires to fix the ship and obtain supplies, leaving meteorologist Robert C. Mossman in charge of the base to continue the observations.\n\nBruce offered to the Government of President Julio Argentino Roca the transfer of the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 pesos, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission. He also offered to transport in his ship the appointed personnel back to the station.\n\nBruce had informed the British officer William Haggard of his intentions in December 1903. On 29 December, Haggard sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Jose Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition. Roca submitted the matter to the \"Oficina Meteorologica Nacional\" (National Office of Meteorology) who advised to accept the offer. On January 2, 1904, the installations were accepted through a presidential decree.\n\nThe \"Scotia\" sailed back for Laurie Island on 14 January 1904 carrying on board Luciano H. Valette, from the Office of Zoology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Edgard C. Szmula, employee of the National Meteorological Office, and Hugo Acuña, from the Ministry of Livestock, who was also designated Postal Chief of the Orkney Islands by the Director General of the National Postal and Telegraphs Office, Manuel Garcia Fernandez. Mossman was left in charge of the expedition, along with William Smith as cook.\n\nIn 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on the South Orkney Islands. On August 26, Haggard sent a letter to Foreign Minister Manuel Montes de Oca reminding him that South Orkneys Islands were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. Argentine government ignored the note, \"considering it out of time\".\n\nOn March 30, 1927, naval non-commissioned officer Emilio Baldoni established the first radio telegraph link with Ushuaia. Up to that point, the Orcadas Base remained isolated from the rest of the world until the yearly relief arrived. The radio station (coded LRT in Argentina) allowed for a permanent communication link.\n\nThe station depended on the Ministry of Agriculture until Argentine Navy relieved the crew with navy personnel on March 3, 1951. Formal transfer occurred on December 23, 1952, when by presidential decree the base was put under the Service of Maritime Hydrography as \"Destacamento Naval Orcadas\".\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification system, the station is located under a tundra climate (\"ETf\"), very close to an ice cap climate (\"EF\"). The base is influenced by the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current that runs past the Weddell Sea and the strong westerly winds, creating a colder climate than the coastal areas in the northwestern parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. Weather conditions can vary widely from year to year and day to day since low pressure systems frequently pass through the islands, which influences the climate.\n\nMean monthly temperatures range from in June to in February. In summer, the average high is while the average low is . During winter, the average high is while the average low is . Temperatures can occasionally rise above freezing during winter. When low pressure systems pass to the south of the base, they can result in exceptionally mild temperatures, with the highest temperature recorded being in 1987. However, when this occurs, the weather is stormy and cloudy with reduced visibility. In contrast, when low pressure systems pass to the north, it results in cold and dry conditions with good visibility, causing temperatures to fall to .\n\nFog is a frequent occurrence in the base, averaging 110 days. This can vary from year to year with 1987 being the foggiest year when there were 252 days with fog to only 30 days with fog in 1963. Being located in the path of low pressure systems throughout the year, the base experiences high cloud cover, particularly in summer. December and January are the cloudiest months, averaging 29 cloudy days each month. Winters are less cloudy, averaging 20 cloudy days in June and July. Clear days are extremely rare and are only occur between May to October, averaging 1–3 days. As a result, the base only averages 483.0 hours of sunshine per year or 13.5% of possible sunshine (possibly the lowest on earth), ranging from a low of 9.3% in January to a high of 22.5% in August.\n\nDecember and January are the least windy months, averaging while August and September are the windiest months, averaging more than . The base is subjected to strong winds throughout the year, with each month averaging 20 days with strong winds (wind speeds above ).

{"id": "29468042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29468042", "title": "Political divisions of Spain", "text": "Political divisions of Spain\n\nThe political division of the Kingdom of Spain is defined in Part VIII of the Spanish constitution of 1978, which establishes three levels of territorial organization: municipalities, provinces and autonomous communities, the first group constituting the subdivisions of the second, and the second group constituting the subdivisions of the last. The State guarantees the realization of the principle of solidarity by endeavouring to establish an economic balance between the different areas of the Spanish territory.\n\nThe autonomous communities were constituted by exercising the right to autonomy or self-government that the constitution guarantees to the nationalities and regions of Spain, while declaring the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation. The autonomous communities enjoy a highly decentralized form of territorial organization, but based on devolution, and thus Spain is not a federation, since the State is superior to the communities and retains full sovereignty. In the absence of an explicit definition in the constitution the Constitutional Court of Spain has labeled this model of territorial organization the \"State of Autonomous Communities\", to avoid implying any particular model.\n\nThe autonomous communities (\"comunidades autónomas\" in Spanish and Galician, \"comunitats autònomes\" in Catalan, \"autonomia erkidego\" in Basque) constitute the first order (highest) level of territorial organization of Spain. They were created progressively after the promulgation of the Spanish constitution in 1978, to the \"nationalities and regions\" that constitute the Spanish nation by the exercise of the right to self-government by:\n\nThe constitution allowed two exceptions to the above set of criteria, namely that the Spanish Parliament reserves the right to:\n\nEven though the province was the basis for the creation of the autonomous communities, these roughly follow the lines of the old kingdoms and regions of the Iberian peninsula prior to unification.\n\nOriginally autonomy was to be granted only to the so-called \"historical nationalities\": Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia, regions with strong regional identities that had been granted self-government or had approved a Statute of Autonomy during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1936).\n\nWhile the constitution was still being drafted, and self-government seemed to be granted only to the \"historical nationalities\", there was a popular outcry in Andalusia, demanding self-government as well, which led to the creation of a quicker process for that region, which eventually self-identified as a \"historical nationality\" as well. In the end, the right to self-government was extended to any other region that wanted it.\n\nThe \"historical nationalities\" were to be granted autonomy through a rapid and simplified process, whereas the rest of the regions had to follow specific requirements set forth in the constitution. Between 1979 and 1983, all regions in Spain chose to be constituted as autonomous communities; four additional communities self-identify as \"nationalities\", albeit acceding to autonomy via the longer process set forth in the constitution.\n\nWhile the constitution did not establish how many autonomous communities were to be created, on 31 July 1981, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, then the prime minister of Spain and Felipe González, leader of the opposition in Parliament, signed the \"First Autonomic Pacts\" (\"Primeros pactos autonómicos\" in Spanish), in which they agreed to the creation of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities, with the same institutions of government, but different competences. By 1983, all 17 autonomous communities were constituted: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, Cantabria, Castile and León, Castile–La Mancha, Catalonia, the Community of Madrid, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Navarra, the Region of Murcia and the Valencian Community. The two autonomous cities, Ceuta and Melilla were constituted in 1995.\n\nAutonomous communities have a wide range of powers, but the devolution of power to the individual communities has been asymmetrical. The Constitutional Court has declared that the autonomous communities are characterized both by their homogeneity and diversity. Autonomous communities are \"equal\" in their subordination to the constitutional order, in their representation in the Senate of Spain, and in the sense that their differences should not imply any economical or social privilege from the others. Nonetheless, they differ in the process whereby they acceded to autonomy and their range of competences. The cases of the Basque Country and Navarra are exceptional in that the medieval charters (\"fueros\" in Spanish) that had granted them fiscal autonomy were retained, or rather \"updated\"; the rest of the autonomous communities do not enjoy fiscal autonomy.\n\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary form of government. The institutions of government of the different autonomous communities (i.e. the Parliament or the Office of the Executive) may have names peculiar to the community. For example, the set of government institutions in Catalonia and the Valencian Community are known as the \"Generalitat\", the Parliament of Asturias is known as the \"Junta General\" (lit. General Gathering or Assembly), whereas \"Xunta\" in Galicia is the denomination of the office of the executive, otherwise known simply as the \"Government\".\n\nThe official names of the autonomous communities can be in Spanish only (which applies to the majority of them), in the co-official language in the community only (as in the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands), or in both Spanish and the co-official language (as in the Basque Country, Navarre and Galicia). Since 2006, Occitan—in its Aranese dialect—is also a co-official language in Catalonia, making it the only autonomous community whose name has three official variants (Spanish: \"Cataluña\", Catalan: \"Catalunya\", Occitan: \"Catalonha\").\n\nThe provinces (\"provincias\" in Spanish and Galician, \"províncies\" in Catalan, \"probintziak\" in Basque) are the second-level territorial and administrative divisions of Spain. The provincial scheme was created in 1833 by Javier de Burgos and based upon the limits of the old Hispanic kingdoms, though dividing them, if necessary, due to geographic and/or demographic reasons (i.e. to ensure a relative homogeneity in size and population).\n\nThis scheme has undergone only minor adjustments since 1833, most notably the division of the Canary Islands into two provinces in 1927. There are fifty provinces in Spain.\n\nThe province is a local entity with legal personality constituted by the aggregations of municipalities. The governance of provinces is carried out by Provincial Deputations or Councils, with the following exceptions:\n\nThe responsibilities of the provinces vary amongst the autonomous communities they belong to. Since the creation of the autonomous communities their scope of action is minimal, with the exception of the historical territories of the Basque Country. In all cases, they are guaranteed a legal status and autonomy to conduct their internal administration by the constitution.\n\nThe official names of the provinces can be in Spanish, the co-official language of the community they belong to, or both.\n\nThe municipalities of Spain (\"municipios\" or \"concejos\" in Spanish, \"concellos\" in Galician, \"municipis\" in Catalan, \"udalerriak\" in Basque), constitute the lowest level of territorial organization in the country, and are guaranteed a measure of autonomy by the constitution. The administration of the municipalities corresponds to the ayuntamientos (\"ayuntamientos\" in Spanish, \"concellos\" in Galician, \"ajuntament\" in Catalan, \"udalak\" in Basque) consisting of mayors and councillors, who are elected by universal suffrage.\n\nThe municipalities are the basic entities of the territorial organization of the State, the immediate channels of the citizens' participation in public affairs. The official names of the municipalities of Spain can be in Spanish—the official language of the country, in any of the co-official languages of the autonomous communities they belong to, if applicable, or in both.\n\nAll citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality they live in, and after doing so, they are juridically considered \"neighbors\" (residents) of the municipality, a designation that grants them various rights and privileges, and which entail certain obligations as well, including the right to vote or be elected for public office in said municipality. The right to vote in municipal elections is extended to Spanish citizens living abroad. The Spaniard abroad, upon registering in a consulate, has the right to vote in the local elections of the last municipality they resided in. A Spanish citizen born abroad must choose between the last municipality his or her mother or father last lived in.\n\nThe autonomous communities have the right to establish additional territorial entities in their internal territorial organizations, without eliminating the provinces or the municipalities (even if the latter can have a different name). Catalonia had created two types of additional territorial entities: the comarques and the vegueries, both of which had administrative powers and were initially recognized in the last Statute of Autonomy (organic law) of the community, but The Constitutional Court annulled, among others, the parts that modified the territorial organization. Almost all communities have defined territorial entities (e.g. \"comarcas\" or \"merindades\"), but these do not have administrative powers and are simply geographic or historical designations.\n\nOne special case of such territorial entities is Western Sahara, formerly the colony of Spanish Sahara up to 1976, is disputed between Morocco, who controls 80% of the territory and administers it as an integral part of its national territory, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, who controls and administers the remaining 20% as the \"Liberated territories\". The United Nations, however still considers Spain to be the administrating state of the whole territory, under the Non-Self-Governing Territories awaiting the outcome of the ongoing Manhasset negotiations and resulting election to be overseen by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.\n\n"}
{"id": "3490667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3490667", "title": "Salute state", "text": "Salute state\n\nA salute state was a princely state under the British Raj during the time of British rule which had been granted a gun salute by the British Crown (as paramount ruler); i.e., the protocolary privilege for its ruler to be greeted—originally by Royal Navy ships, later also on land—with a number of cannon shots, in graduations of two salutes from three to 21, as recognition of the state's relative status. The gun-salute system of recognition was first instituted during the time of the East India Company in the late 18th century and was continued under direct Crown rule from 1858.\n\nAs with the other princely states, the salute states varied greatly in size and importance. The states of Hyderabad and Jammu and Kashmir, both with a 21-gun salute, were each over 200,000 km in size, or slightly larger than the whole of Great Britain; in 1941, Hyderabad had a population of over 16,000,000, comparable to the population of Romania at the time, while Jammu and Kashmir had a population of slightly over 4 million, comparable to that of Switzerland. At the other end of the scale, Janjira and Sachin (11 and 9 guns, respectively, and both ruled by branches of the same dynasty) were respectively 137 km and 127 km in size, or slightly larger than the island of Jersey; in 1941, Janjira had a population of nearly 14,000, the smallest of the salute states on the subcontinent.\n\nFor varying periods of time, a number of salute states in South Asia (Afghanistan), on the Indian subcontinent (Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim) or in the Middle East (the Gulf/Trucial states and various states in the Aden Protectorate) were also under the British Raj as protectorates or protected states. As with the Indian principalities, those states received varying numbers of gun salutes and varied tremendously in terms of autonomy. Afghanistan and Nepal were both British \"protected states\" from the 19th century until 1921 and 1923, respectively, after which they were sovereign nations in direct relations with the British Foreign Office; while protected states, both enjoyed autonomy in internal affairs, though control of foreign affairs was left to the British. The states under the Persian Gulf Residency and the Aden Protectorate (part of the Bombay Presidency until 1937) ranged from Oman, a 21-gun-rated sultanate under a limited protectorate, to the 3-gun Trucial States which were near-total protectorates.\n\nFollowing their independence in 1947, the new Indian and Pakistani governments maintained the gun-salute system until 1971 (in India) and 1972 (in Pakistan), when the former ruling families were officially derecognised. The Aden Protectorate was transferred to the control of the British Foreign Office in 1937 and eventually became the independent state of South Yemen in 1967, resulting in the abolition of its salute states the same year. Just prior to Indian independence in 1947, the Persian Gulf Residency was likewise transferred to Foreign Office control, remaining in existence until the Trucial States became fully independent in December 1971, forming the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in early 1972.\n\nWhen the ruler of a princely state arrived at the Indian capital (originally at Calcutta (Kolkata), then at Delhi), he was greeted with a number of gun-firings. The number of these consecutive \"gun salutes\" changed from time to time, be increased or reduced depending on the degree of honour which the British chose to accord to a given ruler. The number of gun salutes accorded to a ruler was usually a reflection of the state of his relations with the British and/or his perceived degree of political power; a 21-gun salute was considered the highest. The King (or Queen) of the United Kingdom (who until 1948 was also the Emperor of India) was accorded a 101-gun salute, and 31 guns were used to salute the Viceroy of India.\n\nThe number of guns in a salute assumed particular importance at the time of holding of the Coronation Durbar in Delhi in the month of December 1911. The Durbar was held to commemorate the Coronation of King George V with guns firing almost all day. At that time there were three Princely States that were given 21 gun salutes. These were:\n\nIn 1917, the Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior was upgraded to a permanent and hereditary 21-gun salute, and the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir was granted the same in 1921. Both were granted the increased ranks as a result of the meritorious services of their soldiers in the First World War.\n\nApart from these, no other Princely State received a 21-gun salute. Three of the most prominent princes, however, enjoyed a local salute of 21 guns within the limits of their own state and 19 guns in the rest of India. They were the Nawab (Begum) of Bhopal, the Maharaja Holkar of Indore and the Maharana of Udaipur.\n\nThe Nizam, Maharajas, Princes, etc. were all deeply keen on protocol and ensured that it was practised as a matter of faith. Any departure from it was not taken kindly by them. Salute of guns was one such protocol that was strictly adhered to.\n\nAt the time of Indian independence and partition in 1947, 118 (113 in India, 4 in Pakistan, plus Sikkim) of the roughly 565 princely states were classified as \"salute states.\" \n\n\nThe salute states were broadly divided into two categories: the five premier states with a permanent 21-gun salute and with an individual resident, or envoy, stationed in each, and the remaining 113 states incorporated within political agencies (groups of states) under a political agent. The salutes were themselves organised in a strict hierarchy. Each ruling house of a salute state was entitled to a \"permanent\" hereditary salute. In some instances, one of three sub-categories consisting of an increase of 2 gun salutes could be awarded as follows:\n\nAs a religious head, the Agha Khan received a personal 11-gun salute. In certain cases, a ruler of a non-salute state or a junior member of a princely family could merit a personal salute or the personal style of \"Highness\".\n\nAt independence in 1947, the gun salutes enjoyed by the 113 states that acceded to the Union of India were as follows:\n\nIn 1948 The Hindu Rajput Maharana of Udaipur was raised to first place in the Order of Precedence, displacing the Muslim Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar due to his stubborn stance of not acceding to the union . The system of gun salutes continued in the Republic of India until 1971.\n\nAlthough salutes with many more guns have been used for Western Monarchs (and dynastic and other associated occasions), the 21-gun salute has in modern times become customary for Sovereign Monarchs (hence also known as 'royal salute') and republic.\n\nSome of the rulers not listed above were granted increased gun salutes after the independence, e.g. the Maharana of Mewar (at Udaipur, \"Maharajpramukh\" in Rajasthan) was raised to first place in the Order of Precedence, displacing the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, and all 9-gun states were permitted the use of the style of Highness. However, it has not been possible to obtain complete details for all the rulers.\n\nThis system continued till 1971 when privileges and Privy Purses of ex-rulers were abolished by the Government of India.\n\nBetween August 1947 and March 1948, thirteen Muslim princely states in western India acceded to the new Dominion of Pakistan, created from British India by the Indian Independence Act 1947, thus becoming the Princely states of Pakistan. Between 1955 and 1974, they were all amalgamated into larger federations and provinces. All of the princely states were in the western part of the country, so all were merged into the eventual West Pakistan, which constitutes (since the breakaway of Bangla Desh) the present-day Republic of Pakistan.\nThe states retained internal autonomy so long as they existed, but all had lost this by 1974. The styles and titles enjoyed by the former ruling families ceased to be officially recognised by the Government of Pakistan, mostly in January 1972, with the exception of the small states of Hunza and Nagar, which were shortly after incorporated into the Northern Areas of Pakistan in October 1974.\n\nFour salute states acceded to Pakistan between 3 October 1947 and 27 March 1948. In order of precedence, they were as follows:\n\nAfter \"several promotions and two further post-colonial awarding\" under the republic – which India didn't do – the gun salutes enjoyed by the states in Pakistan were as follows in 1966:\n\n\n\nThe following list of gun salutes is as they stood in 1947.\n\nIn 1890, Abdur Rahman Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan, accepted for his kingdom the status of a British protected state under the British Raj, retaining internal autonomy while placing the state's foreign affairs under British control. In 1905, his son and successor, Habibullah Khan, negotiated the Anglo-Afghan Treaty with the British, by which Afghanistan was \"de jure\" styled as a sovereign monarchy and the ruler recognised as King of Afghanistan (\"Shah-e-Afghanistan\") with the style of \"His Majesty\", while remaining a protected state of Britain. In May 1919, King Habibullah's successor, King Amanullah, declared the country a wholly sovereign kingdom, which resulted in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Despite a British victory, the British recognised the total sovereignty of Afghanistan in the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of Kabul in 1921; thereafter, Afghanistan continued to exist as a sovereign monarchy until the fall of the monarchy in 1973.\n\nThe Anglo-Nepalese War of 1816, which led to the defeat of the Gorkha Shah monarchy of Nepal, resulted in the kingdom becoming a \"de jure\" protectorate, but a \"de facto\" protected state of the East India Company. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the dissolution of the East India Company in 1858, the protectorate was transferred to the British crown through the British Raj, which recognised the monarch as \"King of Nepal\" with the style of \"His Majesty\" in 1919, due to the country's contributions to the Allied cause in the First World War. In 1923, the British government ended its protectorate and recognised Nepal as a wholly sovereign monarchy. While the semi-sovereign Rana oligarchy held power as hereditary Prime Ministers of Nepal until its deposition in 1951, the Nepalese monarchy continued until its abolition in 2008.\n\nA brief war between Bhutan and the British Raj in 1864 resulted in the Treaty of Sinchula, which forced Bhutan to relinquish territory and defined its relationship with the British. A loose agglomeration of semi-independent districts until 1907, Bhutan was unified in that year as a hereditary monarchy represented by Ugyen Wangchuck, the \"penlop\" (or governor) of the district of Tongsa, who was proclaimed the \"Maharaja\" and \"Druk Gyalpo\" (Dragon King) of Bhutan. In 1910, Bhutan signed the Treaty of Punakha, under which the British Raj guaranteed Bhutan's internal sovereignty, but, as with Sikkim, maintained control over its foreign relations. A British residency was officially installed in Bhutan, with a resident deputed from the Indian Political Service and answerable to the British government in India. The treaty, which established Bhutanese sovereignty, albeit as a protected state, remained in force until Indian independence in 1947; at this time, Bhutan was offered the options of remaining independent or acceding to the new Indian Union. Choosing to maintain its independence, Bhutan formally established relations with India in 1949, signing the India-Bhutan Treaty of Friendship on 8 August 1949; while reaffirming Bhutanese sovereignty, the new treaty gave India control over Bhutan's foreign policy. In 1963, however, Bhutan promulgated a new constitution which replaced the title of \"His Highness the Maharaja\" with \"His Majesty the Druk Gyalpo\", formally promoting the country to the status of an independent, sovereign monarchy. In 1971, Bhutan joined the United Nations as a full member, and renegotiated the 1949 treaty with India in 2007, legally ending Bhutan's status as a protected state of India.\n\nThough officially considered a princely state under its ruler, the Maharaja Chogyal, Sikkim was given the separate status of a British protectorate in 1861 under the Treaty of Tumlong, by which the British government could intervene in the state's internal affairs and oversee all external matters; despite this, Sikkim maintained a high degree of autonomy in practice. In 1947, the Maharaja Chogyal and his people decided against accession to India and chose to maintain Sikkim's internal sovereignty. The state formally became a protectorate of India in 1950. Following the death of the Maharaja Chogyal in 1963 and his succession by his unpopular son, Palden Thondup Namgyal, popular demands for increased individual rights grew more frequent. After Sikkim's first free general elections in 1974, the Indian Army placed the Chogyal under house arrest. Under military supervision, a controversial referendum was held in 1975, which approved the state's merger with India and the abolition of the monarchy. Sikkim was formally merged into India as its 22nd state on \n26 April 1975.\n\nThe following were constituent states of the Aden Protectorate from the late 19th century until their independence and merger with South Yemen in 1967 when the states were abolished. The protectorate was under the British Raj and governed as part of the Bombay Presidency until 1917 when the protectorate was transferred to the control of the British Foreign Office.\n\nThe Persian Gulf Residency was established in 1822 during the time of the East India Company, though the company had established a residency at Bushehr in 1763. It was made subordinate to the Governor of Bombay until 1873. As with the rest of British India, it came under the control of the British Crown in 1858. In 1873, the residency came under the direct control of the British Raj and the India Office. In 1892, it officially assumed a protectorate status over the states of Muscat and Oman, Bahrain and the Trucial States, followed by Kuwait in 1914 and Qatar in 1916. In 1920, the Treaty of Seeb recognised the \"de jure\" independence of Oman. The residency was transferred to the charge of the British Foreign Office from the India Office in 1947, shortly before Indian independence. In 1961, Kuwait became the first of the Gulf States to terminate its protectorate and become fully independent, with Muscat and Oman being recognised by Britain as an independent, protected state the following year. With the increasing costs of maintaining an overseas presence, Britain announced in January 1968 that it would end its protectorate over the remaining Gulf states in 1971. The protectorates were finally terminated in December 1971; Muscat and Oman became the modern sultanate of Oman that year, and the erstwhile Trucial States became the United Arab Emirates in 1972.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is defined as the area of\nsea ice relative to the total at a given point in the ocean.\nThis article will deal primarily with its determination from remote sensing measurements.\n\nSea ice concentration helps determine a number of other important climate\nvariables. Since the albedo of ice is much higher than that of water,\nice concentration will regulate insolation in the polar oceans.\nWhen combined with ice thickness, it determines\nseveral other important fluxes between the air and sea,\nsuch as salt and fresh-water fluxes between the polar oceans\n(see for instance bottom water) as well as\nheat transfer between the atmosphere.\nMaps of sea ice concentration can be used to determine\nice area and\nice extent, both of which are important\nmarkers of climate change.\n\nIce concentration charts are also used by navigators to determine\npotentially passable regions—see icebreaker.\n\nMeasurements from ships and aircraft are based on simply calculating\nthe relative area of ice versus water visible within the scene.\nThis can be done using photographs or by eye.\nIn situ measurements are used to validate remote sensing\nmeasurements.\n\nBoth synthetic aperture radar and visible sensors (such as Landsat)\nare normally high enough resolution that each pixel is simply classified\nas a distinct surface type, i.e. water versus ice. The concentration can then be\ndetermined by counting the number of ice pixels in a given area which\nis useful for validating concentration estimates from lower resolution\ninstruments such as microwave radiometers. Since SAR images are normally\nmonochrome and the backscatter of ice can vary quite considerably,\nclassification is normally done based on texture using groups of\npixels—see pattern recognition.\n\nVisible sensors have the disadvantage of being quite weather sensitive—images are obscured by clouds—while SAR sensors, especially in the\nhigher resolution modes, have a limited coverage and must be pointed.\nThis is why the tool of choice for determining ice concentration is\noften a passive microwave sensor.\n\nAll warm bodies emit electro-magnetic radiation: see thermal radiation.\nSince different objects will emit differently at different frequencies,\nwe can often determine what type of object we are looking at based on its emitted\nradiation—see spectroscopy. This principle underlies all \"passive\"\nmicrowave sensors and most passive infrared sensors. Passive is used in the\nsense that the sensor only measures radiation that has been emitted by other\nobjects but does not emit any of its own.\n(A SAR sensor, by contrast, is \"active\".) SSMR and SSMI radiometers were flown on the Nimbus program and DMSP series of satellites.\n\nBecause clouds are translucent in the microwave regime, especially\nat lower frequencies, microwave radiometers are quite weather insensitive.\nSince most microwave radiometers operate along a polar orbit with\na broad, sweeping scan, full ice maps of the polar regions where\nthe swaths are largely overlapping can usually be obtained within one day.\nThis frequency and reliability comes at the cost of a poor resolution:\nthe angular field of view of an antenna is directly\nproportional to the wavelength\nand inversely proportional to the effective aperture area.\nThus we need a large deflector dish to compensate for a low frequency\n\nMost ice concentration algorithms based on microwave radiometry\nare predicated on the dual observation that: 1. different surface types\nhave different, strongly clustered, microwave signatures and\n2. the radiometric signature at the instrument head is a linear\ncombination of that of the different surface types, with the weights\ntaking on the values of the relative concentrations.\nIf we form a vector space from each of the instrument channels\nin which all but one of the signatures of the different surface types\nare linearly independent, then it is straightforward to solve for\nthe relative concentrations:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the radiometric signature at the\ninstrument head (normally measured as a brightness temperature),\nformula_3 is the signature of the nominal\nbackground surface type (normally water),\nformula_4 is the signature of the \"i\"th\nsurface type while \"C\" are the relative\nconcentrations.\n\nEvery operational ice concentration algorithm is predicated on this\nprinciple or a slight variation.\nThe NASA team algorithm, for instance, works by taking the\ndifference of two channels and dividing by their sum.\nThis makes the retrieval slightly nonlinear, but with\nthe advantage that the influence of temperature is mitigated.\nThis is because brightness temperature varies roughly linearly\nwith physical temperature when all other things are equal—see emissivity—and because the sea ice emissivity at different microwave\nchannels is strongly correlated.\nAs the equation suggests, concentrations of multiple ice\ntypes can potentially be detected, with NASA team distinguishing between\nfirst-year and multi-year ice (see image above).\n\nAccuracies of sea ice concentration derived from passive microwave sensors may be expected to be on the order of 5\\% (absolute).\n\nA number of factors act to reduce the accuracy of the retrievals, the most obvious being variations in the microwave signatures produced by a given surface type.\nFor sea ice, the presence of snow, variations in salt and moisture content, the presence of melt ponds as well as variations in surface temperature will all produce strong variations in the microwave signature of a given ice type. New and thin ice in particular will often have a microwave signature closer to that of open water. This is normally because of its high salt content, not because of radiation being transmitted from the water through the ice—see sea ice emissivity modelling.\nThe presence of waves and surface roughness will change the signature over open water. Adverse weather conditions, clouds and humidity in particular, will also tend to reduce the accuracy of retrievals.\n\n\n"}

The concept was to provide high-range-resolution ground moving target indication (GMTI), as well as SAR imaging and high-resolution digital mapping. This program was cancelled by Congress in 2007. SBR is a less-ambitious version of Discoverer II.\n\nSpace-based radar (SBR) is a proposed constellation of active radar satellites for the United States Department of Defense. The SBR system would allow detection and tracking of aircraft, ocean-going vessels (similar to the Soviet US-A program), and potentially land vehicles from space. This information would then be relayed to regional and national command centers, as well as E-10 MC2A airborne command posts.\n\n\nUse of radar sensor for Earth observation purposes was started by NASA/JPL's Seasat satellite, which carried three different radar sensors: \n\nAfter Seasat, SARs, altimeters and scatterometers have been flown on several other space missions.\n\nWhile the SAR, in principle, is similar to its airborne counterparts (with the advantage of the increased coverage and worldwide access offered by the satellite platform), the other two are specific to satellite operations.\n\nA satellite radar-altimeter is a nadir-looking radar with very high range resolution, which measures the ocean surface topography with an accuracy in the order of few centimeters. Additionally, analysis of the echo amplitude and shape can extract information about the wind speed and wave height, respectively.\nSome radar-altimeters (like CryoSat/SIRAL) employ synthetic aperture and/or interferometric techniques: their reduced footprint allows mapping of rougher surfaces like polar ices.\n\nA wind scatterometer observes the same portion of the ocean surface from different (at least 3) angles of view as the satellite passes by, measuring the echo amplitude and the corresponding surface reflectivity. Reflectivity being affected by the ocean surface \"roughness\", which in turn is affected by the wind and also dependent on its direction, this instrument can determine the wind speed and direction.\n\nThese three types of radar are currently used on several satellites. Scatterometers are of high value for operational meteorology, allowing reconstruction of wind fields on a global scale. Data from radar altimeters are used for the accurate determination of the geoid, monitoring of tides, ocean currents and other large-scale ocean phenomena such as El Niño.\n\nSARs applications are many: they range from geology to crop monitoring, from measurement of sea ice to disaster monitoring to vessel traffic surveillance, not to forget the military applications (many civilian SAR satellites are, in fact, dual-use systems). SAR imaging offer the great advantage, over its optical counterparts, of not being affected by meteorological conditions such as clouds, fog, etc., making it the sensor of choice when continuity of data must be ensured. \nAdditionally, SAR interferometry (both dual-pass or single-pass, as used in the SRTM mission) allows accurate 3-D Reconstruction.\n\nOther types of radars have been flown for earth observation missions: precipitation radars such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or cloud radars like the one used on Cloudsat.\n\nLike other Earth observation satellites, radar satellites often use sun-synchronous orbits so that diurnal variations of vegetation are ignored, allowing long-term variations to be more accurately measured.\n\nEarth-observing radar satellites include:\n\nMost of the radars flown as payload in planetary missions (i.e., not considering avionics radar, such as docking and landing radars used in Apollo and LEM) belong to two categories: imaging radars and sounders.\n\nImaging radars: Synthetic aperture radars are the only instruments capable of penetrating heavy cloud cover around planets such as Venus, which was the first target for such missions. Two Soviet spacecraft (Venera 15 and Venera 16) imaged the planet in 1983 and 1984 using SAR and Radar altimeters. The Magellan probe also imaged Venus in 1990 and 1994.\n\nThe only other target of an imaging radar mission has been Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, in order to penetrate its opaque atmosphere. The radar of the Cassini probe, which orbited Saturn between 2004 and 2017, provided images of Titan's surface during each fly-by of the moon. The Cassini radar was a multimode system and could operate as Synthetic Aperture Radar, radar altimeter, scatterometer and radiometer.\n\nSounding radars: these are low-frequency (normally, HF - 3 to 30 MHz - or lower) ground-penetrating Radars, used to acquire data about the planet sub-surface structure. Their low operating frequency allow them to penetrate hundreds of meters, or even kilometers, below the surface. Synthetic aperture techniques are normally exploited to reduce the ground footprint (due to the low operating frequency and the small allowable antenna dimensions, the beam is very wide) and, thus, the unwanted echo from other surface objects.\n\nThe first radar sounder flown was ALSE (Apollo Lunar Sounder Experiment) on board Apollo 17 in 1972.\n\nOther sounder instruments flown (in this case around Mars), are MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for SubSurface and Ionosphere Sounding) on board the European Space Agency's Mars Express probe, and SHARAD (mars SHAllow RADar sounder) on JPL's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Both are currently operational. A radar sounder is also used on the Japanese Moon probe SELENE, launched September 14, 2007.\n\nA similar instrument (primarily devoted to ionospheric plasma probing) was embarked on the Japanese Martian mission Nozomi (launched in 1998 but lost).\n\n"}

These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.\n\n Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or tribrach. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.\n\nLeveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.\n\nFor two spirit vials at right angles;\n\nOtherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.\n\nThe same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:\n\n\nTo obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.\n\nFor focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the sky or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.\nTo Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.\n\nIt is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the telescope towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.\n\n"}
{"id": "36184743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36184743", "title": "Thembuland", "text": "Thembuland\n\nThembuland, , is a natural region in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Its territory is the traditional region of the Thembu people, one of the sub-groups of the Xhosa nation.\n\nIt was formerly also known as \"Tamboekieland\" or \"Tambookieland\". The area of Thembuland proper includes present-day Mthatha, Mqanduli, Ngcobo, Mjanyana, Dutywa and Willowvale as well as their surroundings.\n\nThembuland was historically defined as the area between Umtata and the upper Kei River. As such it formed an area of 50 by 120 miles, although its boundary was considered disputable with Pondoland on the coast, and with Fingoland just to the south. The definition of the area has also changed over time.\n\nBefore colonial conquest, it was divided into Tembuland Proper, Emigrant Tembuland and Bomvanaland — the Bomvana were a related people who lived on the east bank of the Bashee River, in what was later the district of Elliotdale. In colonial times it was defined as consisting of the districts of Emjanyana, Engcobo, Mqanduli, Umtata, St Marks, Southeyville and Xalanga.\n\nThe hunter-gatherer San and Khoikhoi people inhabited the region in scattered nomadic groups from 30,000 BCE. In the 16th century, iron-working Nguni farmers entered the area from the north-east. A sub-group of the Nguni peoples became the Thembu people. Although originally classed as a separate Nguni nation, the Thembu subsequently assimilated to a large degree with the neighbouring Xhosa people.\n\nThembuland became an independent kingdom, ruled by the Hala royal clan. British interference and incursions began in the 19th century. \nFrom 1871 the Thembu became engaged in a protracted war against an alliance of neighbouring Xhosa-speaking peoples, including the Pondo, the Bomvana and the Gcaleka. The Thembu Paramount-Chief, Ngangelizwe, had sought to unite the various Thembu clans but had come under increasing military pressure from Sarhili, Paramount-Chief of the Gcaleka. The conflict had a personal side, as Ngangelizwe's Chief Wife Novili was the daughter of Sarhili, and rumours had been spread that Ngangelizwe had ill-treated her. \n\nFacing severe military pressure from the combined armies of his enemies, Chief Ngangelizwe and his Ministers approached the nominally-independent Cape Colony to negotiate alliance and possible incorporation.\n\nThe Cape Colony, having recently achieved a degree of independence from Britain under the system of Responsible Government, operated under a relatively inclusive system of multi-racial franchise - whereby qualifications for suffrage applied equally to all male residents, regardless of race. Its laws also forbade any white settlement in traditional \"Native territory\". The Cape was therefore viewed by Ngangelizwe and his ministers as a satisfactory entity to merge with. \nNgangelizwe however, was a highly controversial leader in the Xhosa-speaking community. He was hated by many in the neighbouring Pondo and Gcaleka states, and accused of a range of crimes. The Cape Government demanded his resignation, as a precondition for any annexation. \n\nAccording to Cape Parliamentary records, the Thembu leaders demanded, among other things, 4 magistracies with equal access to the Cape's current system of nonracial franchise, and military protection from both the British and their Gcaleka enemies. If these conditions were incorporated into law, together with respect for the traditional authority of the chiefs, then they would request incorporation. \nThe Cape government agreed to these terms and signed them into law with the \"Tembuland Annexation Act (1876)\", creating the magisterial districts of Xalanga, St. Marks, Elliot and Engcobo. Additional stipulations of the 1876 act were that the Thembu traditional government system was to get full government recognition; Thembu King, Chiefs and Subchiefs were to earn government salaries; normal taxation would only begin in 1878; the boundaries of Thembuland were final and were not to be altered in any way; and that the sale of alcohol be prohibited to Thembu subjects.\nThe resignation of the controversial Thembu King Ngangelizwe, in favour of his successor, had initially been demanded by the Cape government as a precondition for annexation, but this condition was waived as being impractical. \nOtherwise, the terms of the incorporation were implemented as stated. Traditional land ownership was fully recognised and, with the exception of a few missionaries and white traders, Thembuland was preserved for Thembu occupation, as part of the \"Transkeian territories\". However, the British overthrow of the elected Cape government in 1878 and assumption of direct rule over the Cape Colony caused the Confederation Wars, and the later disruption of the treaty's peaceful implementation. \n\nThe annexation was only finally completed in 1885. Thembuland was defined at the time as being the territory between Umtata and the Tsomo River, and home to 60,000 people. Thembuland also submitted troops to the Frontier Armed forces of the Cape Colony, who, in this capacity, fought several victorious campaigns against their Gcaleka and Mpondo enemies.\n\nAccording to the original laws of the Cape Colony, as well as the terms of the Annexation Act, Europeans were prohibited from owning land in the Thembu territories. This was initially intended to prevent the dispossession of the Thembu by aggressive settlers, however in the ensuing political upheavals, the law was badly enforced. \n\nFrom the 1880s, the pro-imperialist governments of Prime Ministers John Gordon Sprigg and Cecil Rhodes turned a blind eye to white incursions. Already by 1882, white settlers had illegally moved north of the Great Kei River and, in the same year, Chief Ngangelizwe himself sold territory within Umtata district to white land owners. \n\nIn 1894, the \"Glen Gray Act\" constituted the Thembu chiefs as leaders of \"District Councils\", thereby establishing a system of proxy rulers. The Government of Cecil Rhodes passed legislation, such as the \"Parliamentary Registration Act\", that severely curtailed the voting rights of the Thembu and all Black African citizens of the Cape. However it was the Union of South Africa, in the Twentieth Century, that was to oversee the greatest growth in oppression against the people of Thembuland. \n\nLater, in the lead up to the Union of South Africa and the beginning of Apartheid, the franchise and property rights of the Thembu were gradually revoked, and what rights remained were applied only in their original homeland.\n\nLater still, under apartheid, the Transkei was turned into a bantustan. In the ethnic theory underpinning apartheid, the Transkei was regarded as the \"homeland\" of the Xhosa people. As a result, the Thembu people are often misidentified as being Xhosa.\n\nThe current Thembu king is King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, son of Sabata Jonguhlanga Dalindyebo, and his praise name is \"Zwelibanzi\". \n\nThe King caused controversy in 2009, by calling for secession from South Africa, as a response to a criminal case against him. In December 2009 King Buyelekhaya was convicted of offences including culpable homicide, kidnapping, arson and assault. In response he proposed secession from South Africa and later demanded that the South African government pay the king R900m and the tribe a further R80bn in compensation for the humiliation caused by the criminal trial.\n\nDalindyebo was imprisoned in December 2015, has since been customarily dethroned, and is expected to be administratively dethroned in the near future.\n"}

The Tropical Andes' area spans .\n\nThe Tropical Andes are located in South America following the path of the Andes. They run, mainly, through five countries, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The land initially was roughly but has decreased to , leaving 25% of the original land. Due to the massive amount of area the landscape is diverse. Diverse landscapes lead to diverse habitats and the ability to provide needed resources for many species. The diverse landscape includes snow-topped mountains down to canyons and valleys. The different vegetation as altitude changes includes tropical rainforests at , cloud forests ranging from , and the highest altitudes of contain grasslands up to snow. The most diverse cloud forests found in Peru and Bolivia covers . Dry forests and woodlands are also found throughout the Tropical Andes. The range is also home to the deepest gorge in Peru at deep and Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable water with an altitude of .\n\nThe Tropical Andes are a biodiversity hotspot named the \"global epicenter of biodiversity\" according to the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund.\n\nThe Tropical Andes are an area of rich biodiversity. This location contains about 45,000 plant species of which 20,000 are endemic. There are over 3,000 vertebrate species with about 1,500 endemic. Besides plants and vertebrates, 1,666 bird species, 479 reptile species, and 830 amphibian species reside in the Tropical Andes. All hotspots are important for conservation biology, but especially the tropical Andes with so many endemic species. The biodiversity within the Tropical Andes is dwindling in numbers due to threats.\n\nThe diversity between vegetation throughout altitudes was further studied in Colombia. Chengyu Weng studied how pollen diversity is affected by different temperatures due to changing altitudes. The team studied different vegetations, the subandean forest, Andean forest, subparamo and grassparamo located in the Andes. There was more plant diversity as altitude increased throughout the vegetations. Pollen diversity positively correlated with more diversity at lower altitudes. With these findings, they were able to see changes in plant diversity in the past 430000 years. During hot temperatures, pollen diversity increased at higher altitudes, from plant species moving up. Cooler temperatures saw pollen diversity in lower altitudes. The study explains how temperature influences plant diversity.\n\nThe ecoregions in the hotspot include:\n\n\nA hotspot can be identified as an area with great biological diversity with high endemism. The location must also have lost a significant amount of land and threatened species, according to the fourth edition of the \"Essentials of Conservation Biology\". The term \"hotspots\" was used by Norman Myers written to describe ten tropical forests. The forests contained the characteristics of high levels of plant endemism and loss of habitats. Myers went on to add eight more hotspots by 1990. The Conservation International reassessed Myers definition of a hotspot and by 1999 criteria for a hotspot developed to be used globally. A hotspot needs 1,500 endemic vascular plant species and a loss of at least 70 percent of its original land. With these criteria, 25 hotspots were identified in 1999 and published in the journal \"Nature\". They contained at least 44 percent of earth's endemics plants and 35 percent of land vertebrates. The combined area between the 25 hotspots used to cover 11.8 percent of land. The total amount of land has reduced from 17 million km to 2 million km, or about 85% of the land. This leaves this great biodiversity limited to about 1 percent of Earth's land surface.\n\nThere are a little over 30 hotspots now recorded and used for research. A few other hotspots include the Caribbean Islands, Himalaya, and Japan. Due to a hotspot's great diversity and endemic species, conservation biology and many other sources conduct research in these locations. Research is also needed considering the amount of threatened species in hotspots. Researchers have the opportunity to preserve many species along with their habitats within hotspots. Some organizations that use hotspots for research are World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Birdlife International, Conservation International, and World Wildlife Fund. Research is also done on humans' impact to the hotspots land and species that reside in them. Funding for hotspot conservation has been estimated at $750 million accumulated over the past fifteen years. By focusing research on hotspots, many species can be helped at once.\nOne specific research studies fire's impact on vegetation in Northern Ecuador of the Tropical Andes. This location's variety of vegetation includes different forests, land used for agricultural and páramo, or tropical alpine found at 4,500 meters. Páramo is dominated by grasses but still high in diversity. The article \"Fire Ecology and Conservation in the High Tropical Andes: Observations from Northern Ecuador\" looks at páramo's ability to withstand disturbances such as fire. Humans have lived in this location for 7,000 years, and the páramo has been through fires and grazing. The writer believes that policies used to implement fire suppression are not probable or beneficiary to the plant. Policies instead should be written up according to specific plant species and impact on natives living there. This is a small example of research in the Tropical Andes that could make a big impact to saving diversity.\nFurther research is also processed on looking into the decrease in avian populations, focusing in hotspots due to its massive diversity. The study focuses in Endemic Bird Areas or EBAs in order to understand why they become extinct and possible conservation plans. there were 218 EBAs, with over 30 percent of bird species threatened. EBAs located in hotspots interfere with many human activities, leading to habitat loss in 51 percent of EBAs. According to the article's chart, five EBAs with habitat loss are located in the Tropical Andes. By studying the effect of human activities on EBAs that are losing avian populations, plans to help the future of other EBAs are possible. Their results showed that if a species has habitat specificity and is large in size, the chance of extinction increases. Habitat loss will impact those with habitat specificity greatly. Conservation goals need to look into human activities and the bird's habitat specificity in order to make a positive impact.\nAn example of research on a specific threatened species in the Tropical Andes is the rare \"Tremarctos ornatus\", also known as Andean (or spectacled) bears. Two males were captured, and radio collars were attached in order to track and study their habits and movement. They portrayed similar patterns compared to many other bear species. These findings contrasted with the belief of spectacled bears being nocturnal and no change in patterns between seasons because only slight change in temperature. The radio collars proved these spectacled bears to be diurnal. The bears were in motion from sunrise to sunset with periods of rest in between. There was a small change in level of activity between seasons, with an increase during the dry season. Due to the technology of radio collars, hypotheses about these bears were tested. By knowing their habitat and lifestyle, we can better understand and help threatened species.\n\nThe Tropical Andes is said to be the most diverse of the world's scientific hotspots of diversity. The journal \"Nature\" contained an article by Norman Myers comparing the 25 hotspots with land and species in 2000. At the time, the Tropical Andes was recorded to have 45,000 plant species with the next closest hotspots recorded to have 25,000 plant species. Actually a sixth of all plant species can reside in the Tropical Andes. The Tropical Andes also has the most endemic plant species at 20,000, while the next hotspot contains 15,000. The Tropical Andes has a lot of land compared to other hotspots, but is not the largest. that The large land area shows the Tropical Andes can provide for biodiversity with diverse landscape.\nMany endemic plant and animal species are currently threatened in the Tropical Andes. An example of a threatened plant species is the Andean bromelilad, an endemic plant that takes up to 100 years to mature and a common diet for species that forage. Other plants species include many crops such as tobacco and potatoes. Some endemic animals include the Andean condor, which almost became extinct from hunting. Thanks to a conservation reintroduction program, their numbers are growing. Another threatened endemic bird in the Tropical Andes is the yellow-eared parrot. One threat this species faces is the loss of the vulnerable wax palm. The yellow-eared parrot uses the wax palm for nesting and roosting. However, humans, especially in Colombia, are removing the vulnerable wax palm from the wild for Palm Sunday. Some conservation programs are helping the situation to educate churches to use other resources besides the vulnerable wax palm. The yellow tailed monkey is another endemic animal being endangered. They are one of the rarest mammals, with a recorded population of 250 found in the cloud forests of Peru. They are threatened by humans causing habitat loss and fragmentation of their habitat. Their slow maturity and low population densities do not help. Programs have tried to relocate them to secondary forests, but attempts have failed. Many species reside in the Tropical Andes but are threatened severely.\n\nThere are many threats that the Tropical Andes faces every day. One of the main threats is human activities, especially with increasing population. Some activities include mining, logging, and construction. Humans also use land for agriculture and keep relocating once the land is used up. Valleys are severely degraded due to humans living there. Hydroelectric dams have also been put in the Tropical Andes and negatively pressured cloud forests. The 25 percent of land that is protected is still poorly managed with little help from the public from lack of education. Invasive species have also been a threat to the Tropical Andes' land and species, possibly brought in by humans. Invasive species include the American bullfrog and certain grasses used for cattle.\nHumans have the ability to cause habitat loss and habitat fragmentation for species. The forest habitats that are threatened in the Tropical Andes are modified and destroyed 30 percent faster than lower tropical areas. Fragmentation causes a separation within species and decreases the diversity of genes. There is the possibility of inbreeding to increase as well. An article also looked at fragmentation causing certain phenotypes to arise in organisms. By studying feathers of 2,500 individual bird species within nine forests, observation showed asymmetry linked with fragmentation. Asymmetry was lowest if the forest continued and highest with small or medium fragmentation. They suggest asymmetry of bird feathers influenced by the stress of fragmentation and changing environments. That is one outcome from fragmentation in the Tropical Andes.\nA study by Niall O'Dea looks at bird communities in general and how habitat degradation impacts them. He compared the bird communities that reside in primary forests, secondary forests, edge habitat and agricultural land, all modified by humans. Most diversity was found in secondary forests and edge habitats but different species. The agricultural land and primary forest held the lowest diversity. This study suggests that within Andean montane forests, preserving secondary forests offers most benefit for these threatened birds.\nAnother serious threat to the Tropical Andes is global warming, the effect of too much of greenhouse gasses trapped in the air that hold in heat. Some locations are increasing in temperature and others decreasing. The change in temperatures has a major effect on the Tropical Andes; some say that this is more negative than deforestation. One serious issue is the melting of the glaciers in the mountains. It is estimated that 80 percent of freshwater comes from mountains and with them melting about half of the Earth's population will be affected. All over the world glaciers are melting, but the mountains in the Tropical Andes are very susceptible. It is said that a quarter of the Tropical Andes glacier has already begun retreating. These glaciers make up many species water supply, and the location could be in crisis if they melt away. Glaciers in the Andes provide two main functions; decrease seasonal discharge variability and provide greater specific discharge. The article by Bryan Mark predicts an increase in discharge as glaciers melt, with the ability to trace glacier water melting into watersheds using isotopes. Global warming can lead to the extinction of many species, especially in hotspots. A study done by Jay Malcolm predicts that less than 1 percent up to 43 percent of endemic biota will become extinct due to global warming. He also believes the Tropical Andes is in the top six vulnerable hotspots, with the possibility of plant extinction exceeding 2000 species.\nGlobal warming is also causing an increase in diseases among amphibians. Considering that the Tropical Andes is recorded to have the most amphibians, some restricted to this location, diseases could decrease the diversity greatly. Another factor is that 400 of the amphibian species are already threatened. These deadly fungi have actually been linked to the extinction of dinosaurs. One chytrid fungus that is infecting amphibians is the batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This fungus will impair the amphibian's skin and reduce its ability to absorb. One example of an amphibian in the Tropical Andes is the genus \"Atelopus\", with 56 of the species Critically Endangered. Due to increase in temperature, the fungus has the ability to spread rapidly and thrive on living amphibians.\nA new threat that is being researched is the effect from nitrogen deposition. Studies done in Europe have shown diversity among plants decreased due to nitrogen deposition. Current models are estimating what could happen to hotspots across the world if nitrogen deposition keeps increasing. By comparing to past research, nitrogen deposition has already increased 50 percent since the 1990s. The estimation for the future shows an increase by 100 percent in 2050. Considering the great plant diversity in the Tropical Andes, especially so many endemics, nitrogen deposition could be a severe threat. The decrease in plant diversity could cause a chain reaction on other species that depend on the plants.\nThese are just few threats the Tropical Andes faces on a daily basis. The impact on the land is shown by a 75 percent decrease from its original mass. Species affected are decreasing in numbers, and the number of species listed on the Endangered Species Act is increasing. The situation is worse when threatened species are endemic to the Tropical Andes. 14 endemic mammals and 110 endemic birds are threatened in the Tropical Andes. Two species from the Tropical Andes have already become extinct.\n\n\n"}

The area consists of Green Hill and Rocky Hill and surrounding land.\n\nHistorically these hills have been also named the Maidens Paps because of their shape.\n\nGentle slopes on the Maiden Paps support species-rich Magnesian Limestone grassland dominated by upright brome Bromus erectus, blue moor-grass Sesleria albicans, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha, red fescue Festuca rubra, glaucous sedge Carex flacca and herbs such as common rock-rose Helianthemum nummularia, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor, fairy flax Linum catharticum, wild thyme Thymus praecox, pignut Conopodium majus, small scabious Scabiosa columbaria and sea plantain Plantago maritima. Of particular note is a small population of perennial flax Linum anglicum, which occurs here towards the northern limit of its distribution range in Great Britain, and locally uncommon plants such as frog orchid Coeloglossum viride, autumn gentian Gentianella amarella, purple milk-vetch Astragalus danicus and thrift Armeria maritima. Steep south-facing slopes above the reclaimed railway line support a more open, herb-rich grassland characterised by common quaking-grass Briza media, blue moorgrass, crested hair-grass and red fescue with yarrow Achillea millefolium, hairy violet Viola hirta, hoary ragwort Senecio erucifolius, and fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea.
