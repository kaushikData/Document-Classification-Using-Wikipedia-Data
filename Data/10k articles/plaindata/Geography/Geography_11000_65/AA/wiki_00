(His grandfather fought in the Prussian Army against Napoleon.) He attended the Brunswick Military Academy and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Brunswick Army in 1841. In 1847 he resigned his commission and emigrated to the United States, settling in Alabama. He served as an engineer in the U.S. Coast Survey, surveying the United States–Mexico border and Mobile Bay, Alabama, but his desire to serve in a combat position in the Mexican–American War was denied and he returned to Brunswick in 1849, but not before marrying 19-year-old Florence Mary of Mobile, Alabama. He returned to the United States in 1854 and purchased a farm near Wallingford, Connecticut. He later moved to New York state.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, Steinwehr raised a regiment, consisting primarily of German immigrants, the 29th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which he commanded at the First Battle of Bull Run. The regiment was in reserve during the battle, but served an important screening role during the Union retreat. He was promoted to brigadier general on October 12, 1861, and commanded the 2nd Brigade of Louis Blenker's division of the Army of the Potomac. This brigade was moved into Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont's Mountain Department on April 1, 1862, and it fought in the Valley Campaign against Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Fremont's command was expanded into an army corps, which was soon commanded by Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel, another German immigrant. Steinwehr was given the 2nd Division in that corps. It was assigned to the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, and participated in the Northern Virginia Campaign, but had little role in the Second Battle of Bull Run. Although the corps joined the Army of the Potomac, the division did not fight at the Battle of Antietam or the Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nThe command of what was now called the XI Corps changed to Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard in 1863, and Steinwehr continued to command the division in the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg. The corps was the victim of the surprise flanking attack by Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, and the overwhelming attack by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps on the first day of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. At Chancellorsville, Steinwehr's division had one brigade, that of Col Adolphus Buschbeck involved in resisting Jackson's attack. At Gettysburg, when the corps was forced to retreat back through the town to Cemetery Hill, Col Charles Coster took a brigade of Steinwehr's division out to the edge of the town, where it sacrificed itself buying time for the retreating soldiers of the other two divisions. These two defeats seriously degraded the combat effectiveness of the XI Corps and humiliated many of the German immigrant soldiers in the corps. Nevertheless, Steinwehr was well thought of by his superiors. After Chancellorsville, General Howard wrote that Steinwehr's bearing during the battle was \"cool, collected and judicious.\" Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams, a fellow division commander, described him as a \"remarkably intelligent and agreeable person.\"\n\nIn September 1863, two divisions of the XI Corps, those of Steinwehr and MG Carl Schurz, were transferred to the Western Theater to help relieve the besieged Union army in Chattanooga, becoming part of the Army of the Cumberland. They served under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker in the Battle of Wauhatchie, where the brigade of Col Orland Smith from Steinwehr's division distinguished itself. Buschbeck's brigade was engaged alongside Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's command at the Third Battle of Chattanooga. After that battle the XI Corps was combined with the equally depleted XII Corps to form the new XX Corps. That corps fought under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in the Atlanta Campaign and March to the Sea, but Steinwehr was essentially reorganized out of his job and he commanded no more combat units during the war. He resigned his commission on July 3, 1865.\n\nAfter the war, Steinwehr was employed as a geographer and cartographer. He returned to Connecticut to accept a professorship at Yale University. He moved to Washington, D.C., then to Ohio, and returned to New York. He died in Buffalo, New York, and is buried in Albany Rural Cemetery, Menands, New York. Steinwehr was a prolific author, including \"A School Geography: Embracing a Mathematical, Physical, and Political Descriptions of the Earth\" (published in 1870); co-author of \"Primary Geography\" (1870) and \"An Elementary Treatise on Physical Geography\" (1873); editor of \"The Centennial Gazetteer of the United States\" (1874). He is memorialized by the prominent Steinwehr Avenue in the city of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22791469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22791469", "title": "Bedding (horticulture)", "text": "Bedding (horticulture)\n\nBedding, in horticulture, refers to the temporary planting of fast-growing plants into flower beds to create colourful, temporary, seasonal displays, during spring, summer or winter. Plants used for bedding are generally annuals, biennials or tender perennials; succulents are gaining in popularity.\n\nSome bedding plants are also referred to as \"patio plants\" because they are widely used in pots and other containers positioned on patios, terraces, decking and other areas around houses. Larger tender \"conservatory plants\" may also be moved out from greenhouses or conservatories and planted out in borders (or stood in their pots in sheltered positions) for the warmer months, then returned to shelter for the winter.\n\nThe modern bedding plant industry breeds and produces plants with a neat, dwarf habit, which flower uniformly and reliably. They are bred primarily for use in large-scale bedding schemes where uniformity and predictability is of paramount importance, but this is often achieved by losing the plants' individual character, and has been criticised by such notable plantsmen as the late Christopher Lloyd, who championed an informal style of bedding.\n\nThere exists a huge range of plants specifically grown to produce a period of flower colour throughout the spring and summer, and (usually) discarded after flowering. They may conveniently be divided into four groups:-\n\nFormal bedding, as seen in parks and large gardens, where whole flower beds are replanted two or three times a year, is a costly and labour-intensive process. Towns and cities are encouraged to produce impressive displays by campaigns such as \"Britain in bloom\". \nPlants used for spring bedding are often biennials (sown one year to flower the next), or hardy, but short-lived, perennials. Spring-flowering bulbs such as tulips are often used, typically with forget-me-nots, wallflowers, winter pansies and polyanthus.\n\nPlants used for summer bedding are generally annuals or tender perennials. They become available (often as what are referred to as \"plug plants\") in nurseries and garden centres during spring, to be gradually \"hardened off\" (acclimatised to outdoor conditions) by the purchaser and finally planted out around the time that the last frosts are expected. Experienced gardeners keep an eye on the weather forecasts at that time of year and are on standby to protect their bedding displays overnight with horticultural fleece (or the older alternatives of net curtains or newspaper) if frost threatens.\n\nCarpet bedding employs two or more contrasting plant cultivars with a neat, dwarf habit and distinct colouring (of flower or foliage) to create geometric displays. It is often used to form such things as lettering, logos or trademarks, coats of arms, or floral clocks. Suitable plants are rosette-forming succulents such as \"Echeveria\" or fairly slow-growing or mat-forming foliage plants, such as coloured-leaved \"Alternanthera\" cultivars, which are tolerant of clipping; such plants may also be used in three-dimensional sculptural forms or pseudo-topiary.\n\nPlanted in autumn to give a display until early spring, the plants used for winter bedding are mainly hardy perennials. As it has to be planted at the same time of year as spring bedding does, winter bedding tends to be less commonly seen, except in containers such as windowboxes. Some are short-lived and will be discarded after their first display; others may be used as a source of cuttings for the next year. Winter-hardy ornamental vegetables such as cultivars of kale and cabbage with coloured or variegated foliage are increasingly common. \"Primula\" cultivars (polyanthus and primroses) are commonly used, as are winter-flowering heathers and \"Viola\" ×\"wittrockiana\", winter pansies. Variegated evergreens such as cultivars of \"Vinca minor\" (lesser periwinkle), \"Euonymus fortunei\" and \"Hedera helix\" (ivies) are also popular.\n\n"}

{"id": "47138210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47138210", "title": "Champlain's Dream", "text": "Champlain's Dream\n\nChamplain’s Dream: The European Founding of North America is a biography written by American historian, David Hackett Fischer and published in 2008. It is a biography of French \"soldier, spy, master mariner, explorer, cartographer, artist and \"Father of New France\"\", Samuel de Champlain. \nIn this book, Fischer examines more closely Champlain's personal impact on the establishment of a French colony in the New World - securing royal support despite opposition from formidable foes like Marie de Medici and Cardinal Richelieu, negotiating with \"Indian nations\" and imbuing the new colony with the values of humanism. He is also remembered for having survived 27 crossings of the North Atlantic in 37 years - without ever losing a ship. Despite never being the \"senior official\" of New France, Champlain functioned as an absolute ruler and as Fischer shows, his vision for New France (a vision that was very much a product of Champlain's upbringing and experiences) helps explain both its triumphs and failures.\n\nFischer has substantial experience using the life and perspective of a great leader to tell a broader historical narrative; he employed a similar structure in \"Washington's Crossing\" for which he received a Pulitzer Prize in 2005.\n\nChamplain's dreams as an explorer and cartographer are documented in his own writings - one of them was to find a North American passage to China. Ostensibly, his overarching dream was to establish a successful French colony in the New World. This required Champlain to:\nBetween 1535 and 1601, six French settlements in the New World ended in failure. Champlain carefully studied the experiences of earlier explorers like Jacques Cartier and Pierre de Chauvin. But then, he needed to convince men like the duc de Sully, the King's Chief Minister who thought American colonies were against French national interest as they distracted from business at home. Other noblemen of the time would have preferred domestic reforms to expansion abroad and Champlain stayed alert to their machinations. \nEven after royal support could be secured, \"rival merchants, competing seaports and the representatives of foreign powers\" conspired against the colonies of 'New France' and it fell to Champlain to lead his men to deal with all kinds of problems.The explorers had to claim land, protect it from the \"Indian nations\" and convince French subjects to emigrate to the New World - a prospect they were much less enthusiastic about than Britishers fleeing religious persecution. \nEven after all of this was done and the colonies began to run smoothly, he had to regulate unlicensed trade on the rivers and build trading posts to make sure the colony stayed profitable.\n\nBut as Fischer puts forward in this book, Champlain's dream went further than that. He envisioned that this colony would be \"a place where people of different cultures could live together in amity and concord\" and hoped that North America could be this place. He dreamed of collective action, humanistic ideals like peace and tolerance and a Francophone legacy in the new world. Fischer makes frequent reference to Champlain's \"grand design\" or his sweeping vision.\n\nWhat Fischer seeks to do in this book, after articulating this aspiration, is ask a series of questions about why this man believed in it and what steps he took to make it a reality.\n\nFischer rejects the view that Champlain was just another European mercenary looking to seize lands and enslave native populations like many other early British and Spanish explorers in North America. He writes admiringly of Champlain's humanist values - that he treated \"Indian nations\" with respect and pursued peaceful coexistence through policies of \"trade alliances, cultural tolerance and intermarriage\".\n\n\nFischer describes the unique character of Brouage, the town of Champlain's youth as the \"salty broth in which our hero was cooked\".\nDue to its thriving economy and \"cosmopolitan nature\", the man historians know as Champlain's father managed to work his way up from a humble ship's pilot to a naval captain in the King's Marine. Thus, Champlain's early life was one of visible opportunity and upwards mobility, an experience that Fischer claims Champlain's later optimism and persistence is a result of.\n\nBrouage was in a region that was deeply suspicious of Paris, the seat of power but enjoyed a \"broad diversity of language, culture, religion and ecology\". This upbringing inculcated in Champlain an exceptional curiosity about cultural differences. He learned Dutch, English and Spanish in school and from his neighbors and \"the art of navigation\" from his father. Despite not having a 'classical' education, Samuel de Champlain became skilled in the use of weapons and likely learned map-making from a Champlain family friend who was an \"engineer and geographer to the King\". Fischer emphasizes the exposure Champlain had as a youth and the different strengths he picked up through his family, his education and his town to show that each served him well in the adventures that would come later on.\n\n\nEven the small town of Brouage was not immune from the clashes between Calvinists and Roman Catholics that occurred after the Protestant Reformation. Fischer writes about an incident in which a rival port city sent \"barges full of sand and rock\" to block the channel leading to Brouage and sabotage its trade. After 1628, Brouage was even turned into a garrison by Cardinal Richelieu, its sea trade having been cut off. \nEven though historians cannot confirm whether Champlain was a Protestant or a Catholic, his writings show the influence of a deep \"Christian faith\". Fischer goes further, drawing parallels between King Henry IV of France and Champlain, arguing that both men detested intolerance and believed it to be \"anti-Christian\". He claims that both thought religion was a force for social and political stability, faith was an intensely personal choice and religious controversy mattered far less than \"piety, humility and good works\".\n\nFischer claims that Champlain gained an understanding of the need for cultural acceptance, but also limited violence to ensure stability from war.\n\nOne of the new theories published in this book is that Champlain was actually the son of French King, Henry IV. Historians such as Marcel Trudel and Hubert Deschamps have previously expressed belief that Champlain was actually the son of an \"unknown French nobleman\". Fischer, however, said that both Champlain’s \"close relationship with the King\" and \"the King’s travel history in the nine months prior to Champlain’s birth\" lead him to believe that Henry IV was in fact the father. At a book reception in Brandeis, Fischer stated that, “He was at the right place at the right time, so to speak. It could have happened. Granted that there is exactly zero hard evidence to support that theory, but [if Henry IV were his father] it would explain many anomalies in their relationship. It’s only a possibility, but it’s very clear that the two of them had a very special relationship.”\n\nMany reviewers of Fischer's work pointed out that little is known about Samuel de Champlain- both in the United States and also in Canada. Despite the variety of his achievements, he is a somewhat obscure figure.\n\nThere is only a single “authentic likeness . . . is known to survive from his own time”. This likeness is a one-inch engraving wielding an advanced wheel-lock arquebus and with a \"panache\", or a feathery plume in his helmet. Every other portrait or image came much later.\n\nAnother is that he wrote \"thousands of pages about what he did, but only a few words about who he was\" - historians hardly know his birthdate, level of schooling or even whether he was baptized as a Protestant or a Catholic.\n\nFischer has also offered the view that Champlain may have been forgotten due to the predominance of the Annales school of French historiography. Under its influence, the \"structure of society and the details of daily and communal life\" were seen as more important subjects for history than great men or major events.\n\nIn response to the many questions left unanswered, Fischer devotes a series of Appendices that examine competing theories on subjects from his birthdate to the questions of authorship or authenticity in his surviving writings.\n\nIn the Introduction to this book, Fischer mentions the need for biography to walk the line between hagiography and iconoclasm.\n\nIn an address to the New York Historical Society, Fischer lays out the three rules of biography he picked up from historians Francis Parkman and Samuel Eliot Morison: \nPartly in deference to this process, the Introduction to the book is subtitled \"In Search of Champlain\" and Fischer makes frequent mention of the role of \"physical evidence\" in knowing history.\n\nTony Horwitz, writing for the Washington Post described \"Champlain's Dream\" as \"exhaustively researched\" though perhaps too effusive in its praise for Champlain's character. He writes that Champlain seems “almost perfect, and perfectly dull” and though Fischer tries, Champlain remains an abstract figure and doesn't come alive. Moreover, Horwitz describes the near avoidance of Champlain's love life or trust placed in Champlain's own writings of how the Native Americans loved him as odd notes. He adds that the absence of a dramatic event to offer a tight focus (like in Fischer's other books, Washington's Crossing and \"Paul Revere's Ride\") throws off the book's pace.\n\nMax Boot, in the New York Times takes the view that this work must be considered within the view of how little documentation exists of Champlain's life and how he \"remains a relatively obscure corner of our continent’s history\". Since Fischer's \"plain, unadorned\" prose is seeded with \"intriguing ideas\", the reader's interest is caught by how this man they barely knew anything about was so versatile and accomplished and how smoothly Fischer's narrative of his life fits its big ideas together.\n\nIn general, the response was positive with \"Champlain's Dream\" being declared one of the best books of 2008 by the New York Times (100 Notable Books) and Publishers Weekly (Best Books of the Year) as well as a number of regional papers. It was also a runner-up for the 2009 Cundill Prize.\n\n"}
{"id": "49063156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49063156", "title": "Climate of Buenos Aires", "text": "Climate of Buenos Aires\n\nBuenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, has a temperate climate, which is classified as a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") under the Köppen climate classification with four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid with frequent thunderstorms while winters are cool and drier with frosts that occurs on average twice per year. Spring and fall are transition seasons characterized by changeable weather. At the central observatory, the highest recorded temperature is while the lowest recorded temperature is .\n\nDifferent climatic factors influence the climate of Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to the city in the form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.\n\nBuenos Aires is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: \"Cfa\"). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) being rare. Thus, cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds from the southwest (which are not moderated by it).\n\nThe climate of Buenos Aires is dominated by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subantarctic and antarctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35S (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system in the center of the country (at around 40S). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.\n\nThe city is located in an area in which the Pampero and the Sudestada winds pass by. Being located in the Pampas, the weather is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms. The Pampero wind brings in cold, dry air from the south while warm humid tropical air produces sultry \"nortes\" (a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves). Often, the passage of the Pampero winds occurs as a cold front passes through, leading to strong gusts from the south or southeast, a decrease in humidity and temperature, and an increase in the atmospheric pressure. When the cold Pampero winds meet with warm humid air from the north, thunderstorms are produced. The Sudestada winds are formed when a high pressure system located in southern Argentina interacts with a low pressure system over Uruguay and southern Brazil. When Sudestadas form, they bring long periods of precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. These are common during the winter months. Because the Sudestada brings the highest wind speeds (particularly when these winds are combined with the astronomical tides), the Sudestada is responsible for floods that occur in low-lying areas. Its geomorphology along with inadequate drainage network and infrastructure, a flat landscape, and low elevations (much of Buenos Aires lies between above sea level) makes Buenos Aires highly vulnerable to flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall. Flooding impacts the neighbourhoods La Boca and Barracas which are in the southern parts of the city, more low-lying and inhabited by poor people (of low socioeconomic status).\n\nThe urban heat island makes the city warmer than suburban and rural areas. On average, Buenos Aires is warmer than the surrounding areas by owing to the urban heat island. The average heat island is in summer than in winter. This varies by season; its influence during the day is the strongest in July than in January. In contrast, the urban heat island effect during nights is the most intense in January than in July.\n\nThe El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a major factor in the variation of annual precipitation within Buenos Aires and the Pampas, particularly during spring and summer. During an El Niño year, precipitation is higher, with a significant increase in precipitation from November to January. In contrast, La Niña years are associated with lower precipitation; precipitation is below average during October–December.\n\nSprings in Buenos Aires are typically mild during the day with cool to cold nights. The average high is while the average low is . It is one of the rainiest seasons in the city, averaging of precipitation and 28 days with measurable precipitation. Nonetheless, most precipitation events are short in duration.\n\nSpring is characterized by changeable weather with temperatures that can fluctuate. Cold polar air from the south can bring cooler temperatures. An extreme example of this was in November 2007, when cold polar air from the south brought temperatures down to on the morning of November 15. The same polar air affected many parts of the country, bringing cold temperatures and snow in coastal parts of Patagonia. In contrast, hot humid air from the north produces sultry days; the highest temperature recorded in spring is on 27 November 1955. In some cases, heat waves, can occur, particularly in November.\n\nSummers are hot and humid. On average, mornings and afternoons are hot whereas temperatures drop considerably at night. The average high is while the average low is . With a mean precipitation of , it is the rainiest season. This is due to hot temperatures and high insolation that lead to the development of a low pressure system called the Chaco Low situated over northern Argentina that interacts with the South Atlantic High to generate a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the region, favouring precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms. The Chaco Low also interacts with the South Atlantic high to bring warm and tropical air from the north which is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest due to higher insolation.\n\nHeat waves are a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on electricity usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams as a result of these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.\n\nAt the beginning of autumn, temperatures are warm to hot in the afternoon while nights and mornings are mild. Later on in the season, conditions are cooler featuring mild afternoons, and cold nights and mornings. The average high and low are and respectively while precipitation averages during this season. Similar to spring, the season is characterized by changeable weather conditions with temperatures that can fluctuate; temperatures as high as and as low as have been recorded. Periods of rainy weather occur although these are usually of short duration. Frosts rarely occur, though they can occur as early as May.\n\nJune to August are the winter months in Buenos Aires. Winters are cold with mild temperatures during the day and cold nights. Highs during the season average while lows average . Lows rarely drop below , averaging 2 days each year at the central observatory, and 1 day at Aeroparque. Cold waves can occur in these months in which periods of cold temperatures can persist for days. These cold waves, particularly during severe winters lead to increases in energy demand, which can cause significant energy shortages. Snowfall occasionally occurs in the surrounding areas of the city but rarely within Buenos Aires proper; since the start of meteorological observations in 1906 at the central observatory, snowfall has only been observed thrice: June 1918, July 1928, and July 2007. This is due to the city center having higher temperatures than the surrounding areas owing to the urban heat island effect.\n\nMost of the precipitation comes from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when they come from the north or northwest as a result of a trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.\n\nTowards the end of winter in August, there are important changes in the atmospheric circulation. Warm, humid air penetrates the city, higher solar radiation and frequent synoptic weather disturbances from the west occur during the end of the winter. As such, the end of winter is usually characterized by heavy storms with lightning. This is popularly known as the \"Santa Rosa Storm\", around August 30. Based on 111 years of weather observations (1906–2016) from the central observatory, 61 years (55% of the time) have seen stormy weather occurring on days close to August 30, although not all of these have led to heavy precipitation.\n\nAccording to the central observatory, which has one of the most reliable and oldest records in South America, the highest temperature in Buenos Aires, , was recorded on 29 January 1957 while the lowest temperature recorded is on 9 July 1918.

Later a version built with Java and JOGL was developed. But the demand for a Java-based version was very little. This may be because NASA's WorldWind also has an open source Java version. So most people wanted to use a C++ based globe in their applications. That was the reason why a minimalized version, the Earth3dlib was developed.

HIA seeks to maximise the positive health impacts and minimise the negative health impacts of proposed policies, programs or projects.\n\nThe procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of impact assessment, such as environmental impact assessment or social impact assessment. HIA is usually described as following the steps listed, though many practitioners break these into sub-steps or label them differently:\n\n\nThe main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve community health and wellbeing. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both design and operational aspects of a proposal.\n\nHIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential health inequalities can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project .\n\nA number of manuals and guidelines for HIA's use have been developed (see further reading).\n\nThe proposition that policies, programs and projects have the potential to change the determinants of health underpins HIA's use. Changes to health determinants then leads to changes in health outcomes or the health status of individuals and communities. The determinants of health are largely environmental and social, so that there are many overlaps with environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment.\n\nThree forms of HIA exist:\n\n\nIt has been suggested that HIAs can be prospective (done before a proposal is implemented), concurrent (done while the proposal is being implemented) or retrospective (done after a proposal has been implemented) . This remains controversial, however, with a number of HIA practitioners suggesting that concurrent HIA is better regarded as a monitoring activity and that retrospective HIA is more akin to evaluation with a health focus, rather than being assessment per se . Prospective HIA is preferred as it allows the maximum practical opportunity to influence decision-making and subsequent health impacts.\n\nHIA practitioners can be found in the private and public sectors, but are relatively few in number. There are no universally accepted competency frameworks or certification processes. It is suggested that a lead practitioner should have extensive education and training in a health related field, experience of participating in HIAs, and have attended an HIA training course. It has been suggested and widely accepted that merely having a medical or health degree should not be regarded as an indication of competency.\n\nThe International Association for Impact Assessment has an active health section.\n\nA HIA People Directory can be found on the HIA GATEWAY.\n\nHIA is currently being used or developed around the world, most notably in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Thailand.\n\nThe new safeguard policies and standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank, were established in 2006. These contain a requirement for health impact assessment in large projects. The standards have been accepted by most of the leading lending banks who are parties to the Equator Principles. Health impact assessments are becoming routine in many large development projects in both public and private sectors of developing countries. There is also a long history of health impact assessment in the water resource development sector - large dams and irrigation systems.\n\nThe 13th International HIA Conference was held in Geneva in 2013.\n\nThe 12th International HIA Conference was held in Québec City in 2012.\n\n\n\n\"This page uses .

It can also be described as green engineering, but the design professionals best known for landscape engineering are landscape architects. Landscape engineering is the interdisciplinary application of engineering and other applied sciences to the design and creation of anthropogenic landscapes. It differs from, but embraces traditional reclamation. It includes scientific disciplines: Agronomy, Botany, Ecology, Forestry, Geology, Geochemistry, Hydrogeology, and Wildlife Biology. It also draws upon applied sciences: Agricultural & Horticultural Sciences, Engineering Geomorphology, landscape architecture, and Mining, Geotechnical, and Civil, Agricultural & Irrigation Engineering.\n\nLandscape engineering builds on the engineering strengths of declaring goals, determining initial conditions, iteratively designing, predicting performance based on knowledge of the design, monitoring performance, and adjusting designs to meet the declared goals. It builds on the strengths and history of reclamation practice. Its distinguishing feature is the marriage of landforms, substrates, and vegetation throughout all phases of design and construction, which previously have been kept as separate disciplines.\n\nThough landscape engineering embodies all elements of traditional engineering (planning, investigation, design, construction, operation, assessment, research, management, and training), it is focused on three main areas. The first is closure planning – which includes goal setting and design of the landscape as a whole. The second division is landscape design more focused on the design of individual landforms to reliably meet the goals as set out in the closure planning process. Landscape performance assessment is critical to both of these, and is also important for estimating liability and levels of financial assurance. The iterative process of planning, design, and performance assessment by a multidisciplinary team is the basis of landscape engineering.\n\nSource: McKenna, G.T., 2002. \"Sustainable mine reclamation and landscape engineering\".

He was also an Engineer, Mathematician and an Irrigation and Consulting Engineer.\n\nIt was there where Carpenter began the first organized and systematic college program for irrigation engineering starting in 1888. Those completing such instruction were awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Irrigation Engineering.\n\nCarpenter was one of the foremost leading experts on irrigation systems. During his life he investigated irrigation systems not only in North America but also in Canada and Europe. This led to his engineering consulting and water law.

{"id": "12248744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12248744", "title": "List of Keeping Up Appearances characters", "text": "List of Keeping Up Appearances characters\n\nThis page is a list of characters for the British television sitcom Keeping Up Appearances, which was shown on BBC One from 1990 to 1995.\n\nThe show's protagonist, played by Dame Patricia Routledge, is the social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket (née Walton) (b. 4 December 1930), who insists that her surname is pronounced \"Bouquet\", like a bunch of flowers. Hyacinth's primary aims in life are to impress people, particularly of the upper and upper-middle classes, and to give the impression that she is of high social standing, despite her fairly average status. \n\nHyacinth and Richard live at number 22 Blossom Avenue, in a bungalow which Hyacinth refers to as \"The Residence\" when sending letters. She describes herself as a \"local celebrity\", and believes she is held in high and enviable esteem by the community for her candlelight suppers, charity work and her involvement in the local amateur dramatics. In an attempt to make callers think she is well-off enough to employ domestic staff, she repeatedly (and famously) answers her beloved pearl-white slim line telephone with automatic redial facility with, \"The Bouquet residence; the lady of the house speaking.\" While on the phone, she is prone to making impossible requests of people, such as a shipping forecast for a river, and does not understand why they cannot be met. \n\nThose around her despise her snobbery, her constant meddling, her outlandish plans and her refusal to listen to others. Hyacinth seems completely oblivious to everyone's terror of her and wants to believe the best of most people, that they are either enamoured with her and too shy to say so or that they are trying to be considerate to her by not bothering her. However, she cannot abide anyone one-upping her when it comes to social events or showing the same snobbery she herself shows. She has a penchant for finding the most disagreeable people to try to impress, while at the same time shunning agreeable people who are of lower social standing, but never seems to learn from her mistakes.\n\nHyacinth goes to great lengths to avoid her poorer or oddly-behaving relatives (Daisy, Onslow, Rose, Bruce and, to an extent, Daddy) in public, while boasting about her richer sister (Violet, who has \"a Mercedes, sauna, and room for a pony\") in order to maintain her vaunted social status. However, she loves her family, especially her father, and will rush to their aid in times of need. She rarely acknowledges the fact, however, that her family treat her more kindly than most characters on the series whom she is trying to impress, being equally willing to come to her aid in an emergency as she is for them. \n\nAnother of Hyacinth's other quirks is that she frequently refers to or makes preparations for her candlelight suppers, attendance at which almost seems mandatory, but we never actually see one in progress. She also plans other extravagant functions such as fancy picnics and barbecues, which usually end in disaster. She is an excellent housekeeper, keeping the house immaculately clean and setting absolutely beautiful tables for dinners and functions. She is very proud of her various china dishes and objets d'art, especially her Royal Doulton tea service with the hand-painted periwinkles. She can play piano, and often attempts to sing for people. While she has a rich, strong voice, she tends to force it too hard and loudly, making her singing unpleasant to listen to. She often plots and schemes to make herself or Richard look higher-class than they are, and has a tendency to embellish upon stories of her and Richard's exploits to make them sound better than they really were, to impress other people. She does the same with stories of her son Sheridan, whom she adores even though he only wants her money. She also has a great aversion to dogs and indeed most animals, which is reciprocated by the animals themselves. \n\nAs revealed in the special \"Young Hyacinth\", Hyacinth is the eldest of the four floral-named Walton sisters: in birth order, Hyacinth, Daisy, Violet and Rose.\n\nPlayed by Clive Swift, Richard Bucket is Hyacinth's long-suffering husband who is at her beck and call. Richard is a calm, tolerant and relaxed character who cares little for enhancing or preserving social status, and he seems content with his lower-middle class standing. He is usually laid back but has two great fears; heights, and Hyacinth spending too much money on things. He pronounces his last name, Bucket, as the English word, and snaps to Hyacinth in one episode, \"It's not \"Bouquet\", it's Bucket! It was always Bucket until I met you\". \n\nRichard Bucket married Hyacinth Walton (as she was back then) on 9 February 1963 and moved into 22 Blossom Avenue at a later date. Although the house is in his name, he does not have a key for it: Hyacinth has the only key. Until series three, he works as a civil servant, a deputy in the Town Council's Department of Finance and General Purposes. He dreads the idea of retirement, as it would mean being with Hyacinth all day, every day for the rest of his life, but is forced into early retirement despite begging and pleading with his boss. After his early retirement, Hyacinth attempts to get Richard back into the workforce in a \"senior executive position\" in several jobs, but the attempts never succeed. In \"The Senior Citizens' Outing\", he is seen reading a self-help book titled, \"Can You Afford to Retire?\", suggesting he too is still eager to get back into the workforce.\n\nA few times, Richard has stood up to Hyacinth in public because of her unreasonable behaviour, driving her into shock, but he is usually meek and mild in front of other people. He is not afraid to disagree with Hyacinth in private, however, and does so frequently, though she never listens and he always winds up capitulating to her whims. These usually involve contrived plots to impress neighbours or aristocrats, or a far-fetched plan to avoid Hyacinth's down-market family, whom he actually prefers to the upper-class people Hyacinth is determined to mingle with. Whenever anyone asks how he manages to cope with Hyacinth, he often compares his marriage to being in the army: every day is routinely planned out for him, and he never has to make any decisions. He also points out that Hyacinth is extremely kind and caters to his every need. However, in \"Please Mind Your Head\", it is revealed that they are no longer intimate, as Hyacinth disapproves of it at their age, and in other episodes Richard indicates that Hyacinth lost interest in him once their son Sheridan was born.\n\nRichard and Hyacinth own a blue 1986 Rover 216, which Richard is often forced to polish, sometimes multiple times a day. He drives the car because Hyacinth has not learned to drive, but claims he only steers while Hyacinth drives by \"word of mouth\". A running gag of the series is that, besides directing every turn he makes, Hyacinth incessantly tells him to watch out for various people, animals, or objects that are on the side of the road or on the pavement, as if they might suddenly leap out and block Richard's path. An exasperated Richard usually responds with \"Minding the...\" whatever it is, in a silly voice, which irritates Hyacinth.\n\nRichard is an avid reader, and is often shown with a book in hand - he mentions to the vicar in \"Let There Be Light\" that he uses reading as an escape from Hyacinth, oftentimes reading in the bathroom to avoid interruption. However, while Richard protests otherwise, Hyacinth insists Richard's favourite hobby is gardening, and forces him to work in the garden and look happy while doing so, hoping neighbours will think they could afford a gardener but don't have one because Richard likes doing it himself. Hyacinth twice tries to get him started in golf, also to impress wealthy people, but Richard is no good at it. In \"Richard's New Hobby\", Hyacinth also tried to get him started in amateur cinematography, but an unfortunate mishap involving the police put that to an end quickly. As shown in several episodes, Richard sings, and is actually a bit better at it than Hyacinth is, but he usually does not make a habit of singing unless asked to by someone else. In \"The Father Christmas Suit\", it was revealed he also knows how to play piano (Richard plays while he and Emmet drunkenly sing \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\"). In \"How to Go on Holiday Without Really Trying\", Richard is shown to be excellent at billiards, when Onslow \"kidnaps\" him and takes him to a local pub.\n\nRoy Clarke, writer of the show, described Richard as a foil to show Hyacinth's character to worst advantage. Although various characters in the series often express bemusement as to Richard's tolerance for Hyacinth, the cast and crew observe that he simply loves her and that his sense of humour helps get him through.\n\nDaisy (played by Judy Cornwell) is the second-born of the Walton sisters. A happy, lively character, Daisy lives with her slobbish husband Onslow, her man-crazy sister Rose and their senile father. Her married surname is never given. Daisy, Onslow and Rose are the lower-class relatives Hyacinth is ashamed of. It is repeatedly mentioned that Daisy and Onslow were once very wild and passionate lovers, but Onslow has considerably cooled down with age. Daisy is constantly trying to get her husband to show passion towards her; however, she often fails to rouse any signs of affection from him save the odd compliment, and, as a result, buries herself in Mills & Boon novels.\n\nHer other attempts to get Onslow's attention include giving herself a makeover to attract the attention of other men, and getting herself a seventeen-year-old, motorbike-riding toy boy; however, Onslow was sensible enough to not fall for either of these. Much to Onslow's disbelief, Daisy repeatedly insists he is a \"menace to the female sex\" and is terrified of the thought of him possibly having another woman, or of other women (even Hyacinth) coming after him. In \"A Celebrity for the Barbecue\", she even likens him to Marlon Brando in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". It is sometimes hinted that these claims are just attempts to rouse Onslow, however.\n\nDaisy, like her husband, enjoys life in the slow lane; she spends most of her time sitting on the sofa eating, reading romance novels borrowed from the public library, or watching television. Daisy is full of life and always smiling, despite picking up her husband's bad habits of sleeping until noon, eating junk food, drinking beer and watching television all day. She and Onslow are actually fairly well-educated, and often have philosophical discussions, but these never last long because she usually tries to turn the conversation to love fairly quickly.\n\nDaisy tries to rein in Rose's dramatics, but her own flighty nature often gets in the way of these endeavours. She also has trouble keeping an eye on Daddy, and frequently has to ask Hyacinth for help when he goes off on one of his exploits, or does something outlandish at home. She makes half-hearted efforts to look nice around Hyacinth and tries to get Onslow to do the same, but usually fails. She also tries to rescue the Vicar and Emmett from Rose when she can. \n\nDaisy and Onslow have a daughter called Stephanie, who appeares only in the final episode of series one, along with her own daughter Kylie and two lovers. In \"Let There Be Light\", Daisy reveals she was once a Liverpool supporter, but changed loyalties because of Onslow's intense hatred for the team. A kindly soul at heart, Daisy does try to help Hyacinth when the latter reluctantly has to ask for help on occasion, but is rarely ever acknowledged or thanked. Like Onslow, although Hyacinth is ashamed of her, she gets along well with every other character she meets during the series thanks to her cheerful nature.\n\nOnslow's surname is never given. He is played by Geoffrey Hughes, is Hyacinth's brother-in-law, and is a tattooed, beer-guzzling, unemployed and apathetic slob intensely despised by Hyacinth. Onslow threatens his sister-in-law's social prestige with his scruffy clothes and common, coarse ways. Onslow is proudly \"workshy, bone idle and out of condition\", and rarely gets up before lunch or dinner time. In multiple episodes, it is implied he was a bit wild in his youth, and it is suggested he may even have served time in prison, but he has considerably mellowed with age and is a gentle soul under his rough exterior.\n\nHe watches television all day every day, eating and drinking constantly and rarely moving from his armchair save to go to the bookie's on occasion. He calls himself \"the breadwinner\", but his only income comes from betting on horses and Social Security. Nevertheless, Onslow's intellectual reading, and viewing of Open University programmes, have made him knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects. He is also a fan of an unnamed football club, though he is known to dislike Liverpool – so much so that he felt ready to divorce Daisy when she revealed on their honeymoon that she supported Liverpool. Very occasionally, he goes to the local pub to play billiards or darts, once challenging Richard to play billiards and discovering Richard was actually better at it than he was. He also loves to eat, his favourite snack being Smoky Bacon Crisps. He owns both a bicycle and a 1978 Ford Cortina, which is falling apart and tends to back-fire and belch dark clouds of exhaust.\n\nOnslow owns a mixed-breed dog, which lives outside in the rusting carcass of a Hillman Avenger in the front garden. However, he indicates that this is the dog's preference and not neglect on his part, and in several episodes it is shown he does care deeply for the dog and treat her well. He is an inattentive husband to Daisy, in that he never takes her out, nor has he ever bought her any jewellery or clothing. However, he does compliment her on occasion, and the two seem fond of each other despite their issues. His sex drive has slackened off considerably since his youth, and Daisy's frequent efforts to arouse him are often in vain.\n\nDespite Hyacinth's utter contempt of him and her belief that he cannot succeed at anything, in the Christmas special \"Sea Fever\", Onslow managed to win a newspaper competition, which earned him and Daisy a first-class vacation on the QE2. Hyacinth and Richard were also on board in a cheaper cabin at the time, and, while at first intensely jealous, Hyacinth swallowed her pride and kindly wished Onslow congratulations and danced with him in the ship's ballroom. Also, despite Hyacinth's usual mistreatment of him, Onslow is willing to help Hyacinth when she needs help (though often she would rather it was someone else than him) and even rescued her three-piece suite in the episode of the same name when the van carrying it crashed. He also admitted in \"Riverside Picnic\" that he admired Hyacinth's stiff upper lip when things went wrong. \n\nHyacinth detests Onslow; however, he has no mean spirit and gets on well with almost everyone else, including his own vicar, Hyacinth's vicar, Emmett, Elizabeth, Bruce and Violet. He is exasperated by Rose and Daddy on occasion, and thinks Daisy should not take their dramatics so seriously. Onslow is also good friends with Richard, nicknaming him \"Dickie\" much to Hyacinth's outrage (though Richard himself does not mind), and often tries to persuade him not to let Hyacinth browbeat him all the time. \n\nOnslow is - when he can overcome his inherent sloth - a very loving and kindly character, despite his appearance suggesting otherwise. He is Roy Clarke's favourite character in the show, as stated in the Comedy Connections series.\n\nStephanie (played by Laura Shavin) is Daisy and Onslow's daughter and Hyacinth's niece. Her daughter, Daisy's and Onslow's granddaughter, is named Kylie and is christened in the episode \"The Christening\". Great-Aunt Hyacinth does not approve of the name Kylie, saying it sounds like a foreign vegetable. She also disapproves of the fact that Stephanie had her baby out of wedlock, as do others, though she is the only one to make a point of her disapproval. However, when Stephanie and Kylie don't show up to the christening, Hyacinth and Richard volunteer to search for them and find that Stephanie's caravan is broken down. They also are horrified to discover that she has become a hippie and lives in the caravan with two men, and has no idea which of the two men is Kylie's father. Even the men themselves don't know, and after delivering the trio to the church for the christening, Hyacinth insists she and Richard hide behind a column in the church because she is so ashamed. \n\nStephanie and Kylie are not seen again in the show, although in \"Problems with Relatives\", while pushing Daddy in a wheelchair, Daisy says it reminds her of when she and Onslow used to push baby Stephanie in the pram. It also reminds them of why they had to bring the wedding forward, implying Daisy became pregnant out of wedlock as well.\n\nHyacinth's youngest, lustful sister, Rose has an eye for men and a taste for short skirts and flashy, provocative outfits. In the episode \"Early Retirement\", she reveals she was once married, though it is not stated whether she is widowed or divorced. Her surname is also never given, though her maiden name is Walton like all the other sisters. She was played by Shirley Stelfox in series one and Mary Millar (whose performance was more over-the-top than Stelfox's) in every episode after that. She is another family member who threatens Hyacinth's social prestige, especially as the Vicar and Emmett are two of the men she sometimes chases. She even sometimes cosies up to Richard, though Hyacinth always puts a quick stop to that.\n\nRose is promiscuous, unstable, and prone to fits of hysteria and depression, some of which are genuine but most of which are merely attention-seeking tactics. However, Richard describes her as a gentle soul who is just a bit 'mixed up'. She is constantly having affairs with men, but her choice in men is poor and she often finds herself with married or otherwise unsuitable men who abandon her after a brief fling. Onslow has said more than once that her hormones never get a chance to settle, which explains her outrageous behaviour. She has a penchant for stealing Onslow's cigarettes, and for going into long tirades about men and their unfaithfulness. She regularly becomes 'disillusioned' and decides to 'give up men', sometimes several times in a week, but always has a new beau in record time. She is shown to be relatively uneducated, never reads, often speaks childishly, and cannot spell simple words.\n\nHyacinth is particularly ashamed of Rose, and at times goes to great lengths to keep her existence and their relationship a secret. But she does care for her, all the same. In the episode \"Charity Shop\", she stands and listens patiently as Rose confides to her about her dysfunctional love life. Hyacinth cheers her up and then kisses her on the cheek before sending her home. In \"Iron Age Remains\", when Rose has locked herself in a room in one of her depressive fits, Hyacinth panics that Rose may have harmed herself, especially when there is no answer at the door (in fact, Rose just had stereo headphones on and couldn't hear the people outside). She sends Richard up a ladder to investigate, but he falls off. Hyacinth also tries to stop a fight between Rose and one of her lovers in \"A Picnic for Daddy\", thinking he is a reputable member of society, though she changes her mind and tells the man to stop bothering Rose when she realises she had mistaken his identity and that he was indeed another of Rose's bad choices in men.\n\nViolet (played by Anna Dawson) is the third-eldest of the Walton sisters, who married a successful but eccentric turf accountant named Bruce (played by John Evitts). A sign outside their house reads \"The Paddocks\", but it is not revealed if this refers to their surname or is the name of their property. Violet and Bruce were initially unseen characters, apart from the occasional glimpse from a distance, but in the fifth series, both Bruce and Violet became regulars on the show.\n\nBruce and Violet are extremely wealthy. Hyacinth often brags that Violet and Bruce have a large house, Mercedes, sauna, jacuzzi, swimming pool, musical bidet, and room for a pony. They also have a cottage in the countryside, and a villa in Ibiza. However, Violet has a troubled marriage with her eccentric, cross-dressing husband, and repeatedly phones Hyacinth to complain about Bruce's mad behaviour. Bruce often confiscates Violet's clothes in order to wear them himself, leaving her with his clothes. He also has had an affair with his secretary, and has done other unsuitable things such as refusing to come down out of a tree, drinking to excess, wearing strange costumes, throwing childish tantrums over trivial things, and buying lots of nude artwork. In \"The Toy Store\", Richard remarks that Bruce is supposed to be on some sort of medication but it's implied he often does not take it. However, despite everything, Hyacinth insists that Violet put up with Bruce for the luxurious lifestyle his wealth gives her, particularly the Mercedes. \n\nWhile Violet is obviously far more affluent than Hyacinth, she is not the snob Hyacinth is. She is far more accepting of Daisy, Onslow and Rose than Hyacinth, in that she is not embarrassed by them. In \"Riverside Picnic\", when told by Hyacinth to find a friend \"in the same income bracket\" to drive her, Violet calls Onslow and invites her father and sisters to gate-crash Hyacinth's \"waterside supper with riparian entertainments\". \n\nAlthough continually bragging about Violet to her friends, Hyacinth cannot use Violet and Bruce to her full advantage, as she often cannot introduce them to friends and neighbours due to their volatile marriage and Bruce's costumes. On the odd occasion, Hyacinth has invited Violet to her candlelight suppers (which Violet does not enjoy any more than anyone else), and it is implied the main reason Hyacinth invites Violet and Bruce around is because she likes to have their Mercedes in her driveway. \n\nIn the episode \"A Barbecue at Violet's\", when Hyacinth and Richard arrive at Violet's home, they arrive in the middle of a vicious domestic row, in which Violet and Bruce are arguing loudly and hurling objects at each other. By \"Skis\", Violet eventually wants to divorce Bruce, but Hyacinth frog-marches her distraught sister to the vicar to try to change her mind, determined not to lose her one genuine connection to a higher class. Richard is shown to not be fond of Violet, remarking how she is \"always moaning\", nor is he fond of Bruce and his eccentricities.\n\nDaddy (played by George Webb) is the apparently senile, divorced father of Hyacinth, Daisy, Rose and Violet; the prequel \"Young Hyacinth\" reveals his wife ran off with an American. He lives with Onslow, Daisy and Rose. Hyacinth repeatedly makes bizarre excuses as to why he can't live with her (one being that he brings Sheridan out in a rash), and Daisy herself remarks in \"Angel Gabriel Blue\" that to punish Daddy by making him live with Hyacinth would be inhumane. Hyacinth loves her father dearly; however, his antics and constant requirement for attention put her social standing at risk. She tends to make up outlandish stories to explain his behavior to other people. It is often said by Richard that the rundown neighborhood that Daddy lives in is the one he has lived in all his life, therefore revealing that Hyacinth grew up in the grubby, decrepit area she loathes visiting. \n\nWhile mentally senile, Daddy is still quite capable physically, and seems unable to keep himself out of trouble. He is fit enough to climb onto roofs, ride a skateboard, steal cars, dig trenches, ride bicycles, and wander all over the countryside - all of which he has done, usually causing some embarrassment to his family in the process. Rose apparently inherited her promiscuous streak from him, as he is constantly ogling, pursuing, and accosting women, sometimes promising to marry them. He also relives experiences from his younger days, such as his childhood and his service in the war, and in those moments he will assume the character of his younger self in the clothes he wears and the actions he takes. He often goes missing, and requires the rescue efforts of his daughters and sons-in-law. He has a medication which makes him very drowsy (and therefore manageable) when given, but whenever it wears off, he starts causing trouble again. \n\nDaddy's screen appearances are somewhat rare, and his spoken lines even more so. Although his given name is unknown, his surname is revealed to be Walton in \"Young Hyacinth\".\n\nAn unseen character, Sheridan is Hyacinth's and Richard's spoiled and selfish only son, about 18 years of age. He is away at college (a poly which Hyacinth insists is of a \"university standard\" - the first three series were written before the Further and Higher Education Act 1992) and is known to audiences primarily through Hyacinth's telephone conversations with him. \n\nThe major running gag surrounding Sheridan involves him ringing home whenever he needs money, Hyacinth without fail assuming at first that he is \"just ringing his mummy\" - despite his age, she still refers to herself and Richard as \"mummy and daddy\". Most of the time, he needs money for ludicrous things that his friend Tarquin has suggested, up to and including a walking holiday in Iceland. \n\nAlthough Sheridan usually convinces Hyacinth of his need for the money (much to Richard's exasperation), Hyacinth is very occasionally able to say no. Hyacinth claims Sheridan writes to her constantly, and often expects to receive letters from him, but Sheridan rarely gets in touch unless he wants money. Only once in the series did Sheridan do something for his parents; in the episode \"What to Wear When Yachting\", he arranged a weekend for Hyacinth and Richard on a small yacht owned by Tarquin's father.\n\nSheridan prefers not to talk to Richard on the phone, and has been known to pretend to be someone else whenever he calls and Richard answers. The other running gag is that Richard suspects Sheridan is gay, something which is implied through his love of needlework, his lilac-colored car, his desire for pure silk pyjamas, his male friend, Tarquin (with whom Sheridan makes his own curtains), and his stated disinterest in girls. Richard regularly tries to raise the issue with Hyacinth, only for her to remain totally oblivious. \n\nA glimpse of the back of Sheridan's head can be seen in the episode \"Let There Be Light\" while he is in a taxi, and during the opening credits, a photograph of him as a young boy is seen on Hyacinth's writing desk; this is the closest he has ever been seen on the show.\n\nElizabeth Warden (née Hawksworth) is Hyacinth's friendly, tolerant next-door neighbour who lives at number 24 Blossom Avenue. She has a brother, Emmett, who moves in with her in Season 2. She is played by Josephine Tewson. Hyacinth calls her Elizabeth, but everyone else calls her Liz. Hyacinth often invites her round for coffee, and despite frequent encouragement from her brother, Liz is too weak-willed to say no despite living in fear of Hyacinth's invitations. \n\nAware of Hyacinth's house-proud ways, Elizabeth is terrified of spilling, dropping or breaking anything in her neighbour's home, but ironically, Hyacinth's flighty mannerisms and nagging make Liz especially clumsy in her presence, and she indeed ends up spilling, dropping or breaking something nearly every time. \n\nUnlike most, Liz sympathises with Hyacinth, aware of how she is despised by everyone, including Liz's brother Emmet. She is likely Hyacinth's only real friend (although she makes a point of referring to Hyacinth as a \"neighbour\" rather than a friend). This friendship is tested by Hyacinth's tactless and unthinking remarks, which usually involve Elizabeth's dexterity, clothes, car, appearance, and her daughter's intelligence. Liz likes Richard quite dearly, and has deep sympathy for him; the two seem discreetly fond of each other. Liz feels pity for Hyacinth's and Richard's son, Sheridan, as well, believing \"he never really stood a chance\" with Hyacinth for a mother. Liz is also unsure whether to be amused by or disapproving of her brother's frequent attempts to avoid and/or exact revenge on Hyacinth. \n\nLiz's husband Mr Warden is never seen: he is always away due to his work (he is variously mentioned as being in the Far East or in Saudi Arabia). In \"Onslow's Birthday\", it is implied that Liz and her husband were having marriage troubles, which is what prompted him to take the position abroad. They have a daughter, Gail, who is also never seen but mentioned in conversation in a few early episodes. Gail grew up friends with Sheridan, but unlike Sheridan she goes to a proper university and is trying to make something of herself. Hyacinth seems a bit jealous of Gail's success as compared to her son's, and sometimes finds reasons to put her down (such as having a live-in boyfriend) when she is mentioned.\n\nWhile Elizabeth did eventually meet and become friends with Rose, Onslow, and Daisy in \"Problems with Relatives\", Hyacinth did her best to prevent this happening and afterwards would still go to great lengths to prevent her from seeing their shabby house. Both parties have offered lifts for the other when one is stranded on the side of the road, and have met on other occasions as well. Onslow even jokingly kissed Liz under the mistletoe in the episode \"The Father Christmas Suit\", which prompted an inebriated Richard to do the same. \n\nLiz owns a white 1988 Austin Metro, which appeared in most episodes and was also subject to tactless comments from Hyacinth about its age and appearance, even though Hyacinth's own car is older.\n\nEmmet, played by David Griffin, made his first appearance in \"A Strange Man\", and appeared in nearly every subsequent episode. At first, Hyacinth and Richard thought he was Liz's illicit lover, but later found out he was her brother who moved in after he reportedly lost his own house in a messy divorce.\n\nEmmet is a cultured person, unlike most of Hyacinth's acquaintances. He rides horses, enjoys working in the garden, and has a fondness for sherry (occasionally over-imbibing, which Liz chides him for). He is a classically trained pianist, as well as both producer and director for the local amateur operatic society. He is also shown to have a fair singing voice, himself. Richard suggests that Emmett probably makes a good salary for his talents. Hyacinth, who always wanted to be on the stage, frequently sings at Emmet, and drops broad hints that he should include her in his work, but to no avail.\n\nEmmet is, like most artists, very temperamental. He has a tendency to be somewhat melodramatic (though not to the same extent as Rose), and is terrified of leaving the house because of Hyacinth's terrible singing and even worse manners being enough to \"ruin his day.\" He develops a stronger aversion to Hyacinth than just about any other main character does, to the point he burst into tears when told they were going to visit Hyacinth when the latter was out of town in the episode \"Violet's Country Cottage\". He also frequently falls or hurts himself trying to run to escape her.\n\nIn \"Singing for Emmett\", Emmet explosively loses his temper at Hyacinth, only to realize Hyacinth is completely oblivious to it. Therefore, in later episodes, he frequently says nasty things about her practically to her face, because this incident taught him she doesn't listen and won't hear him. Emmett also begins to seek out ways to get back at Hyacinth for the misery she causes himself and Elizabeth. In \"Let There Be Light\", he and the Vicar's wife contrive to leave Hyacinth outside the church hall during the Bring and Buy sale to meet a wealthy guest (who happens to own two disagreeable dogs, but Hyacinth doesn't know this). In \"Hyacinth Is Alarmed\", Emmett makes a point to call Hyacinth and tell her when the house across the street is burgled twice, because he knows Hyacinth will be jealous that the burglars thought there were better pickings at the Barker-Finches than at her own house. Arguably, his most famous revenge against Hyacinth came in \"Please Mind Your Head\", when he discovered Hyacinth was dressed in riding gear to impress the neighbors. He forced her to actually ride a horse to prove she could, taking great delight in her horrible attempts to mount and get the horse started, but showing some remorse when the horse threw her and nearly injured her. \n\nIn the latter years of the programme, Hyacinth can no longer ignore the fact Emmett is desirous to avoid her, but assumes he's shy and possibly has a romantic attraction to her. Upon hearing this, Emmet says, \"I think I want to die!\" Emmett is often pursued by Rose as well, because she believes him handsome. Emmett is initially flattered by Rose's attentions, even showing some attraction to her, but eventually comes to fear her as well because of how eagerly she forces herself on him. \n\nLike Liz, Emmett deeply sympathizes with Richard. He and Emmett become friends early on, and Emmett is one of the few people who can get Richard to do something silly or unbecoming without Hyacinth being too upset, such as going to a pub in \"Hyacinth is Alarmed\". Emmett also is shown in several episodes to be friendly with Onslow, despite Hyacinth's initial attempts to keep them apart. \n\nIn the special features of the complete DVD collection of the series, it is revealed that David Griffin was being treated for cancer during much of the series' run. In later seasons, Emmett is noticeably much thinner and seems to have aged, because of this, though the show explains it as his having gotten prison pallor from hiding indoors from Hyacinth all the time. \n\nMichael (played by Jeremy Gittins) is the young and handsome vicar of St. Mark's Church, which Richard and Hyacinth attend. Like most, he is terrified of Hyacinth, and does his best to avoid her, often unsuccessfully. Moreover, he often forgets that Hyacinth prefers her last name to be pronounced \"bouquet\" and addresses her as \"Mrs Bucket\". When he's discussing Hyacinth with his wife, they refer to her as \"the Bucket woman\". \n\nHe first arrived in the parish in \"The New Vicar\", after being a prison chaplain for an unspecified amount of time (as referenced in \"A Picnic for Daddy\"). He is called \"that dishy vicar\" by Rose, who often pursues him, much to the anger of his jealous wife, who dislikes the fact that the majority of Michael's congregation are women who make a fuss of him. The vicar being caught in compromising positions (which in context are quite innocent) with Rose or other women is a recurring gag in the series, as is the Vicar damaging whatever he's holding/using whenever Hyacinth's name is mentioned. However, despite his dislike, he feels it his duty to be sympathetic to Hyacinth most of the time, trying to rescue her from the Commodore's amorous advances in \"The Commodore\" and agreeing to help her with her kitchen dilemma in \"Angel Gabriel Blue\". He also twice stops to offer Hyacinth and Richard lifts when he spots them stranded on the side of the road, and agrees to try to counsel her sister Violet in the episode \"Skis\", though Violet is unwilling to go through with it. \n\nThe vicar likes Onslow and Daisy and is always glad to see them, and more than once has been to their house to help with various issues (such as a ghost in Daddy's bedroom, or Rose being depressed). However, he has made no secret of the fact he dislikes Hyacinth's father, famously standing up to Hyacinth in the episode \"The Father Christmas Suit\" to demand she take her inebriated and nearly-nude father away from the church Christmas gathering 'as soon as possible'. \n\nOnly once did the vicar try to exact revenge on Hyacinth, in the episode \"Senior Citizen's Outing\". He saddled her with the two most difficult seniors to deal with, telling his wife he'd 'make up for it on Sunday'.\n\nMarried to the vicar, Mrs Partridge (played by Marion Barron) is usually referred to as \"dear\" by her husband. She is a timid yet fiery young woman with a soft Scottish accent. She often finds her husband in compromising positions with Rose, whom she nicknames 'the vampire sister', or other young females and incorrectly assumes the worst. These situations are usually prefaced in an earlier scene where she expresses jealousy over the attention that Michael's female parishioners give him.\n\nThe vicar's wife initially dislikes Hyacinth, but as the series goes on, she grows to see more humour in some of Hyacinth's behaviour than other characters do. She has been seen to stifle fits of laughter at Hyacinth's suggestion of leaving sick parishioners outside while the vicar attends a party of Hyacinth's, and on another occasion merrily bobbed her head in time to Hyacinth's horrendous singing. She also is the only person who seems willing (instead of forced) to go on Hyacinth's little expedition in \"Riverside Picnic\".\n\nMrs. Partridge, like Emmett, has frequently attempted various small revenges against Hyacinth. In \"How to Go On Holiday Without Really Trying\", she deliberately tricked Hyacinth into cleaning the toilets in the church hall all by herself, and in \"Let There Be Light\", she assigned Hyacinth to the booth farthest away from anyone else in the church Bring and Buy sale. Furthermore, in the same episode, she and Emmett contrived to get Hyacinth to stay outside and wait for Mrs. Drummond and her disagreeable dogs, instead of helping set up the sale.\n\nThe other vicar (played by Gerald Sim) had a single appearance in the episode \"The Christening\". He is of an older appearance than Michael the vicar, and his church is located at a different location from Michael's. He is Onslow and Daisy's friend and likes to joke around with them.\n\nMichael the postman was played by Leo Dolan in the first series and by David Janson from 1992 on. He is impertinent, high-strung, and completely overwhelmed by Hyacinth Bucket, of whom he lives in fear. He would rather avoid her, but tries to stand up to her when she pounces on him, which is every time he delivers (and occasionally throws) mail to her house. She constantly makes sure she takes all letters in person, never allowing him to put them in the letterbox itself and sternly rebuking him when he tries to do so. She frequently makes impossible demands of him, such as letting her see Elizabeth's mail, or switching all second class stamps on her letters to first class stamps, or having him track down packages or letters that were never actually sent. He tries many techniques to not speak to Hyacinth, but all fail. In later episodes he develops a bad twitch, and he openly tells Hyacinth it is her fault, but she seems not to notice. He is the father of seven children.\n\nPlayed by Robert Rawles, the unnamed Milkman is in the same position as Michael the Postman, in that he constantly sneaks about doing his level best to avoid speaking to Hyacinth. Like the postman, he always fails, and usually finds himself bombarded with ridiculous requests such as finding out which specific cows the milk comes from and making sure Hyacinth receives the exact same bottles every time. He and the postman consider themselves fellow brothers in affliction, and celebrate whenever Hyacinth is on holiday. However, unlike the postman, the milkman never loses his cool with Hyacinth and is not afraid of her, merely annoyed by her.\n\nMajor Wilton-Smythe (played by Peter Cellier), commonly known simply as \"the major\", only appears in the first two series, and hopelessly lusts after Hyacinth even though he is married to a never-seen wife, whom he refers to as \"the ball and chain\". \n\nHe fought in World War II and is a veteran of the British North African Campaign against Erwin Rommel. The Major lives in a large house called The Laurels, which is just around the corner from Hyacinth and Richard's bungalow. In \"Golfing with the Major\", he reveals he was wounded in the leg somewhere east of Suez, and he still has \"some poxy foreign lead in there somewhere\". He pretends to limp on this injury when he wants to get out of doing something he doesn't like, walking normally whenever people aren't watching.\n\nHe is brash and forceful, and disliked by Richard. In particular, Richard finds it odd that an elderly man like the major prefers whizzing about in a two-seat sports car convertible rather than driving in presumably a more sensible car - the major drives a Morgan Plus 4. \n\nDespite his irritating behaviour, his upper-class status means that Hyacinth refuses to sever contact with the man. At one point she admits \"it's a good thing he's a Major... if he were a Sergeant, he wouldn't get a foot past the door!\"\n\nMrs Nugent (played by Charmian May) is high up the social ladder but low down the charismatic scale, being a dull, bad-tempered and ill-mannered woman. She speaks in an overly loud and militaristic tone and goes on unnecessary tirades about \"excessive romantic behaviour\" and wasting money. Despite her dislike of romance, however, she thinks it would be fun to be a part of the film industry, and dons a skimpy costume when she thinks Richard is filming an amateur movie in \"Richard's New Hobby\".\n\nShe also seems to be the only person who can get away with referring to Hyacinth as \"Mrs Bucket\" without Hyacinth correcting her. In \"The Toy Store\", when Mrs Nugent yells \"Mrs Bucket\", Hyacinth can be seen mouthing out \"It's Bouquet\", meaning she still wants to correct her, but stifles it. \n\nHyacinth tolerates her, not only because of her status, but also because she wants a place on her committee. The committee itself is never identified, nor it is clear if Mrs Nugent or her husband is the Councillor. Hyacinth admits that she doesn't know what the committee does, she just wants a seat on it.\n\nSonia Barker-Finch lives in the same street as Hyacinth, just opposite her own home in Number 23, Villa Costa Blanca. Above all her other acquaintances, Hyacinth is convinced that Mrs Barker-Finch is her greatest social rival; however, Mrs Barker-Finch does not seek to outdo Hyacinth in any way, and generally wants nothing to do with her at all. She is referred to in many episodes, but only makes an (uncredited) appearance in the episode \"Driving Mrs. Fortescue\", appearing on the sidewalk with a friend just in time to see Hyacinth embarrassingly trapped on the back of a moving lorry.\n\nAlthough Hyacinth invites\nMrs Barker-Finch to parties and dinners, Mrs Barker-Finch usually declines. She also had the temerity to talk while Hyacinth was singing, once, firmly making her an enemy of Hyacinth's. Hyacinth hypocritically believes Mrs Barker-Finch to be a snob (\"She was a Barker, he was a Finch, now suddenly they're hyphenated\") and is determined to get one up on her at every opportunity. \n\nShe also believes Mrs Barker-Finch is inferior to her. In \"Hyacinth is Alarmed\", when Hyacinth hears that Mrs Barker-Finch has been burgled twice, rather than sympathise with her, she accuses Mrs Barker-Finch of being \"pretentious\", and opines that only a \"low-class burglar\" would rob Number 23. Hyacinth furthermore becomes unreasonably jealous whenever Mrs Barker-Finch has some form of social success and becomes adamant that she will do better than her. This was best exampled in the episode \"A Celebrity for the Barbecue\", when Mrs. Barker-Finch invited a prominent businessman to her house. Hyacinth went to great lengths to throw a barbecue with a more distinguished celebrity.\n\nIn \"Three Piece Suite\", Hyacinth ordered a three-piece suite that was \"an exact replica of the one at Sandringham House\", and went to extraordinary lengths to ensure Mrs Barker-Finch saw it being delivered by \"The van with the royal warrant on it\", such as repeatedly phoning her so that she would have to come to the window and see the delivery van pull up. An ill-timed phone call from Sheridan to ask for money fouled the plan up, and Richard had to pay the van to drive away and come back. Unfortunately, the van was seen to crash into a verge shortly thereafter, and Daisy and Onslow's hired lorry turned up just as this happened. This resulted in them delivering the three-piece suite to Hyacinth's house instead, which Mrs. Barker-Finch presumably saw (much to Hyacinth's dismay).\n\nDelia Wheelright is another unseen rival of Hyacinth. Her rivalry with Hyacinth forms the central plot for the episode 'How To Go On Holiday Without Really Trying'. At the beginning of the episode, Hyacinth is talking to Delia Wheelright on the phone. We do not hear the other side of the conversation, but it is revealed that the former is going on an expensive holiday to the Caribbean. \n\nAlthough she does not express it on the telephone, Hyacinth is greatly put out by this and sets out to better her. Hyacinth drags Richard into town to visit some travel agencies and inquire about holidays, though not the cheap sort of holiday that 'caters to the spaghetti and chips brigade\". Of course the Buckets cannot afford to pay for any of the expensive holidays, but Hyacinth grabs information regarding trips for the Orient Express and the QE2 (the latter trip being one they actually save up to take in the 1994 Christmas special). On the way home, Hyacinth deliberately drops the brochures out of the car window in front of some friends of Delia Wheelright, in the hope that they will see the brochures and the news gets back to her that Hyacinth is going on an expensive holiday. As usual the plan comes to nothing as the friends in question take no notice.\n\nAnother of Hyacinth's social rivals, Lydia Hawksworth (actress uncredited) earned Hyacinth's ire during one of her candlelight suppers, when she obnoxiously commented that Hyacinth's kiwi fruit were \"lower middle-class\", and further rubbed Hyacinth up the wrong way by boasting about her recent holiday in Corfu. By this behaviour, it can be assumed that she too is as snobbish as Hyacinth. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that she may be either Emmet's ex-wife or some other relation of Elizabeth and Emmet.\n\nIn the episode, \"The Rolls Royce\", Hyacinth was outraged at losing to Lydia in a flower arranging contest, and even further dismayed that Lydia had acquired a flashy new Jaguar. She then began a scheme to show her up, by visiting an exclusive garage and convincing the owner to let her \"test drive\" a Rolls Royce. \n\nHowever, Hyacinth badgered Richard into driving the Rolls out to the country club where Mrs Hawksworth often went, and the vehicle was reported as stolen. Hyacinth was apprehended by police officers as soon as Mrs Hawksworth arrived, much to the latter's glee.\n\nMrs Fortescue (played by Jean Anderson) is the irascible, bossy and inconsiderate widow of a wealthy businessman who is a parishioner at the Buckets' church. Her sister is married to a baronet, which leads Hyacinth to perform favours for her even if they are inconvenient to her and Richard, with hopes of socializing with members of the nobility. She appeared in \"Driving Mrs. Fortescue\".\n\nMrs Fortescue asks for a lift into town - as she has had her own driving license revoked for speeding - and Hyacinth goes to enormous lengths to impress her, even forcing Richard to rehearse how he is going to ring her doorbell. Richard is not fond of Mrs Fortescue because she hits him with her walking stick. Much to Hyacinth's dismay, Mrs Fortescue accidentally meets Rose, Daisy and Onslow, and gets on extremely well with them.\n\nMiss Pillsworth and Miss Pillsworth (played by Lois Penson and Clare Kelly) are two elderly spinster sisters that appear in the series 5 episode 'Skis'. They are from a rather posh and \"very old\" family, their late father having been a Colonel. Hyacinth and Richard drive through town, and on the way they pass the two Miss Pillsworths and, despite the lack of space in the car and the fact that both dislike Hyacinth and are reluctant to travel with her, manage to persuade the two women to take a lift. However, Hyacinth insists they detour through the beautiful neighborhood Violet lives in before letting them out of the car, prompting the elder Miss Pillsworth to fear they've been kidnapped. Later on in the same episode, the sisters run away when they see Hyacinth coming, afraid she'll insist on giving them another lift.\n\nMr Reginald 'Reggie' Thorgunby (played by Mark Brackenbury) was Richard's superior in the Department of Finance and General Purposes. In \"The Father Christmas Suit\", it was Hyacinth's intention to have Mr Thorgunby and his wife Fiona (played by Annette Peters) around for mulled wine and hot mince pies so that they could discuss the conditions of Richard's early retirement. Unfortunately for her, a series of mishaps involving a drunken Richard, a disguised Elizabeth, and a semi-naked Daddy caused the Thorgunbys to give up on the idea of a Christmas visit and drive back home.\n\nEarlier on in the episode, Hyacinth phoned the Thorgunby's house. She was surprised to have a timid childish voice answer at the other end. Believing it to be a child, Hyacinth told the person to \"run along, poppet, and tell your Mummy Mrs Thorgunby that there is a nice lady wanting to speak with her\". However, it turned out that Hyacinth was speaking to Mrs Thorgunby.\n\nMr. Millburn (Played by Frederick Jaeger) is the owner of Frosticles Frozen Food factory, and a neighbour of Hyacinth and Richard. His unseen wife is a member of the Ladies' Luncheon Committee along with Hyacinth, and Hyacinth dislikes her, calling her a \"thrusting creature.\" Hyacinth and Richard tend to refer to the Millburns as Mr. and Mrs. Frosticles instead of their actual names. Their acquaintance is only slight, as Richard forgot who they were for a time, and Millburn had no recollection at all of who Hyacinth and Richard were. He was shown as a not-very-bright man, who valued stupidity as a quality and who enjoyed golfing.\n\nIn \"A Job for Richard\", Millburn announced an open senior executive position at his factory. Hyacinth schemed with Onslow to get Richard the job, roping a reluctant Richard into it. The scheme involved Onslow pretending to be a hoodlum and Richard pretending to subdue him, to impress Millburn. The arrival of two real hoodlums (which Hyacinth had to chase off herself) messed up the plan, and Millburn offered the job to Hyacinth instead, though she refused.\n\nThe Cooper-Bassets (Mr. Cooper-Basset was played by Derek Waring, Mrs. Cooper-Basset was uncredited) were a wealthy married couple, who liked amusement parks, having met on a ghost train. They appeared in \"Senior Citizen's Outing.\" Hyacinth, Richard, and Elizabeth ran into them while escorting some senior citizens on an outing to the seaside. Hyacinth initially wanted to meet up with them, but they went out of their way to avoid her. However, the tables were turned when the Cooper-Bassets showed up a second time while Hyacinth was dealing with an embarrassing situation with one of the senior citizens, and she tried to avoid them, but without success.\n\nAppearing only in \"Senior Citizen's Outing\", Signor Farrini (played by Angus Lennie) and Mrs. Lomax (played by Rita Davies) were the two senior citizens Hyacinth was to escort to the outing at the beach. The vicar, knowing full well they were the two most difficult to manage of the group, deliberately saddled Hyacinth with them and told his wife that he knew it was wicked and that he would 'make up for it on Sunday'.\n\nSignor Farrini was a senile, elderly Italian gentleman, who was almost instantly enamored with Hyacinth. He did everything in his power to follow her around and express his love, even going so far as to handcuff himself and Hyacinth together when she wasn't looking. Mrs. Lomax was an even older lady, who suffered from severe motion sickness, to the point she would even begin to feel sick in anticipation of getting in the car and would require stops every few miles to prevent her from vomiting. She also had a gluttonous appetite for sweets and ice cream.\n\nMrs. Drummond (played by Sue Lloyd) appeared in \"Let There Be Light\" and was a wealthy and very inconsiderate parishioner of Michael the vicar, and another person Hyacinth tried to impress. Her family lived on an estate called \"The Grange\", and Hyacinth always introduced them as \"The Drummonds. From the Grange, you know.\" She had two ill-behaved Labrador retrievers who despised Hyacinth, but Hyacinth pretended not to notice, since Mrs. Drummond had said she had no time for anyone who disliked dogs. Mrs. Drummond would watch while other people worked, and was very much so a snob.\n\nBunty and Dorian (played by Marcia Warren and Royce Mills) were two extremely eccentric neighbors of Bruce and Violet, who appeared in \"Violet's Country Cottage\". They lived in a manor house next door to the aforementioned cottage, but whether they actually were aristocracy or not was not mentioned. They tended to dress in shabby yokel-like clothing and behaved very oddly, as befits friends of the equally eccentric Bruce, whom Bunty referred to as \"The Weirdo\". Bunty enjoyed drinking, hunting and shooting. She first met Hyacinth while looking for her lost dog (Hyacinth and Richard were staying in the cottage at the time). Richard met up with her husband Dorian while helping to look for the missing dog at Hyacinth's behest, and brought Dorian back to the cottage with him. Bunty quickly became drunk and Dorian started to pursue Hyacinth amorously, which amused Bunty to no end. For once, Hyacinth did not act snobbish but went with the flow, and the three of them danced a conga line at the end of the episode.\n\nZoe Zbygn made an uncredited appearance in the episode \"Violet's Country Cottage\". She was an elderly lady from Poland who spoke no English. While all the other characters could spell her surname, no one could figure out how to pronounce it. Daisy finally settled on \"Mrs. Thing\", which the other characters (even Hyacinth) also called her. She was Daddy's girlfriend for a time, and accompanied Daddy, Daisy, Onslow, and Rose to the cottage to visit Hyacinth. She seemed a mostly deadpan individual until she heard Richard calling her name, which made her excitedly leave Daddy's side and act amorously toward Richard. In actuality, Richard was calling Bunty's lost dog, who was also named Zoe.\n\nThe Commodore (played by Nigel Davenport) appeared in the episode \"The Commodore\" and was an old seafaring man who became famous sailing round Cape Horn singlehandedly. He retired from the sea and made a living going around as a guest speaker at events. Hyacinth went to great lengths to meet and impress him, and volunteered the Vicar to give him a ride back to the train station after the Commodore had given a speech. The Commodore had a notorious reputation with the ladies, including a scandalous divorce. Hyacinth ignored warnings about him, enamored with the prospect of meeting a Commodore, until he tried to seduce her in the back seat of the Vicar's car. The Vicar tried to rescue the terrified Hyacinth by offering to let her out of the car, but because stopping would mean the Commodore would miss his train (and be stuck with her!) Hyacinth told him to keep driving.\n\nNever named, and played by Bruce Montague, His Lordship was a suave and wealthy peer who lived on a large estate some miles out in the country from Hyacinth's house. He was said to be the son of the deceased Dowager Lady Ursula. He was one of the kindliest, most considerate characters in the series.\n\nIn \"Country House Sale\", Hyacinth first met His Lordship in the large drive of his mansion, at the estate sale of his late mother. Hyacinth, unaware to whom she was speaking, asked him for directions, which he happily gave her. Later, she overheard a servant address him as 'Milord' and realized who she was talking to. After the estate sale had concluded, Hyacinth, who had bought several bottles of homemade wine in the sale, sought out his Lordship, and the two seemed to get along well together. They shared a toast to the late Dowager Lady Ursula, but the wine was too strong for Hyacinth, who promptly became hopelessly drunk. However, His Lordship was very nice about the whole business, blaming the wine and not Hyacinth and helping Richard get his confused wife safely back to the car.\n\nIn the episode \"Looking at Properties\", Hyacinth and Richard briefly leased a second home in the form of a flat in the roof of a large manor house, and were neighbours to Sir Edward (played by John Arnatt). He lived on the ground floor, and spent most of his time snoozing in a wheelchair with his gouty foot propped up. He took an instant dislike to Hyacinth when the first thing she did was inadvertently bump into his gouty foot, and barely spoke to her after that incident.\n\nSeen only in \"Country Estate Sale\", Mrs. Braddock (played by Jessica James) is a senile older woman who attends Senior Lunches with Daddy and who stalks his house and insists he proposed to her, though Daddy remembers only offering her a \"temporary arrangement\". Rose and Daisy imply she's stalked their house before, but only one instance is shown, in which she shoos Onslow's dog away from the old car she naps in, and takes her place, waiting outside to nab Daddy. She causes Onslow to fall into the hedge (parodying a recurring gag of Hyacinth doing the same whenever the dog barks) by jumping out and yelling \"Oi!\" at him. She also scares Hyacinth into the hedge when she arrives later in the episode.\n\nMr. Mawsby (played by Preston Lockwood) appeared in \"Angel Gabriel Blue\". Daddy went off on one of his adventures and rented the room to the equally elderly Mr. Mawsby, giving him a receipt. Mr. Mawsby stayed in the room for a time, and Rose and Daisy mistook Mr. Mawsby for Daddy and brought him meals. When Rose found out he wasn't Daddy, Mr. Mawsby locked himself in the room and refused to leave. Eventually, after the entire family tried various tactics to get him out, Hyacinth sent Richard up a ladder to try to contact him through the window. However, Daddy came back and Mr. Mawsby left of his own volition, referring to his rented accommodation as a 'Madhouse'.\n\nThroughout the series, Rose had a long succession of boyfriends, sometimes seeing more than one at the same time. It was a running gag that Rose had a new one almost every episode. Most were unseen, but a few made appearances, usually embarrassing Hyacinth in some way in the process. \n\nAppeared in \"The Christening\", played by Bruce Bennett and Jonathan Fryer. Rose spent the first half of the episode on the phone alternately with the two men, playing them off each other and trying to make one of them jealous enough of the other to escort her to her grand-niece's christening. Unfortunately, this backfired as both men arrived at the church at the same time and began squabbling over Rose in front of all the guests. \n\nCharlie (played by John Darrell) was a local police inspector who appeared in the episode \"Senior Citizen's Outing\". It was implied he'd had a brief fling with Rose in the past; however, when he met her again, he was less than thrilled to renew the acquaintance, given she called him out in front of his peers at the police station.\n\nMr. Sudbury (played by Tony Kemp) was a tall, elegant man that Rose fell for because of his dancing skills. He appeared briefly in \"The Father Christmas Suit\", literally dancing down the street with her. \n\nBoris and Mr. Heliwell, (played by Dicken Ashworth and Gregory Cox), were both mentioned in several episodes as on-again-off-again flames of Rose's, but only appeared in \"The Candlelight Supper\". They were two very large and loud men who embarrassingly fought over Rose's affections on Hyacinth's front doorstep, only getting louder when Rose told them to go away because she had fallen for Emmett. The disturbance prompted Hyacinth - who had Elizabeth and Emmett over for dinner - to sing as loud as she could to drown the fighting out. The horrible, off-key racket actually stopped the fight and made both men flee, which was not Hyacinth's intent but it did save the situation.\n\nRoger (played by Jon Glover), a kindly younger man with a large Newfoundland dog, appeared in \"Early Retirement\". He disrupted Hyacinth's tea party plans when he went to the wrong house to pick Rose up, having mistaken Hyacinth for Rose's mother. His dog then refused to leave Hyacinth's drive, and Roger ended up leaving her there while he went in search of something to entice her away. The big dog then terrorized the pet Yorkshire Terrier of Hyacinth's honored guest. \n\nMr. Merryweather (played by Trevor Bannister), appeared in \"Angel Gabriel Blue\" and was a long-suffering, obsequious salesman in a store that sold kitchen fittings and remodeling services. Hyacinth, unaware he was involved with Rose, persuaded him to get her an out-of-stock worktop in the color Angel Gabriel Blue, so her house would be the only one in the neighborhood with the 'exclusive' color. However, the scheme backfired when Onslow found a new worktop being given away and Mr. Merryweather identified it as Angel Gabriel Blue as well, thus meaning Daisy and Onslow's house now had the \"exclusive\" color.\n\nBannister's appearance on the show was a cameo, as he had previously played Mr. Lucas - almost exactly the same character, in terms of personality and occupation, as Mr. Merryweather - on the popular BBC comedy Are You Being Served?.\n\nIn \"Onslow's Birthday\" Rose infamously became involved with a wealthy Greek gentleman by the name of Mr. Marinopoulous (played by Ivan Santon), who also happened to have a limousine. Rose offered Hyacinth and Richard a ride in the limousine, to Onslow's birthday party. Hyacinth, thrilled that Rose was moving up in the world, invited people over for cocktails and bought Onslow a pair of expensive cufflinks, to impress the wealthy Greek when he arrived. However, Mr. Marinopoulos was, in fact, a well-to-do undertaker, and when the limousine broke down, he came to pick Hyacinth and Richard up in his hearse instead, in front of a crowd of guests invited to see the limousine.\n\nIn \"A Celebrity for the Barbecue\", C.P. Benedict (played by Paul Williamson) was an acquaintance of Richard's who passed the time of day during strolls, as well as a former fling of Rose's who had parted with her on amicable terms. Furthermore, Hyacinth knew of C.P. from watching him on television, advertising his lucrative garden center, and referred to him as \"The Garden Center King\". However, none of the three were aware that either of the others knew him, until Richard happened to casually mention him in conversation with Hyacinth. Hyacinth, thinking him a celebrity, invited him to a barbecue in hopes of impressing the neighbors. She even had Richard deck the house out in live plants until it resembled a jungle, and wore one of her best dresses, only to have Rose and Daisy accidentally crash the party. C.P. gleefully reunited with Rose, much to Hyacinth's dismay.\n\nAppeared in \"The Art Exhibition\". The occupation of Mr. Finchley (played by Nicholas Bennett) is unknown, but he happened to own a van with loudspeakers in the roof and a microphone in the cab. He also happened to be one of Rose's most amorous pursuers. When Daddy went missing one day, Rose borrowed Mr. Finchley's vehicle to go look for him, though he ended up having to drive her. Unfortunately Mr. Finchley turned on the loudspeakers by accident, and as the two of them rode through town, everyone could hear his and Rose's rather scandalous conversation blaring at full blast, much to Hyacinth's horror.\n\nSeen only as a silhouette in the back seat of a car, Mr. Whatsit appeared/was mentioned in two episodes, \"The Fancy Dress Ball\" and \"Hyacinth is Alarmed\". His real name was unknown, but Rose stated that it was a Polish surname with \"too many zeds\" in it, hence her calling him either \"Cuddly Chops\" or \"Mr. Whatsit\". He was the most serious of Rose's lovers, actually proposing to her, but Hyacinth was afraid she'd have to call Rose \"Mrs. Whatsit\" or \"Mrs. Cuddly Chops\" if the marriage came to pass. However, when he went back to Poland, he fell for a Polish woman and broke the engagement off. Rose was more philosophical about this breakup than most, musing \"Well, I couldn't pronounce him anyway\".\n\nOnslow's dog doesn't have a name, simply referred to as \"Girl\" or \"Dog\". In some episodes she appears as an Old English Sheepdog mix of some sort, but for the most part she appears as an Irish Wolfhound mix. She is most often found in the Hillman Avenger that has been left to rust in the front yard of Onslow's home, though she sometimes snuggles on Onslow's lap, hanging off it as she's too big to fit. Generally placid and friendly to visitors, the dog barks aggressively at only two characters: Hyacinth and Mrs Councillor Nugent, the two most disagreeable characters on the show. Onslow clearly is very fond of his dog - he feeds her scraps, takes her for car rides, and in \"Country Estate Sale\", when one of Daddy's fiancées shoos the dog out and stays in the old car herself, Onslow is visibly distraught and goes down the street looking for her. Richard also seems to be fond of the dog; however, he becomes unhappy with her when, in \"A Picnic for Daddy\", she takes a liking to Richard's suit and snuggles with him, pinning him to the couch against his wishes.\n\nIn what is arguably the series' most memorable running gag, the dog startles Hyacinth into falling into the nearby hedge by barking at her from the car whenever she walks down the path to the house. Sometimes the dog startles her in other places by barking, as well, such as from a window or from the church hall car park. This habit of the dog's was also responsible for Richard's leg injury in \"Iron Age Remains\"; she barked at Hyacinth, who in turn jumped backwards and hit the ladder Richard was standing on, knocking him off it. In \"The Charity Shop\", the dog made Mrs. Councillor Nugent fall into the hedge as well. In \"Country Estate Sale\", Hyacinth, emboldened by gooseberry wine, sneaked up on the car and barked into it to startle the dog and teach her a lesson. This backfired, however, since Daddy's fiancee was in the car instead of the dog and barked back at Hyacinth, again startling her into the hedge.\n\nHardly ever seen and only referenced on the phone or on the gates of Violet's house, the pony is part of a main running gag, which features Hyacinth introducing Violet on the telephone (shouting to Liz, her next-door neighbour, from the corridor) by exclaiming: \"The one with the swimming pool, the new Mercedes and room for a pony... But not in the car!\" Or replacing the Mercedes part with \"...Sauna...\" or \"...Musical bidet...\" and referencing the joke that there isn't room for it in the Sauna or the Musical bidet. \n\nIn \"Problems with Relatives\", When Hyacinth and Richard plan on taking Daddy to Violet and Bruce's house, the pony makes a brief cameo in the background. The stables is also seen briefly in this episode.\n\nOnly appearing in \"Early Retirement\", Olive was a massive black Newfoundland that belonged to one of Rose's beaus. She was incredibly stubborn and disobedient, and caused mayhem when she sat on Hyacinth's driveway and flatly refused to get up, just as Hyacinth was expecting a prominent guest to arrive. Neither her owner nor Hyacinth could get her to move by command, so Elizabeth and Hyacinth tried pulling and pushing her instead while her owner walked off. Unfortunately, the guest (and her Yorkshire Terrier) arrived at Hyacinth's house at that moment. Olive, who liked to play with smaller dogs according to her owner, chased after the Yorkie, dragging Hyacinth down the street behind her.\n\nZoe is never seen but her actions drive much of the plot of \"Violet's Country Cottage\". She is reportedly a liver-and-white English Springer Spaniel belonging to Bunty and Dorian. It is revealed Bunty was training her to be a gun dog. However, Zoe is very scared of loud noises and ran away when Bunty fired the gun, and hasn't been seen since. Bunty first meets Hyacinth and Richard while trying to find Zoe, and in order to ingratiate herself with the wealthy eccentric lady, Hyacinth sends Richard to look for the dog. Richard spends much of the episode looking for Zoe, and in doing so meets Dorian, Bunty's husband, who saves him from getting stuck in a patch of nettles. Later, while still looking for Zoe and calling her name, Richard is amorously pursued by one of Daddy's girlfriends, whose first name also happens to be Zoe.\n\nOnly seen in \"A Picnic for Daddy\", the vicar and his wife own a fat, black and white Cocker spaniel mix whose name is never given. She, like most dogs, despised Hyacinth. When Vicar gave Hyacinth a lift, with the dog riding in the boot of the car, the dog barked at her furiously and proceeded to eat all the artificial fruit off of her fancy hat. \n\nAlso unnamed, appearing in \"Let There Be Light\". They belonged to a wealthy parishioner of Michael the vicar and were two Labradors, atypically vicious for the breed, who lunged at and tried to attack Hyacinth. She was eventually able to calm them and try to take them for a walk, but an ill-timed electrical explosion in the church hall spooked them into running away from her.\n\n\n"}

An autonomous area is defined as an area of a country that has a degree of autonomy, or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical for it to be geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a national minority. Countries that include autonomous areas are often federacies. The autonomous areas differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in the same country, enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see Federated state).\n\nThis list includes areas that are internationally recognized, as well as some that are generally unrecognized. The definition of an \"autonomous area\" varies from country to country, so the native term as defined by the respective country's government is listed, and the English translation of the term is included.\n\nNotes:\n\nIn a number of countries, all territories or regions of a particular type are called \"autonomous\". Depending on the case, this may or may not reflect a special devolution of powers or freedom from external authority.\n\nA number of entities are also officially called \"autonomous\", though they do not have an exceptional freedom from external authority, and would not fall under the definition of autonomous area.

{"id": "343178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343178", "title": "M27 motorway", "text": "M27 motorway\n\nThe M27 is a motorway in Hampshire, England. It is long and runs west-east from Cadnam to Portsmouth. It was opened in stages between 1975 and 1983. It is unfinished, as an extension to the east was planned. A number of smaller motorways were proposed, connecting the city centres of Southampton and Portsmouth to the motorway; of these only the M271 and M275 were built. Three sections of the M27 have since been widened to four lanes each way, the first between Junctions 7 and 8, the second between Junctions 3 and 4, and the third begins at the slip road where Junction 11 joins until mid-way to junction 12.\n\nRunning approximately parallel both to the coast of the Solent and to the A27, the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the A31 from Bournemouth and Poole, meets the A36 from Salisbury, crosses the Wessex Main Line railway, and then meets the M271 to central Southampton. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes Rownhams services, it then meets the M3, (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing to the other side of the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes Southampton Airport, meeting Junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after Junction 8, it then runs alongside the West Coastway Line as it heads south-east towards Fareham. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth climbing lane in either direction, before its junction with the M275 to Portsmouth. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the A3 (M) Motorway. The official reason for this section of road not being a continuation of the motorway is the hard shoulders being too narrow. Although the M275 which the M27 junctions with, has no official hard shoulders throughout its entire length.\n\nThe M27 was opened in stages (in common with many UK motorways) between 1975 and 1983.\n\n\nThe South Stoneham Crematorium, which was located north of South Stoneham Cemetery, was demolished during 1973 to make way for the construction of the M27 motorway. The South Stoneham garden of remembrance is now located at the north end of the cemetery, adjacent to the motorway.\n\nIt has been said that the M27 was intended as a motorway connecting south coast towns from Penzance to Ramsgate. However the only proposal of a route similar to that was by the Institution of Highway Engineers in 1936.\nRoad developments in the New Forest are also restricted due to its national park status.\n\nThe M27 was meant to be extended to Chichester; a sign of this is the width of the A27 road between Junction 12 and the junction with the A3(M), which has 3-or-4 lanes, a hard shoulder and grade-separated junctions. It is not part of the M27 as its hard shoulders are not quite wide enough to comply with motorway regulations.\n\nThe M272 was meant to go from Junction 5 through Portswood to the centre of Southampton. The M272 was instead built (in much-reduced form) as the A335 Thomas Lewis Way.\n\nJunction 6 was never built – there were plans for a motorway spur (probably to be numbered M273) connecting the M27 to the centre of the Townhill Park area of Southampton.\n\nA planned service area just east of Junction 9 was never constructed. The long westbound exit slip road at Junction 9 was designed to allow an entry to and exit from the service area.\n\nIn November 2015, an elderly woman, Marion Munns, died after jumping from the A3057 bridge that crosses over the M27, into westbound traffic, just before Junction 3. She had become distressed due to mental illness, and escaped from her Southampton home through an upstairs window before climbing off the garage roof and running away.\n\nData from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information. Where a junction spans several hundred metres (yards) and start and end points are available, both are cited.\n\n!scope=col|miles\n!scope=col|km\n!scope=col abbr=\"Westbound\"|Westbound exits (B carriageway)\n!scope=col|Junction\n!scope=col abbr=\"Eastbound\"|Eastbound exits (A carriageway)\n!scope=col|Coordinates\n\nJunction 1 is about ( by road) from The Rufus Stone, where King William II, also known as William Rufus, was killed in what may have been a hunting accident in 1100.\n\n\n"}

Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers, the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners.\n\nHeinrich Himmler's \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) took full control of the police and the concentration camps throughout Germany in 1934–35. Himmler expanded the role of the camps to hold so-called \"racially undesirable elements\", such as Jews, Romanis, Serbs, Poles, disabled people, and criminals. The number of people in the camps, which had fallen to 7,500, grew again to 21,000 by the start of World War II and peaked at 715,000 in January 1945.\n\nThe concentration camps were administered since 1934 by the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (CCI) which in 1942 was merged into \"SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt\" and they were guarded by \"SS-Totenkopfverbände\" (SS-TV).\n\nHolocaust scholars draw a distinction between \"concentration\" camps (described in this article) and extermination camps, which were established by Nazi Germany for the industrial-scale mass murder of Jews in the ghettos by way of gas chambers.\n\nUse of the word \"concentration\" came from the idea of confining people in one place because they belong to a group that is considered undesirable in some way. The term itself originated in 1897 when the \"reconcentration camps\" were set up in Cuba by General Valeriano Weyler. In the past, the U.S. government had used concentration camps against Native Americans and the British had also used them during the Second Boer War. Between 1904 and 1908, the \"Schutztruppe\" of the Imperial German Army operated concentration camps in German South-West Africa (now Namibia) as part of its genocide of the Herero and Namaqua peoples. The Shark Island Concentration Camp in Lüderitz was the largest camp and the one with the harshest conditions.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in Germany, they quickly moved to suppress all real and potential opposition. The general public was intimidated by the arbitrary psychological terror that was used by the special courts (\"Sondergerichte\"). Especially during the first years of their existence when these courts \"had a strong deterrent effect\" against any form of political protest.\n\nThe first camp in Germany, Dachau, was founded in March 1933. The press announcement said that \"the first concentration camp is to be opened in Dachau with an accommodation for 5,000 people. All Communists and – where necessary – Reichsbanner and Social Democratic functionaries who endanger state security are to be concentrated there, as in the long run it is not possible to keep individual functionaries in the state prisons without overburdening these prisons.\" Dachau was the first regular concentration camp established by the German coalition government of National Socialist Workers' Party (Nazi Party) and the Nationalist People's Party (dissolved on 6 July 1933). Heinrich Himmler, then Chief of Police of Munich, officially described the camp as \"the first concentration camp for political prisoners.\"\nOn 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke commandant of Dachau, who in 1934 was also appointed the first Inspector of Concentration Camps (CCI). In addition, the remaining SA-run camps were taken over by the SS. Dachau served as both a prototype and a model for the other Nazi concentration camps. Almost every community in Germany had members who were taken there. The newspapers continuously reported on \"the removal of the enemies of the Reich to concentration camps\" making the general population more aware of their presence. There were jingles warning as early as 1935: \"Dear God, make me dumb, that I may not come to Dachau.\"\n\nBetween 1933 and the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, more than 3.5 million Germans were forced to spend time in concentration camps and prisons for political reasons, and approximately 77,000 Germans were executed for one or another form of resistance by Special Courts, courts-martial, and the civil justice system. Many of these Germans had served in government, the military, or in civil positions, which enabled them to engage in subversion and conspiracy against the Nazis.\n\nAs a result of the Holocaust, the term \"concentration camp\" carries many of the connotations of \"extermination camp\" and is sometimes used synonymously. Because of these ominous connotations, the term \"concentration camp\", originally itself a euphemism, has been replaced by newer terms such as internment camp, resettlement camp, detention facility, etc., regardless of the actual circumstances of the camp, which can vary a great deal.\n\nAfter September 1939, with the beginning of the Second World War, concentration camps became places where millions of ordinary people were enslaved as part of the war effort, often starved, tortured and killed. During the war, new Nazi concentration camps for \"undesirables\" spread throughout the continent. According to statistics by the German Ministry of Justice, about 1,200 camps and subcamps were run in countries occupied by Nazi Germany, while the Jewish Virtual Library estimates that the number of Nazi camps was closer to 15,000 in all of occupied Europe and that many of these camps were run for a limited amount of time before they were closed. Camps were being created near the centers of dense populations, often focusing on areas with large communities of Jews, Polish intelligentsia, Communists or Romani. Since millions of Jews lived in pre-war Poland, most camps were located in the area of the General Government in occupied Poland, for logistical reasons. The location also allowed the Nazis to quickly remove the German Jews from within Germany proper.\n\nBy 1940, the CCI came under the control of the \"Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt\" (VuWHA; Administration and Business office) which was set up under Oswald Pohl. Then in 1942, the CCI became \"Amt D\" (Office D) of the consolidated main office known as the \"SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt\" (SS Economic and Administrative Department; WVHA) under Pohl. In 1942, the SS built a network of extermination camps to systematically kill millions of prisoners by gassing. The extermination camps (\"Vernichtungslager\") and death camps (\"Todeslager\") were camps whose primary function was genocide. The Nazis themselves distinguished the concentration camps from the extermination camps. The British intelligence service had information about the concentration camps, and in 1942 Jan Karski delivered a thorough eyewitness account to the government.\n\nThe two largest groups of prisoners in the camps, both numbering in the millions, were the Polish Jews and the Soviet prisoners of war (POWs) held without trial or judicial process. There were also large numbers of Romani people, ethnic Poles, Serbs, political prisoners, homosexuals, people with disabilities, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholic clergy, Eastern European intellectuals and others (including common criminals, as the Nazis declared). In addition, a small number of Western Allied aviators were sent to concentration camps as punishment for spying. Western Allied POWs who were Jews, or who were suspected of being Jews by the Nazis, were usually sent to ordinary POW camps; however, a small number of them were sent to concentration camps because of antisemitic policies.\nSometimes the concentration camps were used to hold important prisoners, such as the generals involved in the attempted assassination of Hitler; U-boat Captain-turned-Lutheran pastor Martin Niemöller; and Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, who was interned at Flossenbürg on February 7, 1945, until he was hanged on April 9, shortly before the war's end.\n\nIn most camps, prisoners were forced to wear identifying overalls with colored badges according to their categorization: red triangles for Communists and other political prisoners, green triangles for common criminals, pink triangles for homosexual men, purple triangles for Jehovah's Witnesses, black triangles for asocials and the \"work shy\", yellow triangle for Jews, and later the brown triangle for Romanis.\n\nMany of the prisoners died in the concentration camps due to deliberate maltreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or they were executed as unfit for labor. Prisoners were transported in inhumane conditions by rail freight cars, in which many died before reaching their final destination. The prisoners were confined in the boxcars for days or even weeks, with little or no food or water. Many died of dehydration in the intense heat of summer or froze to death in winter. Concentration camps also existed in Germany itself, and while they were not specifically designed for systematic extermination, many of their inmates perished because of harsh conditions or they were executed.\nIn the spring of 1941, the SS—along with doctors and officials of the T-4 Euthanasia Program—introduced the Action 14f13 programme meant for extermination of selected concentration camp prisoners. The Inspectorate of the Concentration Camps categorized all files dealing with the death of prisoners as 14f, and those of prisoners sent to the T-4 gas chambers as 14f13. Under the language regulations of the SS, selected prisoners were designated for \"special treatment () 14f13\". Prisoners were officially selected based on their medical condition; namely, those permanently unfit for labor due to illness. Unofficially, racial and eugenic criteria were used: Jews, the handicapped, and those with criminal or antisocial records were selected. For Jewish prisoners there was not even the pretense of a medical examination: the arrest record was listed as a physician's \"diagnosis\". In early 1943, as the need for labor increased and the gas chambers at Auschwitz became operational, Heinrich Himmler ordered the end of Action 14f13.\n\nAfter 1942, many small subcamps were set up near factories to provide forced labor. IG Farben established a synthetic rubber plant in 1942 at Monowitz concentration camp (Auschwitz III); other camps were set up next to airplane factories, coal mines and rocket propellant plants. Conditions were brutal and prisoners were often sent to the gas chambers or killed on site if they did not work quickly enough.\n\nOn 31 July 1941 Hermann Göring gave written authorization to SS-\"Obergruppenführer\" Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations. The resulting \"Generalplan Ost\" (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.\nTowards the end of the war, the camps became sites for medical experiments. Eugenics experiments, freezing prisoners to determine how downed pilots were affected by exposure, and experimental and lethal medicines were all tried at various camps. A cold water immersion experiments at Dachau concentration camp were performed by Sigmund Rascher.\n\nThe lead editors of the \"Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945\" of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Geoffrey Megargee and Martin Dean, cataloged some 42,500 Nazi ghettos and camps throughout Europe, spanning German-controlled areas from France to Russia and Germany itself, operating from 1933 to 1945. They estimate that 15 million to 20 million people died or were imprisoned in the sites.\n\nSome of the most notorious slave labour camps included a network of subcamps. Gross-Rosen had 100 subcamps, Auschwitz had 44 subcamps, Stutthof had 40 sub-camps set up contingently. Prisoners in these subcamps were dying from starvation, untreated disease and summary executions by the tens of thousands already since the beginning of war.\n\nThe camps were liberated by the Allied forces between 1944 and 1945. The first major camp, Majdanek, was discovered by the advancing Soviets on July 23, 1944. Auschwitz was liberated, also by the Soviets, on January 27, 1945; Buchenwald by the Americans on April 11; Bergen-Belsen by the British on April 15; Dachau by the Americans on April 29; Ravensbrück by the Soviets on the same day; Mauthausen by the Americans on May 5; and Theresienstadt by the Soviets on May 8. Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec were never liberated, but were destroyed by the Nazis in 1943. Colonel William W. Quinn of the U.S. 7th Army said of Dachau: \"There our troops found sights, sounds, and stenches horrible beyond belief, cruelties so enormous as to be incomprehensible to the normal mind.\"\n\nIn most of the camps discovered by the Soviets, almost all the prisoners had already been removed, leaving only a few thousand alive—7,000 inmates were found in Auschwitz, including 180 children who had been experimented on by doctors. Some 60,000 prisoners were discovered at Bergen-Belsen by the British 11th Armoured Division, 13,000 corpses lay unburied, and another 10,000 died from typhus or malnutrition over the following weeks. The British forced the remaining SS guards to gather up the corpses and place them in mass graves.\n\nThe Nazi concentration camps have been divided by historians into several major categories based on purpose, administrative structure, and inmate population profile. The system of camps preceded the onset of World War II by several years and was developed gradually. \n\nThough most Nazi concentration and extermination camps were destroyed after the war, some of them were turned into permanent memorials. In Communist Poland, some camps such as Majdanek, Jaworzno, Potulice and Zgoda were used by the Soviet NKVD to hold German prisoners of war, suspected or confirmed Nazis and Nazi collaborators, anti-Communists and other political prisoners, as well as civilian members of the German-speaking, Silesian and Ukrainian ethnic minorities. Currently, there are memorials to the victims of both Nazi and communist camps at Potulice; they have helped to enable a German-Polish discussion on historical perceptions of World War II. In East Germany, the concentration camps at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen were used for similar purposes. Dachau concentration camp was used as a detention centre for the arrested Nazis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated between the rivers Danube and Tamiš, in Belgrade's municipality of Palilula.\n\nIts 400 km² wetland was constantly flooded, but since World War II it has been drained part by part and almost half of it has been turned into a very fertile patch of land, suitable especially for cultivating grains and vegetables. It is managed by Serbia's largest agricultural company, \"PKB Beograd\", which almost exclusively provides food for 2 million people in the greater Belgrade area; thus Pančevački Rit is commonly nicknamed Granary of Belgrade. Stockbreeding is also very intensive, as are fishery and hunting.\n\nMany meandering canals and bogs have remained in the marsh: the slow streams of Vizelj, Dunavac, Sibnica, Butuš, Rogoznica, Buk, Belanoš and Sebeš, and large bogs of Reva, Veliko Blato (2 km²), Sebeš and Široka Bbara. In the south, the area ends with a river island (ada) Kožara (0.44 km²) and the southwest is occupied by the wetland of Beljarica.\n\nThe marshland is the natural habitat for the wild boars and Pančevački Rit is the location of the largest population of the wild boars on the territory of Belgrade, and probably in the entire Serbia. They are especially numerous in the area bounded by the Pupin Bridge, Crvenka, Borča and Padinska Skela. In the previous decades, as the settlements expanded, boars' natural roaming paths have been intersected by the houses or roads. As the area is agricultural, they feed on the crops (wheat, corn) and roots, but also on the fish and shells so many are found on the banks of the Danube.\n\nThere are two official, unfenced hunting grounds in Pančevački Rit. One is named the same way, while the other is called simply Rit. The Rit is located near Padinska Skela, from Belgrade along the \"Zrenjaninski put\". It covers an area of , of which is a pheasantry. Animals bred in the facility include roe deer, hare, quail, mallard, greylag goose and 13,000 pheasants per year.\n\nAfter being almost uninhabited before 1945, today its population density is above average for Serbia as a whole, since some of the fastest growing suburbs of Belgrade (Borča, Padinska Skela and Krnjača) have been built there.\n\nNeighborhoods of urban Belgrade in the Pančevački Rit:\n\nSettlements and neighborhoods of suburban Belgrade in the Pančevački Rit:\n\nThe area had its own municipality in 1955-1965 (until 1955 it had four municipalities: Borča, Ovča, Padinska Skela and Krnjača which merged into one municipality, Krnjača, in 1955 which in turn was annexed to Palilula in 1965).\n\nToday, there is a proposal that area again become a separate municipality with the name Dunavski Venac. Beginning in the late 1990s, the notion of the area on the left bank of the Danube splitting from the municipality of Palilula had been gaining momentum until in 2005 the Municipal assembly of Palilula finally accepted supporting the move. The proposed new municipality, if accepted and confirmed by the Belgrade City assembly, will have an area of 407 km² and a population of 70-80,000.\n\n"}

With the 2010 declaration of Dorob National Park, Namibia became the first and only country to have its entire coastline protected through a national parks network. Protected areas are subdivided into game reserves and/or nature reserves, such as special protected area, wilderness areas, natural areas, and development areas. There are also recreation reserves. Facilities in the national parks are operated by Namibia Wildlife Resorts. Over 19% of Namibia is protected, an area of some 130,000 square kilometres. However, the Ministry of Environment & Tourism auctions limited hunting rights within its protected areas. The Namibia Nature Foundation, an NGO, was established in 1987 to raise and administer funds for the conservation of wildlife and protected area management. Communal Wildlife Conservancies in Namibia help promote sustainable natural resource management by giving local communities rights to wildlife management and tourism.\n\nCape Cross is a protected area under the name Cape Cross Seal Reserve. The reserve is the home of one of the largest colonies of Cape fur seals in the world.\nCape Cross is one of two main sites in Namibia where seals are culled, partly for selling their hides and partly for protecting the fish stock. The economic impact of seals on the fish resources is controversial: While a government-initiated study found that seal colonies consume more fish than the entire fishing industry can catch, animal protection society Seal Alert South Africa estimated less than 0.3% losses to commercial fisheries.\n\nThe Daan Viljoen Game Reserve is a game reserve near Windhoek, situated in the hill area of Khomas Hochland. Over 200 species are found here, typical of the Namibian highlands, including Hartmann's mountain zebra, blue wildebeest, kudu, gemsbok, springbok, impala, rockrunner, white-tailed shrike, Monteiro's hornbill, Bradfield's swift, Rüppell's parrot and Carp's tit. In the 1990s a number of indigenous people in the area were resettled by the Namibian government. The park has many walking paths and allows tourists to travel around by themselves. It closed in 2010 to allow for the construction of the Sun Karros Daan Viljoen Lodge but has since reopened.\n\nHardap Recreation Resort surrounds Namibia's largest Hardap Dam, which opened in 1964 as a recreational area. Listed under IUCN Category IV, as of 2004 the park it covered an area of , of which about 10% formed the lake area. As Reader's Digest said though, \"ironically, although Hardap is one of Namibia's best-known resorts, the nature reserve is unfamiliar to the large majority of visitors.\" It contains over 100 species of birds.\n\nThe Popa Game Park is a small park where the Popa water fall, which drops by only 3 m over rapids on the Okavango River, is situated. Its thunderous sound is heard over a long distance. Bird species are a common sight and hippopotamus inhabit the river.\n\nEhirovipuka Conservancy is a gazetted communal area conservancy situated in the Kunene Region. It was established in January 2001 and covers an area of . The reserve consists of mainly semi-desert and savannah woodlands, and the Ombonde River flows through the area. Animals living there include African bush elephant, African leopard, lion, South African cheetah, common eland, kudu, duiker, warthog, steenbok, gemsbok, Angolan giraffe, springbok, South African ostrich, and Hartman's mountain zebra. It contains a meat processing plant supplying tourist lodges. Other economic activity includes forestry and the sale of traditional craft products. Ehirovipuka Conservancy received a 20-year tourism concession in 2010.\n\nThe Erindi Game Reserve ('Erendi' meaning \"Place of Water\") is in the heart land of Namibia and covers an area of 70,000ha. It is located 40 km to the east of Omaruru town and lies between the Erongo Mountain Rhino Sanctuary Trust of Namibia and the Omataku Mountains. Habitats recorded are of mountainous areas, riverine vegetation, inselbergs (\"island mountains\") and grassland savannahs. Leopard research is an important activity in the reserve. It also has a notable population of south-western black rhinoceros, lion, brown hyena, leopard and cheetah.\n\nGamsberg Nature Reserve is in central Namibia, located west of Rehoboth. It surrounds Gamsberg, Namibia's fourth highest mountain, with a peak elevation of .\n\nThe Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary covers an area of 3,200 ha which is a sanctuary for orphaned animals. Some of the animals tended are lions, leopards, cheetahs, wild dogs, caracals and baboons. The animals reported in the wild of the sanctuary are giraffe, zebra, kudu, hartebeest, springbok, eland, jackal and also wild cheetahs and leopards. The sanctuary has developed a new method to identify cheetahs in the wild based on their paw prints. This is done in association with Wildtrack, AfriCat and Chester Zoo.\n\nThe NamibRand Nature Reserve is a private nature reserve (largest such reserve in Africa) covering an area of 202,200 ha with four habitats of dunes and sandy plains, inselbergs and mountains gravel plains, and sand and gravel plains interface. The largest number of oryx gazelle (\"gemsbok\" or oryx) (3,200) and \"Antidorcas marsupialis\" (springbok) (12,400) are the dominant mammal species in the reserve. 150 bird species of birds are also reported. Other wild animals which are predators, recorded in the reserve are leopard, spotted and brown hyena, black-backed jackal, aardwolf, bat-eared fox, Cape fox, Southern African wildcat, caracal and genet.\n\nThe Tsaobis Leopard Park is the only nature reserve in Namibia to conserve leopards in particular. Situated south of Omaruru and east of Swakopmund, it was established in 1969.\n\nThe protection is not necessarily limited to inside the borders of Namibia. In 2007 the Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park, an international peace park, was created through the joint management of the Ai-Ais Hot Springs park, which includes parts of Fish River Canyon, and the Richtersveld National Park in neighbouring South Africa. Fauna includes rock hyrax, ground squirrel, jackal buzzard and Hartmann's mountain zebra.\n\nIn 2006, the countries of Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Botswana signed an agreement creating the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KaZa TFCA), a vast expanse of land designated primarily \"'to establish a world-class transfrontier conservation area and tourism destination in the Okavango and Zambezi river-basin regions within the context of sustainable development\", by linking different habitats and allowing animals the freedom of movement throughout this region of Africa.\n\nIn addition, there is ongoing discussion between the governments of Namibia and Angola regarding the creation of a trans-border coastal park, formed from the concaternation of the Skeleton Coast National Park, and Angola's Iona National Park.\n\n"}

A physiocrat, monist, pan-Slavist (after 1815) and laissez-fairist, he supported many reforms in Poland. He is particularly remembered for his political writings during the \"Great (Four-Year) Sejm\" (1788–92) and for his support of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, adopted by that Sejm.\n\nHe co-founded the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning (precursor to the Polish Academy of Sciences), of which he became president. He served as a member of the State Council of the Duchy of Warsaw and as minister of trade and industry in Congress Poland. Staszic is seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, Tatra Mountains studies and exploration, mining and industry.\n\nStanisław Staszic was born into a burgher family in the town of Piła (he was baptised on 6 November 1755), the youngest of four siblings. His father, Wawrzyniec Staszic, was mayor of Piła and a royal secretary. His brothers were Antoni (1743–1775) and Andrzej (1745–1825), a priest.\n\nStaszic attended secondary school at Wałcz. He studied theology and graduated from a Jesuit school at Poznań in 1778 and was ordained a Catholic priest (he took lesser Holy Orders in 1774, and higher orders about 1778–79). Between 1779 and 1781 he continued his studies in France at the Collège de France, where he took classes in physics and natural history.\n\nOn returning to Poland in 1781, he accepted a position as tutor in the house of Grand Crown Chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski. In 1782 he received a doctorate from the Zamojski Academy. He translated several works from French into Polish and briefly worked at the Academy as a teacher of French language.\n\nHis \"Remarks upon the Life of Jan Zamoyski\" (\"Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego\", 1787), published anonymously on the eve of the Great Sejm, transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth. It became a model for other similar works and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.\n\nWithin his \"Remarks\", Staszic did not portray the life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In \"Remarks\" he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.\n\nStaszic was a keen observer of the proceedings of the Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788. He continued publishing new books and pamphlets. His \"Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of the remarks upon the life of Jan Zamoyski\" (\"Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego\", 1790), together with his previous \"Remarks\", are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment. In \"Warnings\", he criticised the magnates of Poland and Lithuania, monastic orders and serfdom, and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk. Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is recognized as one of the founding fathers of the Constitution of May 3, 1791.\n\nDuring 1790–1791 he accompanied Zamoyski's family on a trip abroad, and continued to serve as an adviser to the family, although his relations with the sons (Aleksander August Zamoyski, Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski) had become strained; he would eventually align himself with the daughter of the family, Anna Zamoyska (Anna Jadwiga Sapieżyna). He supported the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, a failed attempt to liberate Commonwealth from foreign influence following the events of the 1793 Second Partition of Poland, donating money to the insurgents' cause. Upon the defeat of the Uprising, he accompanied the family on their trip to Vienna. He also made some successful financial investments, including in the stock market. He then served as an economic adviser for the Zamoyski and the Sapieha families, invested in their estates, and lent them money.\n\nAfter the partitions of Poland, in which Russia, Prussia, and Austria seized all of the Commonwealth's territory, Staszic was active in many scientific and scholarly initiatives. He studied the geology of the Carpathian Mountains. In 1800 he co-founded the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning; from 1802 he was one of its most active members. In 1804 he went to France, where he observed the changes wrought by Napoleon. On return to Poland in 1805, he spent some time in the Tatra Mountains, where he continued his geological studies and conducted ethnographic ones. He worked with Jan Chrystian Hoffmann on a geological map of Poland. In the Duchy of Warsaw he worked with the Ministry of Education (\"Izba Edukacyjna Księstwa Warszawskiego\") and was involved in numerous educational reforms and initiatives. He also briefly worked with the Ministry of Treasury.\n\nFrom 1808 he was president of the Society of Friends of Learning (\"Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk\", or \"TPN\"), forerunner to the Polish Academy of Sciences (\"Polska Akademia Nauk\"); he would be elected repeatedly as the society's president until his death. In 1808 he also became referendary to the State Council (\"Rada Stanu\") of the Duchy; in 1810 he became a full member. In the Council, he was active in regard to questions of education and the economy. As \"TPN\" president he was active in many initiatives which supported and popularized science in Poland. He oversaw the construction of a headquarters for the \"TPN\", which came to be known as the \"Staszic Palace\".\n\nFrom 1814 he supported the Russian Empire, seen as a Pan-Slavist ally of Poland, and favored the idea of a great Slavic monarchy. After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1815, he became a member of the government of the newly created small state of Congress Poland (in personal union with Russia), initially in the new Ministry of Education and Religion, in 1816 serving as deputy minister. In 1815 he was decorated with the Order of Saint Stanislaus. In 1819 he endorsed a controversial censorship law, damaging his reputation.\n\nHis 1815 Polish translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" met with a negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume \"Works\" (\"Dzieła\"). Volumes 7–9 comprised his \"Humankind: A Didactic Poem\" (\"Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne\"), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as an important contribution to the history of Polish philosophy. However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.\n\nHe also carried out studies on education and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical of the influence of religion. These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.\n\nFrom 1816 he was involved in mining research and projects. He also actively supported industrial development in Poland. He was one of the first to see the importance of coal, and supported the development of metallurgy-related projects, from mines to zinc and steel mills. He was also involved in the development of ceramic and textile industries, and improving the transport infrastructure (roads, canals). He discovered coal deposits in Dąbrowa Górnicza, where he initiated the building of a coal mine. Between 1816 and 1824 he was the \"de facto\" minister of industry of the Congress Poland (styled officially the \"director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry\") and initiated construction of the Old Polish Industrial Area (\"Staropolski Okręg Przemysłowy\"). As his projects did not result in quick returns, he incurred increasing criticism, and eventually resigned from his position in 1824.\n\nIn 1816 he founded the \"Hrubieszowskie Towarzystwo Rolnicze\" (Hrubieszów Agricultural Society), seen by some as the first Polish cooperative.\n\nHe died in Warsaw on 20 January 1826, most likely due to a stroke. His funeral gathered 20,000 people, including the viceroy of the Congress Poland, Józef Zajączek. He was buried in the cemetery of the Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Kraków. His testament left his property at Hrubieszów to its tenants, and much of his wealth went to various philanthropic initiatives.\n\nStaszic was remembered by his contemporaries as a loner and not a person who was quick to make friends. He has been described as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.\n\nHe is seen as one of the chief representatives of the political activists and writers of the Polish Enlightenment. He is also seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, Tatra Mountains studies and exploration, mining and industry. He is one of the figures immortalised in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting \"Constitution of May 3, 1791\". He was also the protagonist of the Charles Dickens' novella \"Judge Not\" (1851), and of Hanna Muszyńska-Hoffmanowa's novel \"Pucharek ze srebra\" (\"Little chalice of silver\"). Wacław Berent published a biography of Staszic, but it is now lost. In 1926, on the 100th anniversary of his death, he was celebrated in the Second Polish Republic with several studies, articles and publications.\n\nIn April 1951, he was honoured on a postage stamp of the People's Republic of Poland as part of the set issued for the First Congress of Polish Science. His figure was popular among the Marxist scholars of the People's Republic, who stressed his materialist, determinist and anti-clerical views. The 150th anniversary of his death in 1976 was also celebrated, with many works dedicated to him, including poems by Jan Czeczot and Jan Lohmann. He has been made a patron of over 200 schools, including the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków. There are statues of Stanisław Staszic in Łódź, Kielce, Hrubieszów and Dąbrowa Górnicza. Several geographical landmarks, minerals and a bacterium bear his name as well. In Piła, there is a Museum of Stanisław Staszic, which has gathered various artifacts related to him, and publishes a journal, \"Zeszyty Staszicowskie\" (\"Staszic Notebooks\").\n\n\nHis best-known works include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

For example, the design of a sustainable urban drainage system can: improve habitats for fauna and flora; improve recreational facilities, because people love to be beside water; save money, because building culverts is expensive and floods cause severe financial harm.\n\nThe design of a green roof or a roof garden can also contribute to the sustainability of a landscape architecture project. The roof will help manage surface water, provide for wildlife and provide for recreation.\n\nSustainability appears to be a new addition to the traditional Vitruvian objectives of the design process: a structure must be solid, useful, and beautiful (\"firmitas\", \"utilitas\", \"venustas\"). But it can be seen as an aspect of both solidity and usefulness: an outdoor space is likely to last longer and give more usefulness to its owners if it requires low inputs of energy, water, fertiliser etc., and if it produces fewer outputs of noise, pollution, surface water runoff etc. \n\nThe American Society of Landscape Architects' sustainable design guidelines include the following:\n\n\nThe American Society of Landscape Architects also provide a sustainability toolkit that includes economic, environmental, and social models, for projects of different scales, that can be used in practicing landscape architecture.\n\nThe scales includes:\n\nSustainable Regional Planning\n\nSustainable Cities & Community Planning\n\nSustainable Neighborhood Planning\n\nSustainable Landscapes \n\nGreen Buildings\n\n\n\n\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n\n\n"}

McChesney (New York: Monthly Review Press, 2004). The book brings up issues in journalism like bias of news and declining quality of content. The book also points a number of weaknesses in the media sector as well as new ways to regulate the sector.\n\nIn further analysis of identifying the problem with Media as it relates to politics is to understand that in the Political Science disciplines in universities it is very much a sideline subject matter that doesn't bare the potential weight should on American Politics and elections. The higher education discipline that does deal more with the impact of media bias on politics is Communications. \n\nIn a a Journal article by D. Graber, J.Smith Political communication faces the 21st century but the research in this article shows the importance and small change to begin to better understand the impact of the media and politics. The author references multiple future directions and 10 targets to give political communication scholars better insight into the neglected aspect of the impact and issues facing politics and media in the 21st century. These targets include, \"Communications policy formulation, preserving the open marketplace of ideas, Global cultural differences,Media as agents of political socialization,Public information campaigns,The rhetoric of political leaders,The rhetoric of negotiations,Learning limitations and Network analyses\".\n\nAnother powerful impact to U.S. Politics has grown from the types of technology used to communicate political information to the masses. We need look no further than our own Facebook or Twitter pages to see positions, news or fake news and quotes from our politcal leaders taken in and out of context and manipulated to position the posters agenda. The seeds are planted and those seeds are powerful. In an article by Clay Shirky The Political Power of Social Media Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change he first describes the 2001 impeachment trial of Philippin President Joseph Estrada. How mass text messages created crowds of protesters coordinated by text messages that shut down the city of Manila and the response changing the course of the hearing. Shirky goes to write \"Disciplined and coordinated groups, whether businesses or goverments, have always had an advantage over undisciplined ones: they have an easier time engaging in collective action because they have way of directing the action of their members. Social media can compensate for the disadvantages of undisciplined groups by reducing the costs of coordination\". This has effectivley changed the ability of smaller group impact on any politically charged environment. Shirky goes on to analyze several attempts by U.S. offiicials to control, censor or entertain controlling these private environments. In addition Shirky says he believes \" \"Washington's ability to shape or target these changes is limited. Instead, Washington should adopt a more general approach, promoting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly every where. And it should understand that progress will be slow. Only by switching from an instrumental to an environmental view of the effects of social media on the public sphere will the United States be able to take advantage of the long-term benefits these tools promise?even though that may mean accepting short-term disappointment.\"\"\n\nMedia bias, rating importance and monetary gain for sensationalizing political controversy verses fact reporting on politics is rampant in our society, the tools by which now normal people can piece together a political view and share it with 1000s of people instantly is problematic where it is combined with the extreme mainstream media antics needs to be researched more thoroughly and is at a critical point that begs for reform and understanding not necessarily censorship. \nFOREIGN\n\n"}

Movement along the shear zone helps explain how the South American continent could have fitted tightly to the African continent before the breakup of Gondwana.\n\nThe TBL was formed when the Goiás Ocean, lying between the Amazonian craton and the Congo / Sao Francisco craton, was closed during the formation of West Gondwana around 600 million years ago.\nThe lineament extends from the northeast coast of Brazil in a southwesterly direction through Paraguay and into Argentina, where it is dissipated in the Salado and Colorado extension basins.\n\nThe Trans-Saharan Belt (TSB), running from Algeria to Benin, was created in the same period. It marks the line where the Pharusian Ocean, linked to the Goiás Ocean, was closed as the West African craton collided with the Saharan Metacraton.\nThe TSB includes the Hoggar belt, which splays into the Kandi fault zone in Benin, corresponding to the Sobral fault at the north of the TBL.\nGiven the correspondence of faults, which is widely accepted, the TBL and TBS form perhaps the longest coherent shear zone on the Earth.\n\nTowards the north of the lineament in Brazil, a series of splay faults show where the crust has extended, and these faults match corresponding faults in Africa. Thus the Pernambuco fault in Brazil matches the Foumban fault zone in Cameroon, and other Brazilian faults match the Benue Trough in Nigeria. The extension caused by these splay faults causes a poor fit between South America and Africa around the Niger Delta region.\nHowever, after allowing for a sinistral shear movement of about 100 km of the crust to the east of the TBL, there is an excellent fit between South America and Africa both to the south and the west of the Niger Delta.\n"}
