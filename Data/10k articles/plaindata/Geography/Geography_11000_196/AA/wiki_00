During some of these events, euxinia, waters that contained hydrogen sulfide, developed. Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years, the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past. Anoxic events coincided with several mass extinctions and may have contributed to them. These mass extinctions include some that geobiologists use as time markers in biostratigraphic dating. Many geologists believe oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to slowing of ocean circulation, climatic warming, and elevated levels of greenhouse gases. Researchers have proposed enhanced volcanism (the release of CO) as the \"central external trigger for euxinia\".\n\nThe concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927–1990) and geologist Hugh Jenkyns and arose from discoveries made by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine volcanic plateaus (Shatsky Rise, Manihiki Plateau), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe - particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated Apennines chain in Italy - that led to the realization that these widespread similar strata recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of geological time.\n\nSedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide. Furthermore, detailed organic geochemical studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both purple sulfur bacteria and green sulfur bacteria: organisms that required both light and free hydrogen sulfide (HS), illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column.\n\nThere are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized \"dead zones\". Dead zones exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay, in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat, the Black Sea (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current surge of jellyfish worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and New Zealand. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.\n\nThis is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black shale in the geologic record. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called \"super-greenhouse events\".\n\nOceanic anoxic events with euxinic (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity.\n\nTemperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today - making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable.\n\nOne hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world. There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at depth, with a temperature of to .\n\nThe second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as coccoliths and foraminifera.\nSuch an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the oxygen minimum zone, further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans.\n\nFor such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous upwelling, requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-isotope ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals. Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand - sustaining the event through a positive feedback.\n\nHere is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events. Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the greenhouse effect; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-carbon burial in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean–atmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends).\n\nIn this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth’s response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hydrosphere. One test of this notion is to look at the age of large igneous provinces (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide. Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs (Karoo-Ferrar flood basalt, Caribbean large igneous province, Ontong Java Plateau) correlates uncannily well with that of the major Jurassic (early Toarcian) and Cretaceous (early Aptian and Cenomanian–Turonian) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible.\n\nOceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm climate characterized by high levels of carbon dioxide (CO) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of . The Quaternary levels, the current period, are just in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable natural gas (methane) that some call an \"oceanic burp\". Vast quantities of methane are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of methane hydrate, a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller \"burps\" due to tectonic events. Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide. However, anoxia was also rife during the Hirnantian (late Ordovician) ice age.\n\nOceanic anoxic events have been recognized primarily from the already warm Cretaceous and Jurassic Periods, when numerous examples have been documented, but earlier examples have been suggested to have occurred in the late Triassic, Permian, Devonian (Kellwasser event), Ordovician and Cambrian.\n\nThe Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events.\n\nTypically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery.\n\nOceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass extinctions of marine organisms both in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. The early Toarcian and Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic events correlate with the Toarcian and Cenomanian-Turonian extinction events of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers.\n\nAn economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's petroleum and natural gas reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum source rocks in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale.\n\nA model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the ozone layer, which normally blocks the deadly ultraviolet radiation of the Sun. The increased UV radiation caused by this ozone depletion would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the Permian-Triassic extinction event show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil biomarkers of green sulfur bacteria, indicates that this process could have played a role in that mass extinction event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million.\n\nReduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of iron–manganese oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as barium. When heavy-metal-rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-Pridoli event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow-water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in chitinozoans and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity. Similar metal enrichment has been reported in sediments from the mid-Silurian Ireviken event.\n\nSulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many water bodies from ponds to various land-surrounded mediterranean seas such as the Black Sea, were particularly prevalent in the Cretaceous Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the continental plates are believed to have been well separated, and the mountains we know today were (mostly) future tectonic events—meaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower— and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers.\n\nDetailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early Aptian (~120 Ma), sometimes called the Selli Event (or OAE 1a) after the Italian geologist, Raimondo Selli (1916–1983), and another at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary (~93 Ma), sometimes called the Bonarelli Event (or OAE 2) after the Italian geologist, Guido Bonarelli (1871–1951). OAE1a lasted for ~1.0 to 1.3 Myr. The duration of OAE2 is estimated to be ~820 kyr based on a high-resolution study of the significantly expanded OAE2 interval in southern Tibet, China.\n\nMore minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the Valanginian, Hauterivian, Albian and Coniacian–Santonian stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change.\n\nThe only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early Toarcian (~183 Ma). Because no DSDP (Deep Sea Drilling Project) or ODP (Ocean Drilling Program) cores have recovered black shales of this age – there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining in the world ocean – the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land. These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples.\n\nThe boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian. These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation.\n\nJeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water. If the high latitude waters are below , they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated. If high latitude waters are warmer than , their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters. Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high. This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen. The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years). The warm waters also initiate the release of clathrates, which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia. Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects.\n\nThe periods with cold poles are termed \"P-episodes\" (short for \"primo\"), and are characterised by bioturbated deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events - for example, the Ireviken and Lau events. The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic \"S-episodes\" (\"secundo\"), where deep ocean sediments are typically graptolitic black shales.\nA typical cycle of \"secundo-primo\" episodes and ensuing \"event\" typically lasts around 3 Ma.\n\nThe duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed. Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high ) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes. On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of Milankovic cycles, which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes.\n\nThese events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations.\n\nThe end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation.\n\nIt has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.\n\n\n\n"}

Their heritable rights were given to them by the Arshakuni Dynasty, the kings of Armenia (52-428). They were called aspets and crowned Arshakuni kings. Their domain included the region of Sper in Upper Armenia, which was famous for its gold, and Tayk.\n\nSmbat I was the first member of the dynasty. He was aspet during the reign of Armenia's first Christian king, Tiridates III the Great (287-330). The last Armenian king, who was crowned by Bagratunis, was Artaxias IV (423-428). The aspet was Smbat III, who was known from Vramshapuh king's times (389-415).\n\nThe ancestors of Smbat III were the most famous princes (nakharars) during the occupation of the Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia. Armenia had been divided between them since 387. Tirots, one of the ancestors of Smbat III, allied with Armenian marzbane. Sahak II and Smbat IV were marzbans of Armenia. The rulers of the dynasty traditionally continued to be \"aspets\".\n\nAfter the second division of Armenia, the domains of the Bagratuni family became part of Byzantine Empire. Smbat IV was among the princes who rebelled against them.\n\nDuring the Arabic period (7-9th centuries), the Bagratuni family was one of the most powerful princely dynasties of Armenia. Their main competitors were sparapets of the Mamikonian family who were Byzantine-oriented. Princes of Armenia were chosen from these two families and sometimes the people, who were under their influence. Princes were the second most powerful people after the ostikan.\n\nThe competition was ended by the victory of Bagratunis, who founded an independent kingdom. First, the title of Prince of Armenia changed to Prince of Princes. Then, the prince of princes became sparapets who were the constables of the army. In the beginning of the 9th century, a powerful prince, Ashot Msaker, united Taron, Tayk and Ayrarat, taking them under his control and thus making them part of his domain. Later, he united Moxoene, Gugark, Georgia and Caucasian Albania. He then took over Artsrunis of Vaspurakan and Syunis of Syunik. As a result, all of Arminiya came under his control.\n\nPrinces of Armenia and sparapets were from the family of Smbat VIII. His son, Ashot, became the king of Armenia. Sons of Bagarat II, brother of Smbat VIII, became the princes of Taron. Their sister, Hripsime, became the princess of principality of Vaspurakan. Her husband was the first prince Hamazasp II, Artsruni.\n\nBefore independence, the Tayk of Bagratuni became an independent principality. Its ruler, Ashot, became the head of the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty. It ruled in Georgia for one thousand years (9-19th centuries).\n\nThe last prince of Armenia was Ashot (855-885), son of Smbat VIII, who later became the first king (885-890).\n\nTaron (Turuberan) became a part of Bagratunis' domain in the beginning of the 9th century, when Ashot Msaker was Prince of Armenia (790-826). As a prince of Taron, he is counted as Ashot I (804-826). After his death, prince of princes, Bagrat, inherited Taron, the south of the domain, and Smbat, Ayrarat, which was the northern part. Bagrat was the second in the dynasty. Bagrat I was an aspet in the 4th century. However, in Taron, he was the first Bagrat, so he ruled as Bagrat I of Taron (826-851), because there were no Bagrats before him. His sons and grandsons ruled until 966. After, Taron became a part of Byzantine Empire.\n\nPrevious seniors, princes of Taron, of the Mamikonian family, were strong in the region, even during the ruling of the last prince, Ashot III. They became relatives with the Bagratunis, and as a result of that, there were two more princes in Taron in his last days. They were Bagrat III and Grigor II, who were half-Mamikonians and half-Bagratunis. Later, the Tronite branch of the Bagratunis and Mamikonians became one family. Some of them ruled in Sasun (Tornikians) and the others in Moush (Taronites).\n\nAfter the death of Ashot Msaker (826) and Bagrat II Bagratuni (851), Smbat VIII became the prince of Armenia. His family was the ruling royal family for 200 years, in Armenia, Georgia and Albania. Because of this long rule, they were called king of kings (shahnshah).\n\nThe son of Smbat VIII, Ashot, became the first Bagratuni king. He had four sons and three daughters, whom he married to Artsruni and Syuni princes. Thus, the strongest families of Armenia became one family and began to rule the country. Ashot's brother, Shapuh, became sparapet, the constable of the Armenian army. The capital was Bagaran, which was throne-city of Ashot Msaker (790-826). Ashot 's son, Smbat (890-914), moved the capital to Yerazgavors. It was the capital for about forty years until King Abas moved it to Kars.\n\nAshot III the Merciful, king of Armenia (953-977), built a new capital around the fortress of Ani. It was the last capital of the Armenian kingdom, so it is also called Kingdom of Ani. His brother, Mushegh, stayed in Kars and founded Kingdom of Kars (963-1065) under the sovereignty of Ashot III. Later, the king of Armenia, Smbat II, allowed his brother Gurgen to organize a new kingdom in north which became the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget (978-1113). Smbat Syuni did the same in the east creating the Kingdom of Syunik-Baghk.\n\nThe third son of Ashot III, Gagik, was the last powerful king of Armenia (990-1020). After his death, the kingdom was divided into two parts, between the brothers, Hovhannes-Smbat and Ashot. The last king was Gagik II (1042-1045), son of Ashot.\n\nIn 1079, Gagik II was killed. In 1080, Gagik of Kars and his sons, Hovhannes and David, also died. The son of Hovhannes, Ashot, was also killed in Ani. As a result, the royal branch of the Bagratunis ended with Ani and Kars. The last royal branch, the Kiurikian family, remained in Lori.\n\nArmenian prince Ruben killed the murderers of Gagik II and inherited the throne from him. In 1080, he founded the Armenian principality of Cilicia (1080-1198), which became a kingdom (1198-1375).\n\nConsequently, the royal heritage of the Armenian Bagratuni family is either Georgian Bagrationis, or Rubinians, Hetumids and Lusignans in Cilicia, or the Kiurikians. Non-royal or princely branches have many more than these three royal branches.\n\nThe Kiurikians were a royal and princely family from Armenia from the 10th through 14th centuries. The founder is Gurgen or Kiurike, son of Ashot III the Merciful (953-977). At first, they ruled only in Tashir-Dzoraget (Lori Province) but later in Tavush as well. Grandsons of Gurgen-Kiurike were kings of Tashir-Dzoraget and eastern Georgia (Kingdom of Kakheti).\n\nIn the 12th century, Kakhety and Lori annexed to Georgia. The Kiurikians remained in Tavush. Later they divided into Matsnaberd and Nor-berd branches. The last prince, Sargis of Matsnaberd, ruled in the 13th century. Nothing is known about him, his parents (probably Aghsartan), or their offspring.\n\n\n"}

Most important of these is the Barada, a river that rises in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and disappears into the desert. The Barada flows out of the karst spring of Ain al-Fijah, about north west of Damascus in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, but its true source is Lake Barada, a small lake that is also a karst spring located about from Zabadani. The Barada descends through a steep, narrow gorge named \"Rabwe\" before it arrives at Damascus, where it divides into seven branches that irrigate the Al Ghutah (الغوطة) oasis, the location of Damascus. Eventually the Ghouta reached a size of 370 square kilometers, although in the 1980s, urban growth started replacing agricultural use with housing and industry. The river has also suffered from severe drought in the last decades, mainly due to the lower rainfall rates and the large increase in the population in the area. It also suffers from serious pollution problems, especially in the summer, where there is almost no flow and little water in the basin.\n\nBarada is identified as Abana (or \"Amanah\", in Qere and Ketiv variation in Tanakh and classical Chrysorrhoas) which is the more important of the two rivers of Damascus, Syria and was mentioned in the \"Book of Kings\" (). As the Barada rises in the Anti-Libanus, and escapes from the mountains through a narrow gorge, its waters debouch fan-like, in canals or \"rivers\", the name of one of which, the Banias river, retains a trace of \"Abana\".\n\nJohn MacGregor, who gives a description of them in his book \"Rob Roy on the Jordan\", affirmed that as a work of hydraulic engineering, the system and construction of the canals, by which the Abana and Pharpar were used for irrigation, might be considered as one of the most complete and extensive in the world.

It's name comes from the Latin 'defesa', (fenced), referring to land that was fenced, and usually destined for pasture. Dehesas may be private or communal property (usually belonging to the municipality). Used primarily for grazing, they produce a variety of products, including non-timber forest products such as wild game, mushrooms, honey, cork, and firewood. They are also used to raise the Spanish fighting bull and the Iberian pig. The main tree component is oaks, usually holm (\"Quercus ilex\") and cork (\"Quercus suber\"). Other oaks, including melojo (\"Quercus pyrenaica\") and quejigo (\"Quercus faginea\"), may be used to form dehesa, the species depending on geographical location and elevation. Dehesa is an anthropogenic system that provides not only a variety of foods, but also wildlife habitat for endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle. \n\nBy extension, the term can also be used for this style of rangeland management on estates.\n\nThe dehesa is derived from the Mediterranean forest ecosystem, consisting of grassland featuring herbaceous species, used for grazing cattle, goats, and sheep, and tree species belonging to the genus \"Quercus\" (oak), such as the holm oak (\"Quercus ilex\" sp. \"ballota\"), although other tree species such as beech and pine trees may also be present. Oaks are protected and pruned to produce acorns, which the famous black Iberian pigs feed on in the fall during the \"montanera\". Ham produced from Iberian pigs fattened with acorns and air-dried at high elevations is known as \"Jamón ibérico\" (\"presunto ibérico\", or \"pata negra\" in Portuguese), and sells for premium prices, especially if only acorns have been used for fattening.\n\nIn a typical dehesa, oaks are managed to persist for about 250 years. If cork oaks are present, the cork is harvested about every 9 to 12 years, depending on the productivity of the site. The understory is usually cleared every 7 to 10 years to prevent the takeover of the woodland by shrubs of the rock rose family (Cistaceae), often referred to as \"jara\", or by oak sprouts. Oaks are spaced to maximize overall productivity by balancing light for the grasses in the understory, water use in the soils, and acorn production for pigs and game.\n\nThere is debate about the origins and maintenance of the dehesa, and whether or not the oaks can reproduce adequately under the grazing densities now prevailing. \n\nThe dehesa system has great economic and social importance on the Iberian Peninsula because of both the large amount of land involved and its importance in maintaining rural population levels. The major source of income for dehesa owners is usually cork, a sustainable product that supports this ancient production system and old growth oaks. High end black iberian pigs and sale of hunting rights also represent significant income sources. Periodic hunts in the dehesa are known as the \"monteria\". Groups attend a hunt at a private estate and wait at hunting spots for game to be driven to them with dogs. They usually pay well for the privilege, hunting wild boar, red deer and other species.\n\nThe area of dehesa usually coincides with areas that could be termed \"marginal\" because of both their limited agricultural potential (due to the poor quality of the soil) and a lack of local industry, which results in isolated agro-industries and very low capitalization.\n\nDehesa covers nearly 20,000 square kilometers on the Iberian Peninsula, mainly in:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Became a member of the CPSU in 1939. Davitaia was professor of the universities of Leningrad (1950–1951) and Moscow (1955–1961). In Moscow, for several years he also delivered lectures at the Courses for the improvement of professional skill at the Central Board of Hydrometeorological Service, USSR Council of Ministers.\n\nFrom 1963 Davitaia continued educational work at Tbilisi State University, directing a large number of postgraduates who successfully developed his ideas in their research.\n\nFor 15 years Davitaia was a member of the Scientific and Technological Council of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture; he took an active part in the work of the State Commission for the strain testing of agricultural crops on the territory of our vast country. He participated in the preparation of the many-volume fundamental edition \"Ampelography of the USSR\".\n\nFeofan Davitaia was born on 15 September 1911 in the mountainous village of Eki, Tskhakaia district, Georgia, where he went to elementary school. From 1909 Davitaia's father worked in Poti as a stevedore. Later his large family also moved to Poti.\n\nIn 1927 Feofan Davitaia finished secondary school in Poti, and on the recommendation of the town YCL Committee was given the job of loader of manganese ore at the Poti port. After entering Tbilisi University in 1928, Davitaia combined his study with work at the Weather Bureau of the Tbilisi Geophysical Observatory. While a postgraduate student, Davitaia came out with a number of initiative suggestions on the organization of scientific work. Of these, mention should be made of his well-founded suggestion-published In the Izvestia newspaper—on the setting up of a Scientific Committee attached to the Government of the USSR. \nIn 1936 Davitaia successfully defended his thesis for a candidate’s degree on the \"Climatic Zones of the Vine in the USSR\", which was published as a monograph in 1938.\n\nBy 1950 Davitaia summed up his research in his monograph \"Study of the Climates of the Vine in the USSR and the Bases of their Practical Use\", which he defended brilliantly as a doctoral thesis In agricultural sciences. The monograph, published in 1952, has become a deskbook of viticulturists, winemakers, and agriclimatologists.\n\nIn 1964-1965 Davitaia worked at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba directing a group of Soviet consulting scientists engaged in a study of the country’s natural resources. Jointly with Soviet and Cuban scientists, he conducted extensive work for the preparation of a national atlas of Cuba. As a result of processing the materials of long-term meteorological observations Davitaia wrote a scientific monograph, \"Climatic Resources of Cuba\", which was published (jointly with I. I. Trusov) in Spanish (Havana, 1965). A somewhat modified version of that monograph was published in Tbilisi in Russian (1966). This book was highly appraised in a number of published reviews, including one in the United States. To mark this important event in the scientific life of the Republic of Cuba, in 1965 the Cuban Academy of Sciences conferred on Davitaia the title of cofounder of the Institute of Geography in Havana, presenting him with a diploma. Davitaia’s Scientific missions abroad were combined with geographical excursion-expeditions. Among them particularly fruitful in the scientific respect were his travels in Brazil, Cuba, the United States, Ireland, and the PRC. The results of those travels were used in developing the climatic criteria for the identification.\n\nIn 1967-1968, at the invitation of the University of Wisconsin, Davitaia delivered a course of lectures on contemporary problems of climatology and agrometeorology for the postgraduates and professors of the Department of Geography.\n\nDuring his stay in the USA Davitaia published papers in American scientific journals; his monograph, \"Methods of Agricultural Assessment of Climate\", was published in the same period.\n\nThe numerous articles and papers contributed by Davitaia to newspapers and popular magazines reflected the achievements of Soviet agrometeorology and geography, making this evidence available to broad sections of the public. In 1972, at the 22nd World Geographical Congress (Canada), Feofan Davitaia was elected Vice-President of the International Geographical Union.\n\nAt the 1976 International Congress in Moscow Davitaia was again elected to this high post. At that Congress he directed the work of the section of climatology, hydrology, glaciology, and oceanography.\n\nAt the XIV Geographical Congress of Czechoslovakia (1978) Davitaia read a paper on the topic \"Present-day Problems of Geography\". At that Congress he was elected an honorary member of the Czechoslovak Geographical Society.\n\nin 1978 Davitaia directed the UNESCO Project 6/1—\"Man and Biosphere\". In the same year, at the invitation] of the international Geographical Union, he participated in a conference on regional geography in Nigeria. In the same year Davitaia was one of the organizers of a Soviet-Indian Symposium in Tbilisi on the study of regional geographic problems, as well as of a Bulgarian-Soviet Field Symposium.\n\nFor his scientific studies Feofan Davitaia was awarded the All-Union Prize and Diploma of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the All-Union Leninist Youth League (1938), the prizes and first class diplomas of the Leningrad Regional Committee of the LYCLSU (1939), the prizes oi the USSR Ministry of Food Industry (1949) and of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences (1948), the A. I. Voeykov Prize twice (in 1956 and 1959), the Large Silver (1962t and Gold Medals of the USSR Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy, and others. In 1971 he was awarded the State Prize of the Georgian SSR: on 20 February 1972 he was awarded the Diploma and Gold Medal of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba. In 1973 Davitaia was awarded the State Prize of the USSR for his participation in the compilation of the National Atlas of Cuba.\n\nIn 1980, Feofan Davitaia was posthumously elected honorary member of the Cuban Speleological Society for his outstanding services and great contribution to the development of Cuban geography.\n\nFeofan Davitaia’s services have been recognized by the award of five orders, twelve medals, and governmental and scientific decorations.\n\nDavitaia’s scientific and public activities were a model of selfless service of his fatherland. His scientific investigations had a considerable influence on the development of Soviet geography, climatology, agricultural meteorology and a number of other sciences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26798755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26798755", "title": "Fish Hoek Valley", "text": "Fish Hoek Valley\n\nThe Fish Hoek Valley is situated in the Cape Peninsula, eighteen miles south of Cape Town, South Africa. It takes its name from the town of Fish Hoek on the False Bay coast.\n\nThe valley is bound by mountains (including Chapman's Peak, Spitskop, Silvermine Mountain, and Ridge Peak) on the north; Fish Hoek Bay and False Bay on the east; mountains (including Elsie's Peak, Rooikrans, and Slangkop) on the south; and Chapman's Bay and the Atlantic Ocean on the west. It is 13 kilometres from west to east, and between 3 and 6 kilometres from north to south. The valley has several rivers and lakes.\n\nThe predominant vegetation type in this valley is endangered Hangklip Sand Fynbos. However, the sides of the valley are home to Cape Granite Fynbos, and Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos can be found higher up on the surrounding mountains. The latter two vegetation types (also both endangered) are endemic to the Cape Peninsula and can be found nowhere else in the world. \n\nFish Hoek Valley was once rural, but today it is largely covered by suburbs and townships such as Kommetjie, Ocean View, Noordhoek, The Lakes, Masiphumelele, Capri Village, Sunnydale, Sun Valley, Fish Hoek, and Clovelly. Some rural aspects have been preserved in the form of heritage areas and parts of the Table Mountain National Park.\n\nPre-historic\n\nMany millennia ago, the valley was a channel separating two islands off the African mainland. By 20 000 years ago, the sea had receded, the channel and the isthmus separating the islands from the mainland had become dry land, and the islands had become a peninsula.\n\nBy 10 000 BCE, pre-Bushman people were living in caves in the slopes lining the valley. Several of their skeletons, weapons and other artefacts were unearthed in Peers Cave on the north-eastern side of the valley, in 1927. The skeletons were named 'Fish Hoek Man'.\n\nBy the first century AD 'Strandlopers' (Khoisan) were living on the slopes of Slangkop. A midden containing mussel, limpet and abalone shells, and various stone implements was uncovered there in 1972.\n\n17th century\n\nThe recorded history of the valley, and of South Africa as a whole, begins when the Dutch East India Company established a settlement at Table Bay, 28 kilometres north of the valley, in 1652. The Company regarded the whole of the Western Cape region as being under its jurisdiction, but in the early years its settlement remained confined to the northern peninsula. Its first venture into the southern peninsula is thought to have been in 1659, when troops combed the area in search of KhoiSan who had attacked the Company's settlement. \n\nIn the early 1680s, the Company explored the mountains on the northern side of the valley for silver deposits. The mountain, and a river which flows down it, became known as 'Zilvermyn'. In 1687, Governor Simon van der Stel explored the area, and reported an abundance of wild birds and wild game roaming the area. Three years later, Van der Stel granted fishing and whaling rights at Visch Hoek on the eastern end of the valley — a community of fishermen and whalers developed there, and a building was erected. \n\n18th century\n\nPermanent settlement of the valley began in 1743, when the Company established Simon's Bay, 3 kilometres south of Visch Hoek bay, as a winter anchorage. Governor-general Gustav van Imhoff granted three farms at the western end of the valley, probably to supply fesh produce to Simon's Bay. They were \"Slangkop\" ('Snake Peak'), \"De Goede Hoop\" ('Good Hope'), and \"Poespaskraal\" ('Hotch-potch kraal'). Half a century later, in 1797, when the colony was under British military occupation, a fourth farm was established, at Visch Hoek, but it was only on loan and the lease ended when the lessee died in 1808. \n\n19th century\n\nWhen the Cape became a permanent British colony in 1814, the Royal Navy established a permanent base at Simon's Town, and governor Sir John Cradock established the southern part of the Peninsula as the Simon's Town magisterial district. The road through Visch Hoek to Simon's Town was rebuilt in 1815.\n\nSoon afterwards, two more farms were established, at the eastern end of the valley. In 1815, Governor Lord Charles Somerset granted a 112-hectare farm on the slopes of the Zilvermyn mountain - appropriately, the farm was named \"Zilvermyn\". In 1818, Somerset granted the 1528-hectare \"Visch Hoek\" property as a farm, on condition that the owner was not allowed to sell liquor. When Visch Hoek was subdivided in 1827, the 454-hectare portion north of the Zilvermyn river became a separate farm named \"Klein Tuin\" ('small garden').\n\nLater, a farm named \"Brakkloof\" (or \"Brakke Kloof\") was granted between Visch Hoek and Poespaskraal.\n\nFarm names were changed from time to time. Slangkop also became known as 'Imhoff's Gift', De Goede Hoop as 'Noordhoek', and Poespaskraal as 'Sunnydale'.\n\nIn 1855, a divisional council (comparable to a county council in England) was established to administer the Cape Division, i.e. the rural areas surrounding Cape Town. It administered the valley for the following 131 years, except during the years 1879 to 1888, when the Simon's Town magisterial district was a division with its own divisional council. \n\nAnother farm was created in the late 1850s, when Slangkop / Imhoff's Gift was subdivided and the south-eastern portion became \"Ocean View\".\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the south peninsula was well established. The railway line was extended from the seaside town of Kalk Bay through Visch Hoek to Simon's Town in 1890. When Kalk Bay was proclaimed a municipality in 1895, the farm Klein Tuin was included within its boundaries.\n\n20th century\n\nLike the rest of the colony, the Simon's Town district was under martial law during 1901 and 1902, because of the Anglo-Boer War, the invasion of the British of the Boer countries to the North. The Transvaal and Free State.\n\nThe first townships were established in the valley towards the end of the war. Kommetje Estates Ltd bought Slangkop farm in 1900 and established a seaside village named Kommetje. At the other end of the valley, G.W. MacIntyre bought Klein Tuin in 1902, renamed it 'Mayville', and established a small seaside suburb (which was later renamed 'Clovelly'). \n\nParliament approved the construction of a branch railway line from Visch Hoek to Kommetje, but it was never built. Eventually, ten years later, in 1913, the divisional council built Kommetje Road (now route M65), leading from Visch Hoek across the southern side of the valley, to Kommetje.\n\nThe Kalk Bay municipality, including Mayville (Clovelly), was incorporated into the City of Cape Town in 1913, but the rest of the valley remained under the divisional council.\n\nDuring World War I, the Simon's Town district was under martial law to protect the naval base, and travel through the valley was hampered by military roadblocks. The German navy cruiser \"Möwe\" was seen in Chapman's Bay, off Slangkop, in 1916.\n\nTwo more townships were developed after the war. Visch Hoek (or 'Fish Hoek') farm was subdivided into a township in 1918, and grew rapidly. A local board was established in 1921, and a village management board in 1927. The prohibition against the sale of liquor imposed a century earlier still held good, and the town became well known for being the only 'dry' town in the country.\n\nPart of Noordhoek was subdivided for residential development in 1920. Access to the western end of the valley was improved when the divisional council opened Chapman's Peak Drive (now part of route M6) in 1922, as part of a scenic motor route around the Peninsula. \n\nCape Estates Ltd bought the undeveloped part of Mayville in 1922, and established the Clovelly Country Club.\n\nFish Hoek was proclaimed a municipality in 1940.\n\nGerman submarines were active in Cape waters during World War II. A military radar station was established on Slangkop, to monitor the ocean, and a small military camp named 'Cobra' was opened to house the personnel. Two German anti-ship mines washed up at Kommetjie — the navy dismantled one and detonated the other.\n\nAfter the war, most of Sunnydale farm was subdivided into a residential township.\n\nThe divisional council undertook considerable development in the valley during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s, it developed a White residential township, named Sun Valley, on Brakkloof farm., and a Coloured township on Ocean View farm, to accommodate the communities which the government had forced to move out of Fish Hoek, Sunnydale, and Simon's Town under its apartheid system. In 1968, the council opened the 'Ou Kaapse Weg' ('Old Cape Road') (now route M64), leading from Sunnydale over the Silvermine mountain to Tokai. \n\nIn the 1970s, the council opened Soetwater caravan park (for Coloured holidaymakers), and Imhoff caravan park (for Whites) near Kommetjie. Wildevoëlvlei sewage works were opened in 1977\n\nPart of Sunnydale was developed into a residential township named \"Capri Village\".\n\nThe divisional council was absorbed into the Western Cape Regional Services Council in 1986. \n\nIn 1986, the Black residents of Dassenberg were forcibly evicted under the apartheid laws and re-settled at Khayalitsha. They were allowed to return to the valley in 1989, and a new settlement was established for them on part of Sunnydale — it was later named Masiphumelele ('we will succeed'). Apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nIn 1996, the valley was incorporated into the new South Peninsula Municipality, and Fish Hoek's municipality was dissolved. Four years later, the South Peninsula Municipality was incorporated into the City of Cape Town, which now administers the valley.\n\n1725 : A pirate ship anchored in Visch Hoek bay — Dutch East India Company troops were sent to the valley to prevent the pirates scouring the countryside for food and drink.\n\n1795 : British military forces invaded the colony.

{"id": "95388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95388", "title": "Frisia", "text": "Frisia\n\nFrisia (, Dutch and ) is a coastal region along the southeastern corner of the North Sea in what today is mostly a large part of the Netherlands, including modern Friesland and smaller parts of northern Germany. Frisia is the traditional homeland of the Frisians, a Germanic people that speaks Frisian languages, which together with English and Scots form the Anglo-Frisian language group.\n\nThe names for Frisia in the local languages are:\nWhen the French occupied the Netherlands, the name for the Frisian department was . In English, both terms, Frisia and Friesland are used.\n\nFrisia is commonly divided into three sections:\n\n\nThe three groups of the Frisian Islands (the West, East and North Frisian Islands) stretch more or less correspondingly along these three sections of the German Bight coast.\n\nWest Frisia corresponds roughly to the Dutch province of Friesland (\"Fryslân\"), the northern part of North Holland province (the historical region of West Friesland, the westernmost portion of the traditional region of West Frisia), and also modern Groningen province, though the Western Frisian language is only spoken in Friesland proper. Dialects with strong West Frisian substrates, including Low German and Low Franconian, are also spoken in West Frisia. In the northern province of Groningen, people speak Gronings, a Low Saxon dialect with a strong Frisian substrate. Rural Groningen was originally part of the Frisian lands \"east of River Lauwers\" and by law and language closer linked to East Frisia than to the west.\n\nEast Frisia includes areas located in the northwest of the German state of Lower Saxony, including the districts of Aurich, Leer, Wittmund and Friesland, as well as the urban districts of Emden and Wilhelmshaven, the Saterland, the Land Wursten and former Rüstringen (\"Butjadingen peninsula\"). East Frisia is also the name of a historical county in that region. Only people from that area consider themselves as East Frisians. The German name \"Ostfriesland\" distinguishes the former county from \"Ost-Friesland\", which means the whole eastern Frisian area.\n\nThe portions of North Frisia within the German state of Schleswig-Holstein are part of the district of Nordfriesland and stretch along the coast, including the coastal islands from the Eider River to the border of Denmark in the north. The North Sea island of Heligoland, while not part of the Nordfriesland district, is also part of traditional North Frisia. North Frisia was until the Second Schleswig War 1864 part of Denmark or the Danish Duchy of Schleswig. \n\nA half-million Frisians in the province of Friesland in the Netherlands speak West Frisian. Several thousand people in Nordfriesland and Heligoland in Germany speak a collection of North Frisian dialects that are often unintelligible to each other. A small number of Saterland Frisian language speakers live in four villages in Lower Saxony, in the Saterland region of Cloppenburg county, just beyond the boundaries of traditional East Frisia. Many Frisians speak Low Saxon dialects known as Friso-Saxon, especially in East Frisia, where the local dialects are called \"Oostfreesk\" ('East Frisian') or East Frisian Low Saxon. In the Province of Friesland and North Frisia there are also areas where Friso-Saxon dialects are predominantly spoken, such as Gronings. In West Frisia, there are West Frisian-influenced dialects of Dutch such as West Frisian Dutch and Stadsfries.\n\nFrisia has changed dramatically over time, both through floods and through a change in identity. It is part of the supposed Nordwestblock which is a hypothetical historic region linked by language and culture.\n\nThe people, later to be known as Frisii, began settling in Frisia in the 6th century BC. According to Pliny the Elder, in Roman times, the Frisians (or rather their close neighbours, the Chauci) lived on terps, man-made hills. According to other sources, the Frisians lived along a broader expanse of the North Sea (or \"Frisian Sea\") coast.\n\nFrisia at this time comprised the present provinces of Friesland and parts of North Holland and Utrecht.\n\nFrisian presence during the Early Middle Ages has been documented from North-Western Flanders up to the Weser River Estuary. According to archaeological evidence, these Frisians were not the Frisians of Roman times, but the descendants of Anglo-Saxon immigrants from the German Bight, arriving during the Great Migration. By the 8th century, ethnic Frisians also started to colonize the coastal areas North of the Eider River under Danish rule. The nascent Frisian languages were spoken all along the southern North Sea coast. \nToday, the whole region is sometimes referred to as Greater Frisia or \"Frisia Magna\".\n\nDistant authors seem to have made little distinction between Frisians and Saxons. The Byzantine Procopius described three peoples living in Great Britain: Angles, Frisians and Britons, and the Danish author of \"Knútsdrápa\" celebrating the 11th-century Canute the Great used \"Frisians\" as a synonym of \"English\". The historian and sociologist George Homans has made a case for Frisian cultural domination in East Anglia since the 5th century, pointing to distinct land-holdings arrangements in carucates (these forming vills assembled in leets), partible inheritance patterns of common lands held in by kin, resistance to manorialization and other social institutions. Some East Anglian sources called the mainland inhabitants Warnii, rather than Frisians.\n\nDuring the 7th and 8th centuries, Frankish chronologies mention the northern Low Countries as the kingdom of the Frisians. According to Medieval legends, this kingdom comprised the coastal \"seelande\" provinces of the Netherlands, from the Scheldt River to the Weser River and further East. Archaeological research does not confirm this idea, as the petty kingdoms appear to have been rather small and short-lived.\n\nThe earliest Frisian records name four social classes, the \"ethelings\" (\"nobiles\" in Latin documents) and \"frilings\", who together made up the \"Free Frisians\" who might bring suit at court, and the \"laten\" or \"liten\" with the slaves, who were absorbed into the \"laten\" during the Early Middle Ages, as slavery was not so much formally abolished, as evaporated. The \"laten\" were tenants of lands they did not own and might be tied to it in the manner of serfs, but in later times might buy their freedom.\n\nThe basic land-holding unit for assessment of taxes and military contributions was - according to Homans - the \"ploegg\" (cf. \"plow\") or \"teen\" (cf. tithing, cf. \"hundred\"), which, however, also passed under other local names. The \"teen\" was pledged to supply ten men for the \"heer\", or army. \"Ploegg\" or \"teen\" formed a unit of which the members were collectively responsible for the performance of any of the men. The \"ploegg\" or East Frisian \"rott\" was a compact holding that originated with a single lineage or kinship, whose men in early times went to war under their chief, and devolved in medieval times into a union of neighbors rather than kith and kin. Several, often three, \"ploeggs\" were grouped into a \"burar\", whose members controlled and adjudicated the uses of pasturage (but not tillage) which the \"ploeggs\" held in common, and came to be in charge of roads, ditches and dikes. Twelve \"ploeggs\" made up a \"long\" hundred, responsible for supplying a hundred armed men, four of which made a \"go\" (cf. \"Gau\"). Homans' ideas, which were largely based on studies now considered to be outdated, have not been followed up by Continental scolars.\nThe 7th-century Frisian realm (650-734) under the kings Aldegisel and Redbad, had its centre of power in the city of Utrecht. Its ancient customary law was drawn up as the \"Lex Frisionum\" in the late eighth century. Its end came in 734 at the Battle of the Boarn, when the Frisians were defeated by the Franks, who then conquered the western part up to the Lauwers. Frankish troops conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, after Charlemagne defeated the Saxon leader Widukind. The Carolingians laid Frisia under the rule of \"grewan\", a title that has been loosely related to count in its early sense of \"governor\" rather than \"feudal overlord\".\n\nDuring the 7th to 10th centuries, Frisian merchants and skippers played an important part in the international luxury trade, establishing commercial districts in distant cities as Sigtuna, Hedeby, Ribe, York, London, Duisburg, Cologne, Mainz, and Worms.\n\nThe Frisian coastal areas were partly occupied by Danish Vikings in the 840s, until these were expelled between 885 and 920. Recently, it been suggested that the Vikings did not conquer Frisia, but settled peacefully in certain districts (such as the islands of Walcheren and Wieringen), where they built simple forts and cooperated and traded with the native Frisians. One of their leaders was Rorik of Dorestad.\n\nDuring the 12th century Frisian noblemen and the city of Groningen founded the Upstalsboom League under the slogan of 'Frisian freedom' to counter feudalizing tendencies. The league consisted of modern Friesland, Groningen, East Frisia, Harlingerland, Jever and Rüstringen. The Frisian districts in West Friesland West of the Zuiderzee did not participate, neither did the districts North of the Eider River along the Danish North Sea coast (Schleswig-Holstein). Former were occupied by the count of Holland in 1289, the latter were governed by the Duke of Schleswig and the king of Denmark. The same holds true for the district of Land Wursten East of the Weser River. The Upstalsboom League was revived in the early 14th century, but it collapsed after 1337. By then the non-Frisian city of Groningen took the lead of the independent coastal districts.\n\nThe 15th century saw the demise of Frisian republicanism. In East Frisia a leading nobleman from the Cirksena-family managed to defeat his competitors with the help of the Hanseatic League. In 1464 he acquired the title of count of East Frisia. The king of Denmark was successful in subduing the coastal districts North of the Eider River. The Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen remained independent until 1498. By then Friesland was conquered by Duke Albert of Saxony-Meissen. The city of Groningen, which had started to dominate the surrounding rural districts, surrendered to count Edzard of East Frisia in 1506. The city conveyed its remaining privileges to the Habsburg Empire in 1536. The district of Butjadingen (formerly Rüstringen) was occupied by the Count of Oldenburg in 1514, the Land Wursten by the Prince-bishop of Bremen in 1525.\n\nIn the early 16th century, the pirate Pier Gerlofs Donia (Grutte Pier) challenged Saxon authority in Friesland during a prolonged guerrilla war, backed by the Duke of Guelders. He had several successes and was feared by Holland authorities, but he died as a farmer in 1520. According to the legend he was seven feet tall. A statue dedicated to him has recently been installed in Kimswert.\n\nIn the 1560s many Frisans joined the revolt led by William of Orange against the Habsburg monarchy. In 1577 the province of Friesland became part of the nascent Dutch Republic, as its representatives signed the Union of Utrecht. The city of Groningen was conquered by the Dutch in 1594. Since then, membership of the Dutch Republic was perceived as a guarantee for the preservation of civil liberties. Actual power, however, was usurped by the landowning gentry. Protests against aristocratic rule led to a democratic movement in the 1780s.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th century, 'Frisian freedom' became the slogan of a regionalist movement in Friesland, demanding equal rights for the Frisian language and culture within the Netherlands. The West Frisian language and its urban dialects are spoken by the majority of the inhabitants. In East Frisia, the idea of \"Frisian freedom\" became entangled with regional sentiments as well, though the East Frisian language had been replaced by Low German dialects as early as the 15th century. In Groningen, on the other hand, Frisian sentiments faded away at the end of the 16th century. In North Frisia regional sentiments concentrate around the surviving North Frisian dialects, which are spoken by a sizeable minority of the population, though Lower German is far more widespread.\n\n\nAlthough the Frisian regions have their own separate flags, Frisia as a whole has not historically had a flag of its own. A flag for a united Frisia, known as the \"Interfrisian Flag\", was launched in September 2006 by the Groep fan Auwerk (English: \"Group of Aurich\"). This separatist group supports a united Frisia as a recognized country. The design was inspired by the Nordic Cross flag. The four \"pompeblêden\" (water lily leaves) represent the contemporary variety of the Frisian regions—North, South, West and East.\n\nThis flag was not accepted by the Interfrisian Council. But the council adopted the idea of an interfrisian flag and created an own design, containing elements of flags of the councils's three sections. Neither flag is in wide use.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44310", "title": "Gallura", "text": "Gallura\n\nGallura is a region in the northeast of the island of Sardinia, Italy.\n\nThe name \"Gallùra\" ( , ) is allegedly supposed to mean \"stony area\".\n\nGallùra has a surface of and it is situated between 40°55'20\"64 latitude north and 09°29'11\"76 east longitude. It is 187 kilometers from the Italian peninsula and 11 kilometers from the French island of Corsica.\nThe coast of Gallura is very jagged and continues along in a continuous series of small fiords, rock-cliffs and little islands that form the archipelago of La Maddalena, a natural bridge towards nearby Corsica.\nThe landscape is characterised by granite rocks and harsh mountains that, even if not particularly high, have constituted for millennia a barrier between this region and the nearby territories of Baronie and Montalbo. Monte Limbara is the highest mountain (1,362 m/4,469 ft). It represents the boundary between Gallura and the nearby region called Logudoro. Its highest peak is Punta Balestrieri (1362 m above the sea level). In the past, Monte Limbara used to be the location of an important NATO long range radar base and a Carabinieri’s barrack. Today it is used as a telecommunications center for the Italian Air Force and a heliport for the Servizio Antincendi. It is also the location of all the major TV relay stations of West Sardinia. Another small mountain is Monte Cruzitta (666 m). Even if it is not very high, it offers a very characteristic landscape.\nThe climate is typical of the Mediterranean. The weather is clear. During the year approximately 300 days are sunny and the few others are rainy, with a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn, some heavy showers in the spring, and snowfalls on the highest massifs and highlands. The mistral is the dominant wind, fresh, strong, and usually dry and cold, blowing from the northwest throughout the year, but most frequently in winter and spring.\n\nThe first human settlements in Gallura date back to 700.000 years ago, when the first populations crossed the strait between Tuscany and Sardinia. This historic period is known as the Stone Age.\nForeign populations colonize Gallura due to its numerous natural resources. Many people from the nearby island of Corsica came as well to Gallura during this historic period. The mid-late neolithic Arzachena culture subsisted almost exclusively in this area, and here is found the remains of perhaps the oldest megalith on Sardinia, at Li Muri.\n\nThe historic period that goes from 1700 BC to the Roman Age is also known in Sardinia as the Nuragic Age. The particular name of this historic period takes after the Nuraghes, the biggest megalithic edifices ever found in Europe, which still today represent a symbol for Sardinia.\nThe Phoenicians founded the (hence Punic) city of Olbia (renamed in Greek, though), which was conquered by the Romans with all of Gallura in 238 BC.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Gallura was one of the four \"giudicati\", the four autonomous states into which Sardinia was divided under pope Alexander's assent. \nCivita (which today is known as Olbia) was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura and the (first) bishop's see.\nThe Giudicato of Gallura included today's area of Gallura, the area surrounding the city of Nuoro, and the area called Baronie. It was occupied by the republic of Pisa in 1288 after the fall of the last ruling judge Nino Visconti.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century, the city of Civita (today's Olbia) takes the name of Terranova, a new settlement founded by the pisans near the site of the ancient Roman port of Olbia.\nPirates – primarily from North Africa – raided the coasts of Gallura and people moved consequently from there to the hinterland. The city of Tempio became especially populated.\nBetween 1300 and 1800 there was a big emigration of people from the nearby island of Corsica to Gallura. Corsicans deeply influenced the language and the culture of Gallura, which still today is considered quite different from the culture and the dialects of the rest of Sardinia.\n\nBy the end of the 1700s people started to move from the hinterland to the coasts.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century the bishop's see was transferred from the city of Olbia to the city of Tempio, which also became a district's capital.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism increased greatly, especially in the areas of Costa Smeralda, Santa Teresa di Gallura and San Teodoro.\nToday, Gallura has the highest capital income in all of Sardinia.\n\nThe region's original Roman bishopric, the Diocese of Fausania (P(h)ausania), founded no later than the 5th century (tradition says by the 3rd century saint Simplicius), of disputed location (Olbia, Tempio Pausania or Posano) perished under Byzantine rule, probably in the 8th century.\n\nIt was restored under the name of Gallura in 1070, renamed Civita after its see (the medieval name of Olbia) and from 1506 held in personal union with the Diocese of Ampurias, but no later than the 12th century a second bishopric was established, the Diocese of Galtelli.\n\nGallura has a population of 143,921 people. The population density has remarkably increased in small centers along the eastern coast and in the cities of Arzachena and Olbia. The population density of 12 municipalities out of 26 has however decreased (-4%) in centers located in the country -side and on the mountains. This tendency depends on the increase of the seaside tourism.\n\nIn general, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the lowest fertility rate (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second lowest birth rate. These factors result positive towards the preservation of the natural environment.\n\nOlbia (medieval Civita) is a town of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. It represents the city with the highest population density of the entire Gallura. In 2005 it became an administrative capital together with Tempio-Pausania. They form the province called Olbia-Tempio.\nFounded in 350 BC, it used to be one of the most important trade areas of the Mediterranean Sea.\nToday, it represents the economic center of Sardinia due to its airport, its seaport and also to its closeness to the famous Costa Smeralda tourist area.\n\nTempio Pausania is a town of 13,800 inhabitants. Together with Olbia, it is the administrative capital of the province Olbia-Tempio.\nFounded around 250 BC, Tempio Pausania is located 560m above the sea level. It represents both the geographical and the cultural capital of Gallura. Every year, thousands of tourists come to visit Tempio Pausania to assist to the characteristic carnevale (carnival), which takes place at the end of February.\n\nArzachena is a town of 12,080 inhabitants. \nIt represents the administrative capital of the Costa Smeralda tourist area. Founded in 1961 by the prince Karim Aga Khan, Costa Smeralda represents the most exclusive tourist area of Gallura.\nArzachena is also famous for its archeology. Its archeological sites include the LiMuri Tomba dei Giganti (Giants’ Grave).\n\nLa Maddalena is part of an archipelago called Arcipelago della Maddalena. It is situated in the Straits of Bonifacio, which divide Sardinia from Corsica. La Maddalena represents the largest town of this archipelago, which includes the islands of Caprera, S. Stefano, Spargi, Budelli, S. Maria and Razzoli. La Maddalena represents an important tourist site in Gallura and the island of Caprera is famous for being the residence of the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\nThe economy of Gallura is based mostly on tourism and hospitality due to the presence of Costa Smeralda and other world-famous sea sites.\nThe primary sector is not as important as in the rest of Sardinia. It is based mostly on wine production. Also sheep breeding, dairy production, and poultry farm are relevant.\nThe secondary sector is quite important. It is mostly based on cork work and mineral processing of granite. In fact, it is easy to find cork oaks in many parts of the region and the whole area is rich in granite, especially in vicinity of Monte Limbara. Cork production is one of the main economic activity in the interior, while on the coasts are developed fish factories and shipyards.\n\nGallura has one international airport (Olbia-Costa Smeralda Airport), which is situated in the city of Olbia. It represents one of the three international airports of Sardinia and the base of the Sardinian airline Meridiana, Italy's third-largest airline.\n\nAnother way to reach the region of Gallura is by ferry. The ferry companies operating on the Island are Tirrenia di Navigazione, Moby Lines, Corsica Ferry, Grandi Navi Veloci, Snav, SNCM and CMN. They link the harbors of Olbia, Golfo Aranci, Santa Teresa di Gallura and Palau to the harbors of the Italian peninsula, France, Corsica and Spain.\n\nThe native language of the area is Gallurese, which is also recognized by the Regional Government of Sardinia. Gallurese is usually not considered a dialect of Sardinian, since it is quite different from most of the other Sardinian dialects, but rather as a direct offshoot from Corsican. Luras and Padru, two small towns in the province of Olbia-Tempio, are the only areas in Gallura in which Gallurese is not traditionally spoken. Sardinian is also spoken in its Logudorese variety.\n\nWith 1,213,250 hectares of woods, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the largest forest extension. Regional landscape plans regulate building activities along the coasts, the forests, and other natural sites.\n\n\nSardinia has ten regional parks and three national parks. One of these three national parks is located in Gallura, i.e., the Archipelago of La Maddalena's National Park. This park is a world-famous tourist area due to the beauty of its beaches and to the one of its landscape, where granite rocks alternate with green areas.\n\nRenewable energies have increased impressively during the recent years in Sardinia. Due to the windy climate, the most important renewable energy in Gallura is the wind power. During the past years however, the installation of wind power systems has been the subject of controversial debates due to its landscape impact.\n\n"}

{"id": "38764748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38764748", "title": "Holy Basin", "text": "Holy Basin\n\nHoly Basin (Hebrew: האגן הקדוש, \"ha'agan ha'kadosh\", or Historic Basin, Hebrew: האגן ההיסטורי, \"ha'agan ha'histori\" ) is a modern Israeli term for a geographical area in Jerusalem that includes the Old City and its adjacent territories. The term was coined by the contemporary Israeli generation while a political-academic discourse on how does one refers to the area in Jerusalem where the historical and holy sites are concentrated. The term is being used in the field of geographical research and in contemporary geo-political studies specializing in urban planning, such as local master plans for Jerusalem and studies concerning the political future of the city.\n\nThe Holy Basin, in effect – Jerusalem, a concentrated geographical area of thousands of years of history and hundreds of holy places – some common to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and some are unique to one of the three religions. Isaac Tischler maintains that David Ben-Gurion argued that \"Jerusalem is not Shuafat, Beit Hanina or Sur Baher, nor Abu Dis, but rather the Holy Basin – the Temple Mount and the Old City\". He added that the suggestion of Ben-Gurion to destroy the old city walls after the unification of the city intended to erase the boundary between the Holy Basin and the new city.\n\nIn a comprehensive study on the holy basin, Professor Ruth Lapidoth starts with an example out of the first speech, in the First Knesset, by the poet Uri Zvi Grinberg. In this speech, in which the poet dedicated to \"Divided Jerusalem\" and the Jewish yearning to the Old City across the border, he emphasized that the name \"Jerusalem\" is directed only to the Jerusalem that is within the walls of Jerusalem, \"where Temple Mount lies\", and all that was built in the modern era – beyond the holy basin, is no more than \"fecundation of Jerusalem. \"\n\nAreas of the Holy Basin area are not clearly defined and region boundaries are not agreed upon by all geographers engaged in the study of Jerusalem. A limited version sees the old city surrounded by the Walls of Jerusalem as the Holy Basin. A more expanded version sees Mount of Olives, Mount Zion and the City of David also as part of the Holy Basin.\n\nIn a study conducted for the Research Institute of Jerusalem, the researchers Kobi Michael and Dr Moshe Hirsch drew the precise boundaries of the basin as follows:\n\nCore region: westerly − along the old city walls up to the southwestern corner. southerly − along the channel of Gehenna, through the south of the wall surrounding the monastery of Akeldama. From there, to the north to the eastern wall of Gallicantu Peter's Church. From there, to the southern wall of the Old City up to the Southern Wall excavations (Ophel Garden). From there, to the Valley of Josaphat up to the Ras al-Amud road – including the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.\n\nEasterly – along the Jewish burial plots on Mount of Olives up to the section of the wall of the Russian Church Chapel of the Ascension, up to Al Makassed Hospital, through the wall of Viri Galilaei church. Northerly – from Viri galilaei church, to the northeast corner of the city walls of the Old City, and along the wall up to the Schmidt school compound, and along the wall up to its corner in Jaffa Road. Over all, a sum total of 2,012 acres.\n\nAccording to the Research Institute of Jerusalem, in late 2003, 35,400 residents lived in the Old City, and in the entire Holy Basin around 40,000. 73% of the residents in the old city were Muslims, 18% Christians, and 9%\nwere Jews.\n\nOut of 900 acres where the old town is situated, about 210 acres owned by the Waqf (24%) (mostly on the Temple Mount, an area of approximately 144 acres); About 270 acres owned by the Christian Churches and monasteries (30%); 250 acres of Arab private land ownership (28%), and about 170 acres owned by the state (18%).\n\nOut of 6,000 families who live in the Old City, 68% are Muslim, 24% Christian, and 8% are Jewish.\n\nAbout half the lands of the Old City are being used for residence, 280 acres are being used for religious and educational institutions, and 80 acres for trade. Archaeological sites stretch over 50 acres, and there are also 40 acres that are not being used.\n\nThe Holy Basin is not only the center of Jerusalem, but also in the center of the Arab–Israeli conflict, and any negligible controversy may turn into an international incident. The latest example for such incident was the uproar against the Rescue excavations at the Mughrabi Gate in early 2007, an event that joins a series of events, some of which included casualties.\n\nIn 2006, the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, headed by Ruth Lapidot, conducted a research on alternatives to the sovereignty over the Holy Basin. According to this study there are five solutions to the Holy Basin:\n\n\nThe researchers Kobi Michael and Dr Moshe Hirsch presented a study in which the option that is most applicable is rather the model based on West Berlin – an area managed as an autonomous entity under international supervision – agreed upon all parties.\n"}

It was earlier a part of the village development committee in Kaski District, a region in northern-central Nepal.\n\nKaskikot is located in Annapurna Massif, north of Fewa Lake at a distance of 12 kilometers west of Pokhara after Sarangkot. It is on the trekking route to the Annapurna region. A mountainside ridge at an altitude of 1,788 meters, Kaskikot provides panoramic Himalayan views. On the northern side of Kaskikot, Dhawalagiri can be seen in the far west. The Annapurna mountain range is clearly visible on the same side. To the east, the village overlooks the city of Pokhara across Fewa Lake.\n\nKaskikot shares its territory with Sarangkot, Chapakot, Dhikurpokhari, and Hemja.\n\nBefore the unification of Nepal, there were 24 small principalities in west Nepal, one of which was Kaski. \n\nThe ruins of the old palace of the rulers of Kaski still exist in the ward. The historical kingdom was an early homeland of the Shah dynasty. Kulmandan Shah was one of the rulers who established his kingdom in west Nepal. His descendant Drabya Shah was the first to establish Gorkha, the source of the legendary Gorkha warriors. \n\nDuring Dashain holidays, various cultural events can be witnessed. Kaskikot Kalika Temple lies in the historical palace located at the top of the hill (1700 meters). During Nava Durga, Dashain and Chaitra Dashain, Kaski Guthi Sanstha organizes worship to goddess Durga Bhawani. Many people gather in Kaskikot Temple during Dashain Fulpati and Chaitra Dashain.\n\nAt the time of the 1991 Nepal census, Kaskikot had a population of 6,075 people residing in 1,185 individual households. According to the census of 2011, the population has decreased to 5,892 people residing in 1,508 households. Most inhabitants depend on agriculture and are members of the Brahmin, Chhetri, Thakuri, Magar and Dalit castes.\n\nWith the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri Himalayas clearly visible to the north, Kaskikot is a tourist destination. There are hotels and guest houses in Deurali and Mala, Nepal. A milk collection center is located in Guntechour, which supplies milk to Pokhara. There are also small industries like poultry farming and handicrafts. General stores provide necessary goods like oil, sugar, and salts to the community.\n\nKaskikot Women's Financial Organization, founded by Krishna Paudel, has around 1000 members. The Kalika Community Development Organization, located in Guntechour, engages in the development of the village. Numerous organizations and Youths Clubs also organize different cultural and development work around the village.\n\nThere are primary schools in every ward. Kalika Higher Secondary School, located at Mandredhunga is the only Higher education institution teaching up to Class 12. The other Siddha Bahara Lower Secondary School goes up to Class 8. There is also a private school, namely Shree Bishwajyoti English Boarding School, that goes up to Class 8.\n\nThere is a general health post equipped with primary medicine, which operates a monthly health camp around the village. A few health sub-posts provide free treatment and vaccination to children.\n\nKaskikot is connected by bus routes. Apart from buses, local agricultural transport jeeps also provide a semi-reliable transport service. There are four rough motor roads connecting Kaskikot. A major road connects Kaskikot to Pokhara and Sarangkot. The other road goes from the beach of Fewa Lake, next to the midway of the hill to Guntechour connecting Naudanda [krishi sadak].\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17616", "title": "Latitude", "text": "Latitude\n\nIn geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or \"parallels\", run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the \"geodetic latitude\" as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or \"normal\") to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six \"auxiliary latitudes\" which are used in special applications.\n\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \"actual\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.\n\nSince there are many different reference ellipsoids, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that \"without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst\". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.\n\nIn English texts the latitude angle, defined below, is usually denoted by the Greek lower-case letter phi ( or ). It is measured in degrees, minutes and seconds or decimal degrees, north or south of the equator.\nThe precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up theodolites or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the figure of the Earth together with its gravitational field is the science of geodesy.\nThis article relates to coordinate systems for the Earth: it may be extended to cover the Moon, planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature.\n\nThe graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the poles where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the meridians; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the Prime Meridian) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the Equator. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0°, the North Pole has a latitude of 90° North (written 90° N or +90°), and the South Pole has a latitude of 90° South (written 90° S or −90°). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal to the surface of the sphere is along the radius vector.\n\nThe latitude, as defined in this way for the sphere, is often termed the spherical latitude, to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article.\n\nBesides the equator, four other parallels are of significance:\nThe plane of the Earth's orbit about the Sun is called the ecliptic, and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the Earth is the equatorial plane. The angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt, the obliquity, or the inclination of the ecliptic, and it is conventionally denoted by . The latitude of the tropical circles is equal to and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90° - \"i\"). The axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current epoch. The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on axial tilt.\n\nThe figure shows the geometry of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December solstice when the Sun is overhead at some point of the Tropic of Capricorn. The south polar latitudes below the Antarctic Circle are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two tropics is it possible for the Sun to be directly overhead (at the zenith).\n\nOn map projections there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used Mercator projection and the Transverse Mercator projection. On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.\nOn the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude () is\ntherefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the meridian distance is denoted by then\nwhere denotes the mean radius of the Earth. is equal to . No higher accuracy is appropriate for since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is (60.0 nautical miles). The length of 1 minute of latitude is (1.00 nautical miles), while the length of 1 second of latitude is (see nautical mile).\n\nIn 1687 Isaac Newton published the \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid. (This article uses the term \"ellipsoid\" in preference to the older term \"spheroid\".) Newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century. (See Meridian arc.) An oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis (minor axis). \"Oblate ellipsoid of revolution\" is abbreviated to 'ellipsoid' in the remainder of this article. (Ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial.)\n\nMany different reference ellipsoids have been used in the history of geodesy. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of GPS, it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as WGS84) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.\n\nThe shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the ellipse which is rotated about its minor (shorter) axis. Two parameters are required. One is invariably the equatorial radius, which is the semi-major axis, . The other parameter is usually (1) the polar radius or semi-minor axis, ; or (2) the (first) flattening, ; or (3) the eccentricity, . These parameters are not independent: they are related by\n\nMany other parameters (see ellipse, ellipsoid) appear in the study of geodesy, geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set , , and . Both and are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations; they are of the order and 0.08 respectively. Values for a number of ellipsoids are given in Figure of the Earth. Reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the \"inverse\" flattening, . For example, the defining values for the WGS84 ellipsoid, used by all GPS devices, are\nfrom which are derived\nThe difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening; on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels. This would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere, so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening.\n\nThe graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing:\n\n\nThe importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example. On the reference ellipsoid for WGS84, the centre of the Eiffel Tower has a geodetic latitude of 48° 51′ 29″ N, or 48.8583° N and longitude of 2° 17′ 40″ E or 2.2944°E. The same coordinates on the datum ED50 define a point on the ground which is distant from the tower. A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified.\n\nIn Meridian arc and standard texts it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude to the equator is given by ( in radians)\n\nwhere is the meridional radius of curvature.\n\nThe distance from the equator to the pole is\n\nFor WGS84 this distance is .\n\nThe evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection. It can be evaluated by expanding the integral by the binomial series and integrating term by term: see Meridian arc for details. The length of the meridian arc between two given latitudes is given by replacing the limits of the integral by the latitudes concerned. The length of a \"small\" meridian arc is given by\n\nWhen the latitude difference is 1 degree, corresponding to radians, the arc distance is about\n\nThe distance in metres (correct to 0.01 metre) between latitudes formula_7 − 0.5 degrees and formula_7 + 0.5 degrees on the WGS84 spheroid is\n\nThe variation of this distance with latitude (on WGS84) is shown in the table along with the length of a degree of longitude (east-west distance):\n\nA calculator for any latitude is provided by the U.S. Government's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).\n\nThe following graph illustrates the variation of both a degree of latitude and a degree of longitude with latitude.\n\nHistorically a nautical mile was defined as the length of one minute of arc along a meridian of a spherical earth. An ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude. This was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metres. However for all practical purposes distances are measured from the latitude scale of charts. As the Royal Yachting Association says in its manual for day skippers: \"1 (minute) of Latitude = 1 sea mile\", followed by \"For most practical purposes distance is measured from the latitude scale, assuming that one minute of latitude equals one nautical mile\".\n\nThere are six auxiliary latitudes that have applications to special problems in geodesy, geophysics and the theory of map projections:\nThe definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes, like the geodetic latitude, can be extended to define a three-dimensional geographic coordinate system as discussed below. The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used \"only\" as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude, the semi-major axis, , and the eccentricity, . (For inverses see below.) The forms given are, apart from notational variants, those in the standard reference for map projections, namely \"Map projections: a working manual\" by J. P. Snyder. Derivations of these expressions may be found in Adams and online publications by Osborne and Rapp.\n\nThe geocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the centre to a point on the surface. The relation between the geocentric latitude () and the geodetic latitude () is derived in the above references as\n\nThe geodetic and geocentric latitudes are equal at the equator and at the poles but at other latitudes they differ by a few minutes of arc. Taking the value of the squared eccentricity as 0.0067 (it depends on the choice of ellipsoid) the maximum difference of formula_12 may be shown to be about 11.5 minutes of arc at a geodetic latitude of approximately 45° 6′.\n\nThe parametric or reduced latitude, , is defined by the radius drawn from the centre of the ellipsoid to that point on the surrounding sphere (of radius ) which is the projection parallel to the Earth's axis of a point on the ellipsoid at latitude . It was introduced by Legendre and Bessel who solved problems for geodesics on the ellipsoid by transforming them to an equivalent problem for spherical geodesics by using this smaller latitude. Bessel's notation, , is also used in the current literature. The parametric latitude is related to the geodetic latitude by:\nThe alternative name arises from the parameterization of the equation of the ellipse describing a meridian section. In terms of Cartesian coordinates , the distance from the minor axis, and , the distance above the equatorial plane, the equation of the ellipse is:\nThe Cartesian coordinates of the point are parameterized by\nCayley suggested the term \"parametric latitude\" because of the form of these equations.\n\nThe parametric latitude is not used in the theory of map projections. Its most important application is in the theory of ellipsoid geodesics, (Vincenty, Karney).\n\nThe rectifying latitude, , is the meridian distance scaled so that its value at the poles is equal to 90 degrees or radians:\nwhere the meridian distance from the equator to a latitude is (see Meridian arc)\nand the length of the meridian quadrant from the equator to the pole (the polar distance) is\nUsing the rectifying latitude to define a latitude on a sphere of radius\ndefines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale. The sphere may then be projected to the plane with an equirectangular projection to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale. An example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the Equidistant conic projection. (Snyder, Section 16). The rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the Transverse Mercator projection.\n\nThe authalic (Greek for same area) latitude, , gives an area-preserving transformation to a sphere.\nwhere\nand\nand the radius of the sphere is taken as\nAn example of the use of the authalic latitude is the Albers equal-area conic projection.\n\nThe conformal latitude, , gives an angle-preserving (conformal) transformation to the sphere.\nwhere is the Gudermannian function. (See also Mercator projection.)\nThe conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of \"arbitrary\" radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of \"small\" elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the Transverse Mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).\n\nThe isometric latitude, , is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal Mercator projection and the Transverse Mercator projection. The name \"isometric\" arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of and longitude give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The graticule defined by the lines of constant and constant , divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15):\nFor the \"normal\" Mercator projection (on the ellipsoid) this function defines the spacing of the parallels: if the length of the equator on the projection is (units of length or pixels) then the distance, , of a parallel of latitude from the equator is\nThe isometric latitude is closely related to the conformal latitude :\n\nThe formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and parametric latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are fixed-point iteration and Newton–Raphson root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of Lagrange reversion. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity. Osborne derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.\n\nThe following plot shows the difference between the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude (which diverges to infinity at the poles) for the case of the WGS84 ellipsoid. In every case the auxiliary latitude is the less (in magnitude) than the geodetic latitude. The differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes. The horizontal resolution of the plot fails to make clear that the maxima of the curves are not at 45° but calculation shows that they are within a few arc minutes of 45°. Some representative data points are given in the table following the plot. Note the closeness of the conformal and geocentric latitudes. This was exploited in the days of hand calculators to expedite the construction of map projections.\nTo first order in the flattening \"f\", the\nauxiliary latitudes can be expressed as\n\"ζ\" = \"φ\" − \"Cf\" sin 2\"φ\"\nwhere the constant \"C\" takes on the values\n[, , , 1, 1] for\n\"ζ\" = [\"β\", \"ξ\", \"μ\", \"χ\", \"θ\"].\n\nThe geodetic latitude, or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid, constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid. To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and parametric latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.\n\nAt an arbitrary point consider the line which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates are the latitude and longitude of the point on the ellipsoid and the distance . This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.\n\nThe geocentric latitude is the complement of the polar angle in conventional spherical polar coordinates in which the coordinates of a point are where is the distance of from the centre , is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and is longitude. Since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points on the normal, which all have the same geodetic latitude, will have differing geocentric latitudes. Spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field.\n\nThe parametric latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes and ) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci , ) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids. Let be the semi-minor axis () of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let be the parametric latitude of on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set define the ellipsoid coordinates. These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a rotating ellipsoidal body.\n\nThe relations between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in Geographic coordinate conversion. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in Spherical coordinate system. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.\n\nAstronomical latitude () is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface. The true vertical, the direction of a plumb line, is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the gravitational acceleration (mass-based) and the centrifugal acceleration at that latitude. Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the zenith and stars whose declination is accurately known.\n\nIn general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy. The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape \"at mean sea level\". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.\n\nAstronomical latitude is not to be confused with declination, the coordinate astronomers use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the celestial equator (see equatorial coordinates), nor with ecliptic latitude, the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the ecliptic (see ecliptic coordinates).\n\n"}

Chinese names also form the basis for many common Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese surnames in both translation and transliteration into those languages.\n\nThe conception of China as consisting of the \"old 100 families\" () is an ancient and traditional one, the most notable tally being the Song-era \"Hundred Family Surnames\" (). Even today, the number of surnames in China is a little over 4,000, while the year 2000 US census found the number of American surnames held by at least 100 people to be more than 150,000 and more than 6.2 million surnames altogether.\n\nThe Chinese expression \"Three Zhang (or/and) Four Li\" () is used to mean \"anyone\" or \"everyone\", but the most common surnames are currently Wang in mainland China and Chen in Taiwan. A commonly cited factoid from the 1990 edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" estimated that Zhang was the most common surname in the world, but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have not repeated the claim. However, Zhang Wei () is the most common \"full\" name in mainland China.\n\nThis list of the 100 most common Chinese surnames derives from comprehensive surveys from 2007 and 1982. The first is derived from a report on the household registrations released by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security on April 24, 2007. The second is derived from the 1982 Chinese census whose zero hour was 00:00 on 1 July 1982. Although no list of surnames was published with the initial summaries, the State Post Bureau subsequently used the census data to release a series of commemorative stamps in honor of the then-most-common surnames in 2004. Previous partial surveys proved less accurate, as many surnames are clustered regionally.\n\nThe summary of the 2007 survey revealed China had approximately 92,881,000 Wangs (7.25% of the general population), 92,074,000 Lis (7.19%), and 87,502,000 Zhangs (6.83%). These top three surnames alone accounted for more people than Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world. Detailed numbers for the other surnames were not released, but it was noted that seven othersLiu, Chen, Yang, Huang, Zhao, Wu, and Zhouwere each shared by more than 20 million Chinese and twelve moreXu, Sun, Ma, Zhu, Hu, Guo, He, Gao, Lin, Luo, Zheng, and Liangwere each shared by more than 10 million. All together, the top hundred surnames accounted for 84.77% of China's population. By way of comparison, the 2000 census found the most common surname in the United StatesSmithhad fewer than 2.4 million occurrences and made up only 0.84% of the general population. The top 100 surnames accounted for only 16.4% of the US population, and reaching 89.8% of the US population required more than 150,000 surnames.\n\n\nAccording to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Interior's Department of Population in 2016, Taiwan has only 1,503 surnames. The top ten surnames in Taiwan accounted for 52.77% of the general population, and the top 100 accounted for 96.56%.\n\nOther common surnames in Taiwan are listed by rank below. This report is based on the 2016 study. The ranking in the PRC (based on the 2007 study) is listed in the parenthesis. The Wade–Giles romanization is also listed first in the brackets, and the Hanyu Pinyin romanization is listed second in the brackets.\n\n\nChinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines from 1898 onward usually have single syllable Chinese surnames. On the other hand, most Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines prior to 1898 usually have multiple syllable Chinese surnames such as Gokongwei, Ongpin, Pempengco, Yuchengco, Teehankee, and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Chinese names which were transliterated into Spanish and adopted as surnames.\n\nThere are also multiple syllable Chinese surnames that are Spanish transliterations of Hokkien words. Surnames like Tuazon (Eldest Grandson, 大孫), Dizon (Second Grandson, 二孫), Samson (Third Grandson, 三孫), Singson (Fourth Grandson, 四孫), Gozon (Fifth Grandson, 五孫), Lacson (Sixth Grandson, 六孫) are examples of transliterations of designations that use the Hokkien suffix -son (孫) used as surnames for some Chinese Filipinos who trace their ancestry from Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish Colonial Period. It should be noted as well that \"Son/Sun\" (孫) is a surname listed in the classic Chinese text Hundred Family Surnames, perhaps shedding light on the Hokkien suffix -son used here as a surname alongside some sort of accompanying enumeration scheme.\nStatistics Canada has not released a list of common surnames for any of its recent censuses, but much of the Canadian Chinese population is clustered in Metro Vancouver and Greater Victoria in British Columbia and the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and the Ottawa-Gatineau Area in Ontario, as well as in some emerging major clusters, such as the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor in Alberta, Montreal, and the Communauté métropolitaine de Québec (Quebec Community Metropolitan Area) in Quebec.\n\nA 2010 study by Baiju Shah & al data-mined the Registered Persons Database of Canadian health card recipients in the province of Ontario for a particularly Chinese-Canadian name list. Ignoring potentially non-Chinese spellings such as Lee (49,898 total), they found that the most common Chinese names in Ontario were:\n\nNearly as large is the Chinese Indonesian community. The 2010 Indonesian census reported more than 8.8 million self-identified Chinese, making up 3.7% of the general population. Just as in Thailand, though, previous legislation (in this case, 127/U/Kep/12/1966) had banned ethnic Chinese surnames throughout the country. This law was abolished after the removal of Suharto, but Chinese names remain a mix of Indonesian, pinyin, and Dutch-influenced Hokkien.\n\nDuring the 2010 Malaysian Census, approximately 6,960,000 Malaysians of Chinese race.

However, \"very\" few of the Chinese Thais have Chinese surnames, after the 1913 Surname Act that required the adoption of Thai surnames in order to enjoy Thai citizenship. Moreover, the same law requires that those possessing the same surname be related, meaning that immigrant Chinese may \"not\" adopt the surname of their clansmen unless they can show actual kinship.\n\nThe 2010 US Census found 3,794,673 self-identified Chinese Americans and 230,382 self-identified Taiwanese Americans, up from 2,734,841 Chinese Americans and 144,795 Taiwanese Americans in 2000.\n\nAlthough the Chinese make up the largest segment of the U.S. Asian and Pacific Islander population, the most common Chinese-derived surname during the 2000 census was not itself Chinese but the Vietnamese Nguyễn (Chinese: , \"Ruǎn\").\n\nDuring the 2000 census, the 10 most common Chinese American names were:\n\n\nLin Yutang's \"Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\", hosted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Most endemic species to the British Isles are considered to be subspecies of a larger species, with mutations or adaptations slightly changing the species in the islands or in certain localities.\n\nBritish Conservationists often describe this as a “wiped clean effect” with repeated glaciations forcing many species out of the modern area of the islands to more southern latitudes in Europe and perhaps even driving some species extinct.\n\nSome species which were present in Britain before past glaciations, often during periods with a warmer climate than now failed to return after the Last Glacial Maximum. Amongst these are \"Rhododendron ponticum\" and rabbits, now considered invasive and non-native.\n\nA species is only deemed native if it reached the British Isles without human intervention (either intentional or unintentional). That means that to be native the species must have reached Britain before the land bridge joining Britain to the continent was submerged. Alternatively species can also be native when they have flown or swum to Britain as is the case with many bird species which arrived after the submersion of the land bridge, a recent example is the collared dove which arrived in the 1950s, this also applies for plants which spread seed in the wind.\n\nA few endemic species are Arctic-Alpine species, survivors of Arctic species of plants and animals which either adapted to the warming climate or became isolated in suitable areas of mountains or lakes which still retained a suitable micro-climate. A common misconception is that the entirety of the British Isles was under glaciers and was uninhabitable both for humans, plants and animals. Whilst unsuitable for most species, a number of Arctic species survived in the areas not under glaciers in southern areas of England, Wales and south west Ireland and were either driven to extinction in the British Isles or to micro-climatic refuges as the climate warmed and the Arctic conditions retreated north.\n\nMost endemic species or subspecies however date to more recent, post-glacial times, many having spread via land bridges or along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe.\n\n\n\n\n, 47 species of flowering plants (430 including microspecies) were considered to be endemic to the British Isles, 32 of them in the \"critical genera\" \"Euphrasia\", \"Limonium\" and \"Sorbus\".\n\nSubsequently, \"Sorbus pseudomeinichii\" was discovered on the island of Arran in 2007.\n\n\n\nSome species of insects only occur in Britain:\n\n\nBritain has few endemic species of birds but quite a few subspecies. A few Arctic-Alpine species have subspecies in the British Isles, some have been in the islands since the last Ice Age, but many spread in the immediate Sub-Arctic conditions as the ice retreated.\nFurther more these species were latter reinforced by newer arrivals as the climate assumed temperatures and conditions more similar to the present day.\n\n\nBritain has a few subspecies of mammals but no endemic species. Many again are Ice Age survivors that adapted to the new conditions; others arrived in warmer conditions whilst the land bridge still existed.\n\n\nThe Cnidaria are a group of animals found exclusively in aquatic and mostly marine environments. They include sea anemones, sea pen and corals and their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey.\n\n\nIn some areas of uplands in the British Isles the retreating glaciers left melt water in hollows which had been carved out by the movement of ice. In these, Arctic species of fish survived, due often to the sheer depth of the lakes and the colder temperatures. For the young endemic fish varieties of the British Isles, it is usually controversial whether they should be considered as distinct taxa (species or subspecies) or just as isolated populations of their ancestral species.\n\nAs global warming affects the British climate there is some concern for these species, some confined to a handful of lakes. Action has been taken to protect them, as is the case with vendace which has been moved to tarns in nearby mountains due to the cooler temperatures. It is hoped that these will act as refuges should the species die-out in the lower-level lakes where they occur naturally.\n\n\nThe distribution of endemic species seems to have a North Western bias and with endemic species on the whole showing an oceanic / alpine distribution with most endemics being found in upland areas or islands.\n\nHuman bred-animals are not usually classified as distinct subspecies but rather breeds which is a similar concept. However some animals such as Iron Age pigs are classified as a distinct species from their wild relatives.\n\n"}

After the reforms of Emperor Diocletian in the 290s, its governor held the rank of \"consularis\".\n\nCrete became part of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire upon the partition of the Roman Epire in 395 AD. It remained in Byzantine hands until it was conquered by Andalusian exiles in the mid-820s and became an emirate, nominally under Abbasid suzerainty. The emirate became a major base for Muslim naval raids along the coasts of the Byzantine Empire, and several attempts at reconquest failed. The Byzantines finally retook the island in 961 under the leadership of Nikephoros Phokas, and held it until 1205.\n\nThe supreme Venetian governor of Crete bore the title of \"Duke of Crete\" ().\n\nCrete became an autonomous state under international protection and nominal Ottoman suzerainty following the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. A High Commissioner of the Great Powers (Ύπατος Αρμοστής) was installed to govern the island. In 1908, the Cretan Assembly unilaterally declared union with Greece, but this was not recognized by Greece until the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912 and internationally until 1913.\nFrom unification with Greece in 1912 until 1955, Crete as a whole was administered by a government-appointed governor-general (), who supervised the administration of the island's four prefectures (Chania, Heraklion, Lasithi and Rethymno).\n\nWith the establishment of the region of Crete (Περιφέρεια Κρήτης) in 1986, Crete became again an administrative entity. Until 2011, the regional governors (περιφερειάρχες) were government-appointed, but in accordance to the Kallikratis reform they were replaced with elected officials.\n\n"}

He was brought to Istanbul after being recruited by the Ottoman scouts in Rumelia, educated, served several Ottoman sultans, and became a teacher at Enderun School.\n\nMatrakçı Nasuh (\"bin Abdullah; son of Abdullah\"), born in the Bosnian town of Visoko, was a gifted Janissary who went through both the Infantry and devşirme system, a gifted swordsman, and sharpshooter well known for his intellect; he spoke five languages and was recruited into the Ottoman Navy.\n\nAlthough born to Bosnian Muslim parentage, Nasuh was drafted into the devşirme system, otherwise reserved for the Christian populace of the empire. Exceptionally, however, in Bosnia, the devşirme was also extended to local Muslim families.\n\nAfter a long period of studies on mathematics and geometry, he wrote his works \"Cemâlü'l-Küttâb\" and \"Kemalü'l- Hisâb\" and submitted them to the Ottoman sultan Selim I. He wrote also the two books named \"Mecmaü't-Tevârih\" and \"Süleymannâme\". They deal with the history of the period of 1520–43. He also wrote a historical piece on the Persian campaign of Suleiman I titled \"Fetihname-i Karabuğdan\". A recent study of his book \"Umdet-ul Hisab\" revealed an unknown fact that Matrakçı had invented some genuine multiplication methods. One of the significant results displayed in this book was that the lattice method had been widely used in the Enderun School nearly 50 years before John Napier reintroduced it to Europe.\n\nBesides his works on mathematics and history, he is famous because of his miniatures. He created a naturalist style which focuses on panoramic views of landscapes and cities painted with the greatest detail (his most famous work, the Istanbul landscape picture, shows almost every street and building of the city). In Ottoman miniature art, this was later known as the \"Matrakçı style\". The most important of his four historic volumes of miniatures is the one dealing with Suleiman I's Safavid war, upon which he had written his historical work \"Fetihname-i Karabuğdan\". Besides illustrating the march of the Ottoman army from Istanbul to Baghdad and then Tabriz and its return via Halab and Eskisehir, Nasuh also includes all the cities met by the army along the way. The Library of Istanbul University hosts the only copy of this work.\n\nNasuh was also a soldier and a master bladesmith. He worked as a weapons teacher at Enderun School. He and his students demonstrated their skills in a show which was part of the circumcision celebrations of Suleiman I's sons. Because of his success in this demonstration, Nasuh received the honorary title of Ustad (\"master\") and Reis (\"chief\") from the Sultan. He also wrote a book about usage of various weapons and techniques of cavalry and infantry fight, called \"Tuhfet-ül Guzât\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his hometown Visoko, in Bosnia, annual conferences are held in honors of most important people from Visoko, and Matrakčija is considered one of the most important. For illustration, he is regarded as Bosnian Leonardo da Vinci. Also a street near \"Hometown Heritage Museum Visoko\" \"(Zavičajni Muzej Visoko)\" is named after him: Matrakčijina (English: Matrakci's Street).\n\nA documentary film about Matrakçı was produced by Turkish Radio-television in 1978.\n\n"}

The series mapped the counties of Great Britain at both a six inch and twenty-five inch scale with accompanying acreage and land use information. Following the introduction of the Ordnance Survey National Grid in the 1930s the County Series maps were replaced by a new series of maps at each scale.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey began producing six inch to the mile (1:10,560) maps of Great Britain in the 1840s, modelled on its first large-scale maps of Ireland from the mid-1830s. This was partly in response to the Tithe Commutation Act 1836 which led to calls for a large-scale survey of England and Wales.\n\nFrom 1854, to meet requirements for greater detail, including land-parcel numbers in rural areas and accompanying information, cultivated and inhabited areas were mapped at 1:2500 (25.344 inches to the mile), at first parish by parish, with blank space beyond the parish boundary, and later continuously. Early copies of 1:2500 maps were available hand-coloured. Up to 1879 the 1:2500 maps were accompanied by Books of Reference or \"area books\" that gave acreages and land-use information for land-parcel numbers. After 1879, land-use information was dropped from these area books; after the mid-1880s, the books themselves were dropped and acreages were printed instead on the maps. After 1854, the six-inch maps and their revisions were based on the twenty-five inch maps.\n\nThe six-inch sheets covered an area of six by four miles on the ground; the twenty-five inch sheets an area of one by one and a half. One square inch on the twenty-five inch maps was roughly equal to an acre on the ground. In later editions the six-inch sheets were published in \"quarters\" (NW, NE, SW, SE), each covering an area of three by two miles on the ground. \n\nThe first edition of the two scales was completed by the 1890s. A second edition (or \"first revision\") was begun in 1891 and completed just before the First World War. From 1907 till the early 1940s, a third edition (or \"second revision\") was begun but never completed: only areas with significant changes on the ground were revised, many two or three times.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to the early 1940s, the OS produced many \"restricted\" versions of the County Series maps and other War Department sheets for War Office purposes, in a variety of large scales that included details of military significance such as dockyards, naval installations, fortifications and military camps. Apart from a brief period during the disarmament talks of the 1930s, these areas were left blank or incomplete on standard maps. The de-classified sheets have now been deposited in some of the Copyright Libraries, helping to complete the map-picture of pre-Second World War Britain.\n\nBoth the 6 inch and 25 inch scale Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain showed the boundaries of:\n\nThe maps included the area of most civil parishes and their detached parts, as well as extra-parochial areas and townships. Originally the area of these places was given in acres, roods and perches. After about 1879 this was changed to solely acres, with area given to three decimal places. As boundary changes occurred throughout the late 19th century, reprints of map sheets would be updated with annotations detailing these changes.\n\n\nLondon Index map 1 London Index map 2\nLondon Index map\n"}

The Canadian provinces and territories of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories along with the American states of Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Oregon compose the membership. It is designed to improve cooperation and communication between member jurisdictions as well as improve communication between the public and private sector. PNWER provides the public and private sectors a cross-border forum for unfiltered dialogue that capitalizes upon the synergies between business leaders and elected officials who work to advance the region’s global competitiveness.\n\nFormer BC cabinet minister and legal scholar Andrew Petter describes the PNWER as one of North Americas most sophisticated examples of regionalist paradiplomacy.\n\nPNWER has three program areas:\nEnergy,\nHomeland Security, and\nPacific Northwest Innovation Network.\n\nThe Pacific NorthWest Economic Region was established in 1991 by statute in the organization's original seven legislative jurisdictions – Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska in the United States, and British Columbia and Alberta in Canada. The Yukon joined PNWER in 1994, Saskatchewan joined in 2008, and the Northwest Territories joined in 2009. From the beginning, all state and provincial legislators were members of PNWER. The governors and premiers were added to the PNWER governance structure in 1993.\n\nThe proposal establishing PNWER passed with 701 out of 703 sitting legislators voting in its favor following a three-year process initiated by the Pacific NorthWest Legislative Leadership Forum (PNLLF) in 1988. Six working groups were established, including environmental technology, tourism, recycling, value-added timber, workforce training, and telecommunications; some of these merged into or were replaced in later years by new areas of concentration. Critical in establishing the initiative to create the PNWER were Washington State Senator Alan Bluechel and Deputy Premier and Minister of Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs for Alberta Jim Horsman. Bluechel served as the organization's first president. Another President was Mel Knight, a former Energy Minister of Alberta.\n\nPNWER incorporated official private sector participation – including the non-elective public sector, and nonprofit organizations and NGOs in 1994; with that, a private sector council mirroring that of the organization's legislative delegate council was established and private and public sector co-chairs became part of the working group structure. Each working group has its agenda set by representatives of the private industries. Since then, funding for PNWER has been balanced by the public and private sector. The organization's current (2010) annual budget is U.S. $1.4 million, up from $900,000 in 2006, with approximately one third coming from state and provincial dues, one third from private sector sponsorship and dues, and one third from public and private grants.\n\nThe current president of PNWER is MLA Dan Ashton of British Columbia, elected on 17 July 2016.\n\n"}

WFF includes an extensively instrumented range to support launches of more than a dozen types of sounding rockets; small expendable suborbital and orbital rockets; high-altitude balloon flights carrying scientific instruments for atmospheric and astronomical research; and, using its Research Airport, flight tests of aeronautical research aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThere have been over 16,000 launches from the rocket testing range at Wallops since its founding in 1945 in the quest for information on the flight characteristics of airplanes, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, and to increase the knowledge of the Earth's upper atmosphere and the environment of outer space. The launch vehicles vary in size and power from the small Super Loki meteorological rockets to orbital-class vehicles.\n\nThe Wallops Flight Facility also supports science missions for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and occasionally for foreign governments and commercial organizations. Wallops also supports development tests and exercises involving United States Navy aircraft and ship-based electronics and weapon systems in the Virginia Capes operating area, near the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to its fixed-location instrumentation assets, the WFF range includes mobile radar, telemetry receivers, and command transmitters that can be transported by cargo planes to locations around the world, in order to establish a temporary range where no other instrumentation exists, to ensure safety, and to collect data in order to enable and support suborbital rocket launches from remote sites.\n\nThe WFF mobile range assets have been used to support rocket launches from locations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and at sea. Workers at Wallops include approximately 1,000 full-time NASA civil service employees and the employees of contractors, about 30 U.S. Navy personnel, and about 100 employees of NOAA.\n\nIn 1945, NASA's predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), established a rocket launch site on Wallops Island under the direction of the Langley Research Center. This site was designated the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station and conducted high-speed aerodynamic research to supplement wind tunnel and laboratory investigations into the problems of flight. In 1958, Congress established NASA, which absorbed Langley Research Center and other NACA field centers and research facilities. At that time, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station became a separate facility, Wallops Station, operating directly under NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1959, NASA acquired the former Naval Air Station Chincoteague, and engineering and administrative activities were moved to this location. In 1974, the Wallops Station was named Wallops Flight Center. The name was changed to Wallops Flight Facility in 1981, when it became part of Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nIn the early years, research at Wallops concentrated on obtaining aerodynamic data at transonic and low supersonic speeds. Between 1959 and 1961, Project Mercury capsules were tested at Wallops in support of NASA's manned space flight program - the Mercury program - before astronauts were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Some of these tests using the Little Joe booster rocket were designed to flight-qualify components of the spacecraft, including the escape and recovery systems and some of the life support systems. Two rhesus monkeys, Sam and Miss Sam, were sent aloft as pioneers for astronauts; both were recovered safely.\n\nThe first payload launched into orbit from Wallops Island was Explorer IX, atop a Scout rocket, on February 15, 1961.\n\nOn September 6, 2013, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) was launched from Wallops, atop a Minotaur V rocket. This was the first time that an American lunar mission had been launched from anywhere but Florida.\n\nWallops Island is currently experiencing beach erosion of 10 to 22 feet (3 to 7 meters) a year, due in part to the current sea level rise; some access roads and parking lots have had to be rebuilt several times over the past five years. NASA has responded by continually fortifying the shoreline with sand.\n\nA permanent ground control station for NASA's RQ-4 Global Hawk drone is at Wallops Flight Facility.\n\nThe WFF Main Base is located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula about west of Chincoteague, Virginia; about north of Norfolk, Virginia, and southeast of Salisbury, Maryland. The WFF consists of three separate parcels of land totaling 6,200 acres (25 km²): the Main Base, the Mainland, and the Wallops Island Launch Site. The Mainland and the Wallops Island Launch Site are about southeast of the Main Base.\n\nWallops operates controlled airspace with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) qualified air traffic controllers including:\n\n\nMajor Wallops facilities include FAA-certified runways; an experimental UAV runway; and crash, fire and rescue services. WFF has facilities for the receipt, inspection, assembly, checkout and storage of rocket motors and other hazardous pyrotechnic devices. The Wallops Island Launch Site includes six launch pads, three blockhouses for launch control, and assembly buildings to support the preparation and launching of suborbital and orbital launch vehicles.\n\nThe Wallops Research Range includes ground-based and mobile systems, and a range control center. Its radar facilities and systems are used for tracking and surveillance. Telemetry facilities include a variety of antennas, receivers, and display instrumentation systems. Command uplink and optical tracking facilities are included as part of the range. The range also provides premier digital photographic and video services including operation of numerous still cameras, high speed and video systems for Range Safety support, surveillance, and post-launch analysis (e.g., failure analysis), project documentation (e.g., fabrication and test), administrative documentation, and archiving for environmental studies. In addition, WFF has a variety of communications systems and facilities to route voice, video, and data in support of launch processing, flight and test operations.\n\nThe WFF Research Airport is located on the Main Base. There are three runways (from to long), two taxiways, three ramps, and one hazardous cargo loading area in active service. Two ramps adjoin the two active hangars, and a third ramp adjoins the Crash, Fire and Rescue building. The primary research runway has a test section with a variety of surface textures and materials for runway research projects.\n\nWeather measurements and predictions are critical to all Research Airport operations, rocket and balloon launches, and in safely conducting hazardous operations on the ground. Wallops meteorological services provide measurements of upper atmospheric and magnetic phenomena to augment and enable collection of scientific data by sensors aboard flight vehicles. The S-band Doppler radar system at Wallops, known as SPANDAR, is capable of automatic unambiguous tracking of targets up to 60,000 kilometers away. It can detect a single raindrop of 3 millimeters at a range of 10 kilometers and cloud water content as little as 1 gram per cubic meter. SPANDAR’s sensitivity with its dish antenna can detect small changes in the refractive index of air caused by sea breeze fronts, gust fronts, and various forms of clear air turbulence.\n\nThe Wallops mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range to ensure safety and collect data to support the rocket customers in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at Poker Flat, Alaska; Andoya, Norway; and Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands. The Wallops Mobile Instrumentation is integrated with NASA and Department of Defense networks and can be used to supplement established ranges in support of rocket launches.\n\nSince 2001, engineers at NASA Wallops Flight Facility have been developing new range technologies, systems and approaches to improve the cost and responsiveness of launch and flight test activities, within the constraints of available funding and program schedules.\n\nSpecifically, NASA Wallops has been leading two range technology development projects: the Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) and the Low Cost TDRSS Transceiver (LCT2).\n\nAFSS is a project to develop an autonomous on-board system that could augment or replace traditional ground-commanded Range Safety flight termination systems. The AFSS would use redundant sensors and processors on board a launch vehicle to monitor its trajectory, and if necessary initiate pyrotechnic devices to terminate the flight.\n\nLCT2 is an effort to produce a relatively low-cost transceiver to allow launch vehicles to communicate through NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) after they have gone over the horizon from the launch site. LCT2 is being pursued as part of the Space Based Range Demonstration and Certification (SBRDC) program (formerly called Space Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS)) in cooperation with NASA Kennedy Space Center.\n\nWFF’s primary mission areas are as follows:\n\nWith its sounding rocket, aircraft, and balloon flights carrying scientific payloads, its aeronautical systems testing, its range support for Space Shuttle launches, and its educational outreach activities, WFF supports all of NASA’s Mission Directorates and practically all of their respective themes:\n\nIn 1998, the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority, later joined by Maryland, built the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops on land leased from NASA. In December 2006, the facility made its first launch.\n\nThe Wallops Visitor Center has a variety of hands-on exhibits and hosts weekly educational activities and programs to enable children to explore and learn about the technologies designed and used by NASA researchers and scientists. In addition, one Saturday each month, NASA invites model rocketry enthusiasts to launch their own rockets from the WFF rocket launch site. NASA personnel also participate, launching models of various rockets and explaining the spacecraft they carry in real life.\n\nThe schedule for sounding rocket launches from WFF is posted on its official Web site.\n\nFor many years WFF was home to the NSIP Sub-SEM and SEM projects. NSIP stands for the NASA Student Involvement Project, the Sub-SEM project was to design one of four experiments that would be inserted into an ORION-II one-stage rocket and launched above 98 percent of the atmosphere, and experience over 30 Gs of centrifugal force, while SEM was to design an experiment that would be flown on a future Space Shuttle mission. Each project gave 16 students and four teachers (four students and one teacher from each high school) the opportunity to spend an almost all-expense-paid week at WFF. Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments and learning about the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.\n\nOn April 2, 1957, a Lockheed P2V-6 Neptune exploded in midair after takeoff from what was then known as NAAS Chincoteague. All eleven occupants of the aircraft died. \n\nOn October 23, 1995, the maiden flight of a Conestoga 1620 rocket failed 46 seconds after liftoff, resulting in disintegration. EER Space Systems, Conestoga's manufacturer, concluded that low frequency noise from an unknown source upset the guidance system on the rocket causing it to order course corrections when none were needed. The rocket went off course when its first stage steering mechanism ran out of hydraulic fluid and became inoperable. After this failure, the Conestoga program was terminated, and EER abandoned the launch business. At the time of the launch, the Conestoga was the largest rocket ever launched from Wallops Island, and it was the first orbital mission attempted from the facility since 1985. The company's launch pad at Wallops Island were the first commercially built facilities in the US. 14 scientific experiments, some of which were planned to return from orbit, were destroyed. All debris landed in the Atlantic Ocean. There were no injuries. \n\nOn October 27, 1998 a Learjet 45 was destroyed at Wallops after a loss of control during a water ingestion test flight. Only minor injuries to a copilot and flight engineer were reported. There were no ground injuries. The airplane was being used to test a new nose wheel tire. For the test, the airplane was passed through a \"pool\" or \"trough\" of water on the runway at different speeds. The pilot failed to obtain/maintain alignment with the water pool and lost control. The plane departed the left side of the runway, and struck a pickup truck parked adjacent to the runway.\n\nOn August 22, 2008, a ALV X-1 sounding rocket was intentionally destroyed 20 seconds into flight after veering too far off course.\nOn October 28, 2014, a failure occurred in an Antares rocket, carrying Cygnus CRS Orb-3, shortly after launch and destroyed both the rocket and the payload at the adjacent Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Launch Pad 0A.\n\nThe NASA Wallops Flight Facility has alliances with a number of organizations important to its mission and future growth. Some examples include:\n\nIt has also worked with the National Security Agency in experiments involving ionized clouds for communications interception during the Cold War\n\n\n\n\n"}

The site is located approximately 35 km southwest of the urban centre and about the same distance from the Yangguan Pass; the area served as a staging post for travellers on the Silk Road. It is the western counterpart of the Mogao Caves, also known as the \"Caves of the Thousand Buddhas\" after the founding monk Yuezun's vision in 366 of \"golden radiance in the form of a thousand Buddhas\". The caves were excavated from the cliff that runs along the north bank of the Dang River. A number have been lost to floods and collapse; some forty are still extant. Twenty-two decorated caves house 34 polychrome statues and 800 m of wall paintings, dating from the Northern Wei to the late-Yuan and early-Ming Dynasties (sixth to fourteenth centuries). The site was included within the 1961 designation of the Mogao Caves as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site.\n\nA manuscript from the Library Cave, dating to the Five Dynasties and now at the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris, documents the early history of the site (P 5034): according to the \"Domain Record of Shazhou Dudu Prefecture – Shouchang County\", \"60 \"li\" east of the county is a very old inscription that says 'Han Dynasty… made a small Buddha niche; the common people gradually built more'\". Since Shouchang County, modern Nanhu Village, is the location of the Yangguan Pass along the Hexi Corridor, it is understood that this is a reference to the origins of the Western Thousand Buddha Caves.\n\nThe decorated caves are in three main sections: Caves 1–19 at the west end of the cliff, approximately one kilometre from the modern reservoir; Cave 20 in the middle of the site, near the second floodgate; and Caves 21 and 22 at the eastern end of the cliff. Most of the sculptures were restored in a different style during the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. The caves at the western end of the site have had aluminium doors and glass partitions installed more recently with the intention of mitigating the environmental causes of deterioration. Some of the paintings at the far east end of the site, distant from the custodians' lodgings, have been detached and remounted in a cave at Mogao. The ruined state of the main Buddha image in Northern Wei Cave 7 enables the construction techniques to be seen: layers of earthen render over an armature of branches and reeds. The loss of upper paint layers also reveals the linear grid used to set out the design of the Thousand Buddhas on the cave walls.\n\nThe twenty-two caves are dated as follows, based largely on the style of the paintings and their accompanying inscriptions:\n\n\n"}
