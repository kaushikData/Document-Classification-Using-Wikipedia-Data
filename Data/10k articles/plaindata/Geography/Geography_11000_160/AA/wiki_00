{"id": "113147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113147", "title": "Barbarian", "text": "Barbarian\n\nA barbarian is a human who is perceived to be either uncivilized or primitive. The designation is usually applied as generalization based on a popular stereotype; barbarians can be any member of a nation judged by some to be less civilized or orderly (such as a tribal society), but may also be part of a certain \"primitive\" cultural group (such as nomads) or social class (such as bandits) both within and outside one's own nation. Alternatively, they may instead be admired and romanticised as noble savages. In idiomatic or figurative usage, a \"barbarian\" may also be an individual reference to a brutal, cruel, warlike, and insensitive person.\n\nThe term originates from the (\"barbaros\" pl. βάρβαροι \"barbaroi\"), which in turn originates from the languages of early Anatolian nations that were heard by the Greeks as \"bar... bar...\" In Ancient Greece, the Greeks used the term towards those who did not speak Greek and follow classical Greek customs. In Ancient Rome, the Romans used the term towards non-Romans such as the Germanics, Celts, Gauls, Iberians, Thracians, Illyrians, Berbers, Parthians, and Sarmatians. In the early modern period and sometimes later, the Byzantine Greeks used it for the Turks, in a clearly pejorative manner.\n\nThe Ancient Greek name βάρβαρος (\"barbaros\"), \"barbarian\", was an antonym for πολίτης (\"politēs\"), \"citizen\" (from πόλις – \"polis\", \"city-state\"). The earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek , \"pa-pa-ro\", written in Linear B syllabic script.\n\nThe Greeks used the term \"barbarian\" for all non-Greek-speaking peoples, including the Egyptians, Persians, Medes and Phoenicians, emphasizing their otherness. According to Greek writers, this was because the language they spoke sounded to Greeks like gibberish represented by the sounds \"bar..bar..;\" the alleged root of the word βάρβαρος, which is an echomimetic or onomatopoeic word. However, in various occasions, the term was also used by Greeks, especially the Athenians, to deride other Greek tribes and states (such as Epirotes, Eleans, Macedonians, Boeotians and Aeolic-speakers) but also fellow Athenians, in a pejorative and politically motivated manner. Of course, the term also carried a cultural dimension to its dual meaning. The verb (\"barbarízō\") in ancient Greek meant to behave or talk like a barbarian, or to hold with the barbarians.\n\nPlato (\"Statesman\" 262de) rejected the Greek–barbarian dichotomy as a logical absurdity on just such grounds: dividing the world into Greeks and non-Greeks told one nothing about the second group, yet Plato used the term barbarian frequently in his seventh letter. In Homer's works, the term appeared only once (\"Iliad\" 2.867), in the form () (\"of incomprehensible speech\"), used of the Carians fighting for Troy during the Trojan War. In general, the concept of \"barbaros\" did not figure largely in archaic literature before the 5th century BC. Still it has been suggested that \"barbarophonoi\" in the \"Iliad\" signifies not those who spoke a non-Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly.\n\nA change occurred in the connotations of the word after the Greco-Persian Wars in the first half of the 5th century BC. Here a hasty coalition of Greeks defeated the vast Persian Empire. Indeed, in the Greek of this period 'barbarian' is often used expressly to refer to Persians, who were enemies of the Greeks in this war.\n\nThe Romans used the term \"barbarus\" for uncivilised people, opposite to Greek or Roman, and in fact, it became a common term to refer to all foreigners among Romans after Augustus age (as, among the Greeks, after the Persian wars, the Persians), including the Germanic peoples, Persians, Gauls, Phoenicians and Carthaginians.\n\nThe Greek term \"barbaros\" was the etymological source for many words meaning \"barbarian\", including English \"barbarian\", which was first recorded in 16th century Middle English.\n\nA word \"barbara-\" is also found in the Sanskrit of ancient India, with the primary meaning of \"stammering\" implying someone with an unfamiliar language. The Greek word \"barbaros\" is related to Sanskrit \"barbaras\" (stammering). This Indo-European root is also found in Latin \"balbus\" for \"stammering\" and Czech blblati \"to stammer\".\n\nIn Aramaic, Old Persian and Arabic context, the root refers to \"babble confusedly\". It appears as \"barbary\" or in Old French \"barbarie\", itself derived from the Arabic \"Barbar\", \"Berber\", which is an ancient Arabic term for the North African inhabitants west of Egypt. The Arabic word might be ultimately from Greek \"barbaria\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines five meanings of the noun \"barbarian\", including an obsolete Barbary usage.\nThe \"OED\" \"barbarous\" entry summarizes the semantic history. \"The sense-development in ancient times was (with the Greeks) 'foreign, non-Hellenic,' later 'outlandish, rude, brutal'; (with the Romans) 'not Latin nor Greek,' then 'pertaining to those outside the Roman Empire'; hence 'uncivilized, uncultured,' and later 'non-Christian,' whence 'Saracen, heathen'; and generally 'savage, rude, savagely cruel, inhuman.'\"\n\nGreek attitudes towards \"barbarians\" developed in parallel with the growth of chattel slavery - especially in Athens. Although the enslavement of Greeks for non-payment of debts continued in most Greek states, Athens banned this practice under Solon in the early 6th century BC. Under the Athenian democracy established ca. 508 BC, slavery came into use on a scale never before seen among the Greeks. Massive concentrations of slaves worked under especially brutal conditions in the silver mines at Laureion in south-eastern Attica after the discovery of a major vein of silver-bearing ore there in 483 BC, while the phenomenon of skilled slave craftsmen producing manufactured goods in small factories and workshops became increasingly common.\n\nFurthermore, slave-ownership no longer became the preserve of the rich: all but the poorest of Athenian households came to have slaves in order to supplement the work of their free members. The slaves of Athens that had \"barbarian\" origins were coming especially from lands around the Black Sea such as Thrace and Taurica (Crimea), while Lydians, Phrygians and Carians came from Asia Minor. Aristotle (\"Politics\" 1.2–7; 3.14) characterises barbarians as slaves by nature.\n\nFrom this period, words like \"barbarophonos\", cited above from Homer, came into use not only for the sound of a foreign language but also for foreigners who spoke Greek improperly. In the Greek language, the word \"logos\" expressed both the notions of \"language\" and \"reason\", so Greek-speakers readily conflated speaking poorly with stupidity.\n\nFurther changes occurred in the connotations of \"barbari\"/\"barbaroi\" in Late Antiquity, when bishops and \"catholikoi\" were appointed to sees connected to cities among the \"civilized\" \"gentes barbaricae\" such as in Armenia or Persia, whereas bishops were appointed to supervise entire peoples among the less settled.\n\nEventually the term found a hidden meaning through the folk etymology of Cassiodorus (c. 485 – c. 585). He stated that the word \"barbarian\" was \"made up of \"barba\" (beard) and \"rus\" (flat land); for barbarians did not live in cities, making their abodes in the fields like wild animals\".\n\nFrom classical origins the Hellenic stereotype of barbarism evolved: barbarians are like children, unable to speak or reason properly, cowardly, effeminate, luxurious, cruel, unable to control their appetites and desires, politically unable to govern themselves. Writers voiced these stereotypes with much shrillness - Isocrates in the 4th century B.C., for example, called for a war of conquest against Persia as a panacea for Greek problems.\n\nHowever, the disparaging Hellenic stereotype of barbarians did not totally dominate Hellenic attitudes. Xenophon (died 354 B.C.), for example, wrote the \"Cyropaedia\", a laudatory fictionalised account of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire, effectively a utopian text. In his \"Anabasis\", Xenophon's accounts of the Persians and other non-Greeks who he knew or encountered show few traces of the stereotypes.\n\nIn Plato's \"Protagoras\", Prodicus of Ceos calls \"barbarian\" the Aeolian dialect that Pittacus of Mytilene spoke.\n\nThe renowned orator Demosthenes (384–322 B.C.) made derogatory comments in his speeches, using the word \"barbarian\".\n\nIn the Bible's New Testament, St. Paul (from Tarsus) - lived about A.D. 5 to about A.D. 67) uses the word \"barbarian\" in its Hellenic sense to refer to non-Greeks (\"Romans 1:14\"), and he also uses it to characterise one who merely speaks a different language (\"1 Corinthians 14:11\").\n\nAbout a hundred years after Paul's time, Lucian – a native of Samosata, in the former kingdom of Commagene, which had been absorbed by the Roman Empire and made part of the province of Syria – used the term \"barbarian\" to describe himself. Because he was a noted satirist, this could have indicated self-deprecating irony. It might also have suggested descent from Samosata's original Semitic population – who were likely called \"barbarians by later Hellenistic, Greek-speaking settlers\", and might have eventually taken up this appellation themselves.\n\nThe term retained its standard usage in the Greek language throughout the Middle Ages; Byzantine Greeks used it widely until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire, (later named the Byzantine Empire) in the 15th century (1453 with the fall of capital city Constantinople}.\n\nCicero (106-43 BC) described the mountain area of inner Sardinia as \"a land of barbarians\", with these inhabitants also known by the manifestly pejorative term \"latrones mastrucati\" (\"thieves with a rough garment in wool\").\nThe region, still known as \"Barbagia\" (in Sardinian \"Barbàgia\" or \"Barbàza\"), preserves this old \"barbarian\" designation in its name – but it no longer consciously retains \"barbarian\" associations: the inhabitants of the area themselves use the name naturally and unaffectedly.\n\nThe statue of the \"Dying Galatian\" provides some insight into the Hellenistic perception of and attitude towards \"Barbarians\". Attalus I of Pergamon (ruled 241-197 BC) commissioned (220s BC) a statue to celebrate his victory (ca 232 BC) over the Celtic Galatians in Anatolia (the bronze original is lost, but a Roman marble copy was found in the 17th century). The statue depicts with remarkable realism a dying Celt warrior with a typically Celtic hairstyle and moustache. He sits on his fallen shield while a sword and other objects lie beside him. He appears to be fighting against death, refusing to accept his fate.\n\nThe statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts' defeat, thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them, and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries. As H. W. Janson comments, the sculpture conveys the message that \"they knew how to die, barbarians that they were\".\n\nThe Greeks admired Scythians and Galatians as heroic individuals – and even (as in the case of Anacharsis) as philosophers – but they regarded their culture as barbaric. The Romans indiscriminately characterised the various Germanic tribes, the settled Gauls, and the raiding Huns as barbarians, and subsequent classically oriented historical narratives depicted the migrations associated with the end of the Western Roman Empire as the \"barbarian invasions\".\n\nThe Romans adapted the term in order to refer to anything that was non-Roman. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta points out that the meaning of the word \"barbarous\" has undergone a semantic change in modern times, after Michel de Montaigne used it to characterize the activities of the Spaniards in the New World – supposedly representatives of the \"higher\" European culture – as \"barbarous,\" in a satirical essay published in the year 1580. It was not the supposedly \"uncivilized\" Indian tribes who were \"barbarous\", but the conquering Spaniards. Montaigne argued that Europeans noted the barbarism of other cultures but not the crueler and more brutal actions of their own societies, particularly (in his time) during the so-called religious wars. In Montaigne's view, his own people – the Europeans – were the real \"barbarians\". In this way, the Eurocentric argument was turned around and applied to the European invaders. With this shift in meaning, a whole literature arose in Europe that characterized the indigenous Indian peoples as innocent, and the militarily superior Europeans as \"barbarous\" intruders invading a paradisical world.\n\nHistorically, the term \"barbarian\" has seen widespread use, in English. Many peoples have dismissed alien cultures and even rival civilizations, because they were unrecognizably strange. For instance, the nomadic steppe peoples north of the Black Sea, including the Pechenegs and the Kipchaks, were called barbarians by the Byzantines.\n\nThe \"Berbers\" of North Africa were among the many peoples called \"Barbarian\" by the Romans; in their case, the name remained in use, having been adopted by the Arabs (see Berber etymology) and is still in use as the name for the non-Arabs in North Africa (though not by themselves). The geographical term Barbary or Barbary Coast, and the name of the Barbary pirates based on that coast (and who were not necessarily Berbers) were also derived from it.\n\nThe term has also been used to refer to people from Barbary, a region encompassing most of North Africa. The name of the region, \"Barbary,\" comes from the Arabic word \"Barbar,\" possibly from the Latin word \"barbaricum,\" meaning \"land of the barbarians.\"\n\nMany languages define the \"Other\" as those who do not speak one's language; Greek \"barbaroi\" was paralleled by Arabic \"ajam\" \"non-Arabic speakers; non-Arabs; (especially) Persians.\"\n\nThe term \"Barbarian\" in traditional Chinese culture had several aspects. For one thing, Chinese has more than one historical \"barbarian\" exonym. Several historical Chinese characters for non-Chinese peoples were graphic pejoratives, the character for the Yao people, for instance, was changed from \"yao\" 猺 \"jackal\" to \"yao\" 瑤 \"precious jade\" in the modern period. The original Hua–Yi distinction between \"Chinese\" and \"barbarian\" was based on culture and power but not on race.\n\nHistorically, the Chinese used various words for foreign ethnic groups. They include terms like 夷 \"Yi\", which is often translated as \"barbarians.\" Despite this conventional translation, there are also other ways of translating \"Yi\" into English. Some of the examples include \"foreigners,\" \"ordinary others,\" \"wild tribes,\" \"uncivilized tribes,\" and so forth.\n\nChinese historical records mention what may now perhaps be termed \"barbarian\" peoples for over four millennia, although this considerably predates the Greek language origin of the term \"barbarian\", at least as is known from the thirty-four centuries of written records in the Greek language. The sinologist Herrlee Glessner Creel said, \"Throughout Chinese history \"the barbarians\" have been a constant motif, sometimes minor, sometimes very major indeed. They figure prominently in the Shang oracle inscriptions, and the dynasty that came to an end only in 1912 was, from the Chinese point of view, barbarian.\"\n\nShang dynasty (1600–1046 BC) oracles and bronze inscriptions first recorded specific Chinese exonyms for foreigners, often in contexts of warfare or tribute. King Wu Ding (r. 1250–1192 BC), for instance, fought with the Guifang 鬼方, Di 氐, and Qiang 羌 \"barbarians.\"\n\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC), the meanings of four exonyms were expanded. \"These included Rong, Yi, Man, and Di—all general designations referring to the barbarian tribes.\" These \"Siyi\" 四夷 \"Four Barbarians\", most \"probably the names of ethnic groups originally,\" were the Yi or Dongyi 東夷 \"eastern barbarians,\" Man or Nanman 南蠻 \"southern barbarians,\" Rong or Xirong 西戎 \"western barbarians,\" and Di or Beidi 北狄 \"northern barbarians.\" The Russian anthropologist Mikhail Kryukov concluded.\nThe Chinese classics use compounds of these four generic names in localized \"barbarian tribes\" exonyms such as \"west and north\" \"Rongdi\", \"south and east\" \"Manyi\", \"Nanyibeidi\" \"barbarian tribes in the south and the north,\" and \"Manyirongdi\" \"all kinds of barbarians.\" Creel says the Chinese evidently came to use \"Rongdi\" and \"Manyi\" \"as generalized terms denoting 'non-Chinese,' 'foreigners,' 'barbarians',\" and a statement such as \"the Rong and Di are wolves\" (\"Zuozhuan\", Min 1) is \"very much like the assertion that many people in many lands will make today, that 'no foreigner can be trusted'.\"\n\nThis word \"Yi\" has both specific references, such as to \"Huaiyi\" 淮夷 peoples in the Huai River region, and generalized references to \"barbarian; foreigner; non-Chinese.\" \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" translates \"Yi\" as \"Anc[ient] barbarian tribe on east border, any border or foreign tribe.\" The sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank says the name \"Yi\" \"furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian',\" but \"Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most civilized of the non-Chinese peoples.\n\nSome Chinese classics romanticize or idealize barbarians, comparable to the western noble savage construct. For instance, the Confucian \"Analects\" records:\nThe translator Arthur Waley noted that, \"A certain idealization of the 'noble savage' is to be found fairly often in early Chinese literature\", citing the \"Zuo Zhuan\" maxim, \"When the Emperor no longer functions, learning must be sought among the 'Four Barbarians,' north, west, east, and south.\" Professor Creel said,\nFrom ancient to modern times the Chinese attitude toward people not Chinese in culture—\"barbarians\"—has commonly been one of contempt, sometimes tinged with fear ... It must be noted that, while the Chinese have disparaged barbarians, they have been singularly hospitable both to individuals and to groups that have adopted Chinese culture. And at times they seem to have had a certain admiration, perhaps unwilling, for the rude force of these peoples or simpler customs.\n\nIn a somewhat related example, Mencius believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless, and thus followed by both Hua and Yi, \"Shun was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T'iao. King Wen was a Western barbarian; he was born in Ch'i Chou and died in Pi Ying. Their native places were over a thousand \"li\" apart, and there were a thousand years between them. Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms, their actions matched like the two halves of a tally. The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical.\"\n\nThe prominent (121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" character dictionary, defines \"yi\" 夷 as \"men of the east” 東方之人也. The dictionary also informs that \"Yi\" is not dissimilar from the \"Xia\" 夏, which means Chinese. Elsewhere in the \"Shuowen Jiezi\", under the entry of \"qiang\" 羌, the term \"yi\" is associated with benevolence and human longevity. \"Yi\" countries are therefore virtuous places where people live long lives. This is why Confucius wanted to go to \"yi\" countries when the \"dao\" could not be realized in the central states.\n\nSome Chinese characters used to transcribe non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative ethnic slurs, where the insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it. Take for instance, the Written Chinese transcription of \"Yao\" \"the Yao people\", who primarily live in the mountains of southwest China and Vietnam. When 11th-century Song Dynasty authors first transcribed the exonym \"Yao\", they insultingly chose \"yao\" 猺 \"jackal\" from a lexical selection of over 100 characters pronounced \"yao\" (e.g., 腰 \"waist\", 遙 \"distant\", 搖 \"shake\"). During a series of 20th-century Chinese language reforms, this graphic pejorative 猺 (written with the 犭\"dog/beast radical\") \"jackal; the Yao\" was replaced twice; first with the invented character \"yao\" 傜 (亻\"human radical\") \"the Yao\", then with \"yao\" 瑤 (玉 \"jade radical\") \"precious jade; the Yao.\" Chinese orthography (symbols used to write a language) can provide unique opportunities to write ethnic insults logographically that do not exist alphabetically. For the Yao ethnic group, there is a difference between the transcriptions \"Yao\" 猺 \"jackal\" and \"Yao\" 瑤 \"jade\" but none between the romanizations \"Yao\" and \"Yau\".\n\nAccording to the archeologist William Meacham, it was only by the time of the late Shang dynasty that one can speak of \"Chinese,\" \"Chinese culture,\" or \"Chinese civilization.\" \"There is a sense in which the traditional view of ancient Chinese history is correct (and perhaps it originated ultimately in the first appearance of dynastic civilization): those on the fringes and outside this esoteric event were \"barbarians\" in that they did not enjoy (or suffer from) the fruit of civilization until they were brought into close contact with it by an imperial expansion of the civilization itself.\"\nIn a similar vein, Creel explained the significance of Confucian \"li\" \"ritual; rites; propriety\".\nThe fundamental criterion of \"Chinese-ness,\" anciently and throughout history, has been cultural. The Chinese have had a particular way of life, a particular complex of usages, sometimes characterized as \"li\". Groups that conformed to this way of life were, generally speaking, considered Chinese. Those that turned away from it were considered to cease to be Chinese. ... It was the process of acculturation, transforming barbarians into Chinese, that created the great bulk of the Chinese people. The barbarians of Western Chou times were, for the most part, future Chinese, or the ancestors of future Chinese. This is a fact of great importance. ... It is significant, however, that we almost never find any references in the early literature to physical differences between Chinese and barbarians. Insofar as we can tell, the distinction was purely cultural.\nDikötter says,\nThought in ancient China was oriented towards the world, or \"tianxia\", \"all under heaven.\" The world was perceived as one homogenous unity named \"great community\" (\"datong\") The Middle Kingdom [China], dominated by the assumption of its cultural superiority, measured outgroups according to a yardstick by which those who did not follow the \"Chinese ways\" were considered \"barbarians.\" A Theory of \"using the Chinese ways to transform the barbarian\" as strongly advocated. It was believed that the barbarian could be culturally assimilated. In the Age of Great Peace, the barbarians would flow in and be transformed: the world would be one. \n\nAccording to the Pakistani academic M. Shahid Alam, \"The centrality of culture, rather than race, in the Chinese world view had an important corollary. Nearly always, this translated into a civilizing mission rooted in the premise that 'the barbarians could be culturally assimilated'\"; namely \"laihua\" 來化 \"come and be transformed\" or \"Hanhua\" 漢化 \"become Chinese; be sinicized.\"\n\nTwo millennia before the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss wrote \"The Raw and the Cooked\", the Chinese differentiated \"raw\" and \"cooked\" categories of barbarian peoples who lived in China. The \"shufan\" 熟番 \"cooked [food eating] barbarians\" are sometimes interpreted as Sinicized, and the \"shengfan\" 生番 \"raw [food eating] barbarians\" as not Sinicized.\nThe \"Liji\" gives this description.\nThe people of those five regions – the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi] (and other wild tribes around them) – had all their several natures, which they could not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called [Yi]. They had their hair unbound, and tattooed their bodies. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the south were called Man. They tattooed their foreheads, and had their feet turned toward each other. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the west were called [Rong]. They had their hair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food. Those on the north were called [Di]. They wore skins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them did not eat grain-food.\n\nDikötter explains the close association between nature and nurture. \"The \"shengfan\", literally 'raw barbarians', were considered savage and resisting. The \"shufan\", or 'cooked barbarians', were tame and submissive. The consumption of raw food was regarded as an infallible sign of savagery that affected the physiological state of the barbarian.\"\n\nSome Warring States period texts record a belief that the respective natures of the Chinese and the barbarian were incompatible. Mencius, for instance, once stated: \"I have heard of the Chinese converting barbarians to their ways, but not of their being converted to barbarian ways.\" Dikötter says, \"The nature of the Chinese was regarded as impermeable to the evil influences of the barbarian; no retrogression was possible. Only the barbarian might eventually change by adopting Chinese ways.\"\n\nHowever, different thinkers and texts convey different opinions on this issue. The prominent Tang Confucian Han Yu, for example, wrote in his essay \"Yuan Dao\" the following: \"When Confucius wrote the \"Chunqiu\", he said that if the feudal lords use Yi ritual, then they should be called Yi; If they use Chinese rituals, then they should be called Chinese.\" Han Yu went on to lament in the same essay that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings. Therefore, Han Yu's essay shows the possibility that the Chinese can lose their culture and become the uncivilized outsiders, and that the uncivilized outsiders have the potential to become Chinese.\n\nAfter the Song Dynasty, many of China's rulers in the north were of Inner Asia ethnicities, such as Qidan, Ruzhen, and Mongols of the Liao, Jin and Yuan Dynasties, the latter ended up ruling over the entire China. Hence, the historian John King Fairbank wrote, \"the influence on China of the great fact of alien conquest under the Liao-Jin-Yuan dynasties is just beginning to be explored.\" During the Qing Dynasty, the rulers of China adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven to rule China. At the same time, they also tried to retain their own indigenous culture. Due to the Manchus' adoption of Han Chinese culture, most Han Chinese (though not all) did accept the Manchus as the legitimate rulers of China. Similarly, according to Fudan University historian Yao Dali, even the supposedly \"patriotic\" hero Wen Tianxiang of the late Song and early Yuan period did not believe the Mongol rule to be illegitimate. In fact, Wen was willing to live under Mongol rule as long as he was not forced to be a Yuan dynasty official, out of his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Yao explains that Wen chose to die in the end because he was forced to become a Yuan official. So, Wen chose death due to his loyalty to his dynasty, not because he viewed the Yuan court as a non-Chinese, illegitimate regime and therefore refused to live under their rule. Yao also says that many Chinese who were living in the Yuan-Ming transition period also shared Wen's beliefs of identifying with and putting loyalty towards one's dynasty above racial/ethnic differences. Many Han Chinese writers did not celebrate the collapse of the Mongols and the return of the Han Chinese rule in the form of the Ming dynasty government at that time. Many Han Chinese actually chose not to serve in the new Ming court at all due to their loyalty to the Yuan. Some Han Chinese also committed suicide on behalf of the Mongols as a proof of their loyalty. We should note that the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, also indicated that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China. On a side note, one of his key advisors, Liu Ji, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that the Chinese were and are superior to the \"Yi.\"\n\nThese things show that many times, pre-modern Chinese did view culture (and sometimes politics) rather than race and ethnicity as the dividing line between the Chinese and the non-Chinese. In many cases, the non-Chinese could and did become the Chinese and vice versa, especially when there was a change in culture.\n\nAccording to the historian Frank Dikötter, \"The delusive myth of a Chinese antiquity that abandoned racial standards in favour of a concept of cultural universalism in which all barbarians could ultimately participate has understandably attracted some modern scholars. Living in an unequal and often hostile world, it is tempting to project the utopian image of a racially harmonious world into a distant and obscure past.\"\n\nThe politician, historian, and diplomat K. C. Wu analyzes the origin of the characters for the \"Yi\", \"Man\", \"Rong\", \"Di\", and \"Xia\" peoples and concludes that the \"ancients formed these characters with only one purpose in mind—to describe the different ways of living each of these people pursued.\" Despite the well-known examples of pejorative exonymic characters (such as the \"dog radical\" in Di), he claims there is no hidden racial bias in the meanings of the characters used to describe these different peoples, but rather the differences were \"in occupation or in custom, not in race or origin.\" K. C. Wu says the modern character 夷 designating the historical \"Yi peoples,\" composed of the characters for 大 \"big (person)\" and 弓 \"bow\", implies a big person carrying a bow, someone to perhaps be feared or respected, but not to be despised. However, differing from K. C. Wu, the scholar Wu Qichang believes that the earliest oracle bone script for \"yi\" 夷 was used interchangeably with \"shi\" 尸 \"corpse\". The historian John Hill explains that \"Yi\" \"was used rather loosely for non-Chinese populations of the east. It carried the connotation of people ignorant of Chinese culture and, therefore, 'barbarians'.\"\n\nChristopher I. Beckwith makes the extraordinary claim that the name \"barbarian\" should only be used for Greek historical contexts, and is inapplicable for all other \"peoples to whom it has been applied either historically or in modern times.\" Beckwith notes that most specialists in East Asian history, including him, have translated Chinese exonyms as English \"\"barbarian\".\" He believes that after academics read his published explanation of the problems, except for direct quotations of \"earlier scholars who use the word, it should no longer be used as a term by any writer.\"\n\nThe first problem is that, \"it is impossible to translate the word \"barbarian\" into Chinese because the concept does not exist in Chinese,\" meaning a single \"completely generic\" loanword from Greek \"barbar-\". \"Until the Chinese borrow the word \"barbarian\" or one of its relatives, or make up a new word that explicitly includes the same basic ideas, they cannot express the idea of the 'barbarian' in Chinese.\". The usual Standard Chinese translation of English \"barbarian\" is \"yemanren\" (), which Beckwith claims, \"actually means 'wild man, savage'. That is very definitely not the same thing as 'barbarian'.\" Despite this semantic hypothesis, Chinese-English dictionaries regularly translate \"yemanren\" as \"barbarian\" or \"barbarians.\" Beckwith concedes that the early Chinese \"apparently disliked foreigners in general and looked down on them as having an inferior culture,\" and pejoratively wrote some exonyms. However, he purports, \"The fact that the Chinese did not \"like\" foreigner Y and occasionally picked a transcriptional character with negative meaning (in Chinese) to write the sound of his ethnonym, is irrelevant.\"\n\nBeckwith's second problem is with linguists and lexicographers of Chinese. \"If one looks up in a Chinese-English dictionary the two dozen or so partly generic words used for various foreign peoples throughout Chinese history, one will find most of them defined in English as, in effect, 'a kind of barbarian'. Even the works of well-known lexicographers such as Karlgren do this.\"\nAlthough Beckwith does not cite any examples, the Swedish sinologist Bernhard Karlgren edited two dictionaries: \"Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese\" (1923) and \"Grammata Serica Recensa\" (1957). Compare Karlgrlen's translations of the \"siyi\" \"four barbarians\":\nThe \"Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus\" Project includes Karlgren's \"GSR\" definitions. Searching the STEDT Database finds various \"a kind of\" definitions for plant and animal names (e.g., \"you\" 狖 \"a kind of monkey,\" but not one \"a kind of barbarian\" definition. Besides faulting Chinese for lacking a general \"barbarian\" term, Beckwith also faults English, which \"has no words for the many foreign peoples referred to by one or another Classical Chinese word, such as 胡 \"hú\", 夷 \"yí\", 蠻 \"mán\", and so on.\"\n\nThe third problem involves Tang Dynasty usages of \"fan\" \"foreigner\" and \"lu\" \"prisoner\", neither of which meant \"barbarian.\" Beckwith says Tang texts used \"fan\" 番 or 蕃 \"foreigner\" (see \"shengfan\" and \"shufan\" above) as \"perhaps the only true generic at any time in Chinese literature, was practically the opposite of the word \"barbarian\". It meant simply 'foreign, foreigner' without any pejorative meaning.\" In modern usage, \"fan\" 番 means \"foreigner; barbarian; aborigine\". The linguist Robert Ramsey illustrates the pejorative connotations of \"fan\".\nThe word \"Fān\" was formerly used by the Chinese almost innocently in the sense of 'aborigines' to refer to ethnic groups in South China, and Mao Zedong himself once used it in 1938 in a speech advocating equal rights for the various minority peoples. But that term has now been so systematically purged from the language that it is not to be found (at least in that meaning) even in large dictionaries, and all references to Mao's 1938 speech have excised the offending word and replaced it with a more elaborate locution, \"Yao, Yi, and Yu.\"\nThe Tang Dynasty Chinese also had a derogatory term for foreigners, \"lu\" () \"prisoner, slave, captive\". Beckwith says it means something like \"those miscreants who should be locked up,\" therefore, \"The word does not even mean 'foreigner' at all, let alone 'barbarian'.\"\n\nChristopher I. Beckwith's 2009 \"The Barbarians\" epilogue provides many references, but overlooks H. G. Creel's 1970 \"The Barbarians\" chapter. Creel descriptively wrote, \"Who, in fact, were the barbarians? The Chinese have no single term for them. But they were all the non-Chinese, just as for the Greeks the barbarians were all the non-Greeks.\" Beckwith prescriptively wrote, \"The Chinese, however, have still not yet borrowed Greek \"barbar\"-. There is also no single native Chinese word for 'foreigner', no matter how pejorative,\" which meets his strict definition of \"barbarian.\".\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty houses of pleasure, where drinking games were common, small puppets in the aspect of Westerners, in a ridiculous state of drunkenness, were used in one popular permutation of the drinking game; so, in the form of blue-eyed, pointy nosed, and peak-capped barbarians, these puppets were manipulated in such a way as to occasionally fall down: then, whichever guest to whom the puppet pointed after falling was then obliged by honor to empty his cup of Chinese wine.\n\nWhen Europeans came to Japan, they were called , literally \"Barbarians from the South\", because the Portuguese ships appeared to sail from the South. The Dutch, who arrived later, were also called either \"nanban\" or , literally meaning \"Red Hair.\"\n\nIn the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, the Sanskrit word \"barbara-\" meant \"stammering, wretch, foreigner, sinful people, low and barbarous\".\n\nAccording to Romila Thapar, the Indo-Aryan semi-nomadic people viewed the indigenous people as barbarians when they arrived. Indo-Aryan used the term \"mleccha\" in referring to people \"outside the caste system and ritual ambience.\" \n\nIn Mesoamerica the Aztec civilization used the word \"Chichimeca\" to denominate a group of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes that lived on the outskirts of the Triple Alliance's Empire, in the north of Modern Mexico, and whom the Aztec people saw as primitive and uncivilized. One of the meanings attributed to the word \"Chichimeca\" is \"dog people\".\n\nThe Incas of South America used the term \"puruma auca\" for all peoples living outside the rule of their empire (see Promaucaes).\n\nThe British, and later the white colonial settlers of the United States, referred to Native Americans as \"savages.\"\n\nThe entry of \"barbarians\" into mercenary service in a metropole repeatedly occurs in history as a standard way in which peripheral peoples from and beyond frontier regions relate to \"civilised\" imperial powers as part of a (semi-)foreign militarised proletariat.\nExamples include:\n\nItalians in the Renaissance often called anyone who lived outside of their country a barbarian. As an example, there is the last chapter of The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli, \"Exhortatio ad Capesendam Italiam in Libertatemque a Barbaris Vinsicandam\" (in English: Exhortation to take Italy and free her from the barbarians) in which he appeals to Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino to unite Italy and stop the \"barbarian invasions\" led by other European rulers, such as Charles VIII and Louis XII, both of France, and Ferdinand II of Aragon.\n\nSpanish sea captain Francisco de Cuellar, who sailed with the Spanish Armada in 1588, used the term 'savage' ('salvaje') to describe the Irish people.\n\nIn her 1916 anti-war pamphlet \"The Crisis of German Social Democracy\", Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg writes: Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.Luxemburg attributed it to Friedrich Engels, though – as shown by Michael Löwy – Engels had not used the term \"Barbarism\" but a less resounding formulation: \"If the whole of modern society is not to perish, a revolution in the mode of production and distribution must take place.\" The case has been made that Luxemburg had remembered a passage from \"The Erfurt Program\", written in 1892 by Karl Kautsky, and mistakenly attributed it to Engels:As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue; we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism.Luxemburg went on to explain what she meant by \"Regression into Barbarism\": \"A look around us at this moment [i.e., 1916 Europe] shows what the regression of bourgeois society into Barbarism means. This World War is a regression into Barbarism. The triumph of Imperialism leads to the annihilation of civilization. At first, this happens sporadically for the duration of a modern war, but then when the period of unlimited wars begins it progresses toward its inevitable consequences. Today, we face the choice exactly as Friedrich Engels foresaw it a generation ago: either the triumph of Imperialism and the collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome, depopulation, desolation, degeneration – a great cemetery. Or the victory of Socialism, that means the conscious active struggle of the International Proletariat against Imperialism and its method of war.\"\n\n\"Socialism or Barbarism\" became, and remains, an often quoted and influential concept in Marxist literature. \"Barbarism\" is variously interpreted as meaning either a technologically advanced but extremely exploitative and oppressive society (e.g. a victory and world domination by Nazi Germany and its Fascist allies); a collapse of technological civilization due to Capitalism causing a Nuclear War or ecological disaster; or the one form of barbarism bringing on the other.\n\nThe Internationalist Communist Tendency considers \"Socialism or Barbarism\" to be a variant of the earlier \"Liberty or Death\", used by revolutionaries of different stripes since the late 18th century \n\nModern popular culture contains such fantasy barbarians as Conan the Barbarian. In such fantasy, the negative connotations traditionally associated with \"Barbarian\" are often inverted. For example, \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" (1932), the first of Robert E. Howard's \"Conan\" series, is set soon after the \"Barbarian\" protagonist had forcibly seized the turbulent kingdom of Aquilonia from King Numedides, whom he strangled upon his throne. The story is clearly slanted to imply that the kingdom greatly benefited by power passing from a decadent and tyrannical hereditary monarch to a strong and vigorous Barbarian usurper.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

This is distinct from and must not be confused with the boundary problem in the philosophy of science that is also called the demarcation problem.\n\nIn spatial analysis, four major problems interfere with an accurate estimation of the statistical parameter: the boundary problem, scale problem, pattern problem (or spatial autocorrelation), and modifiable areal unit problem (Barber 1988). The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbours in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbours. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with area data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary.\n\nIn geographical research, two types of areas are taken into consideration in relation to the boundary: an area surrounded by fixed natural boundaries (e.g., coastlines or streams), outside of which neighbours do not exist (Henley 1981), or an area included in a larger region defined by arbitrary artificial boundaries (e.g., an air pollution boundary in modeling studies or an urban boundary in population migration) (Haining 1990). In an area isolated by the natural boundaries, the spatial process discontinues at the boundaries. In contrast, if a study area is delineated by the artificial boundaries, the process continues beyond the area.\n\nIf a spatial process in an area occurs beyond a study area or has an interaction with neighbours outside artificial boundaries, the most common approach is to neglect the influence of the boundaries and assume that the process occurs at the internal area. However, such an approach leads to a significant model misspecification problem (Upton and Fingleton 1985).\n\nThat is, for measurement or administrative purposes, geographic boundaries are drawn, but the boundaries per se can bring about different spatial patterns in geographic phenomena (BESR 2002). It has been reported that the difference in the way of drawing the boundary significantly affects identification of the spatial distribution and estimation of the statistical parameters of the spatial process (Cressie 1992; Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993; Griffith 1983; Martin 1987). The difference is largely based on the fact that spatial processes are generally unbounded or fuzzy-bounded (Leung 1987) but the processes are expressed in data imposed within boundaries for analysis purposes (Miller 1999). Although the boundary problem was discussed in relation to artificial and arbitrary boundaries, the effect of the boundaries also occurs according to natural boundaries as long as it is ignored that properties at sites on the natural boundary such as streams are likely to differ from those at sites within the boundary (Martin 1989).\n\nThe boundary problem occurs with regard not only to horizontal boundaries but also to vertically drawn boundaries according to delineations of heights or depths (Pineda 1993). For example, biodiversity such as the density of species of plants and animals is high near the surface, so if the identically divided height or depth is used as a spatial unit, it is more likely to find fewer number of the plant and animal species as the height or depth increases.\n\nBoundary problem: urban sprawl in central Florida (an evaluation by land cover analysis with raster datasets vs. an evaluation by population density bounded in the census tract)\n\nBy drawing a boundary around a study area, two types of problems in measurement and analysis takes place (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). The first is an edge effect. This effect originates from the ignorance of interdependences that occur outside the bounded region. Griffith (1980; 1983) and Griffith and Amrhein (1983) highlighted problems according to the edge effect. A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighbouring municipality (McGuire 1995).\n\nThe second is a shape effect that results from the artificial shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration of the effect of the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities (Arlinghaus and Nystuen 1990; Ferguson and Kanaroglou 1998; Griffith 1982). For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an artificial boundary. Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys (Rogerson 1990) or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems (Kirby 1997). From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from BESR 2002) argued that measures of urban sprawl should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas.\n\nIn spatial analysis, the boundary problem has been discussed along with the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) inasmuch as MAUP is associated with the arbitrary geographic unit and the unit is defined by the boundary (Rogerson 2006). For administrative purposes, data for policy indicators are usually aggregated within larger units (or enumeration units) such as census tracts, school districts, municipalities and counties. The artificial units serve the purposes of taxation and service provision. For example, municipalities can effectively respond to the need of the public in their jurisdictions. However, in such spatially aggregated units, spatial variations of detailed social variables cannot be identified. The problem is noted when the average degree of a variable and its unequal distribution over space are measured (BESR 2002).\n\n\n"}

There are bridges over canals, still standing from Roman times.\n\nOne of the canals is suggested to originate from a mountain near Labweh extending to Qusair. Labweh has several archaeological sites of interest including three old caves with Roman-Byzantine sarcophagi and the remains of a temple. There are also remains of a Byzantine bastion and a Roman dam suggested to date to the reign of Queen Zenobia.

Bard Award for Distinguished Architecture and Urban Design, which not only conferred honors on top city buildings but also used the occasion to comment on the state of municipal architecture in general.\n\nThe City Club was founded as a gentlemen's club in March 1892 by a group of 23 men, including such prominent names as August Belmont, Jr., James C. Carter, John Jay Chapman, R. Fulton Cutting, W. Bayard Cutting, Charles DeKay, George C. Magoun, George Haven Putnam, and John Woodruff Simpson. Spurred by international law expert Edmond Kelly (1851–1909), their mission was to:\nThe first club president was James C. Carter. The group first met as a club in June 1892 at a dinner of about 200 men at Sherry's. Membership soon grew to about 350 men.\n\nThe City Club's first target was Tammany Hall; they helped the Lexow Committee probe into police corruption, and worked to elect William Lafayette Strong in 1895 as the reform mayor of New York. In 1897 the City Club helped organize the Citizens Union. Their activities were closely documented by \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn 1913 the City Club commissioned a large boulder to commemorate the burial site of Captain Thomas Willett (died 1674), the first English mayor of New York, at Little Neck Cemetery, East Providence, Rhode Island. By the 1920s the City Club was advocating on behalf of making the city safer in areas like urban planning and transportation; they also expanded their advocacy to the State of New York as a whole. They published an annual \"Murder Map,\" documenting the deaths of children due to traffic accidents and other unsafe urban conditions. In May 1937 the City Club bestowed its first annual \"Citation for Meritorious Service\" to New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. \n\nDespite their earlier commendation of Robert Moses' work, as time moved on the club opposed many of Moses' plans for the development of New York City: it successfully organized opposition to the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge project and was instrumental in the preservation of Castle Clinton. In the late 1930s and early 1940s lawyer and civic activist Albert S. Bard exercised his influence in civic and urban affairs through his work on City Club committees. The Albert S. Bard Award (see below) was later named in his honor. The City Club celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 1942; among those in attendance were New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, New York State Lieutenant Governor Charles Poletti, and former Governor Al Smith.\n\nFrom 1962–1997, the City Club hosted roundtable luncheons, held every Friday except during the summer. Invited speakers (usually members) made presentations before the City Club. The luncheon presentations were aired live by WNYC-AM until 1987, when the station instead taped the luncheons and aired them during off-peak hours.\n\nThe City Club caused controversy In 1967 in a strongly worded article by activist Chairman I. D. Robbins about the perceived failures of the John Lindsay administration, particularly in regard to housing. Some club members objected to the article, asserting that it did not represent the official City Club position. Robbins offered to resign but was not allowed to.\n\nIn 1973, the City Club of New York celebrated its 80th anniversary with a gala dinner at the New York Hilton. Attendees included New York Mayor John Lindsay and former Mayor Robert F. Wagner (both of whom had been heavily criticized by the City Club at various times). At the gala, the City Club handed out 23 \"For New York\" awards to citizens who dedicated themselves to bettering the city. Recipients included John Chancellor, Walter Cronkite, Lloyd Goodrich, Ada Louise Huxtable, Willie Mays, Arthur Mitchell, Bess Myerson, John Bertram Oakes, Joseph Papp, I. M. Pei, Dorothy Schiff, Neil Simon, Preston Robert Tisch, and Lila Bell Wallace.\n\nIn 1977, the City Club inaugurated the Richard S. Childs Lectureship in Municipal Administration. In 1982 San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros delivered a Childs Lecture on the topic \"A Survival Strategy for America's Cities.\" Other Childs Lecture speakers over the years included Governor Mario Cuomo, I. D. Robbins, Richard Ravitch, and Robert F. Wagner Jr. The Childs Lecture series lasted until 1992.\n\nIn 1984 the City Club elected Sally Goodgold as its first female president; she was noted for her ability to attract high-profile names to the Club's weekly luncheon speaker series.\n\nThe club suspended activities in 2003 and officially dissolved in 2009.\n\nIn 2013 the club hired a new president, Michael S. Gruen, and resumed its role of civic advocacy, taking on New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's East Midtown rezoning plans.\n\nThe Club's first headquarters, located at 677 Fifth Avenue, was secured in October 1892.\n\nBy the early 1900s the City Club commissioned its own clubhouse at 55 West 44th Street, which was designed by architect Austin W. Lord and erected in 1904. After 40 years at that location, in 1944 the club moved to the Hotel Russell at 45 Park Avenue. (The 44th Street structure is now the City Club Hotel.)\n\nThe City Club is currently located at 45 West 67th Street in Manhattan.\n\nSocialite and philanthropist Peter Marié was an early member of the City Club, as were publisher Frank Howard Dodd and businessman Hamilton McKown Twombly. Architect and town planner Electus D. Litchfield was a City Club member.\n\nIn 1892 the club's membership was more than 650 men, and by 1904, membership was 667 (including 195 lawyers, 61 bankers, 31 doctors, 28 stockbrokers, 26 editors and writers, and 13 clergymen).\n\nBy 1950 City Club membership was down to 200 men and the club had been unsuccessful at recruiting a new generation of civic-minded applicants. In February 1950 they voted to disband, stating that the work they had been doing should be \"entrusted to the Citizens Union ..., which has the staff to carry on...\" Shortly thereafter, however, the club was revived with an influx of younger men, and it vowed to continue its work.\n\nIn 1969, club membership was about 200 men, but had increased to about 400 in 1973.\n\nIn 1974 the City Club of New York opened its membership to women.\n\nIn 2011 the City Club had 450 members.\n\n\"Notable City Club of New York officers, past and present\"\n\n\n\nThe Albert S. Bard Award (full name Albert S. Bard Award for Distinguished Architecture and Urban Design) created in 1962 and administered by the City Club, honored those who helped enrich the intellectual and cultural life of the community through architecture and urban design. The award was conceived by City Club member architect Leon Brand, who envisioned \"an architectural prize intended to raise the standard of excellence for building design in New York City.\"\n\nThe Bard Award was born into controversy when the City Club refused to present any awards in its inaugural year, claiming that they were unable to find \"a single work of civic architecture created in the city since 1958 worthy\" of the award. The New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects sharply criticized the City Club for this pronouncement. (Awards were given the following year, and most years after that.)\n\nFor many years, the Bard Awards were distributed on alternate years for public and private buildings. Top awards were deemed \"First Honor;\" those that didn't reach such a high level were called \"Merit Awards.\" Award juries were composed of a rotating group of top architects and urban planners, as well as City Club of New York officers.\n\nThe City Club stopped presenting the Albert S. Bard Award in the early 1990s; winners included:\n\n\nIn 1967, in honor of their 75th anniversary, the City Club began presenting Distinguished New Yorker awards to a deserving citizen or citizens.

{"id": "817963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=817963", "title": "Didrik Pining", "text": "Didrik Pining\n\nDidrik Pining ( 1430 – 1491) was a German privateer, nobleman and governor of Iceland and Vardøhus. He is most notable because some have proposed that he may have landed in North America in the 1470s, almost twenty years before Columbus' voyages of discovery. Some of the claims concerning Pining are controversial because information about him is, in general, relatively sparse and partially contradictory.\n\nDidrik Pining has been found by modern German genealogists to have been a native of Hildesheim in Germany, and this has according to a report been \"suddenly and conclusively proved.\" It had been assumed that he was a Dane or Norwegian until the 1930s.\n\nIn Hanseatic records until 1468, he is mentioned as a privateer or captain in the service of Hamburg, charged with hunting down English merchant ships in the North Atlantic. From 1468 to 1478, he was in the service of Denmark (by 1470 as an \"admiral\") first under Christian I of Denmark (ruled 1448–1481), and later for his son, John of Denmark (ruled 1481–1513). Before his employment by the Danes, Pining and his partner Hans Pothorst had also been regarded by the Hanseatic League as \"pirates who did much damage to the Hanse towns.\" During the later years of the reign of Christian I, Pining and Pothorst are said to have distinguished themselves \"not less as capable seamen than as matchless freebooters.\"\n\nThe theory of the Pining voyage reaching America was published for the first time by Dr. Sofus Larsen of the University of Copenhagen in his book \"The Discovery of North America Twenty Years Before Columbus\" in 1925. Larsen based his claims on various sources (mainly three) which had no immediately apparent connection. Pining was according to Larsen appointed leader of an expedition to the north towards Greenland in the early 1470s. He, together with Hans Pothorst (also from Hildesheim), and the Portuguese explorers João Vaz Corte-Real and Álvaro Martins, were said to have been the principals in the expedition. The navigator was supposedly the semi-mythical figure named John Scolvus. According to Larsen, the mission likely started off from Bergen, went on through to Iceland and Greenland, and eventually discovered \"Terra do Bacalhau\", the \"Land of Codfish\", later presumed to be Newfoundland or Labrador. While it is known that Pining and Corte-Real were respectively appointed governors of Iceland (1478) and the Azores (1474), these appointments were according to Larsen a reward for having discovered the Land of Codfish.\n\nWhile Larsen's claims have enjoyed strong scholarly and public support in Scandinavia and Portugal, it has been more disputed among German scholars. Reception of the account by American and English historians has generally ranged from ridicule to acceptance of the plausibility of at least part of it. Many further circumstances are known to support the theory, although it is generally concluded that the theory is \"not proven\" (nor sufficiently \"disproven\"), with any possible \"final proof\" lacking.\n\nRegardless, no sources explicitly supports that Pining and Pothorst had any connections with the journey by Corte-Real, nor that they reached North America (excluding Greenland). What is known however, is that Pining and Pothorst were sent out by a royal Danish order to find out which of several possible policies concerning trade in Iceland should be developed, in which settlements and harbours. Pining's orders further included investigating what formerly, in the 11th century, had been called the \"regiones finitimae\" (i.e. \"the coasts opposite those still-remembered but obsolete settlements in Greenland\"). In 1476, they made this trip, which likely went to Greenland, where they were reported to have encountered hostile Inuit, and no Norse people. The location they visited is assumed by some to have been around Angmagssalik. Nothing specific suggests it went further west than this.\n\nIn 1478, Didrik Pining became the governor (\"höfuðsmaðr\") of Iceland, serving until 1481, when he is mentioned as having \"fared out of Iceland.\" He replaced the former governor Thorleif Björnsson, whose struggle to marry his own cousin Ingvild was supported by Pining. The following year, Thorleif gave Pining silver and a horn of walrus ivory to pay the king for a license for his union. The agreement was constituted in 1484, merging two of Iceland's most fortunate political dynasties. In the same year, there came complaints of Pining and his men having raped women and stolen money from farmers. In 1481, Pining was present at the funeral of Danish king Christian I. He also made state visits of homage to Bergen and Copenhagen, became knighted in Norway, and employed his personal coat of arms which featured a grappling hook. Some years later, in 1489 and 1490, he is again described as \"governor (\"hirdstjore\") over the whole of Iceland\" in two Icelandic laws or edicts (the so-called Pining's Laws). A later chronicler says about him that \"he was in many ways a serviceable man and put many things right that were wrong.\" His godson and nephew, Didrik Pining the Younger, succeeded him in 1490, and was governor for the two following years.\n\nPining, together with Hans Pothorst, patrolled North Atlantic waters and played prominent roles in the Anglo-Danish Naval War (1484–90). Around 1484, he captured, off the coast of England or Brittany and in the Spanish Sea, three Spanish or Portuguese ships which he brought to King John of Denmark in Copenhagen. He accompanied John to Bergen in 1486 as admiral of the royal fleet. In 1487, he led a fleet to the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, and secured it for Denmark. In a treaty concluded between John of Denmark and the Dutch in 1490, it is, however, expressly stated that Didrik Pining (and another admiral named Bartold Busch) were to be excluded from the peace. He was then also spoken of as a lord of Iceland. In the same year, Pining was appointed governor of Vardøhus, and may thus have been commander-in-chief of the seas and lands in northern waters.\n\nDidrik Pining likely died (was possibly killed) around Finnmark or the North Cape in 1491. In the \"Skibby Chronicle\", Pining (and Pothorst) are mentioned among many pirates who \"met with a miserable death, being either slain by their friends or hanged on the gallows or drowned in the waves of the sea,\" although this has been disputed by some modern historians.\n\nIn a letter to Christian III of Denmark in 1551, the mayor of Kiel, Carsten Griep, sent the king two maps of the north Atlantic made during the expeditions of Pining and Pothorst, \"who were sent out by your majesty's royal grandfather King Christian the First, at the request of his majesty of Portugal, with certain ships to explore new countries and islands in the north, have raised on the rock \"Wydthszerck\", lying off Greenland and towards \"Sniefeldsiekel\" in Iceland on the sea, a great sea-mark on account of the Greenland pirates (presumably Inuit).\"\nOlaus Magnus wrote in 1555 that Pining and Pothorst, due to their piracy, had \"by the Nordic kings been excluded from all human contact and declared outlaws, as a result of their extremely violent robberies and numerous cruel acts against all sailors that they could catch, whether close or distant.\" They then took refuge at a cliff called Hvidserken, which apparently was located between Iceland and Greenland. Magnus added that in \"1494\", the pirates created a giant compass out of a considerable circular space at the top of the cliff, with rings and lines formed of lead, to make it easier for them to know in which direction they could seek a great plunder. Modern historians have suggested that they may in fact have set up some mark at the coast of Greenland to reclaim it for the Danish king.\n\nIn 1625, a report from London talks about Pining and Pothorst (\"Punnus\" and \"Potharse\") and states that Pining \"gave the Islanders their Lawes,\" referred to later as Pining's Law, the written Icelandic law.\n\n\n"}

This is done by seeking to minimize each class’s average deviation from the class mean, while maximizing each class’s deviation from the means of the other groups. In other words, the method seeks to reduce the variance within classes and maximize the variance between classes.\n\nThe Jenks optimization method is directly related to Otsu's Method and Fisher's Discriminant Analysis.\n\nGeorge Frederick Jenks was a 20th-century American cartographer. Graduating with his Ph.D. in agricultural geography from Syracuse University in 1947, Jenks began his career under the tutelage of Richard Harrison, cartographer for TIME and Fortune magazine. He joined the faculty of the University of Kansas in 1949 and began to build the cartography program. During his 37-year tenure at KU, Jenks developed the Cartography program into one of three programs renowned for their graduate education in the field; the others being the University of Wisconsin and the University of Washington. Much of his time was spent developing and promoting improved cartographic training techniques and programs. He also spent significant time investigating three-dimensional maps, eye-movement research, thematic map communication, and geostatistics.\n\nJenks was a cartographer by profession. His work with statistics grew out of a desire to make choropleth maps more visually accurate for the viewer. In his paper, \"The Data Model Concept in Statistical Mapping\", he claims that by visualizing data in a three dimensional model cartographers could devise a “systematic and rational method for preparing choroplethic maps”. Jenks used the analogy of a “blanket of error” to describe the need to use elements other than the mean to generalize data. The three dimensional models were created to help Jenks visualize the difference between data classes. His aim was to generalize the data using as few planes as possible and maintain a constant “blanket of error”.\n\nThe method requires an iterative process. That is, calculations must be repeated using different breaks in the dataset to determine which set of breaks has the smallest in-class variance. The process is started by dividing the ordered data into groups. Initial group divisions can be arbitrary. There are four steps that must be repeated:\n\nNew class deviations are then calculated, and the process is repeated until the sum of the within class deviations reaches a minimal value.\n\nAlternatively, all break combinations may be examined, SDCM calculated for each combination, and the combination with the lowest SDCM selected. Since all break combinations are examined, this guarantees that the one with the lowest SDCM is found.\n\nFinally, the goodness of variance fit (GVF) is calculated. GVF is defined as (SDAM - SDCM) / SDAM. GVF ranges from 0 (worst fit) to 1 (perfect fit).\n\nJenks’ goal in developing this method was to create a map that was absolutely accurate, in terms of the representation of data’s spatial attributes. By following this process, Jenks claims, the “blanket of error” can be uniformly distributed across the mapped surface. He developed this with the intention of using relatively few data classes, less than seven, because that was the limit when using monochromatic shading on a choroplethic map.\n\nOther methods of data classification include Head/tail Breaks, Natural Breaks (without Jenks Optimization), Equal Interval, Quantile, and Standard Deviation.\n\n\n"}

He reported on the archaeological ruins of Great Zimbabwe in 1871 during his search for the biblical land of Ophir.\n\nIn 1871, Mauch discovered the stone ruins now known as Great Zimbabwe, five years after discovering the first gold mines in the Transvaal. Mauch believed that the ruins were the remnants of the lost biblical city of Ophir, described as the origin of the gold given by the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon. He did not believe that the structures could have been built by a previous local population similar to those which inhabited the area at the time of his excavation, and so pressed ahead with his research. Further research on the site (including one of the first archaeological uses of aviation) illustrated that the structures did indeed have African origin. \n\nBecause of the ethnocentrism popular in the 19th century, Mauch and his contemporaries have been intensely criticized for their assumptions about the site by modern archaeologists. The Great Zimbabwe site is now considered to have been built by ancestors of the Shona people between the 11th and 15th centuries CE.\n\nMauch died as a result of a fall from the third floor window of a hotel where he was living.

Its administrative center is the city of Krasnodar. The third most-populous federal subject, the krai had a population of 5,226,647 as of the 2010 Census.\n\nKrasnodar Krai is formally and informally referred to as Kuban, a term denoting former Kuban People's Republic and historic region of Kuban situated between the Sea of Azov and the Kuban River which is mostly composed of the krai's territory. It is bordered by Rostov Oblast to the north, Stavropol Krai to the east, Karachay-Cherkessia to the south-east, and Adygea is an enclave entirely within the krai. Krasnodar Krai shares an international border with Georgia to the south, and a disputed border with Crimea across the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe northern part of the krai belongs to the Don Steppe, while southern region's Mediterranean climate has made it a popular tourist location. Novorossiysk is Russia's main port on the Black Sea, one of the few cities awarded the title of the Hero City,\nand Sochi was host of the XXII Olympic Winter Games in 2014. Krasnodar Krai is home to significant infrastructure of the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nKrasnodar Krai is located in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus and borders with Rostov Oblast in the northeast, Stavropol Krai and Karachay-Cherkessia in the east, and with the Abkhazia region (internationally recognized as part of Georgia) in the south. The Republic of Adygea is completely encircled by the krai territory. The krai's Taman Peninsula is situated between the Sea of Azov in the north and the Black Sea in the south. In the west, the Kerch Strait separates the krai from the contested Crimean Peninsula, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine but under \"de facto\" Russian control. At its widest extent, the krai stretches for from north to south and for from east to west.\n\nThe krai is split into two distinct parts by the Kuban River, which gave its name to this entire geographic region. The southern, seaward part is the western extremity of the Caucasus range, lying within the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex ecoregion; the climate is Mediterranean or, in the southeast, subtropical. Historically it is known as Circassia. The northern part is a steppe zone which shares continental climate patterns. It is also known as Kuban region.\nThe height of the mountains exceeds , with Mount Tsakhvoa being the highest at . Mount Fisht, at , is the Great Caucasus' westernmost peak with a glacier.\nThe Black Sea coast stretches from the Kerch Strait to Adler and is shielded by Caucasus Mountains from the cold northern winds. Numerous small mountain rivers flow in the coastal areas, often creating picturesque waterfalls.\nLake Abrau, located in the wine-making region of Abrau-Dyurso, is the largest lake in the northeastern Caucasus region. Lake Ritsa is considered to be one of the most picturesque lakes in the region and \"the diamond of Caucasus\"; it is located in an intermountain basin at the height of above sea level.\n\nThe region's earliest known inhabitants are referred to, generically, as the \"Maiōtai\" (after the Greek name for the Sea of Azov). During the 6th century BCE, Pontic Greeks, founded the area's first cities, such as \"Phanagoria\" (near modern Sennoy) and \"Hermonassa\" (on the Taman Peninsula), who traded with nomadic tribes including the \"Skuthai\" (Scythians) and \"Sindi\".\n\nFrom the 8th to the 10th centuries, the area was dominated by the Khazars, a Turkic people who had earlier migrated from the east onto the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, where they reputedly converted to Judaism. After the defeat of the Khazar Khanate in 965 Kievan prince Svyatoslav conquered the area, it came under the rule of Kievan Rus', and it then formed the Tmutarakan principality. Later, due to the increasing claims of Byzantium at the end of the 11th century, the Tmutarakan principality came under the authority of the Byzantine emperors (until 1204).\n\nIn that period of history, the Circassians were first mentioned, under the ethnonym \"Kasogs\". For example, Rededi Prince Kasozhsky was mentioned in \"The Tale of Igor's Campaign\".\n\nIn 1243–1438 the current territory of the Kuban was part of the Golden Horde. After the collapse of the latter, parts of Kuban were held under the Crimean Khanate, Circassia, and the Ottoman Empire, which dominated the region. The Tsardom of Russia began to challenge the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire in the area during the Russian-Turkish wars.\n\nIn April 1783, by decree of Catherine II, right-bank Kuban and Taman Peninsula were annexed to the Russian Empire. In the years 1792–1793 Cossacks moved here from Zaporozhye, now located in Ukraine, and formed the Black Sea Area troops, with the creation of a solid cordon line for the Kuban River and the marginalization of the neighboring Circassians.\n\nDuring the campaign for control of the North Caucasus (Caucasian war 1763–1864) Russia pushed away the Ottoman Empire from the region, followed by elimination of local population (Circassians) as well. For this see Russian conquest of the Western Caucasus.\n\nIn 1783, the present northern territory of the Kuban region became part of Russia after the liquidation of the Crimean Khanate. A border garrison was located there from 1793–1794 in order to protect the Kuban River. The remaining area was relegated to the Cossacks, initiating development of the region. The administrative region was accorded the status of \"Land of Black Sea Cossack Army\".\n\nIn 1860, most of the occupied area of the territory of the modern Kuban-Krasnodar region was formed of, and controlled by, remnants of the Black Sea Cossack Host and the western part of the Caucasus Line Cossack Host, who were to become the Kuban Cossack Army.\n\nIn 1900, the region's population numbered around two million people. In 1913, the gross grain harvest Kuban region entered the 2nd place in Russia, for the production of marketable grain – in the 1st place.\nKrasnodar Krai was founded on 13 September 1937, when Azov-Black Sea Krai of the Russian SFSR was split up in Krasnodar Krai and Rostov Oblast.\nDuring the Soviet period, the high authority in the krai was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Krasnodar CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the Krai Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the Krai Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the krai administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.\n\nThe Charter of Krasnodar Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Krasnodar Krai is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the krai government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The krai administration supports the activities of the governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Krai Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.\n\nKrasnodar Krai is administratively divided into thirty-eight districts (\"raions\") and fifteen cities of district equivalence. The districts and cities are further subdivided into eleven towns, plus urban-type settlements, and rural okrugs and stanitsa okrugs.\n\nLarge companies in the region include Tander, Novorossmetal, Autonomous Heat Energy Company, Gazprom gas distribution Krasnodar, Evrokhim Chemical Fertilizers.\n\nSeveral lines of Russian Railways cross the region and link it with Abkhazia, Ukraine, and neighboring Russian regions. There are direct trains from resort cities like Sochi and Anapa to Moscow, via Krasnodar, which become very popular during the summer vacation season. There are also suburb train connections.\nThe Apsheronsk narrow-gauge railway, the longest mountain narrow-gauge railway in Russia, runs through Krasnodar Krai.\n\nThere are several airports in the region, including Krasnodar International Airport, Sochi International Airport, Anapa Airport, and Gelendzhik Airport.\n\nThe biggest ports are Novorossiysk and Tuapse. Others are Eisk and Temryuk on the Azov Sea, and Port Kavkaz, Taman, Anapa, Gelendzhik, and Sochi on the Black Sea. There is a Kerch Strait ferry line which connects Krasnodar Krai and Crimea.\n\n\"Population\": 5,404,300 (2014 est.); \n\nThe population of Krasnodar Krai is concentrated in the Kuban River drainage basin, which was traditionally Cossack land (see\" History of Cossacks\"). The Kuban Cossacks are now generally considered to be ethnic Russians, even though they are still an important minority in their own right in the area. Historically, they were considered to be ethnic Ukrainian, and reported their language as Ukrainian in censuses well into the 20th century; this change in identity is due to assimilation and historical persecution of the Kuban Cossacks, which was particularly prominent due to questions of their loyalty to Moscow and the Communist state during the Russian Revolution and First World War. Other notable ethnic groups are the Adyghe, who have lived in the Kuban area for thousands of years, and the Armenians (including Christian Hamsheni and Cherkesogai), who have lived in the region since at least the 18th century.\n\n\"Ethnic groups\": the 2010 Census identified ethnic groups, as shown in the following table:\n\n\nVital Statistics for 2007: Source\n\nVital Statistics for 2008:\n\n2009 - 1.59 | 2010 - 1.57 | 2011 - 1.58 | 2012 - 1.70 | 2013 - 1.72 | 2014 - 1.81 | 2015 - 1.84 | 2016 - 1.86(e)\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey 52.2% of the population of Krasnodar Krai adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 3% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 1% are either Orthodox Christian believers who don't belong to church or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, and 1% are Muslims. In addition, 22% of the population declares to be \"spiritual but not religious\", 13% is atheist, and 7.8% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.\nOn July 7, 2012, at least 171 people died in Krasnodar Krai, after torrential rains overnight caused the worst flooding and landslides in more than seventy years. Over of rain – the typical amount for a four- or five-month period – was reported to have fallen within forty-eight hours. A local police spokesman stated that most of the dead were in Krymsky District, where at least 159 died when a wave of water high swept through the town of Krymsk in the middle of the night. Ten more deaths occurred in Gelendzhik, including five electrocuted when a transformer fell into the floodwater, and two in Novorossiysk. Authorities stated that 17 people had been officially reported missing, and there were fears the death toll would rise further, while medics had hospitalized 210 people, including 16 children.\n\nThe regional government claimed that over 24,000 people were affected by the floods, with more than 3,000 evacuated, and that more than 10,000 rescuers and 140 helicopters were searching for victims and evacuating survivors. In Krymsk, 14 temporary shelters were set up to house around 2,000 evacuees. The transport system in the region was said to have collapsed, while oil shipments from Novorossiysk were halted when the port, located in the lower part of the city, was threatened by landslides. Russia's President Vladimir Putin flew to the area to hold emergency talks with officials in Krymsk, while authorities in Perm Krai dispatched a rescue team to evacuate dozens of children from the region, who had been staying at summer camps on the Black Sea coast.\n\nResidents of Krymsk claimed the wave of water that hit the town resulted from the sluice gates of a nearby reservoir being opened, although this was denied by the prosecutor general's investigative committee. Local prosecutors had earlier confirmed that the gates were opened, but stated that it was too early to determine whether this was the cause of the flooding.\n\n\n\n"}

Situated south of Weddell Sea and between longitudes 20°W and 80°W, stretching from Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole. That territory was unnamed until 2012, though most of it was unofficially known as Edith Ronne Land in 1947–68 and includes areas claimed by the United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina.\n\nOn the occasion of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London on 18 December 2012, it was announced there that a area of the British Antarctic Territory had been named Queen Elizabeth Land after The Queen. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, William Hague, said that the naming was \"a fitting tribute at the end of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee year\".\n\nQueen Elizabeth Land is nearly twice the size of the United Kingdom and is essentially a triangular segment of Antarctica, with one vertex at the South Pole. It is bounded on the North side by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, to the North East by Coats Land, on the East by Queen Maud Land and extending on the West side to a line between the South Pole and Rutford Ice Stream, east of Constellation Inlet. The Pensacola Mountains, discovered in January 1956, run for some along a north-east to south-west line along the centre of the territory. The area's name will be included on all British maps.\n\nArgentina, whose Argentine Antarctica claim overlaps with the British Antarctic Territory, criticised the naming calling it a \"systematic attack\" and described it as \"provocation\" after recent tensions over Argentina's claim to the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the naming, where they reminded that Russia was one of the original parties to the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 and calling for the full, unconditional and responsible compliance by all State parties with its provisions (which included the UK). According to the Russians, \"no acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial in Antarctica and do not create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1704228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1704228", "title": "Soil conservation", "text": "Soil conservation\n\nSoil conservation is the preventing of soil loss from erosion or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical soil contamination.\n\nSlash-and-burn and other unsustainable methods of subsistence farming are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale erosion, loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total desertification. Techniques for improved soil conservation include crop rotation, cover crops, conservation tillage and planted windbreaks and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nFarmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops, plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation.Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we name and value the land and what we call it and this can be changed by cultural adaptation.\n\nContour ploughing orients furrows following the contour lines of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces runoff. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient Phoenicians, and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent. Contour plowing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.\n\nTerracing is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.\n\nTerraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.\nIt protects the soil from its erosion. It is one of the way by which soil erosion can be stopped. It is the step can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. It restricts soil erosion. It is practiced in western and central Himalayas\n\nKeyline design is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the contour lines.\n\nTree, shrubs and ground-cover are effective perimeter treatment for soil erosion prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a “grass way” that both channels and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding surface runoff and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.\n\nWindbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of trees at the windward exposure of an agricultural field subject to wind erosion. Evergreen species provide year-round protection; however, as long as foliage is present in the seasons of bare soil surfaces, the effect of deciduous trees may be adequate.\n\nCover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as green manure that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.\n\nSoil-conservation farming involves no-till farming, “green manures” and other soil-enhancing practices. Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of barren lands. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of soil organic matter.\n\nRepeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.\n\nCritics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.\n\nSalinity in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.\nThe ions responsible for salination are: sodium (Na, potassium (K, calcium (Ca, magnesium (Mg and chlorine (Cl. Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s arable land. Soil salinity adversely affects crop metabolism and erosion usually follows.\n\nSalinity occurs on drylands from overirrigation and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil infiltration; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow saline water table capillary action occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change in the groundwater level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water table led to soil salination.\n\nUse of humic acids may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both anions and cations and eliminate them from root zones. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include saltbush, a plant found in much of North America and in the Mediterranean regions of Europe.\n\nPagal Organisms In Soil\nWhen worms excrete egesta in the form of casts, a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for root uptake. Earthworm casts are five times richer in available nitrogen, seven times richer in available phosphates and eleven times richer in available potash than the surrounding upper of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5 kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil porosity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.\n\nOther important soil organisms include nematodes, mycorrizha and bacteria.\n\nDegraded soil requires synthetic fertilizer to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.\n\nEach one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold 20,000 gallons more water per acre.\n\nTo allow plants full realization of their phytonutrient potential, active mineralization of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to combat mineral depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such as phosphorus and more exotic substances such as zinc and selenium. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.\n\nFlooding can bring significant sediments to an alluvial plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a floodplain is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.\n\n"}

Members commit to gradually ensuring that their sourcing practices promote the conservation of biodiversity, respect traditional knowledge and assure the equitable sharing of benefits all along the supply chain, following the Ethical BioTrade Standard. Members also commit to the UEBT verification system, which includes undergoing independent third party verification against the Ethical BioTrade Standard, developing a work-plan for gradual compliance for all natural, as well as the commitment to continuous improvement once compliance is achieved.\n\nUEBT is a membership-based organisation that was created in May 2007 in Geneva, Switzerland. It was conceptualized in response to multiple developments. First of all, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) acknowledged that additional efforts were needed to reach out to the private sector. The CBD recognized the strong link between business and biodiversity, as well as the dependency of industry on biodiversity and it highlighted the key role the private sector plays in sustainable use and the need for efforts and tools to engage it. In pursuit of the decisions that CBD parties had taken regarding private sector engagement and the use of standards in this, the idea of UEBT was conceived. The creation of the Union for Ethical BioTrade also responded to the need expressed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries for ways to differentiate biodiversity-based products in the market. Finally, UEBT built upon efforts initiated by the BioTrade Initiative of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was created to contribute to making biodiversity a strategy for sustainable development.\n\nOn 8 May 2007, a meeting of the founding members took place and the articles of association were approved. To support the efforts of the Union, the CBD and UEBT signed a Memorandum of Understanding in December 2008, to encourage companies involved in BioTrade to adopt and promote good practices.\n\nAlthough the CBD and CSD provide general principles, not much practical guidance is currently available to help business advance on the ethical sourcing of biodiversity. UEBT fills this gap and makes concrete contributions to biodiversity conservation and local sustainable development. UEBT aims to bring together actors committed to Ethical BioTrade, and promotes, facilitates and recognises ethical sourcing of biodiversity in line with the objectives of the CBD.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, UEBT supports its members in the membership process and in their work towards implementing the Ethical BioTrade Standard. It also provides technical support, organizes regular conferences and workshops around Access and Benefit Sharing and biodiversity, publishes papers and reports, and consults organisations on the ethical sourcing from biodiversity.\n\nUEBT manages the Ethical BioTrade Standard, which provides a basis for UEBT Trading Members to improve their biodiversity sourcing practices. UEBT members develop biodiversity management systems that further the implementation of the Ethical BioTrade Standard in all their own operations involving natural ingredients, as well as throughout their supply chains.\n\nIn joining UEBT, a company agrees to comply with the principles of Ethical BioTrade. This means using practices that promote the sustainable use of natural ingredients, while ensuring that all contributors along the supply chain are paid fair prices and share the benefits derived from the use of biodiversity. The Ethical BioTrade Standard is mainstreamed in the operations of UEBT trading members, including for instance in research, innovation and development.\n\nUEBT members undergo regular audits by independent third party verification bodies. UEBT works with the following Verification Bodies: Imaflora, SGS Qualifor, NaturaCert, Control Union Certifications, Ecocert SA, SGS del Peru S.A.C., Soil Association, IBD Certificações (IBD), Biotropico S.A., IMO do Brasil, and Rainforest Alliance.\n\nThe Ethical BioTrade Standard builds on the seven Principles and Criteria as developed by the UNCTAD BioTrade Initiative. First established in 2007, it was revised in April 2011, following the requirements of the ISEAL Alliance and the World Trade Organization (WTO). These requirements include the need to periodically review the Standard and ensure wide stakeholder involvement during the review process.\n\nEvery year the UEBT publishes the Biodiversity Barometer. The Biodiversity Barometer contains the results of awareness studies commissioned by UEBT and provides insights on evolving biodiversity awareness among consumers and how the beauty industry reports on biodiversity. The Barometer is used as one of the indicators for measuring progress towards meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Target 1 in the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership's Aichi Passport.\n\nThe Union for Ethical BioTrade has several types of trading members: brands, producers and processing companies, mainly in the global cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food sector. Current UEBT trading members include Natura, Weleda, Laboratoires Expanscience and Aroma Forest. UEBT also has affiliate members, which currently include the International Finance Corporation (IFC), MEB - Movimento Empresarial Brasileiro pela Biodiversidade, PhytoTrade Africa and Rongead.\n\nThe Union for Ethical BioTrade is financed by membership fees and contributions from donors.\n\nThe General Assembly acts as the main governing body of UEBT and meets once a year to elect the Members of the Board. The General Assembly is composed of all UEBT Members. Provisional, Trading and Affiliate Members have the right to vote and elect the Board of Directors, thereby approving the management of the organization. UNCTAD, the CBD and the International Finance Corporation act as observers to the Board. To support the functioning of UEBT, the Board has appointed various committees, including an appeals committee, a membership committee, and a standards committee.\n\n"}

The first meeting of the Upper House of the Territorial Legislature, in March 1862, occurred at William Tripp's house in Yankton.\n\nTripp played a part in the story of the first man officially convicted and jailed by the Dakota Territory. A man named Frank Sullivan was brought to Yankton in October of 1870, accused of stealing horses from the Indians. William Tripp managed to get him acquitted. However, while working for William's half-brother Bartlett, Sullivan forged an order for a suit of clothes, and fled when his crime was discovered. Brought back to Yankton, he escaped the jail and stole a horse from William Tripp. He was once more captured, while trying to use another forged order, this time from William Tripp, brought back, convicted, and sent to prison in December of 1871.\n\nWilliam Tripp and his half-brother Bartlett were both defense lawyers in the 1874 trial of Peter Wintermute for the murder of acting governor Edwin Stanton McCook. William was called as a witness at the trial.\n\nTripp married Sarah Adams Woods (1819-1897) in 1841 and had at least two children - William Wallace Tripp (1843-1863) and Flora Louisa Tripp Voter (1849-1913). Tripp and his wife were divorced in 1862 by act of the Dakota legislature. Tripp then married Martha Atwood (1822-1905) and had three children, two of whom died in infancy, and a son, Henry Tripp (1865-1933).\n\n"}
