The new structure replaced another SOM-designed building completed in 1965.\n\nThe headquarters of the American Bible Society originally stood on the site. Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill designed the original structure. It incorporated some Biblical symbolism, inspired by its anchor tenant. John Kriskiewicz, a Manhattan-based historian of architecture, referred to the original 1865 Broadway as “structurally expressive” but also expressed that it “might have left the public cold.” The Bible Society placed the building on the market in 2014.\n\nAvalonBay purchased the building from the Society in 2015 for $300 million, after the organization announced it intended to move its headquarters to Philadelphia. Like the former building, Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill designed the new building. 1865 Broadway topped out in December of 2017. The building will contain mostly residential space, with a mix of apartments for rent and condominiums for sale.\n\nSOM took inspiration from the facade of I. M. Pei's Brutalist Kips Bay Towers.\n"}

{"id": "166164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166164", "title": "Agenda 21", "text": "Agenda 21\n\nAgenda 21 is a non-binding action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development. It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels.\n\nThe \"21\" in Agenda 21 refers to the 21st century. It has been affirmed and had a few modifications at subsequent UN conferences. Its aim is achieving global sustainable development. One major objective of the agenda 21 is that every local government should draw its own local Agenda 21. Since 2015, Sustainable Development Goals are included in the Agenda 2030.\n\nAgenda 21 is a 350-page document divided into 40 chapters that have been grouped into 4 sections:\n\n\nThe full text of Agenda 21 was made public at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro on June 13, 1992, where 178 governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.\n\nIn 1997, the UN General Assembly held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda 21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as \"uneven\" and identified key trends, including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-19/2) promised further action.\n\nThe Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), affirmed UN commitment to \"full implementation\" of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements.\n\nThe first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda 21 was for the environment. They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda 21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with G8 countries.\n\nIn 2012, at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda 21 in their outcome document called \"The Future We Want\".\n180 nation leaders participated.\n\nAgenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals, was a set of goals decided upon at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015. It takes all of the goals set by Agenda 21 and re-asserts them as the basis for sustainable development, saying, “We reaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development…” Adding onto those goals from the original Rio document, a total of 17 goals have been agreed on, revolving around the same concepts of Agenda 21; people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership.\n\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda 21. The UN Division for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works \"within the context of\" Agenda 21.\n\nImplementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.\n\nThe implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. These programs are often known as \"Local Agenda 21\" or \"LA21\". For example, in the Philippines, the plan is \"Philippines Agenda 21\" (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000 cities, towns, and counties in 88 countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda 21 implementation. \n\nEurope turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented. In Sweden, for example, all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda 21 initiative.\n\nThe UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda 21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website.\n\nAustralia is a signatory to Agenda 21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to ICLEI, an organization that promotes Agenda 21 globally. Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States.\n\nIn Africa, national support for Agenda 21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 Sam Nujoma, who was then President of Namibia, spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda 21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a semi-arid country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda 21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in sub-Saharan African countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda 21 participation in North African countries mirrors that of Middle Eastern countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda 21 status reports. By contrast, South Africa's participation in Agenda 21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21 city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda 21 by national-level government.\n\nThe national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs, Office of Environmental Policy, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State. A June 2012 poll of 1,300 United States voters by the American Planning Association found that 9% supported Agenda 21, 6% opposed it, and 85% thought they didn't have enough information to form an opinion.\n\nThe United States is a signatory country to Agenda 21, but because Agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the United States Senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution. President George H. W. Bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992, and in the same year Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Eliot Engel and William Broomfield spoke in support of United States House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda 21 in the United States. Created by a 1993 Executive Order, the President's Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, \"Sustainable America: A New Consensus\", to the President in early 1996. In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21. \n\nIn the United States, over 528 cities are members of ICLEI, an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda 21 and Local Agenda 21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of 1,200 cities promoting sustainable development at a local level. The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda 21 status reports. In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said \"Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments\".\n\nThe Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012, arguing \"It would be bad for business\" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development.\n\nAnti-Agenda 21 conspiracy theories have circulated in the U.S. Some Tea Party movement activists and others promoted the notion that Agenda 21 was part of a UN plot to deny property rights, undermine U.S. sovereignty, or force citizens to move to cities. Activists believed that the non-binding UN resolution was \"the linchpin in a plot to subjugate humanity under an eco-totalitarian regime.\" The conspiracy theory had its roots in anti-environmentalist ideology and opposition to land-use regulation. \n\nAgenda 21 fears have played a role in opposition to local government's efforts to promote resource and land conservation, build bike lanes, and construct hubs for public transportation. The non-profit group ICLEI — Local Governments for Sustainability USA - was targeted by anti-Agenda 21 activists. In 2012 Glenn Beck co-wrote a dystopian novel titled \"Agenda 21\" based in part on concepts discussed in the UN plan. In the same year, fears of Agenda 21 \"went mainstream\" when the Republican National Committee adopted a platform resolution stated that \"We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty.\"\n\nSeveral state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda 21. Most such bills failed, \"either dying in committee, getting defeated on the statehouse floor or – in the case of Missouri's 2013 bill – getting vetoed by the governor.\" In Texas, for example, broadly worded legislation that would prohibit any governmental entity from accepting from or granting money to any \"nongovernmental or intergovernmental organization accredited by the United Nations to implement a policy that originated in the Agenda 21 plan\" was defeated because it could have cut off funding for groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Texas Wildlife Association. In Arizona, a similarly sweeping bill was introduced in the Arizona State Legislature seeking to mandate that the state could not \"adopt or implement the creed, doctrine, or principles or any tenet\" of Agenda 21 and to prohibit the state \"implementing programs of, expending any sum of money for, being a member of, receiving funding from, contracting services from, or giving financial or other forms of aid to\" an array of sustainability organizations. The bill, which was opposed by the state chamber of commerce and the mayor of Phoenix, was defeated in 2012. Alabama was one state that did adopt an anti-Agenda 21 resolution, unanimously passing in 2012 a measure to block \"any future effort to 'deliberately or inadvertently infringe or restrict private property rights without due process, as may be required by policy recommendations originating in, or traceable to 'Agenda 21.'\"\n\nEuropean countries generally possess well documented Agenda 21 statuses.\n\nFrance, whose national government, along with 14 cities, is a signatory, boasts nationwide programs supporting Agenda 21. \n\nBaltic nations formed the Baltic 21 coalition as a regional expression of Agenda 21.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been described as a \"Welsh Atlantis\" and has featured in folklore, literature and song.\n\nCantre'r Gwaelod was an area of land which, according to legend, was located in an area west of present-day Wales which is now under the waters of Cardigan Bay. Accounts variously suggest the tract of land extended from Bardsey Island to Cardigan or as far south as Ramsey Island. Legends of the land suggest that it may have extended 20 miles west of the present coast.\n\nThere are several versions of the myth. The earliest known form of the legend is usually said to appear in the \"Black Book of Carmarthen\", in which the land is referred to as \"Maes Gwyddno\" (). In this version, the land was lost to floods when a well-maiden named Mererid neglected her duties and allowed the well to overflow.\n\nRachel Bromwich questions this identification, saying that \"There is no certainty, however, that in twelfth century tradition Maes Gwyddneu did represent the submerged land in Cardigan Bay.\" She also links Gwyddno Garanhir with the Hen Ogledd, not Wales.\n\nThe popular version known today is thought to have been formed from the 17th century onwards. Cantre'r Gwaelod is described as a low-lying land fortified against the sea by a dyke, Sarn Badrig (\"Saint Patrick's causeway\"), with a series of sluice gates that were opened at low tide to drain the land.\n\nCantre'r Gwaelod's capital was \"Caer Wyddno\", seat of the ruler Gwyddno Garanhir. Two princes of the realm held charge over the dyke. One of these princes, called Seithenyn, is described in one version as a notorious drunkard and carouser, and it was through his negligence that the sea swept through the open floodgates, ruining the land.\n\nThe church bells of Cantre'r Gwaelod are said to ring out in times of danger.\n\nRachel Bromwich discusses a similar tale, that of the submergence of the kingdom of Helig ap Glanawg in the Conwy estuary. As with Cantre'r Gwaelod, there are tales of remains being seen of the sunken kingdom (Llys Helig). Bromwich believes that the two stories influenced each other, and that \"The widespread parallels to this inundation theme would suggest that the two stories are in fact one in origin, and were localized separately in Cardiganshire and in the Conway estuary, around two traditional figures of the sixth century. She also notes that the Halliwell Manuscript gives Helig the title \"Lord of Cantre'r Gwaelod\". In the book \"New Directions In Celtic Studies\" Antone Minard wrote that \"The Welsh legends of Cantre'r Gwaelod and Llys Helig (Helig's Court) contain the same details of audible bells beneath the waves and ruins which are visible at the equinoctial tides, which are the anchors of credulity in the story\".\n\nThere is no reliable physical evidence of the substantial community that legend promises lies under the sea, although several reports exist of remains being sighted.\n\nIn 1770, Welsh antiquarian scholar William Owen Pughe reported seeing sunken human habitations about four miles (6.4 km) off the Ceredigion coast, between the rivers Ystwyth and Teifi.\n\nIn the 1846 edition of \"The Topographical Dictionary of Wales\", Samuel Lewis described a feature of stone walls and causeways beneath the shallow waters of Cardigan Bay:\n\nLewis takes the view that maps by the cartographer Ptolemy marked the coastline of Cardigan Bay in the same location as it appears in modern times, suggesting that the date of the flood occurred before the second century AD.\n\nThe \"causeways\" described by Lewis can be seen today at beaches around Cardigan Bay. Known as \"Sarnau\", these ridges stretch several miles into the sea at right angles to the coast, and are located between each of the four river mouths in the north of Cardigan Bay. Modern geologists surmise that these formations of clay, gravel and rocks are moraines formed by the action of melting glaciers end of the last ice age. In a 2006 episode of the BBC television documentary \"Coast\", presenter Neil Oliver visited \"Sarn Gynfelyn\" at Wallog. The programme also featured the remains of the submerged forest at Ynyslas, near Borth which is associated with the lost land of Cantre'r Gwaelod. The vista of dead oak, pine, birch, willow and hazel tree stumps preserved by the acid anaerobic conditions in the soil is revealed at low tide and is estimated to be about 5000 years old.\n\nThe myth, like so many others, may be a folk memory of gradually rising sea levels at the end of the ice age. The physical remains of the preserved sunken forest at Borth, and of Sarn Badrig nearby, could have suggested that some great tragedy had overcome a community there long ago, and so the myth may have grown from that.\n\nThe legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod is comparable to the deluge myth found in nearly every ancient culture, and it has been likened to the story of Atlantis.\n\nSeveral similar legends exist in Celtic mythology which refer to a lost land beneath the waves. Both the Breton legend of Ker-Ys and the Arthurian tale of Lyonesse refer to a kingdom submerged somewhere in the Celtic Sea, off the coast of Brittany or Cornwall respectively.\n\nThe legend has inspired many poems and songs throughout the ages. The earliest mention of Cantre'r Gwaelod is thought to be in the thirteenth-century Black Book of Carmarthen in a poem called \"Boddi Maes Gwyddno\" (\"The Drowning of the Land of Gwyddno\") which relates the tale of Mererid and the well.\n\nThe story inspired a Victorian era-novel, \"The Misfortunes of Elphin\" (1829), by Thomas Love Peacock. At the 1925 National Eisteddfod of Wales, held in Pwllheli, Dewi Morgan ('Dewi Teifi') won the Bardic Chair with his Awdl recounting the legend, adopting Thomas Love Peacock's version as the basis for his poetic rendition.\n\nGeologist William Ashton's 1920 book, \"The Evolution of a Coast-Line, Barrow to Aberystwyth and the Isle of Man, with Notes on Lost Towns, Submarine Discoveries, &C\", discusses the legend and takes Ptolemy's map as evidence of the existence of an area of lost land in Cardigan Bay. Ashton also includes a conjectural map of Cantre'r Gwaelod within the bay.\n\nCantre'r Gwaelod is also featured in modern children's literature. Cantre'r Gwaelod is central to the setting of the 1977 Newbery Honor Book \"A String in the Harp\" by Nancy Bond. The kingdom also plays a major role in \"Silver on the Tree\", the last book of \"The Dark Is Rising\" by Susan Cooper, parts of which are set in Aberdyfi. Siân Lewis and Jackie Morris's book \"Cities in the Sea\" (2002) retells the legend for children, and Welsh musician Cerys Matthews's first children's book \"Tales from the Deep\" (2011) features a story, \"The Ghost Bells of the Lowlands\", which was adapted from the legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod.\n\nThe folk song \"Clychau Aberdyfi\" (\"The Bells of Aberdovey\"), popularised in the 18th Century, relates to the part of the legend about the bells being heard ringing beneath the waves in the town of Aberdyfi. This song inspired cultural projects in the town involving bells; a new chime of bells was installed in September 1936 in the tower St Peter's Church, Aberdyfi, specifically designed to allow the playing of \"The Bells of Aberdovey\". An art installation by the sculptor Marcus Vergette, a bronze \"Time and Tide Bell\", was mounted beneath the jetty in Aberdyfi Harbour in July 2011 as a homage to the folk song. The bell is rung by the action of water at high tide.\n\nAn episode of the BBC CBeebies programme \"Telly Tales\", first broadcast in 2009, featured a children's re-enactment of the legend of Cantre'r Gwaelod through a mixture of animation and live action.\n\nCantre'r Gwaelod featured in the BBC documentary series \"Coast\". Presenter Neil Oliver visited the sands of Aberdyfi and Ynyslas, near Borth, and examined the remains of the submerged forest and Sarn Badrig which are revealed at low tide, assisted by local historians and dendrochronologists.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30232695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30232695", "title": "Climate of Seoul", "text": "Climate of Seoul\n\nThe climate of Seoul features a humid continental/subtropical climate with dry winter, called \"Dwa\"/\"Cwa\" in the Köppen climate classification. Seoul is classed as having a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, but temperature differences between the hottest part of summer and the depths of winter are extreme. In summer the influence of the North Pacific high-pressure system brings hot, humid weather with temperatures soaring as high as 35 °C (95 °F) on occasion. In winter the city is topographically influenced by expanding Siberian High-pressure zones and prevailing west winds, temperatures dropping almost as low as -20 °C (-4 °F) in severe cold waves. The bitterly cold days tend to come in three-day cycles regulated by rising and falling pressure systems, during winter snowfall can cause frosty weather in the city. The most pleasant seasons, for most people in the city are spring and autumn, when azure blue skies and comfortable temperatures are regular. Most of Seoul's precipitation falls in the summer monsoon period between June and September, as a part of East Asian monsoon season.\n\nSeoul has a wet and very humid climate during the summer season, with cold and dry weather during the winter season. Spring (although windy) and autumn are mild but are short in duration. These seasons are considered the best time to visit Seoul.\n\n\nAs a temperate climate, Seoul has winter, spring, summer and autumn seasons. The monsoon season and typhoons also occurs in the summer season.\n\nThe winter in Seoul is controlled by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitation. The amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air has been over the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls (falls very much) during the winter. Frequently the weather is cloudless, clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4 °C (27 °F). January is the coldest month in Seoul, often with the lowest temperatures, almost always dropping below -10 °C (14 °F), and sometimes below -15 °C (5 °F).\n\nDuring the summer, East Asian monsoon winds engulf the city and the warm, moisture laden air moving off the oceans clashes with the drier air to the north. These fronts oscillate back and forth across Korea during the summer months. The interior highlands disturb the winds, forcing them into a westerly/southwesterly direction. The majority of the annual precipitation falls between late June and the middle of September, with rains fully developing along the entire peninsula by mid-June. Seoul receives approximately 126 mm (5 in) of precipitation during the winter (December–March), but in July alone receives approximately 383 mm (14.3 in). July is the wettest month in the metropolis.\n\nThunderstorms usually occur about 2 to 5 days per month during this period. Summer precipitation in Seoul is as likely to occur at 0200 as at 1400. Humidity is very high and fog will develop whenever a cold air mass confronts this moisture laden air, often forming on cloudless days. The typhoon season occurs from July through September. About once each year, a typhoon will pass very close to or move over Korea, causing heavy showers. Strong winds are usually confined to islands and exposed coastal areas. Although winds might not pose a problem, the associated rainfall can cause significant flash flooding, a very real threat during the rainy season, especially in rough terrain. The mean temperature for Seoul in August is 25.7 °C (78 °F)\n\nOctober is the transition month between the summer rainy season and the cold, dry winter. The predominantly tropical cloudy weather of the summer is replaced by cooler, drier, and less cloudy conditions. The primary weather producers during October are cold frontal systems from the Asian mainland. On the average, one frontal passage per week can be expected during the month. A typical frontal passage is proceeded by increasing middle and high cloudiness with light rain. Following the frontal passage, mostly clear skies can be expected for 3 or 4 days. During this clear period it is very likely for fog to form. Fog is especially prevalent in river valleys and in low-lying areas.\n\n"}

In the 1990s these replaced the older baladiyat system.\n\nHistorically the area of Libya was considered three provinces (or states), Tripolitania in the northwest, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan in the southwest. It was the conquest by Italy in the Italo-Turkish War that united them in a single political unit. Under the Italians Libya was eventually divided into four provinces and one territory: Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, Derna, (in the north) and the Territory of the Libyan Sahara (in the south). After the French and British occupied Libya in 1943, it was again split into three provinces: Tripolitania in the northwest, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan-Ghadames in the southwest.\n\nArticle 176 of the 1951 constitution of Libya stated \"The Kingdom of Libya shall be divided into administrative units in conformity with the law to be promulgated in this connection. Local and regional councils may be formed in the Kingdom. The extent of these units shall be determined by law which shall likewise organize these Councils.\" in exact quote.\n\nAfter independence (1951), Libya was divided into three governorates (\"muhafazat\"), matching the three provinces of before, but in 1963 it was divided into ten governorates. In 1983 a new system was introduced dividing the country into forty-six districts (\"baladiyat\"). In 1987 this was reduced to twenty-five districts.\n\nOn 2 August 1995, Libya reorganized into thirteen districts (\"shabiyat\"). In 1998 this was increased to 26 shabiyat districts. In 2001 it was increased to thirty-two districts plus three administrative regions. Finally in 2007 it was reduced to twenty-two districts.\n\nFor historical evolution see also: Subdivisions of Libya.\n\nLibyan districts are further subdivided into Basic People's Congresses which act as townships or boroughs.\n\n\"Shabiyah\" ( \"šaʿbiyyah\", plural: \"šaʿbiyyāt\") is a neologism exclusive to Libya under Gaddafi, in line with exclusive terms for republic (jamahiriya), ministry (amanah) and embassy (people's-bureau).\nThe term basically means a district, that is, a top level administrative division. Etymologically, it is an adjective meaning \"of or pertaining to the people, popular\".\n\nIn 2007 the current twenty-two districts (\"shabiya\") replaced the older thirty-two district system.\n\nThe current list is as following:\n\nThe 2001 reorganization of Libya into districts (\"shabiya\") resulted in thirty-two districts and three administrative regions (المنطقة الإدارية): \n\nThe three administrative regions are missing from the above map, Qatrun, Marada, and Jaghbub\n\nIn 1998 Libya was reorganized into twenty-six districts which were: Butnan, Jafara, Jufra, Kufra, Marj, Murqub, Quba, Al Wahat, Bani Walid, Benghazi, Derna, Gharyan, Jabal al Akhdar, Murzuq, Misrata, Nalut, Nuqat al Khams, Sabha, Sabrata/Sorman, Sirte, Tarhuna/Msalata, Tripoli, Wadi al Hayaa, Wadi al Shatii, Yafran, and Zawiya\n\nOn 2 August 1995 Libya dropped the baladiyat system and reorganized into thirteen districts (\"shabiyat\"). Among them were Butnan (formerly Tobruk), Jabal al Akhdar, Jabal al Gharbi, Zawiya, Benghazi, and Tripoli. However, there is not agreement about the other seven names.\n\n\"Baladiyah\" (singular) or \"baladiyat\" (plural), are Arabic words used in many Arab countries to denote administrative divisions of the country. In Libya, the baladiyat system of districts was introduced in 1983 to replace the governorate system. Originally there were forty-six baladiyat districts, but in 1988 that number was reduced to twenty-five baladiyat. The table hereunder lists the old twenty-five baladiyat in alphabetical order with a link to each one and numbered to be located on the map. Note that each district linked may be both a baladiyah and a shabiyah. The many changes may not always be reflected in the article. \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23566917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23566917", "title": "Geography of Bankura district", "text": "Geography of Bankura district\n\nGeography of Bankura district refers to the geography of the present Bankura district in the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\nBankura is one of the districts of Burdwan division. It is situated between 22° 38’ and 23° 38’ north latitude and between 86° 36’ and 87° 46’ east longitude. It has an area of On the north and north-east the district is bounded by Bardhaman district, from which it is separated by the Damodar River. On the south-east it is bounded by Hooghly district, on the south by Paschim Medinipur district and on the west by Purulia district.\n\nBankura district has been described as the “connecting link between the plains of Bengal on the east and Chota Nagpur plateau on the west.” The areas to the east and north-east are low lying alluvial plains, similar to predominating rice lands of Bengal. To the west the surface gradually rises, giving way to undulating country, interspersed with rocky hillocks. Much of the country is covered with jungles.\n\nThe area consists of two different tracts. The western portion marks the gradual descent from the table land of Chota Nagpur to the delta of lower Bengal, consisting largely of spurs projecting from the western tableland and of low swelling ridges. However, there is no marked ridge of hills. In the central portion of the district there are rolling downs eventually merging with the alluvial plains.\n\nThe western part of the district has poor, ferruginous soil and hard beds of laterite with scrub jungles and \"sal\" (Shorea robusta) woods. Long broken ridges with irregular patches of more recent alluvium have marks of seasonal cultivation. During the long dry season large extents of red soil with hardly any trees lend the country a scorched and dreary appearance. In the eastern part the eye constantly rests on wide expanses of rice fields, green in the rains but parched and dry in summer.\n\nThe hills of the district consist of outliers of the Chota Nagpur plateau and only two are of any great height – Biharinath and Susunia. While the former rises to a height of , the latter attains a height of . There are a number of low hills in the Saltora area. There are small hills, e.g. the Mejia hill rising to a mere from the base or the Karo hill, halfway between Mejia and Bankura, rising a little higher to about . To the south, in the police station areas of Khatra and Raipur there are picturesque low hills, locally called Masaker Pahar.\n\nThe rivers of the area flow from the north-east to the south-west in courses roughly parallel to one another. They are mostly hill streams, originating in the hills in the west. The rivers come down in floods after heavy rains and subside as rapidly as they rise. In summer, their sand beds are almost always dry.\n\nDamodar River forms the northern boundary of the district with Bardhaman district for about and then flows into Bardhaman district. Floods in the Damodar rarely do much damage to the district. Sali River which drains the northern part of the district is an important tributary of the Damodar.\n\nAmongst the other rivers flowing through the district, the most important is Dwarakeswar River. It has many branches or old beds in Onda and Bishnupur police station areas. The main tributaries of Dwarakeswar River are the Gandheswari, the Kukhra, and the Birai. Other major rivers are Shilabati River and Kangsabati River, both of which enter the district from Purulia district, run along a short course in the territory and then enter Paschim Medinipur district. Gandheswari River is a tributary of Dwarakeswar River and flows in Bankura district. Flowing south-west of Susunia Hill and north of Bankura it joins the Dwarakeswar near Bhutsahar. It is subject to sudden flooding during rains. There are some small but picturesque water falls along the course of the Shilabati near Harmasra, and along the course of the Kangsabati in the Raipur area. Amongst the minor rivers in the district are Jaypanda, a tributary of Shilabati, and Bhairabbanki.\n\nMejia Beel is a large swamp formed by the overflow of the Damodar. There are several small tanks or artificial lakes developed by the former rajas, in and around Bishnupur.\n\nKangsabati Project was started during the second five-year plan period (1956–1961). The dam across the Kangsabati has a length of and a height of . Apart from this dam there are two pick up barrages in the Shilabati and the Bhairabbanki.\n\nThere is a proposal for the construction of a dam across the Dwarakeswar. The preliminary project report on Dwarakeswar Gandheswari Reservoir was received in Central Water Commission in January, 2004 for which ‘in- principle’ consent of Central Water Commission for preparation of detailed Project Report has been conveyed to the State Government in March, 2004.\n\nThe greater portion of the district consists of a rolling country covered by laterite and alluvium. While metamorphic or gneissose rocks are found to the extreme west, to the east there is a wide plain of recent alluvium. Strong massive runs of hornblendic varieties stretch across the region in tolerably continuous lines, the general strike being nearly east and west.\n\nThe most characteristic geological feature of the district is the area of laterite and associated rocks of sand and gravel. At some places one finds hard beds of laterite. At other places it is decomposed and reorganised. Locally, the ferruginous rock is called \"kankar\". The calcareous concretions, commonly used as the sources of lime, are known as \"ghutin\".\n\nThe Gondwana system is represented in the northern portion of the district, south of the Damodar, between Mejia and Biharinath Hill. The beds covered with alluvium contains seams of coal belonging to the Raniganj system.\n\nThe climate, especially in the upland tracts to the west, is much drier than in eastern or southern Bengal. From the beginning of March to early June, when the monsoon sets in, hot westerly winds prevail, the thermometer in the shade rising to around . The westerly winds die down around sunset and allow cool winds to blow from the south. Nor'westers are frequent during this period and help to mitigate the excessive heat.\n\nThe monsoon months, June to September, are comparatively pleasant, as the weather is not as sultry as in other parts of Bengal. The total average rainfall is , the bulk of the rain coming in the months of June to September.\n\nWinters are pleasant with temperatures dropping down to below in December.\n\nThe district comprises three subdivisions: Bankura Sadar, Khatra and Bishnupur. Bankura Sadar subdivision consists of Bankura municipality and eight community development blocs: Bankura — I, Bankura — II, Barjora, Chhatna, Gangajalghati, Mejia, Onda and Shaltora. Khatra subdivision consists of eight community development blocs: Indpur, Khatra, Hirbandh, Raipur, Sarenga, Ranibandh, Simlapal and Taldangra. Bishnupur subdivision consists of Bishnupur and Sonamukhi municipalities and six community development blocks: Indas, Joypur, Patrasayar, Kotulpur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur.\n\nBankura is the district headquarters. There are 21 police stations, 22 development blocks, 3 municipalities, 190 gram panchayats and 5187 villages in this district.\n\nOther than municipality area, each subdivision contains community development blocs which in turn are divided into rural areas and census towns. In total there are 5 urban units: 3 municipalities and 2 census towns.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57693785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57693785", "title": "Geology of Uganda", "text": "Geology of Uganda\n\nThe geology of Uganda formed beginning in the Archean and Proterozoic eons of the Precambrian, and much of the country is underlain by gneiss, argillite and other metamorphic rocks that are sometimes over 2.5 billion years old. Sedimentary rocks and new igneous and metamorphic units formed throughout the Proterozoic and the region was partially affected by the Pan-African orogeny and Snowball Earth events. Through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, ancient basement rock has weathered into water-bearing saprolite and the region has experienced periods of volcanism and rift valley formation. The East Africa Rift gives rise to thick, more geologically recent sediment sequences and the country's numerous lakes. Uganda has extensive natural resources, particularly gold. \n\nThe oldest rocks in Uganda date to the Archean and are more than 2.5 billion years old, forming a gneiss and granulite complex in the north and center of the country. The Watian Group rocks in the West Nile region date to the Mesoarchean, 2.9 billion years ago and metamorphosed to granulite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. Other rocks, similar to the Watian Group form enclaves within gneiss sequences in the Karamoja District. \n\nThese Archean rock formations tend to also include quartz diorite, acid and intermediate granulites and less commonly, basic granulites. Aruan Group rocks overly the Watian Group in the West Nile area, with biotite gneiss, hornblende gneiss, migmatite and granitic gneiss and quartzites. Karamoja Gneiss Group rocks share a very similar lithology to the Aruan Group, along with the eastern West Nile Mirian Group, although this group has experienced intense isoclinal folding.\n\nThe Neoarchean is represented by rhyolites, porphyry, tuff and basalt in the Nyanzian System, close to the Kenya border and in southeast Uganda.\n\nThe Ruwenzori Fold Belt (also known as the Buganda-Toro System) dates to the Paleoproterozoic and covers much of western and south-central Uganda. The fold belt is mainly argillite, with thick amphibolite in the Jinja area and basal arenite in some locations. Parts of the belt are grantized, with low-grade phyllite close to Lake Victoria. Overall, the metamorphic grade tends to decrease southwards. The Ruwenzori Fold Belt includes the Igara Schist gneiss, quartzite and mica schist, as well as the sandstones, slate and phyllite of the Bwamba Pass Series and the Kilembe Series. \n\nThe Kibaran orogeny impacted the region in the Mesoproterozoic, forming the arenites, argillites, siltstones and metacalcareous rocks of Karagwe-Ankole Belt, which unconformably overlies the Buganda-Toro System in the southwest. The Madi Series in northwest Uganda may date to a similar time period, but its age remains poorly understood. \n\nThe Neoproterozoic Bunyoro Series a 160-kilometer section of central Uganda, built on a bottom unit of tillite, likely related to the Snowball Earth glacial deposits from the period. The unmetamorphosed, molasse related Singo Series and Mityana Series of the Bukoban System are common in the west-central parts of the country. Karasuk Group rocks including gneiss, amphibolite, marble, quartzite and ultramafic rocks form a 200- by 40-kilometer strip near the Kenyan border, related to the Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogeny.\n\nDuring the Paleozoic, between 541 and 251 million years ago, the supercontinent Gondwana, including Uganda, joined with Euramerica to form the new supercontinent Pangaea. A large rift valley formed in southern Pangaea spanning southern Africa and southern South America and filled with sediments, depositing the Karoo Supergroup, the most extensive stratigraphic unit in Africa. Compared with neighboring countries, Uganda has comparatively few Karoo rocks. Down-faulted outliers are situated beneath Entebbe, Dagusi Island and Bugiri. \n\nThroughout the late Mesozoic into the Cenozoic, Uganda experienced the regional effects of the East Africa Rift, which caused deep layers of sediments—often laden with fossils--to accumulate as sedimentary rocks in rift valleys. In the Miocene, volcanic activity near the Kenyan border created the mountains in the Karamoja region. Carbonatite ring complexes formed due to the regionally unique geochemistry.\n\nStructurally, the geology of Uganda is strongly influenced by fold belts and shear zones, as well as the East Africa Rift related crustal downwarping in the Pleistocene that formed Lake Victoria. The Aswa Shear Zone is one example of several Neoproterozoic shear zones in Precambrian rocks, running for 300 kilometers on a northwestern trend. \n\nThe East Africa Rift defines the western border of Uganda with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rift is occupied by Lake Albert, Lake Edward and Lake George, along with the horst block of the Ruwenzori Mountains. Modern sediment depths in the Rift Valley are believed by 1.8 to 4 kilometers. Although volcanoes are no longer active in Uganda, the country has some remnant hot springs.\n\nUnconsolidated and unconfined fluvial aquifers, with an average water table depth of 20 meters are common along rivers in Uganda. However, most of the country is underlain by igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock from the Precambrian. Water in these semi-confined units occurs five to 20 meters below ground, either in weathered saprolite or fractures in the rock.\n\nBecause of long-running, intense weathering, Uganda has deposits of gold, niobium, tantalum, tin, rare earth elements and apatite. Gold has been mined from quartz vein and alluvial deposits near Busia, hosted in an Archean greenstone belt, and occurs in Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic metasediments at Buhweju and Kigezi. Exploration in the Buhweju-Mashonga area, indicates that artisanal gold mining is taking place in laterite gravels, overlying kaolin bedrock.\n"}

It is mentioned in some ancient manuscripts of the Gospel of Matthew as the place where the Miracle of the Swine took place, an exorcism performed by Jesus who drove demons out of two possessed men and into a herd of pigs. All three Synoptic Gospels mention this miracle, but only Matthew writes about two possessed men instead of just one, and only some manuscripts of his Gospel name the location as Gergesa, while the other copies, as well as all versions of Luke and Mark, mention either Gadara or Gerasa (see ). \n\nSome are of the opinion that Gergesa was the country of the ancient Girgashites; but it is more probable that 'Gergesenes' was introduced by Origen upon mere conjecture; as before him most copies seem to have read 'Gadarenes', agreeable to the parallel passages and the ancient Syriac version. In any event, the \"country of the Gergesenes/Gadarenes/Gerasenes\" in the New Testament Gospels refers to some location on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The name is derived from either a lakeside village, Gergesa, the next larger city, Gadara, or the best-known city in the region, Gerasa.\n\n\"Gergesenes\" means \"those who come from pilgrimage or fight.\"\n\nMany New Testament manuscripts refer to the \"Country of the Gadarenes\" or \"Gerasenes\" rather than the Gergesenes. Both Gerasa and Gadara were cities to the east of the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan. They were both Gentile cities filled with citizens who were culturally more Greek than Semitic; this would account for the pigs in the biblical account. Gerasa and Gadara are accounted for in historical accounts (by writers such as Pliny the Elder and Josephus) and by archaeological research. Today they are the modern towns of Jerash and Umm Qais.\n\nA third city, Hippos, was similar in character to Gadara and Gerasa, and it may fit the biblical account even better. It was located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, whereas Gerasa and Gadara were several kilometers south-east of it. Hippos, Gerasa, and Gadara were all counted in the Decapolis, an informal grouping of Greco-Roman cities just south of the ancient city of Caesarea Philippi.\n\nByzantine Christian monks venerated a site situated a few kilometres north of Hippos on the lake shore, as the location of the miracle. It is the only place fitting Matthew's description, since it contains the only \"steep bank\" in the area descending all the way to the shore of the lake. The site became apparently known since at least the Early Muslim period as Kursya, the Aramaic word for \"chair\", and later as Kursi, a word with the same meaning in Arabic, The monks built a walled monastic complex there and made it a destination for Christian pilgrims. That monastery was destroyed by Sassanid Persian armies in 614 CE, partially rebuilt, and finally levelled by the 749 Galilee earthquake. The remains of the monastery can be visited in the Kursi National Park. Christian artifacts from Kursi can be viewed at the Golan Archaeological Museum.\n"}

It is part of Tunisia's Sahel Region.\n\nThe Phoenician settlement at Ghar el-Melha little inland from the present sitebegan around the same time as Utica and its dating presents the same problems. Several classical authors place northern Tunisia's colonization but modern archaeology has only found evidence suggestive of a date closer to . In either case, the settlement at Ghar el-Melh came to serve as Utica's chief port as the Medjerda changed course and began silting up Utica's harbor. Its Punic name Rus Eshmun meant \"Cape Eshmun\", after the Punic name for Cape Farina.\n\nScipio Africanus landed nearby, took the town, and pillaged the surrounding countryside in 204 ahead of his siege of Utica during the Second Punic War. A naval battle ending in Roman victory was fought off the town's coast the next year, ahead of Zama and the end of the war.\n\nThe port fell under Roman rule along with the rest of the Carthaginian Empire during the course of the Punic Wars. It sometimes preserved its former namelatinized as Rusucmonabut also came to be known as or Delia, presumably after Scipio's friend and lieutenant G. Laelius. Its peninsula preserved an ancient and important temple to \"Apollo\", probably representing a continuation of the Carthaginian worship of the healing god Eshmun harmonized with the Greco-Roman pantheon. held native city (\"\") status as part of the province of Byzacena. It flourished from around 30 to around 330. During this time the city was also the seat of a Christian bishopric. \n\nMuch later, it became an important base for the Barbary corsairs. Following the conquest of Tunisia by CharlesV in 1534 and 1535, Spaniards tried to remove the pirates unsuccessfully. John of Austria also visited the bay during his reconquest of Tunis in October of 1573, following his victory at Lepanto.\n\nThe Italian convert, Ottoman corsair, and Tunisian dey Usta Murad expanded the citythen known as PortoFarinagreatly enough to consider it a second founding. He established fortifications to prevent the harbor's use by Christian powers and attracted refugee Moriscos by the provision of certain liberties at Porto Farina, Rafraf, and Ras el-Djebel. During this era, it rivaled the size and importance of Bizerte.\n\nIn early 1655, an English fleet under Robert Blake blockaded nine warships in Porto Farina's harbor in order to pressure the dey Mustafa Laz to free Englishmen held as slaves and to provide compensation for English ships recently seized by local pirates. The dey offered to provide a new treaty going forward but refused emancipation or compensation for people and ships already taken. Any such action, he felt, should begin with the English, one of whose captains had recently sold a company of Tunisian troops as galley slaves to the Knights of Malta instead of transporting them to Smyrna (present-day Izmir) as arranged. When Blake maintained his blockade, the dey had his warships' rigging removed, the town's fortifications strengthened, and its garrison increased. On April 14, 1655, Blake finally attacked. Dividing his fleet to attack the warships and the 20-gun fort simultaneously, he had his men storm and burn the warships in turn before declaring victory and leaving the harbor. Because his sustained assault was able to silence the town's defenses entirely, the engagement is celebrated as the first successful naval attack on shore-based fortifications.\n\nThe port and its defenses were then quickly rebuilt. The Ottoman Empire erected Borj el-Loutani as a fort in 1659; Fort Nadur and the \"Genovese fort\" were also raised around the same time. Borj el-Loutani was later used as an artillery base and as a prison; the others gradually fell into disrepair. The town began to be used by British and Maltese privateers, as well as Turkish and local corsairs.\n\nMuhammad Talak and Ali Bey were arrested and strangled in Porto Farina in 1682 as part of the chaotic struggles of the later Muradid dynasty. Shortly afterward, three ships arriving from Turkey proper infected the town with the plague.\n\nWhen Husain I took advantage of Ibrahim Sharif's Algerian imprisonment to usurp control of Tunisia in 1705, the Algerians released Sharif to return home. Husain, intent upon consolidating his power, had Sharif killed en route at Porto Farina. The former dey's tomb lies beside one of the town's forts. Husain established an arsenal at Porto Farina two years later.\n\nLocals were calling the town Ghar el-Melh (recorded by a visiting Frenchman as \"Gramela\") by 1724. French annoyance at piracy in the area prompted to order an attack in 1770 by Admiral de Broves, commanding a squadron consisting of 2 warships (bearing 74 and 50 guns respectively), 2 frigates (24 guns each), a bark (18 guns), 2 schooners, a flute, and some other ships provided by Malta. The ships fired on Porto Farina for two days. De Brove's fleet also attacked Bizerte and Monastir before the Treaty of Bardo ended hostilities on August 25th.\n\nSimilarly, when Venice took exception to Tunisian-based piracy in the early 1780s, its leaders ordered a series of bombardments that included an attack by Admiral Emo's fleet on Porto Farina on September 6, 1784. This seems, however, to have been the last time a foreign fleet bothered the port; by 1806, it was only a winter port for the bey's warships and it was necessary to take special measures each voyage to get them over the harbor's rising sandbar.\n\nThe beylik's arsenal was finally removed in 1818, but fear that a similar fate might befall its navy as had Algeria's caused the bey to hire dredgers and workers to improve conditions.; he was again able to bring his fleet into the harbor by December. When a severe storm destroyed the beylik's fleet at anchor off La Goulette on February 7 & 8, 1821, however, such efforts were discontinued and the sandbar off Porto Farina was allowed to continue to grow.\n\nIn 1834 a large private arsenal belonging to a Maltese pirate exploded and destroyed part of the town. Ahmed Bey, the last Bey of Constantine, decided to clamp down on piracy and attempted to turn the port over to legitimate trade. In 1837, he began efforts to restore the town's arsenal. Although that never proved feasible, the bey established a palace in the city and an attendant garrison. Command was given to a favorite of the bey's, the general Salah Cheboul. The forts were renovated, and the port cleaned and maintained. From 1840, a community of Maltese, Italians, and French settled in the locality. By 1853, however, the beylik's new frigates could no longer access the harbor and the garrison was reduced.\n\nIn the early years of Tunisia's French occupation, the Bizerte Port Company () made an attempt to again dredge access to Porto Farina's harbor but a storm from the northeast closed the channel almost immediately after its opening and further attempts were abandoned. The formerly prosperous town's public buildings had already fallen into disrepair and were thoroughly scavenged by locals for other purposes. The prison, which was listed as a Tunisian Historic Monument in 1922, closed in 1964. Today Ghar el-Melh is a small farming town.\n\nThe ancient bishopric survives today as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church and the current bishop is Geoffrey James Robinson of Australia.\n\n"}

He was born in Taverna, a city in the province of Catanzaro in Sila Piccola. He later studied natural science, languages and theology, probably in Naples. He certainly lived there for a few years and served as the teacher of the Archbishop Mario Carafa. At Carafa's death on 11 September 1575, d'Anania returned to Taverna where he remained until his death (between 1607 and 1609).\n\nDuring d'Anania's stay in Naples, he published his most famous work, \"L'Universale fabbrica del Mondo, ovvero Cosmografia\" (1573), a geographical work which consists of a preface and four volumes that provide a picture of geographical knowledge in the second half of the 16th century. A new, second edition was prepared in Venice in 1576, in which d'Anania supplemented physical geography, with history and anthropology, as well as information religious faiths. The longest volume of the four treatises is the first, dedicated to Europe (the regions are discussed in this order: Ireland, England, Scotland, Portugal, Spain, France and Switzerland, Reno and Holland, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Slavonia, Bosnia and Raška, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, and the Arctic); while the remaining three treatises cover Asia, Africa and West Indies.\n\nD'Anania also authored a theological work titled \"De natura daemonum\", first published in Venice in 1570. In it, d'Anania posits the existence of demons, malevolent beings behind the works of astrologers and necromancers and who are responsible for any diseases which can be cured by the intercession of saints. \"De natura daemonum\" saw many editions, including that produced by Aldus Manutius. In 1654 Gian Lorenzo's nephew, Marcello Anania, prepared an edition titled \"De substantiis separatis\", which contained the previously unpublished \"De natura Angelorum\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "486077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=486077", "title": "Grotto", "text": "Grotto\n\nA grotto (Italian \"grotta\" and French \"grotte\") is a natural or artificial cave used by humans in both modern times and antiquity, and historically or prehistorically. Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually flooded or liable to flood at high tide. Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as garden features. The \"Grotta Azzurra\" at Capri and the grotto at the villa of Tiberius in the Bay of Naples are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.\n\nWhether in tidal water or high up in hills, grottoes are generally made up of limestone geology, where the acidity of standing water has dissolved the carbonates in the rock matrix as it passes through what were originally small fissures. See karst topography, cavern.\nThe word \"grotto\" comes from Italian \"grotta\", Vulgar Latin grupta, and Latin crypta (a crypt). It is also related by a historical accident to the word \"grotesque\". In the late 15th century, Romans accidentally unearthed Nero's \"Domus Aurea\" on the Palatine Hill, a series of rooms, decorated with designs of garlands, slender architectural framework, foliage, and animals. The rooms had sunk underground over time. The Romans who discovered this historical monument found it very strange, partly because it was uncovered from an \"underworld\" source. This led the Romans of that era to give it the name \"grottesca\", from which came the French \"grotesque\".\n\nGrottoes were very popular in Greek and Roman culture. Spring-fed grottoes were a feature of Apollo's oracles at Delphi, Corinth, and Clarus. The Hellenistic city of Rhodes was designed with rock-cut artificial grottoes incorporated into the city, made to look natural. At the great Roman sanctuary of Praeneste south of Rome, the oldest portion of the primitive sanctuary was situated on the second lowest terrace, in a grotto in the natural rock where a spring developed into a well. According to tradition, Praeneste's sacred spring had a native nymph, who was honored in a grotto-like watery nymphaeum.\n\nTiberius, the Roman emperor, filled his grotto with sculptures to create a sense of mythology, perhaps channeling Polyphemus' cave in the \"Odyssey\". The numinous quality of the grotto is still more ancient: in a grotto near Knossos in Crete, Eileithyia was venerated, even before Minoan palace-building. Even farther back in time, the immanence of the divine in a grotto is seen in the sacred caves of Lascaux.\n\nThe popularity of artificial grottoes introduced the Mannerist style to Italian and French gardens of the mid-16th century. Two famous grottoes in the Boboli Gardens of Palazzo Pitti were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammanati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593. One of these grottoes originally housed the \"Prisoners\" of Michelangelo. Before the Boboli grotto, a garden was laid out by Niccolò Tribolo at the Medici Villa Castello, near Florence. At Pratolino, in spite of the dryness of the site, there was a Grotto of Cupid (surviving), with water tricks for the unsuspecting visitor. The Fonte di Fata Morgana (\"Fata Morgana's Spring\") at Grassina, not far from Florence, is a small garden building, built in 1573–4 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa \"Riposo\" (rest) of Bernardo Vecchietti. It is decorated with sculptures in the Giambolognan manner.\n\nThe outsides of garden grottoes are often designed to look like an enormous rock, a rustic porch or a rocky overhang. Inside, they are decorated as a temple or with fountains, stalactites and imitation gems and shells (sometimes made in ceramic); herms and mermaids, mythological subjects suited to the space; and naiads, or river gods whose urns spilled water into pools. Damp grottoes were cool places to retreat from the Italian sun, but they also became fashionable in the cool drizzle of the Île-de-France. In Kuskovo in the Sheremetev estate there is a Summer Grotto, built in 1775.\nGrottoes could also serve as baths; an example of this is at the Palazzo del Te, in the 'Casino della Grotta', where a small suite of intimate rooms is laid out around a grotto and \"loggetta\" (covered balcony). Courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.\n\nGrottoes have also served as chapels, or at Villa Farnese at Caprarola, a little theater designed in the grotto manner. They were often combined with cascading fountains in Renaissance gardens.\n\nThe grotto designed by Bernard Palissy for Catherine de' Medici's château in Paris, the Tuileries, was renowned. There are also grottoes in the gardens designed by André Le Nôtre for Versailles. In England, an early garden grotto was built at Wilton House in the 1630s, probably by Isaac de Caus.\n\nGrottoes were suitable for less formal gardens too. Pope's Grotto, created by Alexander Pope, is almost all that survives of one of the very first landscape gardens in England, at Twickenham. Pope was inspired after seeing grottoes in Italy during a visit there. Efforts are under way to restore his grotto. There are grottoes in the landscape gardens of Painshill Park, Stowe, Clandon Park and Stourhead. Scott's Grotto is a series of interconnected chambers, extending 67 ft (20 metres) into the chalk hillside on the outskirts of Ware, Hertfordshire. Built during the late 18th century, the chambers and tunnels are lined with shells, flints and pieces of coloured glass. The Romantic generation of tourists might not actually visit Fingal's Cave, on the remote isle of Staffa in the Scottish Hebrides, but they have often heard of it, perhaps through Felix Mendelssohn's \"Hebrides Overture\", better known as \"Fingal's Cave\", which was inspired by his visit. In the 19th century, when miniature Matterhorns and rock-gardens became fashionable, a grotto was often found, such as at Ascott House. In Bavaria, Ludwig's Linderhof contains an abstraction of the grotto under Venusberg, which figured in Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\".\n\nAlthough grottoes have largely fallen from fashion since the British Picturesque movement, architects and artists occasionally try to redefine the grotto in contemporary design works. Such examples include Aranda/Lasch's \"Grotto Concept,\" (2005), Callum Moreton's \"Grotto\" pavilion (2010), ARM's post-modern \"Storey Hall\" (1995), and Frederick Kiesler's \"Grotto of Meditation for New Harmony\" (1964).\n\nToday, artificial grottoes are purchased and built for ornamental and devotional purposes. They are often used as shrines in which to place statues of saints, particularly the Virgin Mary, in outdoor gardens.\n\nMany Roman Catholics visit a grotto where Bernadette Soubirous claimed she saw apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes. Numerous garden shrines are modelled after these apparitions. They can commonly be found displayed in gardens and churches, among other places (see Lourdes grotto).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38473147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38473147", "title": "Joseph Conrad's career at sea", "text": "Joseph Conrad's career at sea\n\nJoseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; Berdychiv, Ukraine, 3 December 1857  – 3 August 1924, Bishopsbourne, Kent, England) was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. He is regarded as one of the greatest writers in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties, and always with a marked Polish accent. Before embarking on his writing career, he had a career sailing in the French, then the British merchant marine; of his 19-year merchant-marine career, about half that time was spent actually at sea.\n\nConrad wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent universe. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature. He is viewed as a precursor of modernist literature; his narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors up to the present. Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad's stories and novels.\n\nWriting in the heyday of the British Empire, Conrad drew on his Polish heritage and on his personal experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world, while plumbing the depths of the human soul.\n\nArriving in Marseille in 1874, the not quite 17-year-old Joseph Conrad was to have been looked after by a Pole who sailed in French ships, but the sailor was temporarily away and ship pilots became Conrad's first instructors in sailing. He grew to love the Mediterranean, \"the cradle of sailing.\" Conrad, who became a professional sailor, never learned to swim. \nAfter two months at Marseilles, on 15 December 1874 Conrad, just turned seventeen, began his first sea voyage—as a passenger in a small barque, the \"Mont-Blanc\", which reached Saint-Pierre, Martinique, in the Caribbean, on 6 February 1875. During the ship's return passage to Marseilles (31 March – 23 May) he may have been a crew member. His objectives for this maiden voyage were probably to promote his health and give him a closer look at sailors' work. A month later, on 25 June, he again left in the \"Mont-Blanc\", now as an apprentice, arriving at Saint-Pierre on 31 July. After visiting several other Caribbean ports, the ship returned to France, arriving on 23 December at Le Havre.\n\nIn 1875 Conrad spent seven months at sea. This did not seem to have stirred his enthusiasm for the seaman's profession. He gave himself six months' rest from the sea, socializing and spending in excess of the generous allowance that he received from his maternal uncle, Tadeusz Bobrowski. The uncle indulged his nephew's financial demands but sent him lengthy letters of reproof that included his usual criticisms of Conrad's improvident paternal line. \n\nOn 10 July 1876 Conrad sailed for the West Indies as a steward (at a salary of 35 francs, equivalent to one-fifth the allowance he received from his uncle) in the barque \"Saint-Antoine\", making Saint-Pierre on 18 August. The first mate was a 42-year-old Corsican, Dominique Cervoni, who would become a prototype for the title character of Conrad's \"Nostromo\": \"In his eyes lurked a look of perfectly remorseless irony, as though he had been provided with an extremely experienced soul; and the slightest distension of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look of extraordinary boldness. This was the only play of feature of which he seemed capable, being a Southerner of a concentrated, deliberate type.\" The \"Saint-Antoine\", after visiting Martinique, St. Thomas and Haiti, returned on 15 February 1877 to Marseilles.\n\nIn his novel \"The Arrow of Gold\", Conrad alludes to smuggling \"by sea of arms and ammunition to the Carlist detachments in the South [of Spain].\" This apparently involved Dominique Cervoni. Conrad's first biographer, Georges Jean-Aubry (1882–1950), built on this allusion a tale about Cervoni and Conrad smuggling arms to a Central American republic. The pre-eminent Conrad chronicler and scholar Zdzisław Najder (born 1930) is skeptical about the story and surmises that Conrad \"might have heard... stories [about gun-running] from the experienced Cervoni.\"\n\nIn December 1877 it transpired that, as a foreigner and Russian subject, Conrad could not serve on French ships without permission from the Russian consul. And since Conrad was liable for military service in Russia, there was no chance of obtaining the consul's consent. In consultation with his uncle, \"it was decided that he should join the English Merchant Marine where there are no such formalities as in France\".\n\nConrad later described, in his essay collection \"The Mirror of the Sea\" (1906) and his novel \"The Arrow of Gold\" (1919), having, during his stay in Marseilles, smuggled arms to Spain for the Carlist supporters of Carlos de Borbón y de Austria-Este, pretender to the Spanish throne. Najder finds this, for a variety of reasons, virtually impossible. If Conrad did participate in running contraband to Spain, it likely would have involved something other than weapons. But in the two books written three and four decades later, he embellished his memories, probably borrowing from past adventures of Marseilles friends. To admit that his illicit activities had been conducted for profit would have conflicted with the position that he wished to occupy in literature. And attempts to track down the reality behind his accounts are complicated by Conrad's habit of using some external characteristics, and often the names, of actual people but of furnishing them with different life histories (as in the cases of Almayer, Lingard, Jim, and Kurtz). Najder writes:\n\nAnother Marseilles legend concerns Conrad's great love affair. The story is described only in \"The Arrow of Gold\", a pseudo-autobiographical novel whose chronology is at odds with the documented dates in Conrad's life.\n\nOn 10 June 1878 Konrad Korzeniowski set foot on English soil for the first time, at Lowestoft, having arrived on the small British steamer \"Mavis\", which he had boarded on 24 April 1878 at Marseilles. He had probably joined the ship not as a crew member but as an unofficial apprentice. It is not clear whether he had been on board during the Russian leg of its itinerary, which would have been hazardous for the Tsar's Polish subject. He still planned to return to France and enlist in the French navy. A conflict with Captain Samuel William Pipe prompted Conrad to leave the ship. He departed for London, where he quickly went through half his ready cash. Appealing to his uncle, he received additional funds, along with a long letter exhorting him to \"think for yourself and fend for yourself... don't idle; learn, and don't pretend to be a rich young gentleman... If you have not secured yourself a position by the age of 24, do not count on the allowance... I have no money for drones and I have no intention of working so that someone else may enjoy himself at my expense...\"\n\nConrad returned to Lowestoft and on 11 July 1878 signed on to a coastal coal schooner, the \"Skimmer of the Sea\". He won popularity with the crew by bearing the cost of entertainment and treats, not paid out of his shilling-a-month ordinary seaman's earnings (the lowest permissible) but out of his uncle's allowance, 160 times higher. \"In that craft I began to learn English from East Coast chaps, each built as though to last for ever, and coloured like a Christmas card.\" Having made three voyages to Newcastle upon Tyne and back in the \"Skimmer\", after only 73 days, on 23 September, Conrad left the schooner.\n\nOn 15 October 1878, in his first genuine service at sea, Conrad sailed in the clipper ship \"Duke of Sutherland\" on his longest voyage till then, around the Cape of Good Hope to Australia, arriving on 31 January 1879 at Sydney Harbour. He gained knowledge of local conditions and even of the slang, revealed later in his short story \"To-morrow\". It was then that he became acquainted with the works of Flaubert, through \"Salammbô\", and read a one-volume edition of Shakespeare. In Sydney—Bobrowski wrote Buszczyński—Conrad met a captain famous for his knowledge of Maritime Southeast Asia. The unnamed captain may have become a partial prototype of Tom Lingard in \"Almayer's Folly\", \"An Outcast of the Islands\" and \"The Rescue\", whose namesake Conrad never met. The \"Duke of Sutherland\" left Sydney on 6 July 1879 on its homeward voyage, and Conrad arrived in London on 19 October.\n\nHaving evidently for the moment lost desire for long-distance voyages, on 11 December 1879 Conrad enlisted as an able-bodied seaman in the iron steamer \"Europa\". The next day the ship departed for Genoa, Naples, Patras and Palermo, returning to London on 29 January 1880. Soon after, Conrad met George Fountaine Weare Hope, an ex-merchant-service officer, then director of a London commercial firm. This was apparently Conrad's first close contact in England and it developed into a long-lasting friendship.\n\nUrged on by his uncle, Conrad applied to take the examination for second mate in the British Merchant Marine. Applicants were required to document at least four years' service at sea. In reality, he had served only seventeen months. But, armed with a document from Delestang that amplified his period in French service, and giving augmented figures for his British service, he signed a declaration of his statements and of the enclosed documents, risking indictment in the event that the fraud were discovered. He attended a cram course for the examination and passed it on 28 May 1880, aged 22.\n\nOn 21 August 1880 Conrad enlisted as third mate on an iron clipper ship, the \"Loch Etive\". The next day the ship left London, arriving in Sydney on 24 November. The return voyage began on 11 January 1881. In \"The Mirror of the Sea\" (1906) Conrad would give a story, of uncertain basis, relating to this voyage—the rescue of the crew of a Danish sailing ship. The \"Loch Etive\" arrived in London on 25 April 1881. There Conrad's allowance from his uncle awaited him: 46 pounds for six months—over twice his earnings on the \"Loch Etive\".\n\nWhile waiting to enlist for another voyage, Conrad again engaged in some kind of disastrous speculation, which cost him at least his entire half-yearly allowance. This probably gave rise to a fantastic story, with which he regaled his uncle in a letter of 10 August 1881, about an accident aboard the clipper \"Annie Frost\" (with which Conrad had no link), loss of luggage, and several days spent in hospital.\n\nConrad had trouble finding a berth as second mate. Eventually he signed on to a small, rickety old barque, the \"Palestine\", for a voyage to Bangkok at pay of 4 pounds a month. From 15 October 1881 uncle Bobrowski was to send him only half the previous allowance, rounded up to 50 pounds a year—slightly over his new, highest salary to date. The \"Palestine\" was manned by three officers and ten hands and commanded by 57-year-old Captain Elijah Beard. Conrad was not too pleased with his new appointment. The \"Palestine\" left London on 21 September 1881 and, after a stop at Gravesend, sailed north on 28 September. Due to gales, the passage to Newcastle upon Tyne took 22 days.\n\nConrad later described his adventures on the \"Palestine\", renamed \"Judea\", in his short story \"Youth\" (1898), which he was to call \"a feat of memory\" and \"a record of experience.\" Though he preserved the names of the captain and first officer, and though the general course of events and many details correspond with the facts, as usual a number of things are creations of Conrad's imagination. Thus, there is no documentary evidence of a collision with a steamship at Newcastle; the story's hero is four years younger than Conrad; there was only one attempt, not several, to leave Falmouth, Cornwall, as the ship was continuously under repair; and there are other, more striking discrepancies.\n\nThe \"Palestine\", carrying a cargo of coal, left Newcastle for Bangkok on 29 November 1881. Crossing the English Channel, she met strong gales, lost a mast, and started to leak. On 24 December she returned to Falmouth, Cornwall, for repairs. Conrad nevertheless decided to keep his berth, probably in order to obtain the certificate of service as second officer.\n\nFinally after nine months, on 17 September 1882, after leaving London, the \"Palestine\" sailed from Falmouth for Bangkok, Siam (Thailand). Conrad was, for the first time, fully in charge of a four-man watch—an important step forward in an officer's advancement. The ambiguous status of a novice second mate on a small barque such as the \"Palestine\" required him to be tough and strong-minded, especially in front of the sailors. The passage was slow, uneventful, monotonous, until 11 March 1883, when, in the Bangka Strait between Sumatra and Bangka Island, a smell resembling paraffin oil was noted. Next day, smoke was discovered issuing from the coals; water was thrown on them. On 13 March, four tons of coals were thrown overboard and more water poured down the hold. On 14 March, the hatches not being battened down, the decks blew up fore and aft. The vessel headed for the Sumatra shore, and the \"Somerset\" took it in tow. The fire increased rapidly, and the \"Somerset\" declined to tow the barque on shore. The vessel became a mass of fire, and the crew got off into three boats, which remained by the vessel until the morning of 15 March 1883. That evening the boats arrived at Muntok.\n\nIn his story \"Youth\", Conrad dramatized the accident, stretching it out in time and space and giving a different reason for parting with the towing steamer. In the story, the parting seems very risky; in reality, the disaster took place near shore. And the boats did not steer for Java, to the east of Sumatra, but toward the port of Muntok on Bangka Island, off the east coast of Sumatra. Indeed, Richard Curle's 1922 identification of Muntok as the port where the story's hero experienced his first fascinating encounter with the exotic East revealed the story's greatest exaggeration: the boats could reach shore in some dozen hours, with no need to \"knock about in an open boat\" for \"nights and days\". Conrad had also forgotten, after all those years, that he had three, not two, sailors with him in his boat. But the most interesting discrepancy between story and reality consisted in Conrad's extolling the crew as \"Liverpool hard cases\", whereas in fact there was not a single Liverpudlian in the crew, and half were non-Britons.\n\nThe \"Palestine\"’s Irish first officer, H. Mahon, described him to Conrad's friend George Fountaine Weare Hope as \"'a capital chap,' a good Officer, the best Second Mate he had ever shipped with.\" Conrad officially signed off the \"Palestine\" on 3 April 1883. While he looked in vain for a job that would enable him to sail back to Europe, he explored Singapore's harbor district, which would be the scene for many of his pages. Eventually he returned to England as a passenger on a steamer, reaching London by the end of May.\n\nThe 25-year-old Conrad and his uncle Bobrowski looked forward to a repeatedly postponed meeting, to take place in Kraków; nevertheless, Bobrowski again emphasized in a letter that it was important for Conrad to obtain his British naturalization: \"I should prefer to see your face a little later... as that of a free citizen of a free country, rather than earlier... as that of citizen of the world!... It is really a matter of your looking after your own best interests.\" In any case, the plans had to be changed due to the uncle's stomach troubles and rheumatism. They finally met—for the first time in the five years since Conrad's 1878 suicide attempt in Marseilles—in July 1883 at Marienbad in Bohemia; then on 12 August they left for Teplice, likewise in Bohemia, where Conrad stayed two more weeks. Their meeting appears to have been pleasant. Bobrowski's correspondence became more affectionate and friendly, with fewer admonitions; the prevailing mood became one of intimate understanding. Conrad's own letters from the period, to his uncle and to , in Najder's words, \"allow... one to dispense with an occasionally advanced hypothesis that when [Konrad] left [Poland] he wanted to break once and for all with his Polish past.\"\n\nOn 10 September 1883 Conrad signed on as second mate on the mainly Scandinavian-crewed British clipper \"Riversdale\". The ship sailed from London on 13 September 1883, arriving on 6 April 1884 at Madras, India. There Captain McDonald, a Scot who kept the ship's officers at a distance and treated them \"as machines, to be worked by himself when and as he pleased,\" suffered some kind of \"attack\" which Conrad described to the physician whom he fetched, as alcoholic inebriation. After Captain McDonald learned from a friend, a steamer captain, how Conrad had represented his condition, on 15 April 1884 McDonald dismissed Conrad, with a less than satisfactory certificate, issued on 17 April 1884. The episode seems to have subsequently inspired some of Conrad's scathing literary depictions of sea captains. A court of inquiry later judged McDonald responsible for the subsequent stranding of the \"Riversdale\", which would eventually enable Conrad to take his examination for first mate (the Marine Board having initially delayed accepting his application, put off by McDonald's certificate).\n\nLeaving the \"Riversdale\", Conrad took a train to Bombay, where on 28 April he signed on as second mate of the clipper \"Narcissus\", immortalized 13 years later in the title of his first sea novel, \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\" (1897). The ship sailed for London on 5 June 1884. Thought to have been the original of the title Negro was Joseph Barron, aged 35, who died three weeks before the ship reached Dunkirk. Considering that Captain Archibald Duncan had had trouble with his crew only during the southbound passage—the return voyage was uneventful—Conrad seems to have incorporated into his novel the story of crew trouble heard from Duncan. The \"Narcissus\" entered Dunkirk on 16 October 1884, and next day Conrad signed off.\n\nHaving at last completed the required length of service, Conrad prepared for his first officer's examination. He failed it on 17 November 1884 (he would give no hint of this in \"A Personal Record\", 1912) but, perhaps after coaching by a crammer, passed it on 3 December 1884—over four years after his examination for second mate.\n\nThe years 1885–88 were marked by a fall in demand for new vessels, as the tonnage of individual ships grew; berths for officers fell with the number of ships. The challenge for foreign officers was increased by Britons' resentment of the \"invasion\" of foreigners. \"The fact that Conrad always presented his relationship with his English superiors and employers as free of national conflict is no proof,\" writes Najder, \"since he often smoothed out and retouched his past to render it more consistently positive...\"\n\nConrad searched nearly five months before, on 24 April 1885, in Hull, England, finding a berth as second officer aboard the clipper \"Tilkhurst\", the largest sailing ship in which he served. On 10 June the ship, with a cargo of coal, sailed from Penarth, reaching Singapore on 22 September. The crew once again was largely Scandinavian, and, exceptionally, only one crew member left the ship there. Of the captain, Edwin John Blake, a physician's son, Conrad had the most positive recollections of all his commanders—\"a singularly well-informed mind, the least sailor-like in outward aspect, but certainly one of the best seamen... it has been my good luck to serve under.\" The unloading in Singapore ended on 19 October. The \"Tilkhurst\" sailed to Calcutta, arriving on 21 November. After taking on a load of jute, the ship began its homeward passage on 9 January 1886.\n\nDuring his stay in India, 28-year-old Conrad had sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion, a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at Cardiff in June 1885 just before the \"Tilkhurst\" sailed for Singapore. These letters are Conrad's first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax and phraseology. More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881–83. He had departed from \"hope for the future\" and from the conceit of \"sailing [ever] toward Poland\", and from his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.\n\nFeeling \"sick and tired of sailing about for little money and less consideration,\" Conrad sought Spiridion's advice about the feasibility of engaging in the whaling business—perhaps he hoped to obtain a loan for that purpose from Spiridion and his father. Spiridion later told Jean-Aubry that he dissuaded his young friend from the enterprise.\n\nThe \"Tilkhurst\" arrived in Dundee on 16 June 1886. Conrad signed off the same day. Two letters from uncle Bobrowski awaited him in London. In one, the uncle wrote: \"I deduce from your and [Conrad's business associate Adolf] Krieger's letters [that] you intend to devote yourself to trade and stay in London.\" He urged Conrad to first pass his ship master's examination and obtain British naturalization.\n\nOn 28 July 1886 Conrad failed in his first attempt to pass the master mariner's examination; he again never acknowledged this, to his uncle or to the reading public of his \"A Personal Record\". On 10 November, on the second attempt, he passed the master mariner's examination.\n\nOn 16 February 1887 he signed on as first mate of an iron barque, the \"Highland Forest\", lying in port at Amsterdam. The ship had a crew of 18, including as many as 14 foreigners. The captain was a 34-year-old Irishman, John McWhir (Conrad gave the same name, with an additional \"r\", to the much older master of the \"Nan-Shan\" in the 1902 novel \"Typhoon\"). The \"Highland Forest\" left Amsterdam on 18 February and ran into strong gales. By Conrad's account, some spars were carried away, and a piece of one struck and injured him. On 20 June the ship reached Semarang, Java, and Conrad signed off on 1 July. Next day he boarded the steamship \"Celestial\", disembarking on 6 July at Singapore, where he went for treatment to the European Hospital; Conrad would describe it in his 1900 novel \"Lord Jim\", whose hero had likewise been injured by a falling spar.\n\nThe first mate of the SS \"Celestial\", which had brought Conrad to Singapore, was Frederick Havelock Brooksbank, son-in-law of the then well-known merchant and sailor William Lingard, prototype of Tom Lingard in \"Almayer's Folly\" (1895), \"An Outcast of the Islands\" (1896) and \"The Rescue\" (1920). Conrad never met William Lingard but heard much about him, mainly from Lingard's nephews, James and Joshua Lingard. It was probably through Brooksbank that Conrad met James Craig, master of the small steamer \"Vidar\", which made voyages between Singapore and small ports on Borneo and Sulawesi. James (Jim) Lingard had been living for some years as a trading agent on Borneo, at Berau, on the Berau River. On 22 August 1887 Conrad sailed from Singapore in the \"Vidar\" as first mate; he made four voyages in her: 22 August – 26 September; 30 September – 31 October; 4 November – 1 December 1887; and the last, ending 2 January 1888.\n\nApart from the six days at Muntok in 1883, this was Conrad's first opportunity to see the East up close. The \"Vidar\" penetrated deep inland, steaming up the rivers. Of the six ports of call, four lay in the country's interior, two as much as 30 miles from the sea.\n\nOlmeijer, his name transcribed phonetically as \"Almayer\", became the protagonist of Conrad's first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\" (1895) and a hero of the second, \"An Outcast of the Islands\" (1896); he also appears in the autobiographical volume, \"A Personal Record\" (1912), where Conrad writes: \"If I had not got to know Almayer pretty well it is almost certain there would never have been a line of mine in print.\" But as Jocelyn Baines observes, \"This was paying Almayer too big a compliment because when someone is ready to write there will always be an Almayer to hand.\" In reality, Conrad did not get to know Olmeijer well at all. As he was to write in March 1917, \"[W]e had no social shore connections. [I]t isn't very practicable for a seaman.\" A few days earlier, he had written his publisher: \"... I knew very little of and about shore-people. I was chief mate of the S.S. \"Vidar\" and very busy whenever in harbour.\" Neither the pathetic Almayer of \"A Personal Record\" nor the tragic Almayer of \"Almayer's Folly\" have much in common with the real Olmeijer. Conrad used the names of people he met, and occasionally their external appearances, in his writings only as aids in creating a fictional world from his reminiscences, books that he had read, and his own imagination.\n\nOn 4 January 1888, \"J. Korzeniowski,\" just turned 30, signed off the \"Vidar\" at Singapore. For two weeks, while waiting for a ship to Europe, he stayed at the Sailors' Home (for officers only), where he quarrelled with the steward, Phillips, an evangelist and temperance worker and an inspector of brothels—\"in short,\" writes Najder, \"a professional do-gooder.\" Three decades later, Conrad described his stay in \"The Shadow Line\" (1917), a novel he termed \"not a story really but exact autobiography\"—a misleading description, writes Najder, as usual with Conrad's \"autobiographical\" pieces.\n\nOn 19 January 1888, he was appointed captain of the barque \"Otago\" and left by steamer for Bangkok, Siam (Thailand), where on 24 January he took up his first command. The \"Otago\", the smallest vessel he had sailed in except for the coaster \"Vidar\", left Bangkok on 9 February. After a three-day stop at Singapore, on 3 March it headed for Sydney, Australia, arriving on 7 May. On 22 May, it left for Melbourne; arriving after a difficult and stormy passage, it stayed at anchor in the Melbourne roadstead till 8 June. After taking on a load of wheat, it left for Sydney on 7 July. Arriving five days later, it stayed until 7 August.\n\nThe \"Otago\"'s next voyage, with a cargo of fertilizer, soap and tallow, was to Mauritius, then a British possession east of Madagascar in the southwest Indian Ocean. The ship reached Port Louis on 30 September 1888, setting sail again for Melbourne on 21 November 1888 with a cargo of sugar, arriving on 5 January 1889. The \"Otago\" stayed close to the Australian coast. After being towed to Port Phillip Bay and visiting Port Minlacowie in Spencer Gulf, the \"Otago\" sailed around the Yorke Peninsula, arriving at Port Adelaide on 26 March 1889. Soon after, Captain Korzeniowski gave up his command. He was, Najder explains, \"not a typical seaman... [H]e did not regard his work at sea as permanent... [A]bove all... he had exceptionally wide-ranging interests and cultural needs. Once the first charm of commanding a ship faded, the future writer must have felt the dreariness of sailing in the Antipodes... He must have been oppressed by a sense of being cut off from Europe, deprived of newspapers, books and current news. Even the chances of improving his English were slight: one of his officers in the \"Otago\" was a German and the other a Finn. [T]he command of a small barque with a crew of nine could satisfy neither [Conrad's] ambitions nor his needs.\"\n\nKorzeniowski left Port Adelaide on 3 April as a passenger on the German steamer \"Nürnberg\" (listed as \"Captain Conrad\") and, passing through the Suez Canal, disembarked on 14 May at Southampton, England.\n\nConrad's success in the British Merchant Navy so far had been modest. He had not been captain or first mate in a large vessel, nor had he worked for a firm of importance. \"His foreign origin and looks,\" writes Najder, \"were no help to him.\" Nor had he reached the highest rank in seamanship at the time (which would be discontinued a century later, in the 1990s), that of Extra Master, which required an additional examination. For the time being, he lived on his savings and a modest income from his share in the firm of Baar, Moering & Company.\n\nIn the autumn of 1889 he began writing \"Almayer's Folly\".\n\nConrad's later letters to literary friends show the attention that he devoted to analysis of style, to individual words and expressions, to the emotional tone of phrases, to the atmosphere created by language. In this, Conrad in his own way followed the example of Gustave Flaubert, notorious for searching days on end for \"le mot juste\"—for the right word to render the \"essence of the matter.\" Najder opines: \"[W]riting in a foreign language admits a greater temerity in tackling personally sensitive problems, for it leaves uncommitted the most spontaneous, deeper reaches of the psyche, and allows a greater distance in treating matters we would hardly dare approach in the language of our childhood. As a rule it is easier both to swear and to analyze dispassionately in an acquired language.\" Years later Conrad, when asked why he did not write in French, which he spoke fluently, would reply (puckishly?): \"Ah... to write French you have to know it. English is so plastic—if you haven't got the word you can make it.\"\n\nWith the chances of finding a new job in England seeming slender, Conrad made inquiries on the European Continent. In the first half of November 1889 he traveled to Brussels, Belgium, to meet Albert Thys, the powerful deputy director of the \"Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo\". Apparently the idea of working in Africa had occurred to Conrad for lack of something else; but it probably rekindled his old interest, recently revived by Henry Morton Stanley's expedition in search of Emin Pasha. Additionally, the work paid better than a command at sea.\n\nAfter Johannes Freiesleben, Danish master of the steamship \"Florida\", was murdered by Congo tribesmen on 29 January 1890, Conrad was appointed by Thys' company to take his place. On 10 May 1890, at Bordeaux, he boarded the SS \"Ville de Maceio\" to begin what Najder calls \"the most traumatic journey of his life.\"\n\nAfter his November 1889 meeting with Thys, and before departing for the Congo, Conrad had again gone to Brussels, on 5 February 1890, where he made the acquaintance of a distant relative, Aleksander Poradowski, who had emigrated from Poland after the 1863 Uprising, and who died two days after Conrad's arrival. Conrad's meeting with Poradowski's widow Marguerite, \"née\" Gachet, would prove an important event in his life. His 42-year-old \"aunt\", daughter of a French historian who had settled in Belgium, was a writer whose translations from Polish, and her own fiction, mostly based on Polish and Ukrainian motifs, had been published since 1880 in the renowned \"Revue des Deux Mondes\". For probably the first time since childhood, Conrad had come in direct contact with someone actively engaged in literature.\n\nA few days later Conrad had left for Warsaw, arriving on 9 or 10 February and staying until 12 February. Then he made a two-day visit to Lublin to see his relatives Aniela and Karol Zagórski. On 16 February he was driven in a sleigh from Kalinówka railway station to Kazimierówka, visiting his uncle Bobrowski there till 18 April. At social gatherings, Conrad put off some of the participants. One of them recalled: \"He answered all questions with a strained politeness, he spoke with concentration and listened carefully but one could not fail to notice his extreme boredom... He spoke with a hint of a foreign accent and occasional bursts of our characteristic borderland intonation.\" Najder interprets Conrad's demeanor:\n\nEn route to the Congo, near Grand-Popo, Benin, Conrad saw a French man-of-war, \"Le Seignelay\", shelling a native camp hidden in the jungle. The incident would acquire symbolic import in \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899).\n\nOn 12 June 1890 the \"Ville de Maceio\" reached Boma, 50 miles up from the Congo River estuary. Next day Conrad boarded a small steamer for Matadi, 30 miles farther up, and five miles below the last navigable point on the lower Congo River before rapids make it impassable for a long stretch upriver—the chief Congo seaport, founded as late as 1879 by Henry Morton Stanley. At Matadi Conrad was held up for 15 days and met Roger Casement, who had already been working several years in the Congo. The diary that Conrad kept uniquely for his first 67 days in the Congo shows that he thought very highly of Casement, the future author of a 1904 report on atrocities perpetrated against the native Congolese population, for his own personal profit, by Belgium's King Leopold II.\n\nIt was only on 28 June that Conrad could begin the tedious 230-mile overland trek to the port of Kinshasa, which he completed on 2 August 1890. The steamer \"Florida\", which he was to have commanded, had been seriously damaged and was unfit for sailing. In any case, he could not have taken command immediately on an unfamiliar river; next day he boarded the river steamer \"Roi des Belges\" (King of the Belgians), commanded by a young Dane, Ludvig Rasmus Koch.\n\nThe small, clumsy, noisy river steamer left Kinshasa on 3 August 1890, bound up the Congo River. On the way, over a distance of more than 500 miles, Conrad spotted no more than six villages; later, says Najder, \"Heart of Darkness\" would \"convincingly depict... the threatening atmosphere of isolation.\" The country, formerly rich, had been entirely ruined by the effects of Belgian colonization. One of the four company officials aboard the steamer was Alphonse Keyaerts, whose name Conrad would appropriate for the character Kayerts in his other African tale, \"An Outpost of Progress\" (1897).\n\nOn 1 September 1890 the steamer reached Stanley Falls (now Kisangani), then an important Congo Free State government center. On 6 September, Conrad was appointed \"to take over the command of the SS \"Roi des Belges\"... until the recovery of Captain Koch.\" This, writes Najder, \"constitutes the only basis for Conrad's later claim of having commanded a 'steamer.'\" The ship probably left Stanley Falls back for Kinshasa on 7 or 8 September. On board was Georges-Antoine Klein, a young Frenchman who had recently been appointed the company's commercial agent at Stanley Falls. On 21 September, Klein, who had been ill with dysentery, died. His name (later changed to \"Kurtz\") appears in the manuscript of \"Heart of Darkness\"; otherwise the Frenchman seems not to have had much in common with the novel's character.\n\nIt is unknown whether or how long Conrad was in command of the \"Roi des Belges\" on the way to Kinshasa. When the ship arrived at Bangala on 15 September 1890, Captain Koch was already back in charge.\n\nArriving back at Kinshasa on 24 September 1890, Conrad found a letter from Maria Bobrowska, in Poland—the daughter of his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski's brother, Kazimierz Bobrowski; and three letters from Marguerite Poradowska. Conrad wrote Poradowska:\n\nNajder traces Conrad's conflicts with Delcommune and the other \"Société Anonyme Belge\" employees to the \"sordid instincts\" that motivated Delcommune and the company. \"'Unreliable' persons [such as] Korzeniowski... are not admitted to business.\" Agents were paid high premiums for reducing the costs of obtaining rubber and ivory. Massive deliveries were made compulsory; and punitive expeditions, by members of hostile tribes and cannibals, were sent against non-complying natives. For the natives, the enforced deliveries often meant starvation, since they were left with no time to grow and harvest their crops.\n\nOn 26 September 1890 Conrad left Kinshasa by canoe for Bamou, 30 miles down-river, to get wood cut for the construction of the local station. There he fell ill with dysentery and fever. On 19 October he wrote his uncle Bobrowski from Kinshasa that he was unwell and intended to return to Europe. By 4 December he was back at Matadi. It is not known when and on what ship he returned to Europe. In late January 1891 he appeared in Brussels; on 1 February he was in London. His letters do not mention his recent experiences; he apparently wanted only to forget. As would be suggested in \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899), Conrad was aware how close he had been to himself becoming one of the European despoilers of Africa. His experiences there reinforced his mistrust of human nature.\n\nConrad's African experience made him one of the fiercest critics of the \"white man's mission.\" It was also, writes Najder, his most daring and last \"attempt to become... a cog in the mechanism of society. By accepting the job in the trading company, he joined, for once in his life, an organized, large-scale group activity on land... Until his death he remained a recluse... and never became involved with any institution or clearly defined group of people.\"\n\nConrad spent some months at loose ends and apparently depressed. On 14 November 1891, he decided to step down in rank and accept a berth as first mate in the passenger clipper ship \"Torrens\". Seven days later the ship left London for Australia, on the way picking up passengers at Plymouth.\n\nIt was possibly the finest ship ever launched (1875) from a Sunderland yard. For fifteen years (1875–90), no ship approached her speed for the outward passage to Australia. On her record-breaking run to Adelaide, she covered in 64 days. Conrad writes of her:\n\nIt was the first time Conrad had served on a passenger boat, and it provided opportunities for social contacts with members of the educated class; Conrad made his first acquaintances with Englishmen who were not seamen. During four long voyages in the \"Torrens\" Conrad enjoyed a much more cultivated atmosphere than on any ship he had previously served on.\n\nAfter a calm passage of a hundred days, on 28 February 1892 the \"Torrens\" arrived in Adelaide. Conrad spent over a month in Australia. While he was there, a letter from his uncle Bobrowski informed him that Conrad's cousin Stanisław Bobrowski had been accused, in essence, of social propaganda with \"a tint of [Polish] nationalism\" and had been jailed in the same Warsaw Citadel where Conrad's father had once been held.\n\nOn 10 April 1892 Conrad left Adelaide in the \"Torrens\" and, after 145 days, with stops at Cape Town, South Africa, and Saint Helena, on 2 September arrived in London. He stayed there almost two months, undecided about his future. He would have liked to have had a ship's command, but that did not seem possible.\n\nOn 25 October 1892 he left London again aboard the \"Torrens\". Sea voyages were then considered a health cure, especially for tuberculosis; two convalescing passengers died on the way. Another, William Henry Jacques, a consumptive Cambridge graduate who died less than a year later (19 September 1893), was, according to Conrad's \"A Personal Record\", the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of \"Almayer's Folly\", and Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel. After a passage of 97 days, on 30 January 1893, the \"Torrens\" arrived at Port Adelaide. Writing to Poradowska, Conrad complained of \"the uniform grey of my existence\" and expressed nostalgia for cultivated life and the broad intellectual interests of his correspondent's milieu.\n\nWhen the \"Torrens\" left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand: 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship. The protagonist of one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, \"The Doldrums\" (1895–96), the first mate Armand, is obviously modeled on Conrad. At Cape Town, where the \"Torrens\" remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad. On 26 July 1893 the \"Torrens\" docked at London, and \"J. Conrad Korzemowin\" (per the certificate of discharge) had, without knowing it, completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman.\n\nIn London, letters awaited him from his Uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski, who was in poor health. They discussed Conrad's prospective visit to the uncle and informed Conrad of the trial of his cousin Stanisław Bobrowski—sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, not counting over a year spent under arrest, and sent to a St. Petersburg prison.\n\nConrad resigned from the \"Torrens\", probably because he had lost hope of succeeding his friend W.H. Cope as its captain, and possibly because he was tired of the sailor's profession. He left for Ukraine most likely in early August 1893 and remained with his mentor-uncle at Kazimierówka for over a month. He wrote Poradowska that he had spent five days ill in bed, \"nursed [by Uncle Tadeusz] as if I were a little child.\" She, in a letter, made something of a jealous scene over Maria Ołdakowska, a niece of her late husband Aleksander Poradowski who was getting married.\n\nNajder writes that a graph of Conrad's sailing career would be \"a broken line, but one that climbs between 1874 and 1889... The expedition to Africa stops this upward climb and marks the beginning of a steady... decline. After three years the captain is back to being only second mate, and in a ship going nowhere.\" That ship was the 2,097-ton steamer \"Adowa\" (named for a historic town in Ethiopia), which was to carry emigrants from France to Quebec. Conrad signed on in London on 29 November 1893. On 4 December the \"Adowa\" put in at Rouen. She was expected to leave 9 December for La Rochelle and from there for Quebec City, but passengers failed to materialize—the French showed no eagerness to join in the late-19th-century waves of emigration to the New World—and the steamer remained idle in France. Writing Poradowska, Conrad considered the possibility of a job as a pilot on the Suez Canal. Bored at Rouen, he there began work on chapter 10 (of the 12 chapters) of \"Almayer's Folly\". He wrote Poradowska jokingly how he was taken at the post office for a bomb-carrying anarchist; France was then the scene of many acts of violence, including bombings.\n\nOn 10 January 1894 the \"Adowa\" left Rouen for London. On 17 January 36-year-old \"J. Conrad\" disembarked and unknowingly ended his service at sea.\n\nSix months later, as one of 176 witnesses, he testified before the Board of Trade's Departmental Committee on the Manning of Merchant Ships. He stated that the \"Adowa\" was not sufficiently manned, but considered the manning of the \"Skimmer of the Seas\", the \"Otago\" and the \"Torrens\" satisfactory. Conrad departed from the truth in reporting the length of his service and posts held. He maintained that he had spent 18 months on the Congo River \"in command of a steamer,\" when in fact he had spent only six weeks on the Congo; he also added three months to his command of the \"Otago\", and claimed that he had made two voyages to Mauritius and two passages through Torres Strait; he lengthened his service in the \"Torrens\" by three months; and he alleged that he had made a transatlantic voyage in the \"Adowa\". He was silent about his service in French ships, and about all his Continental European connections generally.\n\nIn fact, during the 19 years from the time that Conrad had left Kraków in October 1874 until he signed off the \"Adowa\" in January 1894, he had worked in ships, including long periods in ports, for 10 years and almost 8 months. He had spent just over 8 years at sea—9 months of this as a passenger.\n\nHe had served as a crew member (steward, apprentice, able-bodied seaman) for over two and a half years (21 months of that at sea); as third mate, 8 months; as second mate (his longest service), almost 4 years (only two and a half years of that at sea); as first mate, two years and three months (two years of that at sea); as captain, one year and two months (half of that at sea). Of his nearly 11 years at sea, 9 months were in steamers.\n\nA bequest from Conrad's uncle and mentor, Tadeusz Bobrowski (who had died on 1 January 1894)—which bequest Conrad, typically, would soon manage to lose—for the moment made it easier for him to retire from the sea and devote himself to a literary career.\n"}

He graduated in Geography and History in 1932, and completed his doctorate at the University of Lisbon in 1935. Between 1937 and 1940 (during World War II), he lived in Paris and worked at the Sorbonne University, alongside March Bloch, Emmanuel de Martonne and A. Demangeon. In 1940 he taught at the University of Coimbra, although he soon settled in his native city of Lisbon. In 1943 he founded the Centro de Estudos Geográficos (Centre for Geographical Studies). Ribeiro also lived in Goa temporarily, where he worked as a geographer for the Portuguese government.\n\nAmong his publications, one book stands out: \"Portugal, o Mediterrâneo e o Atlântico\" [\"Portugal, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic\"] (1945). This is one of the cornerstones in his career, as he develops a detailed study on Portugal's \"dual nature\", or in other words, \"a country which is Atlantic by location but mostly Mediterranean in culture\". Yet, this book had a wide impact, since Ribeiro deepens the concepts of Atlantic Europe and Mediterranean Europe, linking central and southern Portugal to the Mediterranean culture and northern Portugal (together with Galicia) to a pan-Atlantic European culture. In fact, Ribeiro is one of the first geographers formulating the idea of Atlantic Europe as a geographical and cultural unit (it had been partially advanced by Otero Pedrayo), an idea which would be further developed by authors such as P. Flatrès, Emyr Estyn Evans, A. Bouhier, Meynier, J. García Fernández, Patrick O'Flanagan, Barry Cunliffe, Carlos Ferrás Sexto and Xoán Paredes.\n\nHe visited the island of Fogo in Cape Verde which was a Portuguese possession and witnessed the 1951 eruption as he visited which lasted from June 2 to August, he came after the eruption started and also filmed it. He also wrote \"A Ilha do Fogo e as Suas Erupções\" (\"Fogo Island and its Eruptions\") which started publications in 1954, three years after the island's eruption and was finished in 1960, it was about the previous eruptions that occurred on the island up to 1951. On the book, he inspired a large number of pages from Baltasar Lopes da Silva's novel \"Chiquinho\" into one of its chapters. The book was awarded the Lopes de Rego Award in 1957. A small cone made out of the 1951 eruption south of Pico do Fogo (now a volcanic hill) named Monte Orlando was named for him\n\nIn 1958, he later saw the eruption in Capelinhos in the west of Faial Island, Azores.\n\nIn 1966, the Centro de Estudos Geográficos began to publish the geography journal \"Finisterra\", which soon would become the main reference of geographical science in Portugal, to the present day. \n\nRibeiro was also an accomplished photographer, and he would often take the pictures himself for his works.\n\nHe died in Lisbon in 1997.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31429980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31429980", "title": "Transparent eyeball", "text": "Transparent eyeball\n\nThe transparent eyeball is a philosophical metaphor originated by Ralph Waldo Emerson. The transparent eyeball is a representation of an eye that is absorbent rather than reflective, and therefore takes in all that nature has to offer. Emerson intends that the individual become one with nature, and the transparent eyeball is a tool to do that. In the book \"Nature\", Emerson explains that the meaning behind the transparent eyeball is similar to a scientific standpoint on the Bible.\n\nThe idea of the transparent eyeball first appeared in Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay, \"Nature\", published in 1836. In this essay, Emerson describes nature as the closest experience there is to experiencing the presence of God. To truly appreciate nature, one must not only look at it and admire it, but also be able to feel it taking over the senses. This process requires absolute \"solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society\" to uninhabited places like the woods where—\nHowever, only a \"few adult persons can see nature.\" For most people seeing is superficial. It is light illuminating the eye revealing what is physically evident as opposed to sun \"shine[s] into the eye and heart of the child.\" \"Emerson argues that outer and inner vision merge to reveal symbols in the natural landscape. Because of the radical correspondence between visible things and human thoughts, natural facts serve as symbols of spiritual facts, so the natural world is perpetual allegory of the human spirit—an allegory to which the eye gives access.\"\n\n\"Hello: in the midst of wild Nature, the self becomes one with being and god; differentiation, alienation and struggle cease.\"\n\n\"For Emerson, every object rightly seen unlocks a new faculty of the soul and, while he ardently valorizes the physical eye’s potential to see in a way that discovers symbolic meaning, his most memorable metaphorical image for such potential, the transparent eyeball, posits a vision wherein the eye sloughs off its body and ‘egotism,’ merging with what it sees. It is within this transparent, disembodied state of total union with nature that Emerson claims ‘I am nothing; I see all’. The ‘all’ that Emerson seeks access is not simply harmony with nature or even knowledge, but perception of a deep unity between the human spirit and the natural world.\"\n\nEmerson attended Harvard Divinity School in 1825—and by 1826, had applied for a license to preach at the Middlesex Association of Ministers. By 1832, Emerson left the Christian ministry but continued to believe in God. However, he held that God reveals his grandeur not only in scripture, but also through nature. “Emerson's reading in science soon after leaving the ministry was his effort to interpret God's natural book. As Emerson became increasingly interested in science, he eventually came to believe nature, not scripture, was the locus of revelation. His desire to become a naturalist was intimately connected to his yearning to write a new bible of God's revelation in nature.”\n\nSome scholars believe that the “transparent eyeball” passage is an echo of the Bible. ‘In Nature, Emerson fashions himself as a new prophet of nature, believing with Goethe that \"prophetic vision\" arises only in \"slowpaced experiment.\" Vision arises from observing nature, where, as he writes in Nature, \"All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature.\" The essay can be regarded as Emerson's attempt to make nature itself a bible. In this sense, one need not spend Sundays at church but could simply retreat to the ‘woods’ and let nature inhabit his or her consciousness. “The reconstruction of religion in Emerson’s nature works in a number of directions. First, there is an undeniable romantic-naturalism in his writings. One can and should go out into nature, into the fields and forests and be renewed. It follows, then, that Emerson’s religiosity may be read as natural and not supernatural, which may account for his centrality in a tradition of arts and letters which dates to his decisive split with organized religion.” The significance of this shift resulted in Emerson’s paradigmatic role for transcendentalism. “Transcendentalists believe that finding God depended on neither orthodox (Christianity) nor the Unitarians' sensible exercise of virtue, but on one's inner striving toward spiritual communion with the divine spirit.”\n\nWalker Evans is a renowned American photographer, known for his visionary process of aligning “photography with Emerson's original desire to absorb and be absorbed into nature, to become a transparent rather than simply reflective eye.” Walker spent his career during the Great Depression trying to capture images that would be a mirror representation of Americans surrounded by both nature and man-made objects existing in total harmony.\n\nEmerson's description of the “transparent eyeball” functions as a metaphor for the artist's ability to discern the essential nature of objects and as a way to stress that the transcendental is not formless. The \"transparent eyeball\" reflects nature's particulars, much in the way that a camera lens exposes; and in the process illuminates… the \"unrelieved, bare-faced, revelatory\" facts. The transparent eyeball is about capturing and being a part of all of nature and its motion. The camera works in the same fashion. The camera exposes/illuminates all of nature in a single snapshot with more detail and visibility of nature that cannot be taken in by an unaided eye alone.\nTo visually experience and appreciate nature, as Emerson desired, through a transparent state, an individual has to view it. This is similar to the camera. To photograph an image, the individual must first view the scene, then capture what they see. Thus, the “transparent eyeball” is not free from constraints, but is a tool that the individual needs to become one with nature. However, it is not to be understood that “Emerson did not believe in a fundamental god-driven unity underlying the worldly flux, but rather that art's role was to provide an insight into that unity.”\n\nAccording to Amy Hungerford, the influence and use of the transparent eyeball in Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marilynne Robinson’s novel Housekeeping is palpable. Hungerford argues that Robinson’s protagonist Ruth narrates from the perspective of the transparent eyeball.\n\nAnnie Dillard, a prominent critic of transcendentalism, suggests a rather different kind of observer—one conscious of their own embodiment, of a \"particularity\" in space and time, of subjectivity, of the constructiveness, the \"falseness\" of vision. Dillard’s vision is different from Emerson’s because she is conscious of her presence, so she can pay attention to the “falseness” of vision. In this sense, it is safer not to attain nor aim for the transparent eyeball ideal, because vision is limited, and one should “not stalk the truth” of the places where it could be seen.\n\n\n"}

It is the central of the three great Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Ob and the Lena). Rising in Mongolia, it follows a northerly course to the Yenisei Gulf in the Kara Sea, draining a large part of central Siberia, the longest stream following the Yenisei-Angara-Selenga-Ider river system.\n\nThe maximum depth of the Yenisei is and the average depth is . The depth of river outflow is and inflow is .\n\nThe river flows through Tuva, Khakassia and the city of Krasnoyarsk.\n\nIts tributaries include the Angara, Nizhnyaya Tunguska, Podkamennaya Tunguska and Tuba rivers.\n\nThe , partly navigable Upper Angara River feeds into the northern end of Lake Baikal from the Buryat Republic but the largest inflow is from the Selenga which forms a delta on the southeastern side. \n\nThe Yenisei River basin (excluding Lake Baikal and lakes of the Khantayka River headwaters) is home to 55 native fish species, including two endemics: \"Gobio sibiricus\" (a gobionine cyprinid) and \"\" (a grayling). The grayling is restricted to Khövsgöl Nuur and its tributaries. Most fish found in the Yenisei River basin are relatively widespread Euro-Siberian or Siberian species, such as northern pike (\"Esox lucius\"), common roach (\"Rutilus rutilus\"), common dace (\"Leuciscus leuciscus\"), Siberian sculpin (\"Cottus poecilopus\"), European perch (\"Perca fluviatilis\") and Prussian carp (\"Carassius gibelio\"). The basin is also home to many salmonids (trout, whitefish, charr, graylings, taimen and relatives) and the Siberian sturgeon (\"Acipenser baerii\").\n\nThe Yenisei River valley is habitat for numerous flora and fauna, with Siberian pine and Siberian larch being notable tree species. In prehistoric times Scots pine, \"Pinus sylvestris\", was abundant in the Yenisei River valley circa 6000 BC. There are also numerous bird species present in the watershed, including, for example, the hooded crow, \"Corvus cornix\".\n\nThe Taimyr reindeer herd, a migrating tundra reindeer (\"R.t. sibiricus\"), the largest reindeer herd in the world, migrated to winter grazing ranges along the Yenisei River.\n\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenesei River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeneisisk in 1881.\n\nImperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia. One boat was the SS St. Nicholas which took the future Tsar Nicholas II on his voyage to Siberia, and later conveyed Vladimir Lenin to prison.\n\nEngineers attempted to place river steamers on regular service on the river during the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail and parted out river steamers in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisei mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred miles in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.\n\nThe first recreation team to navigate the Yenisei's entire length, including its violent upper tributary in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001. Ben Kozel, Tim Cope, Colin Angus and Remy Quinter were on this team. Both Kozel and Angus wrote books detailing this expedition, and a documentary was produced for National Geographic Television.\n\nA canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.\n\nNomadic tribes such as the Ket people and the Yugh people have lived along the banks of the Yenisei river since ancient times, and this region is the location of the Yeniseian language family. The Ket, numbering about 1000, are the only survivors today of those who originally lived throughout central southern Siberia near the river banks. Their extinct relatives included the Kotts, Assans, Arins, Baikots, and Pumpokols who lived further upriver to the south. The modern Ket lived in the eastern middle areas of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia during the 17th through 19th centuries.\n\nWheat from the Yenisei was sold by Muslims and Uighurs during inadequate harvests to Bukhara and Soghd during the Tahirid era.\n\nRussians first reached the upper Yenisei in 1605, travelling from the Ob River, up the Ket River, portaging and then down the Yenisei as far as the Sym River.\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire agreed to divide Asia along a line that followed the Yenisei River to the border of China, and then along the border of China and the Soviet Union.\n\nStudies have shown that the Yenisei suffers from contamination caused by radioactive discharges from a factory that produced bomb-grade plutonium in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-26, now known as Zheleznogorsk.\n\n\n"}
