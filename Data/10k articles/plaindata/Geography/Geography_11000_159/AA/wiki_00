The center of the earthquake was near the town of Nura, which was destroyed in the quake. The shock destroyed 100 buildings in the area and destroyed the nearby village of Kura. Minor damage also occurred in nearby Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The quake was felt throughout Central Asia. A magnitude 5.7 aftershock in Xinjiang and a magnitude 5.1 aftershock in Kyrgyzstan followed the earthquake. Two more aftershocks above magnitude 5 in Kyrgyzstan and one in Xinjiang struck on October 13, UTC time. Victims were transported in military helicopters to hospitals in Osh.\n\nThe Kyrgyzstan Emergency Ministry said that few buildings remained standing in the village: \"Almost all buildings in the village have been destroyed. The only buildings remaining are the properly engineered ones which were built recently: the school and a medical clinic.\" Kanatbek Abdrakhmatov, head of the Institute of Seismology, attributed much of the destruction due to inferior construction of the buildings, many of which were built out of clay and straw.\n\nThe injured were paid 5,000 Kyrgyzstani soms (US$ 136) and 3 tons of coal, and families of the dead received 50 kg of flour. 200 people wish to remain in Nura, and were provided with 100 6-person tents. 100 mobile homes are being transported to Nura, and the village will be rebuilt in the spring of 2009, and should be completed by August 2009. Uzbekistan pledged the equivalent of US$200,000 in humanitarian aid, including 120 tons of cement, as well as other building materials.\n\nIn Kyrgyzstan, an official day of mourning was observed on October 7, 2008.\n\n"}

It is a primary route from Thurmaston to the A1 junction at Grantham.\n\nThe road used to begin at the junction with the A46 (Fosse Way) in Syston.\n\nThe road begins in Leicester on the A594 inner ring road from the \"Burleys Flyover\" intersection, near Thames Tower, as \"Belgrave Gate\". The section of road was the A46, and also the A6. At \"Belgrave Circle\" (a grade separated junction - the \"Belgrave Flyover\") it meets \"Abbey Park Road\" (B5327) north of the Murco Petroleum Ltd \"Flyover Filling Station\" and Leicester College's Abbey Park Campus at \"Painter Street\", with the college's Technology and Engineering Centre on the eastern side of the flyover, next to the \"Bridle Lane Tavern\". The \"Belgrave Road\" Sainsbury's is on the right. In Belgrave, \"Loughborough Road\" leaves to the left, which was the former A6. The road now becomes \"Melton Road\" and meets the former A6030 at crossroads. On the corner of \"Sandringham Avenue\" there is the BP \"Sandringham Service Station\" on the left, and from here the road becomes a dual-carriageway. There is a roundabout with the \"Owl & Pussycat\" on the left. In Rushey Mead it passes Rushey Mead Academy on the right, and meets the A563 Leicester outer ring road (\"Troon Way\") at crossroads. The former site of the GE Lighting factory (closed in 2007) is on the right (originally British Thomson-Houston, then AEI). The Shell (former TOTAL) \"Fosseway Service Station\" is on the left.\nThe road becomes a primary route, leaves the unitary authority of Leicester and enters Leicestershire and the district of Charnwood. The road used to pass through the centre of Thurmaston, but there is now a bypass to the east (built as the A46) known as \"Newark Road\", where the road leaves the route of the Fosse Way. At the large \"Thurmaston Roundabout\" with \"Barkby Thorpe Lane\", there is a large Asda to the right, with a McDonald's, Pizza Hut and the Thurmaston Shopping Centre retail park. The Syston bypass was originally built as the A46, before the Leicester Western Bypass was built in November 1995. Near The Roundhill Academy in Syston, the road used to diverge from the A46. The Syston bypass is quite some distance longer than driving through Syston itself. It passes the headquarters of Lafarge Cement UK on the right, and there is a left turn for the Watermead Country Park. At Syston the road now meets with the Leicester Western Bypass (A46) at a roundabout, known locally as the \"Hobby Horse Roundabout\" which was widened in May 2006, where there is the \"Hobby Horse\" on the exit to the right, for Syston. At Cossington it crosses the Midland Main Line and leaves the A46 (Fosse Way) at an interchange in the parish of Ratcliffe on the Wreake. The Syston Northern Bypass opened in October 1992.\nThere is a small roundabout as \"Cossington Lane\" with the former Fosse Way, and the road crosses the River Wreake then the Birmingham to Peterborough Line. It meets the former route (east of Syston) at the \"Queniborough Roundabout\". The road used to pass through East Goscote and Rearsby (and access for the Beedles Lake Golf Centre), but is now bypassed to the east. The £7 million bypass was opened on 15 December 2004 by Charlotte Atkins, and construction had begun in April 2004. At the end of the bypass the road enters the district of Melton. There is a left turn for an agricultural college (Brooksby Melton College) at Hoby with Rotherby, where the road is crossed by the Midshires Way. The road is crossed by the Leicestershire Round at Frisby and Kirby. At Kirby Bellars it passes \"The Flying Childers\", named after the Flying Childers race horse.\nEntering Melton Mowbray as \"Leicester Road\", it passes the headquarters of Samworth Brothers on the Leicester Road Industrial Estate and crosses the former Northampton to Nottingham railway and then the Birmingham to Peterborough Line. It meets two roundabouts and passes Long Field Academy to the left. It meets \"Dalby Road\" (B6047, for Tilton on the Hill) to the right at the TOTAL (former BP) \"Malthurst Egerton Park Filling Station\", and crosses the two sections of the River Eye. It passes through the middle of Melton Mowbray, and meets the A606 from the right. Opposite Brooksby Melton College, it meets the A6006 (for Loughborough) to the left, and the A606 exits straight ahead. It follows the exit to the right at the traffic lights crossroads, and passes to the north of the town centre. At the traffic lights junction with the B676 (for Pedigree Petfoods), it leaves to the left, where it is crossed by the Jubilee Way. As \"Thorpe Road\" it passes the small Melton Mowbray Hospital on the right, near the B676 junction, and passes the JET \"Brobot Melton Mowbray\" garage and a Tesco on the right. It bends to the right, and the road ahead, \"Melton Spinney Road\", is the exit for Twinlakes Theme Park (in the parish of Waltham and Thorpe Arnold).\nIn Thorpe Arnold (Waltham and Thorpe Arnold parish) it passes the church, then ascends the Leicestershire wolds, passing Melton Mowbray Golf Club on the right. The Waltham transmitting station dominates the view of the area to the right, and is situated next door to the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. At Waltham on the Wolds, it is crossed by the Mowbray Way, and the primary school is on the left. There is a crossroads next to St Mary Magdalene church, on the right. The \"Royal Horseshoes\" is on the left and the \"Marquis of Granby\" is on the right of the crossroads.\nIn the parish of Croxton Kerrial at Lings Farm, it meets the \"Salters Way\" from the west - a Roman road along the top of the wolds from Six Hills, which eventually reaches Saltersford near Grantham. At this point, Lings Hill, the road is at its highest point of 173 metres. There is a right turn for Branston. In Croxton Kerrial, it passes the \"Peacock\" on the left, and there is a right turn for Knipton (and Belvoir Castle), and a left turn for Saltby. The road bends to the left and the Roman road carries straight on. The road is still on top of the wolds, and at Top Ash Plantation near Hill Top Farm, it meets the Viking Way (Sewstern Lane), and enters South Kesteven and Lincolnshire.\nAt this point it descends from the top of the wolds down into Denton, which it passes to the south. It gently ascends a hill to reach Harlaxton. There is a crossroads, with the left exit for Barrowby. To the right is the entrance to Harlaxton Manor. It descends down the hill towards the A1 and the 400 kV pylon line. There is a roundabout for the northbound A1, where there is a Premier Inn, and the \"Farrier\" (Brewers Fayre) pub.\n\nThis route follows broadly the former route of the Great Northern Railway Grantham to Lincoln line which had stations at Barkston, Honington, Caythorpe, Leadenham, Navenby, Harmston, Waddington and Bracebridge.\nThe road passes under the A1 as \"Harlaxton Road\", with the exit to the southbound A1 (for the Ramada Grantham and the former Fenland Foods), on the left where the road loses its primary route status. It passes close to Walton Girls High School, on the right. Grantham Fire station is on the left, and at a cross roads with traffic lights it meets \"Trent Road\", to the left, and \"Springfield Road\", to the right. \"Springfield Road\" is a spur of the A607, and passes under the East Coast Main Line at a (13 ft - 3.8 m) low bridge, with single-lane access, to meet the A52. Both bridges are regularly hit by lorries, between 10 and 20 times a year. The main section of the road passes a large maltings and Grantham Magistrates Court (now the main magistrates court in south Lincolnshire) on the right, then the \"Huntingtower Arms\", off \"Huntingtower Road\". The BP \"Archways Service Station\" is on the left, and it passes under the ECML at the \"Harlaxton Road\" bridge (arched, 15 ft - 4.5 m at the centre - the highest clearance of the three low railway bridges for journeys across the town), meeting the A52 at the traffic lights (former roundabout) for Grantham railway station. The A607 from the A1 is the most popular, and quickest, route to the railway station.\nThe road follows the A52 on \"Sankt Augustin Way\", following alongside the ECML. It used to follow \"Westgate\" into the Market Place. It passes Asda on the right and meets a small roundabout, taking the exit to the right. It crosses the former \"Great North Road\", and on the corner is the former residence of Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister from 1979–90, now a chiropractic clinic. On the right hand side is The King's School, Grantham, and there is the JET \"Grantham Service Station\" on the right, followed by the \"Waggon & Horses\". At this point the road begins to follow the River Witham, which is to the east. It meets \"Belton Lane\" at traffic lights and Grantham and District Hospital is on the left which is near The Priory Ruskin Academy. \"Manthorpe Road\" passes through Manthorpe, and the St John the Evangelist church is on the left. There is a left turn for Great Gonerby.\n\nAt Belton there is a left exit for the Belton Woods Hotel, country club and golf course. The National Trust Belton House is to the east. The road used to pass through Belton, to the left, but is bypassed. Syston is now bypassed to the east. The road takes a shorter route through Barkston, passing \"The Stag\" and the BP \"Barkston Service Station\". The former route went past the primary school and church. At the Twelve Acre Plantation at Honington, the route leaves the main road to the left, which continues as the A153 (for Sleaford). It crosses the Grantham to Skegness Line at a level crossing. At Carlton Scroop the Viking Way follows the road from the church of St Nicholas, and passes over the former Grantham-Lincoln railway. Sudbrook Moor golf club is to the south, and in front is a BT transmitter on the southern beginnings of the Lincoln Cliff, which follows the road to Lincoln. The Viking Way leaves the road to the east, and the road passes through Normanton-on-Cliffe.\nThe former Grantham-Lincoln railway crosses the road at the point where it enters Frieston. The road passes to the west of Caythorpe on higher ground. On leaving Fulbeck, the road enters North Kesteven and passes over the A17 Leadenham bypass (built in March 1995). It passes the church of St Swithun, and there are traffic lights at crossroads where the road formerly met the A17. In the north of the village is the TOTAL \"F Troop & Son\" garage. At Welbourn it crossed the former Grantham-Lincoln railway with the William Robertson school accessed to the right.\nEntering Wellingore the road ascends the Lincoln Cliff and the villages from here to Lincoln are known as the cliff villages. It passes All Saints church and is crossed by the Viking Way. The villages of Wellingore and Navenby run into each other. The Viking Way follows road, to the west, from here to Lincoln. At Boothby Graffoe the road passes St Andrews church and meets the B1202, for Metheringham to the east and is crossed by 400 kV pylons. It passes to the east of Coleby and at Harmston the road is briefly joined by the Viking Way and there is crossroads with the B1178, to the east. RAF Waddington's airfield is nearby to the right. The road passes through Waddington, and bisects the older village to the left with the newer RAF housing to the right, passing the JET (former Texaco) \"Waddington Service Station\". On the road to Bracebridge Heath, there are views from the limestone edge of North Hykeham to the west. Entering Bracebridge Heath as \"Grantham Road\", it briefly follows the line of the former Roman road Ermine Street, passing the TOTAL \"Bracebridge Heath Filling Station\", then diverts to right, passing St John's church and meets the A15 at traffic lights and a T junction.\n\n"}

{"id": "669919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=669919", "title": "Avala", "text": "Avala\n\nAvala (, ) is a mountain in Serbia, overlooking Belgrade. It is situated in the south-eastern corner of the city and provides a great panoramic view of Belgrade, Vojvodina and Šumadija, as the surrounding area on all sides is mostly lowlands. It stands at above sea level, which means that it enters the mountain category just by .\n\nAvala is located south-east of downtown Belgrade. The entire area of the mountain belongs to the Belgrade City area, majority of it being in the municipality of Voždovac, with the eastern slopes being in the municipality of Grocka, and the southernmost extension in the municipality of Sopot. It is possible that in the future the entire area of Avala will create a separate municipality of Belgrade, named Avalski Venac.\n\nAvala is a low type of the Pannonian island mountain, though it is actually the northernmost mountain in Šumadija. Until 600,000 years ago, when the surrounding low areas were flooded by the inner Pannonian Sea, Avala was an island, just as the neighboring mountains (Kosmaj, Fruška Gora, etc.), thus earning its geographical classification. However, the Avala remains an \"island mountain\" as the area around it, Pinosava plateau of the northern Low Šumadija, is low and mostly flat. In the north it extends into the woods of Stepin Lug.\n\nThe mountain is built of serpentinite, limestone and magmatic rocks, which are injected in the shape of cone (laccolith). Other peaks include Ladne vode (), Zvečara (), Sakinac (). The Avala had deposits of ores, most notably lead and mercury's ore of cinnabarite but mining activities which can be traced to the pre-Antiquity times. Archeologist Miloje Vasić believed that the vast mines of cinnabarite (mercury-sulfide) on Avala were crucial for the development of the Vinča culture, on the banks of the Danube circa 5700 BC. Settlers of Vinča apparently melted cinnabarite and used it in metallurgy.\n\nIn Medieval Serbia mining began in c.1420, after the Law on mines was issued by the Despot Stefan Lazarević in 1412. In this period, the cinnabarite was used for the fresco paintings and was exported to Greece. Mining activities ceased by the 1960s, when the last two mines, Šuplja Stena and Crveni Breg, were closed. Šuplja Stena (\"Hollow Boulder\") was a mercury mine while in Crveni Breg (\"Red Hill\"), lead, zinc, silver and gold were extracted. Crveni Breg was closed in 1953 and has traces of the usage from the Roman period. It has seven levels, out of which four are flooded, and the stalactites are being formed inside. By 2009 upper level was prepared for the visitations, being cleaned and lighted for some but the project of turning it into the tourist attraction failed.\n\nAvala is also a location where the mineral avalite, named after the mountain, was found. A greenish mineral, chromian, magnesian or potassic alumosilicate (variety of the mineral illite), it was discovered by Serbian chemist Sima Lozanić who established its formula. Optically examined by the Israeli mineralogist Tamir Grodek who classified it as a member of the mica mineral group.\n\nOn the southern slopes, in the area of Ripanj, the closed \"Tešićev Majdan\" (\"Tešić Quarry\") is located. The stone pit was privately owned, but was confiscated by the state after World War II and stopped operating before 1960. In the process of the restitution after 2000, the quarry was returned to the surviving owners, but they live abroad so the quarry is still not operational. It is the only known location of kersantite in Serbia, a worldwide rare type of greenish granite. For decades, kersantite was used for the Belgrade buildings, including some of the most representative ones. Features built with this stone include the fountain between the Novi Dvor and Stari Dvor, bordure of the Hotel Bristol, Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, pedestal of the Play of Black Horses statues in front of the House of the National Assembly of Serbia and buildings of Belgrade Cooperative, Elementary School King Petar I, Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel and Main Post Office Building. As the buildings began to deteriorate in time, city authorities showed interest in the quarry, not only for the repairs but also for the future construction. For now, when some deteriorated kersantine feature has to be replaced, the artificial stone is used (as in the case of the pedestal of the Play of Black Horses). Geologists suggested to the city to obtain the ownership over the land on which the pit is located and to reopen it. City government announced in 2012 that it will unilaterally explore the pit until it gets reopened and inspected it in 2013. They found still existing large amounts of already cut kersantite and that locals illegally extract the stone and crush it to cover the roads with it. After the political change in Belgrade in the late 2013, the motion was dropped.\n\nOn the mountain itself, there are several springs, of which the Sakinac is best known. Despite being the only mountain in the area, the Avala is not a source of many rivers. The Topčiderka river, originating in the woods of Lipovička šuma on the south-west, flows on the western slopes of Avala, while the river Bolečica flows on the eastern slopes. Other minor flows include the Vranovac, a tributary to the Bolečica. Small artificial lake near the village of Pinosava is created on the western slope of the mountain. The settlements in the area are notorious for problems with shortages of drinking water during summer.\n\nDespite being officially protected for almost 150 years, it was only in 2007 that preservation plans for the mountain were made. That way, Avala entered a circle of protected green areas of Belgrade, which also included the mountain of Kosmaj, the island of Veliko Ratno Ostrvo and the woods of Stepin Lug, with the forests of Košutnjak and Topčider to be added next. Protected areas of Avala spread over \n\nAvala is known for its diverse plant life, despite not being a tall mountain. There are over 600 plant species living on the mountain. Some of them are protected by the law as natural rarities, like certain types of laburnum, box tree, black broom, common holly and martagon lily. The area is also abundant in medical herbs, like the early-purple orchid and belladonna. Almost 70% of Avala is forested. High woods mostly consist of durmast oak, Turkey oak, hornbeam, beech, linden, black pine, black locust and other trees.\n\nAlmost 100 species of birds live on Avala, including strictly protected Eurasian sparrowhawk, European honey buzzard and European green woodpecker.\n\nA section of the mountain is organized as a game hunting ground.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the town of Žrnov or \"Avalski Grad\" (Avala town) was located on top of Avala. In 1442. it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, which built a new town in Žrnov's place as a counter-fortress to the Belgrade city fort, and renamed it \"havale\", which originally comes from Arabic and means \"obstacle\" or \"shelter\".\n\nThe mountain has been protected since 1859 as a natural monument, or, by the modern standards, \"sight of the exquisite values\". That year, Prince Miloš Obrenović of Serbia issued an order for the Avala to get fenced and protected that way. Remains of the medieval Žrnov were removed in 1934 to make way for the Monument to the Unknown Hero. The destruction of Žrnov, which was demolished with dynamite, caused a massive discontent among the citizens of Belgrade.\n\nIn the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the mountain was declared a national park, in 1936. In 1946, by the ukaz of the Presidium of the National Assembly of Serbia, Avala was reduced to the status of the \"public property of general benefit\" and placed under direct management of the Government of Serbia.\n\nAvala was a key point during the Belgrade Offensive in October 1944, a fighting for the liberation of Belgrade in World War II. Germans halted their mechanized units along the Smederevo road, at Mali Mokri Lug, continued equipped with the light weapons and spread over Avala. German units were commanded by lieutenant general , who was killed during the battle. Germans also had a 7th SS division at the mountain, but after the joint attack of Yugoslav Partisans and Red Army, Belgrade was liberated on 20 October 1944.\n\nIn 1965, a Avala TV Tower was constructed, one of the tallest structures in the Balkans, by the architects Uglješa Bogunović, Slobodan Janjić and M. Krstić. It had a restaurant-look out on . The tower was destroyed during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999. Its total reconstruction began in 2006 and was officially opened at a ceremony on 21 April 2010. The new tower is almost the exact replica of the destroyed one, including the unique three-feet base. Belgrade's General Urbanistic Plan (GUP) for the 2001-2021 period defines the mountain as a sports and recreation area.\n\nSettlements near the mountain are not much populous. They include Ripanj (on the south, the largest one, with a population of 11,088 by the 2011 census of population), Pinosava (on the west, 3,151), Zuce (on the north-east, 2,001), Beli Potok (on the north, 3,621), all in the municipality of Voždovac, and Vrčin (on the east, 9,088), in the municipality of Grocka.\n\nA motion is in the process of creating a new municipality called Avalski Venac, which would include all these settlements and possible few others, but Zoran Alimpić, the acting mayor of Belgrade from September 2007 to August 2008, stated that new municipalities will probably not be formed before 2011 or 2012. The idea was later put on hiatus.\n\nAvala is well connected with Belgrade and other parts of Serbia via roads, highway and railroads.\n\n\"Avalski drum\" (\"Avala road\") is an extension of the Boulevard of the Liberation, which directly connects the mountain to downtown Belgrade (via neighborhoods of Selo Rakovica, Jajinci, Banjica, Voždovac, Autokomanda, Karađorđev Park and Slavija). On the mountain, \"Avalski drum\" divides in three:\nSub-Avalan settlements are directly connected to Belgrade by the bus lines of the city's public transportation, with terminus in the Belgrade's neighborhood of Trošarina.\n\nThe Belgrade–Niš highway, a section of one of the major European roads, European route E75, runs east of the mountain, through Vrčin. North of the mountain runs \"Kružni put\", the most important road in the southern outskirts of Belgrade, which connects all the southern sections of the city. It is also a projected route of the future Belgrade beltway which would continue through the Bolečica river valley and the projected Vinča-Omoljica bridge over the Danube into Vojvodina.\n\nRailroads also run on both sides of the mountain. Eastern branch is a section of the Belgrade-Niš railroad. It runs through the tunnel under the Avala at Beli Potok and then through Včrin. Western branch runs through Ripanj and the long \"Ripanj tunnel\" (though not under the Avala), and continues into western Serbia and further into Montenegro, as part of the Belgrade–Bar railway.\n\nAvala is a traditional picnic resort for Belgraders, but its capacities are not being used much. In 1984 number of tourists was only 15,700 despite over 1.5 million of inhabitants in Belgrade. Some attractions and capacities on the mountain include:\n\nSpecial attractions of the Avala are several monuments. They include:\n\n\nAnnually, from July 1 until July 10, a traditional camp of Serbian mountaineers is held on the Avala. Among other mountaineering activities, there are competitions in:\n\nThe first skiing competition in Yugoslavia was held on Avala in 1929 and the first local, Serbian competition after World War II was also held here, in 1946. The usual route was the one starting at the logger's cabin and ending all the way to the foothills above Ripanj. The tracks were quite crude. Despite low altitude, construction of the ski resort, with sports and recreational venues and a cable car have been proposed in 1994 and 2005. In October 2018, city government announced plans to set a long piste. The construction of the complex, which is planned to be operational over the entire year (skiing specifically from November to February), should start in 2019. The piste will start in the immediate vicinity of the tower and end at the logger's cabin. Due to the altitude and the climate, the north-western slope is chosen. The track has been labeled as the \"blue\", which means it is of and intermediate level of difficulty.\n\nPhase I includes the construction of the piste, ski lift, training trail, snowmaking cannons, decorative lights, parking lots and special machinery. Phase II comprises the building of the bobsled on rails track, zip-line, mini golf course, artificial climbing rock, children playground and an adventure park. Projected price is €5 million.\n\n\n\n"}

In May 1931 AO Komseverput was reorganized into VO Glavkomseverput; the organization employed 35,000 men scattered all over Arctic, as well as a sizable staff in Moscow and in other mainland cities. A new office, Glavsevmorput, was established in December 1932 and absorbed VO Glavkomseverput in May 1933. Overall management was assigned to the Arctic explorer Otto Schmidt, who had previously managed the Arctic Institute (VAI, later AANII). Glavsevmorput had its own Polar Air service Aviaarktika, headed by Mark Shevelev.\nGlavsevmorput, in addition to running Arctic shipping, also became the Soviet agency for exploiting resources across the far north and coordinating supplies and transport. It aimed to contribute to the development of northern coastal Siberia; the office was empowered to establish seaports, conduct extensive research, and trade with the United States and Japan as was necessary to its principal function. The organization's quick unchecked expansion, especially in its Moscow offices, was initially masked by the successes of the 1934-1936 seasons.\n\nHowever, the season of 1937, through a combination of unrealistic plans, bad weather and bad luck, proved a disaster. Twenty-five of 64 ships dispatched on the route (many of them not fit for Arctic conditions) were trapped with crews and cargoes in the Arctic winter; one, \"Rabochiy\", sank. The débâcle, which coincided with the Great Purge of 1936-1938, led to a string of arrests; at least 673 Glavsevmorput personnel were arrested in a domino-effect NKVD operation. The oversized organization was streamlined and stripped of auxiliary functions that were delegated to Dalstroy (land facilities) and to the State trading company (foreign trade). Glavsevmorput was to concentrate exclusively on maintaining the Northern Sea Route, specifically running its coastal shipping line. \n\nOtto Schmidt, once an extremely highly publicized personality, was spared but demoted to scientific duties; overall management of the organization was assigned to Ivan Papanin, a famous polar explorer. Papanin's first season, 1939, was a relatively safe and successful one; the Northern SeaRoute had become a functioning regular line, rather than a dangerous experiment.\n\nIn 1953 the organization, previously enjoying the status of a national ministry, was downgraded to a department within the Ministry of Merchant Fleet. In 1964 the department was dissolved. Its units were reassigned to the , the and the . The system continued working and reached peak capacity in 1987.\n\nA large island at the mouth of the Kolyma River (Mikhalkino) was named Glavsevmorput (or GUSMP) Island in honour of the organization .\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Eton, and thereafter elected to King's College, Cambridge, 17 August 1536, of which he is supposed to have been elected fellow in 1539. He took the degree of BA in 1540–1, and of M.A. in 1544, and was appointed schoolmaster to the \"young courtly companions of Edward VI\" at Greenwich 3 May 1552, at a salary of £10 per annum. He died 9 Jan 1586–7, and was buried at St. Alphege, Greenwich.\n\nThe earliest mention of Adams in the printed literature of the sixteenth century is by his contemporary, Richard Eden, the father of English geography. From the pages of his little read and less known \"Decades\" we learn that Clement Adams was a schoolmaster and not a traveller. To Adams we owe the first written account of the earliest English intercourse with Russia. Eden writes: ‘Wheras I have before (p. 252) made mention howe Moscouia was in our tyme discoured by the direction and information of the sayde master Sebastian [Cabote] who longe before had this secreate in his minde, I shall not neede here to describe that viage, forasmuch as the same is largely and faithfully written in the Latyn tonge by that lerned young man, Clement Adams, scol mayster to the Queenes henshemen (i.e. pages of honour) as he received it at the mouth of the sayde Richard Chancelor.'\n\nThe incidental allusion to the old pilot major Sebastian Cabot has some significance in connection with Adams. Cabot, it is well known, made a famous Mappe-monde, recording, among other things, the discoveries of himself and his father, John Cabot, along the coast of 'Newfoundland' (either Nova Scotia or Newfoundland) in 1497, the date of which discovery has been the subject of much debate among geographers and antiquaries. A contemporary copy of Cabot's map, discovered in Germany, is preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the original of which is now lost, in a volume edited by Nathan Chytræus, first published in 1594. It would appear that there was also a copy preserved at Oxford at the period named; be this as it may, we learn from Hakluyt, in 1584, that yet another copy was made and 'cut' by Adams, which was evidently well known at the period, for we read in a manuscript by Hakluyt on \"Westerne Planting\" (discovered in 1854) of 'the copye of [Gabote's] map sett out by Mr. Clemente Adams, and is in many marchants houses in London.' Hakluyt, five years later, amplifies this statement as to the map by Adams, in quoting a legend relating to the discoveries of the Cabots to be found upon it, described by him as 'an extract taken out of the mappe of Sebastian Cabot, cut by Clement Adams, concerning his [Cabot's] discovery of the West Indias which is to be seene in her Maiesties privie gallerie at Westminster, and in many other ancient merchants houses.' No copy of this map engraved by Adams is now known to exist.\n\nThe only basis for the assumption that he was a traveller is the association of his name with that of Richard Chancellor. That he did not accompany Chancellor in his first voyage to Russia in 1553 is certain, for the name of every person above the rank of an ordinary seaman that accompanied both Sir Hugh Willoughby and Chancellor in the voyage is preserved to us in the pages of Hakluyt (cf. edition of 1589, p. 266). The name of the only clerkly person among the two crews was that of John Stafford, 'minister' on board the 'Edward Bonaventure,' commanded by Chancellor.\n\nThe work referred to by Eden was committed to writing by Adams upon Chancellor's return from his first voyage to Russia in 1554. The title runs thus: ‘Nova Anglorum ad Moscovitas navigatio Hugone Willowbeio equite classis præfecto, et Richardo Cancelero nauarcho. Authore Clemente Adamo, Anglo.’ It was first printed by Hakluyt in his Collections of 1589. This is followed by a translation headed thus: ‘The newe Nauigation and discouerie of the kingdome of Moscouia, by the North east, in the yeere 1553; Enterprised by Sir Hugh Willoughbie, knight, and perfourmed by Richard Chanceler, Pilot maior of the voyage. Translated out of the former Latine into English,’ probably by Hakluyt himself. In the two subsequent editions of Hakluyt the Latin text by Adams is omitted.\n\n"}

Two other Iapygian tribes, the Peucetians and the Messapians, inhabited central and southern Apulia respectively. All three tribes spoke the Messapian language, but had developed separate archaeological cultures by the seventh century BC. The Daunians lived in the eponymous region Daunia, which extended from the Ofanto river in the southeast to the Gargano peninsula in the northwest. This region is mostly coincident with the Province of Foggia today.\n\nTowards the late Bronze Age (11th-10th centuries BC), Illyrian populations from the eastern Adriatic arrived in Apulia. The Illyrians in Italy, united with the pre-existing people and groups from the Aegean, probably from Crete, created the Iapygian civilization which consisted of three tribes: Peucetia, Messapi and the Dauni. The region was previously inhabited by Italic peoples of Southern Italy; among them are the Ausones/Oscans, Sabines, Lucani, Paeligni, Bruttii, Campanians, Aequi, Samnites and Frentani.\n\nThe Dauni were similar to but also different from the Peucetii and Messapii, who settled in central and southern Puglia. Having been also less influenced by the Campanian civilization, it had thus a more peculiar culture, featuring in particular the Daunian steles, a series of funerary monuments sculpted in the 7th-6th centuries BC in the plain south of Siponto, and now mostly housed in the National Archeological Museum of Manfredonia. Particularly striking is the Daunian pottery (as yet little studied) which begins with geometric patterns but which eventually includes crude human, bird and plant figures.\n\nThe main Daunian centers were \"Teanum Apulum\" (within the modern San Paolo di Civitate), \nUria Garganica, the location of which though is not known with certainty, Casone, Lucera, \"Merinum\" (Vieste), Monte Saraceno (near Mattinata), Siponto, Coppa Navigata, Cupola, Salapia (near Cerignola and Manfredonia), Arpi (near Foggia), \"Aecae\" (near Troia), \"Vibinum \"(Bovino), Castelluccio dei Sauri, \"Herdonia\" (Ordona), \"Ausculum \"(Ascoli Satriano), Ripalta (near Cerignola), Canosa di Puglia, Melfi, Lavello and Venosa.\n\nThe ethnonym is connected to the name of the wolf, plausibly the totemic animal of this nation. The cult of the wolf was widespread in ancient Italy and was related to the Arcadian mystery cult. In fact, \"daunos\" means wolf, according to ancient glosses, and is the correspondent of Greek \"taunos\" from an Indo-European root *dhau- to strangle, meaning literally \"strangler\". Among the Daunian towns one may mention Lucera (Leucaria) and among other nations the ethnonym of the Lucani (Loucanoi) and that of the Hirpini, from another word meaning wolf. The outcome of the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirate \"dh\" is proper of the Illyrian languages and so is different from the corresponding Latin \"faunus\" and Oscan, which is not attested.\n\nThere are numerous testimonies among ancient authors (Pseudo-Scylax, Virgil, Festus, Servius) of a presence of the Daunians beyond the Apennines in Campania and Latium where some towns claimed Diomedian origins. The most notable instance is Ardea, the centre of the Rutulians who were considered Daunians: Vergil writes that Turnus' father was Daunus. Festus writes that a King Lucerus of Ardea fought along with Romulus against Titus Tatius and this is the origin of the name of the Roman Luceres.\n"}

The greater parts of the surrounding area of Demir Hisar are smaller hills and mountains, and a small part which is spread around the mentioned river is low lands. A signature of this area are the mountains Bigla, Ilinska and Plakenska, on which is the highest peak reaching 2000 m which separates the region of Demir Hisar with the lake regions of Prespa and Ohrid.\n\nThe name of Demir Hisar derives from the treasure of iron which the surrounding mountains in this region have, which is why it is called \"Iron Fortress\". The name has been changed according to the ruler and his ruling period. When it was ruled by the Greeks, it was known as Sidero Kastron which in translation means ‘Iron Fortress’, and when it was overtaken by the Ottoman army, the name was changed into ”Demir Hisar” which in their language also means ‘’ Iron Fortress’’. “Demir Hisar” was maintained as the town's name when in Yugoslavia, and remained so in Macedonia. \n\nThe community of Demir Hisar comprises 10,610 inhabitants, 0.53% of the population of Macedonia, and 21% of them live in the town Demir Hisar. The town is spread over 473 km² and it is accounted that nearly 23.6 people live per square kilometre. With the new structure of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, the municipality of Sopotnica was integrated into Demir Hisar municipality. Today the municipality of Demir Hisar is spread over a territory of 473 km². As part of this municipality, 41 inhabited places are included, from which the central part is the town Demir hisar with a population of 2,447.\n\nThe community started developing somewhere in 1945 soon after the end of the Second World War. First in Demir Hisar was formed a political – social administrative community – Local public administration, and it was placed in the village of Lopatica but then, with the change of the territorial and urban laws in the republic, it was set in Murgaševo. \n\nDemir Hisar as a community is an independent society which is in constant progress, and now is a well-developed and well-known place in the Republic, with their own systems for water, electricity, garbage disposal systems and extensive roads that lead to neighbouring communities.\n\nFolk ensemble \"Ilinden\" works in the Cultural Educational Centre. It has a small, middle, and big group, own orchestra with a total of 150 members. The ensemble was formed in 1993. With it work three choreographers as external collaborators of the CEC. At repertoire of folk ensemble there are 10 choreographies which are presented afore citizens of Demir Hisar, in neighborhood municipalities and wide in Macedonia and abroad (Serbia and Montenegro, Bulgaria and Austria). In these places ensemble \"Ilinden\" has received widespread recognition and awards.\n\nMention must be made of participation in festivals like \"Ilindenski Denovi\" Bitola, \"Injevo\" -Radovis, \"10 days Krusevo Republic\" - Krusevo, days of Cultural Educational Centres of Macedonia, etc.\nGuests of ensemble \"Ilinden\" have been many ensembles from many countries like, \"Ograzdence\" - Petric (Bulgaria), \"Nisan\" - Sandanski (Bulgaria), \"Kapance\" - Razgrad (Bulgaria), \"Tanasko Rajic\" - Cacak (Serbia and Montenegro), \"Stubline\" -Obrenovac (Serbia and Montenegro) and \"Floricanka\" - Razin (Moldavia).\nCultural Educational Centre \"Ilinden\" - Demir Hisar, with Folk Ensemble up to now have great cooperation with other Cultural Educational Centers in Macedonia, and that cooperation brings many collective concerts (with Krusevo, Makedonski Brod, Demir Kapija) and concerts with ensembles \"Ilinden\" - Bitola, and \"Vlado Tasevski\" - Skopje.\n\nIlinden plans many new visits for the future in Macedonia as well as abroad.\n\n"}

{"id": "3690682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3690682", "title": "Eötvös effect", "text": "Eötvös effect\n\nThe Eötvös effect is the change in perceived gravitational force caused by the change in centrifugal acceleration resulting from eastbound or westbound velocity. When moving eastbound, the object's angular velocity is increased (in addition to the earth's rotation), and thus the centrifugal force also increases, causing a perceived reduction in gravitational force.\n\nIn the early 1900s (decade), a German team from the Institute of Geodesy in Potsdam carried out gravity measurements on moving ships in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. While studying their results the Hungarian nobleman and physicist Baron Roland von Eötvös (Loránd Eötvös) noticed that the readings were lower when the boat moved eastwards, higher when it moved westward. He identified this as primarily a consequence of the rotation of the earth. In 1908 new measurements were made in the Black Sea on two ships, one moving eastward and one westward. The results substantiated Eötvös' claim. Since then geodesists use the following formula to correct for velocity relative to the Earth during a measurement run.\n\nHere,\n\nThe first term in the formula, 2\"Ωu\" cos(φ), corresponds to the Eötvös effect. The second term is a refinement that under normal circumstances is much smaller than the Eötvös effect.\n\nThe most common design for a gravimeter for field work is a spring-based design; a spring that suspends an internal weight. The suspending force provided by the spring counteracts the gravitational force. A well manufactured spring has the property that the amount of force that the spring exerts is proportional to the extension of the spring from its equilibrium position (Hooke's law). The stronger the effective gravity at a particular location, the more the spring is extended; the spring extends to a length at which the internal weight is sustained. Also, the moving parts of the gravimeter will be dampened, to make it less susceptible to outside influences such as vibration.\n\nFor the calculations it will be assumed that the internal weight has a mass of 10 kilograms, 10,000 grams. It will be assumed that for surveying a method of transportation is used that gives good speed while moving very smoothly: an airship. Let the cruising velocity of the airship be 25 meters per second (90 km/h, 55 miles/h).\n\nTo calculate what it takes for the internal weight of a gravimeter to be neutrally suspended when it is stationary with respect to the Earth, the Earth's rotation must be taken into account. At the equator, the velocity of Earth's surface is about 465 meters per second. The amount of centripetal force required to cause an object to move along a circular path with a radius of 6378 kilometres (the Earth's equatorial radius), at 465 m/s, is about 0.034 newtons per kilogram of mass. For a 10,000-gram internal weight, that amounts to about 0.34 newtons. The amount of suspension force required is the mass of the internal weight (multiplied by the acceleration of gravity) minus those 0.34 newtons. In other words: any object co-rotating with the Earth at the equator has its measured weight reduced by 0.34 percent, thanks to the Earth's rotation.\n\nWhen cruising at 10 m/s due East, the total velocity becomes 465 + 10 = 475 m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.0354 newtons per kilogram. Cruising at 10 m/s due West the net velocity is 465 − 10 = 455 m/s, requiring about 0.0325 newtons per kilogram. So if the internal weight is neutrally suspended while cruising due East, after reversing course it will not be neutrally suspended any more: the apparent mass of the 10,000-gram internal weight will increase by about 3 grams, and the spring of the gravimeter must extend some more to accommodate this greater weight.\n\nIn high-performance meteorological models, this effect needs to be taken into account on a terrestrial scale. Air masses with significant velocity with respect to the Earth have a tendency to migrate to another altitude, and when the accuracy demands are strict this must be taken into account.\n\nDerivation of the formula for motion along the Equator.\n\nA convenient coordinate system in this situation is the inertial coordinate system that is co-moving with the center of mass of the Earth. Then the following is valid: objects that are at rest on the surface of the Earth, co-rotating with the Earth, are circling the Earth's axis, so they are in centripetal acceleration with respect to that inertial coordinate system.\n\nWhat is sought is the difference in centripetal acceleration of the surveying airship between being stationary with respect to the Earth and having a velocity with respect to the Earth. The following derivation is exclusively for motion in east-west or west-east direction.\n\nNotation:\n\nIt can readily be seen that in the case of motion along the equator the formula for any latitude simplifies into the formula above.\n\nThe second term represents the required centripetal acceleration for the airship to follow the curvature of the earth. It is independent of both the Earth's rotation and the direction of motion. For example, when an aeroplane carrying gravimetric reading instruments cruises over one of the poles at constant altitude, the aeroplane's trajectory follows the curvature of the earth. The first term in the formula is zero then, due to the cosine of the angle being zero, and the second term then represents the centripetal acceleration to follow the curvature of the Earth's surface.\n\nThe mathematical derivation for the Eötvös effect for motion along the Equator explains the factor 2 in the first term of the Eötvös correction formula. What remains to be explained is the cosine factor.\n\nBecause of its rotation, the Earth is not spherical in shape, there is an Equatorial bulge. The force of gravity is directed towards the center of the Earth. The normal force is perpendicular to the local surface.\n\nOn the poles and on the equator the force of gravity and the normal force are exactly in opposite direction. At every other latitude the two are not exactly opposite, so there is a resultant force, that acts towards the Earth's axis. At every latitude there is precisely the amount of centripetal force that is necessary to maintain an even thickness of the atmospheric layer. (The solid Earth is ductile. Whenever the shape of the solid Earth is not entirely in equilibrium with its rate of rotation, then the shear stress deforms the solid Earth over a period of millions of years until the shear stress is resolved.)\n\nAgain the example of an airship is convenient for discussing the forces that are at work. When the airship has a velocity relative to the Earth in latitudinal direction then the weight of the airship is not the same as when the airship is stationary with respect to the Earth.\n\nIf an airship has an eastward velocity, then the airship is in a sense \"speeding\". The situation is comparable to a racecar on a banked circuit with an extremely slippery road surface. If the racecar is going too fast then the car will drift wide. For an airship in flight that means a reduction of the weight, compared to the weight when stationary with respect to the Earth.\n\nIf the airship has a westward velocity then the situation is like that of a racecar on a banked circuit going too slow: on a slippery surface the car will slump down. For an airship that means an increase of the weight.\n\nThe first term of the Eötvös effect is proportional to the component of the required centripetal force perpendicular to the local Earth surface, and is thus described by a cosine law: the closer to the Equator, the stronger the effect.\n\nThe same gravimeter is used again, its internal weight has a mass of 10,000 grams.\n\nCalculating the weight reduction when stationary with respect to the Earth: \nAn object located at 60 degrees latitude, co-moving with the Earth, is following a circular trajectory, with a radius of about 3190 kilometer, and a velocity of about 233 m/s. That circular trajectory requires a centripetal force of about 0.017 newton for every kilogram of mass; 0.17 newton for the 10,000 gram internal weight. At 60 degrees latitude, the component that is perpendicular to the local surface (the local vertical) is half the total force. Hence, at 60 degrees latitude, any object co-moving with the Earth has its weight reduced by about 0.08 percent, thanks to the Earth's rotation.\n\nCalculating the Eötvös effect: \nWhen the airship is cruising at 25 m/s towards the east the total velocity becomes 233 + 25 = 258 m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.208 newton; local vertical component about 0.104 newton. Cruising at 25 m/s towards the west the total velocity becomes 233 − 25 = 208 m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.135 newton; local vertical component about 0.068 newton. Hence at 60 degrees latitude the difference before and after the U-turn of the 10,000 gram internal weight is a difference of 4 grams in measured weight. (Popularly spoken as the weight is a force being measured in newtons, not in grams.)\n\nThe diagrams also show the component in the direction parallel to the local surface. In meteorology and in oceanography, it is customary to refer to the effects of the component parallel to the local surface as the Coriolis effect.\n\n\n"}

Covered with shallow, highly erodible soils of low fertility, these heavily forested highlands are very sparsely inhabited.\n\nThe second region comprises the northern lowlands, along with the southern coastal plain. Eighteen major rivers and many perennial streams drain these low-lying areas. The coastline is flat and swampy, with many lagoons, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. Westward from the northern coastal areas, the terrain changes from mangrove swamp to tropical pine savanna and hardwood forest.\nBelize claims an exclusive economic zone of and a territorial sea of . From the mouth of the Sarstoon River to Ranguana Cay, Belize's territorial sea is ; according to Belize's Maritime Areas Act, 1992, the purpose of this limitation is to provide a framework for the negotiation of a definitive agreement on territorial differences with Guatemala.\n\nBelize is the only country in Central America without a coastline on the North Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe interlocking networks of rivers, creeks, and lagoons have played a key role in the historical geography of Belize. The largest and most historically important river is the Belize River, which drains more than one-quarter of the country as it winds along the northern edge of the Maya Mountains across the center of the country to the sea near Belize City. Also known as the Old River, the Belize River is navigable up to the Guatemalan border and served as the main artery of commerce and communication between the interior and the coast until well into the twentieth century.\n\nOther historically important rivers include the Sibun River, which drains the northeastern edge of the Maya Mountains, and the New River, which flows through the northern sugar-growing areas before emptying into Chetumal Bay. Both of these river valleys possess fertile alluvial soils and have supported considerable cultivation and human settlement.\n\nBelize has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons, although there are significant variations in weather patterns by region. Temperatures vary according to elevation, proximity to the coast, and the moderating effects of the northeast trade winds off the Caribbean. Average temperatures in the coastal regions range from in January to in July. Temperatures are slightly higher inland, except for the southern highland plateaus, such as the Mountain Pine Ridge, where it is noticeably cooler year round. Overall, the seasons are marked more by differences in humidity and rainfall than in temperature.\n\nAverage rainfall varies considerably, ranging from in the north and west to over in the extreme south. Seasonal differences in rainfall are greatest in the northern and central regions of the country where, between January and April or May, fewer than of rain fall per month. The dry season is shorter in the south, normally only lasting from February to April. A shorter, less rainy period, known locally as the \"little dry,\" usually occurs in late July or August, after the initial onset of the rainy season.\n\nHurricanes have played a devastating role in Belizean history. In 1931 an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two-thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people. In 1955 Hurricane Janet leveled the northern town of Corozal. Six years later, Hurricane Hattie struck the central coastal area of the country, with winds in excess of and storm tides. The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some inland to the planned city of Belmopan. A hurricane that devastated Belize was Hurricane Greta, which caused more than US$25 million in damages along the southern coast in 1978.\n\nThere was a period of 20 years that Belize was considered as a hurricane-free zone by many until Hurricane Mitch (October 1998) caused quite a stir and gave rise to hurricane awareness and the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). Two years later Tropical Storm Chantal and Hurricane Keith did much to put the country on the hurricane map.\n\nIn 2001, Hurricane Iris swept through the southern part of Belize causing damage that ranged in the hundreds of millions due largely to wiping away the banana industry, crippling the citrus and tourism in the area. Six years later, the fury of Category Five Dean landed on the Yucatán coast at Mahahual and Corozal in northern Belize, was not spared the brunt of reportedly Category 3 to 4 winds. Hurricane Dean did tens of millions in damages, especially to the infantile papaya industry and to a lesser extent to the endemic sugar cane industry.\n\nBelizean geology consists largely of varieties of limestone, with the notable exception of the Maya Mountains, a large uplifted block of intrusive Paleozoic granite and sediments running northeast to southwest across the south-central part of the country. Several major faults rive these highlands, but much of Belize lies outside the tectonically active zone that underlies most of Central America. During the Cretaceous Period, what is now the western part of the Maya Mountains stood above sea level, creating the oldest land surface in Central America, the Mountain Pine Ridge plateau.\n\nThe hilly regions surrounding the Maya Mountains are formed from Cretaceous limestone. These areas are characterized by a karst topography that is typified by numerous sinkholes, caverns, and underground streams. In contrast to the Mountain Pine Ridge, some of the soils in these regions are quite fertile and have been cultivated during at least the past 4,000 years.\n\nMuch of the northern half of Belize lies on the Yucatán Platform, a tectonically stable region. Although mostly level, this part of the country also has occasional areas of hilly, karst terrain, such as the Yalbac Hills along the western border with Guatemala and the Manatee Hills between Belize City and Dangriga. Alluvial deposits of varying fertility cover the relatively flat landscapes of the coastal plains.\n\nEnvironmental degradation issues in Belize include deforestation, water pollution from sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, and solid waste disposal.\n\nBelize is party to the Basel Convention, Convention on Biological Diversity, Ramsar Convention, CITES, Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, Montreal Protocol, MARPOL 73/78, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nAlthough a number of economically important minerals exist in Belize, none has been found in quantities large enough to warrant their mining. Those minerals include dolomite, barite (source of barium), bauxite (source of aluminum), cassiterite (source of tin), and gold. In 1990 limestone, used in roadbuilding, was the only mineral resource being exploited for either domestic or export use.\n\nThe similarity of Belizean geology to that of oil-producing areas of Mexico and Guatemala prompted oil companies, principally from the United States, to explore for petroleum at both offshore and on-land sites in the early 1980s. Initial results were promising, but the pace of exploration slowed later in the decade, and production operations never commenced. As a result, Belize remains almost totally dependent on imported petroleum for its energy needs.\n\nBelize has considerable potential for hydroelectric and other renewable energy resources, such as solar and biomass. In the mid-1980s a Belizean businessman proposed the construction of a wood-burning power station for the production of electricity, but the idea foundered in the wake of ecological concerns and economic constraints. In late 2005, a company named Belize Natural Energy found oil in commercial quantities in the Spanish Lookout area of Belize.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "216411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216411", "title": "Land ethic", "text": "Land ethic\n\nA land ethic is a philosophy or theoretical framework about how, ethically, humans should regard the land. The term was coined by Aldo Leopold (1887–1948) in his \"A Sand County Almanac\" (1949), a classic text of the environmental movement. There he argues that there is a critical need for a \"new ethic,\" an \"ethic dealing with human's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it\". \n\nLeopold offers an ecologically based land ethic that rejects strictly human-centered views of the environment and focuses on the preservation of healthy, self-renewing ecosystems. \"A Sand County Almanac\" was the first systematic presentation of a holistic or ecocentric approach to the environment. Although Leopold is credited with coining the term \"land ethic,\" there are many philosophical theories that speak to how humans should treat the land. Some of the most prominent land ethics include those rooted in economics, utilitarianism, libertarianism, egalitarianism, and ecology.\n\nThis is a land ethic based wholly upon economic self-interest. Leopold sees two flaws in this type of ethic. First, he argues that most members of an ecosystem have no economic worth. For this reason, such an ethic can ignore or even eliminate these members when they are actually necessary for the health of the biotic community of the land. And second, it tends to relegate conservation necessary for healthy ecosystems to the government and these tasks are too large and dispersed to be adequately addressed by such an institution. This ties directly into the context within which Leopold wrote \"A Sand County Almanac.\"\n\nFor example, when the US Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot, the prevailing ethos was economic and utilitarian. Leopold argued for an ecological approach, becoming one of the first to popularize this term coined by Henry Chandler Cowles of the University of Chicago during his early 1900s research at the Indiana Dunes. Conservation became the preferred term for the more anthropocentric model of resource management, while the writing of Leopold and his inspiration, John Muir, led to the development of environmentalism.\n\nUtilitarianism was first put forth by British philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Though there are many varieties of utilitarianism, generally it is the view that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people. Utilitarianism has often been used when deciding how to use land and it is closely connected with an economic-based ethic. For example, it forms the foundation for industrial farming; an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. In fact, a common argument in favor of industrial agriculture is that it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices. However, a utilitarian-based land ethic is different from a purely economic one as it could be used to justify the limiting of a person's rights to make profit. For example, in the case of the farmer planting crops on a slope, if the runoff of soil into the community creek led to the damage of several neighbor's properties, then the good of the individual farmer would be overridden by the damage caused to his neighbors. Thus, while a utilitarian-based land ethic can be used to support economic activity, it can also be used to challenge this activity.\n\nAnother philosophical approach often used to guide actions when making (or not making) changes to the land is libertarianism. Roughly, libertarianism is the ethical view that agents own themselves and have particular moral rights, including the right to acquire property. In a looser sense, libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each individual person has a right to a maximum amount of freedom or liberty when this freedom does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well-known libertarian theorist is John Hospers. For libertarians, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for the above farmer to plant on a slope as long as this action does not limit the freedom of his or her neighbors.\n\nThis view is closely connected to utilitarianism. Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments to support their own arguments. For example, in 1968, Garrett Hardin applied this philosophy to land issues when he argued that the only solution to the \"Tragedy of the Commons\" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens. Hardin supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument. However, it can be argued that this leaves a libertarian-based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic-based approaches. Even excepting this, the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that numerous people making self-interested decisions often cause large ecological disasters, such as the Dust Bowl disaster. Even so, libertarianism is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, held by U.S. ranchers and farmers.\n\nEgalitarian-based land ethics are often developed as a response to libertarianism. This is because, while libertarianism ensures the maximum amount of human liberty, it does not require that people help others. In addition, it also leads to the uneven distribution of wealth. A well-known egalitarian philosopher is John Rawls. When focusing on land use, egalitarianism evaluates its uneven distribution and the uneven distribution of the fruits of that land. While both a utilitarian- and libertarian-based land ethic could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an egalitarian approach typically favors equality, whether that be equal entitlement to land and/or access to food. However, there is also the question of negative rights when holding to an egalitarian-based ethic. In other words, if it is recognized that a person has a right to something, then someone has the responsibility to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, an egalitarian-based land ethic could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water because it links land and water with the right to food, with the growth of human populations, and the decline of soil and water resources.\n\nLand ethics may also be based upon the principle that the land (and the organisms that live off the land) has intrinsic value. These ethics are, roughly, based on an ecological or systems view. This position was first put forth by Ayers Brinser in \"Our Use of the Land\", published in 1939. Brinser argued that white settlers brought with them \"the seeds of a civilization which has grown by consuming the land, that is, a civilization which has used up the land in much the same way that a furnace burns coal.” Later, Aldo Leopold's posthumously published \"A Sand County Almanac\" (1949) popularized this idea. \n\nAnother example is the deep ecology view, which argues that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities, and that all life is of inherent worth. Similar to egalitarian-based land ethics, the above land ethics were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian-based approaches. Leopold's ethic is one of the most popular ecological approaches in the early 21st century. Other writers and theorists who hold this view include Wendell Berry (b. 1934), N. Scott Momaday, J. Baird Callicott, Paul B. Thompson, and Barbara Kingsolver.\n\nIn his classic essay, \"The Land Ethic,\" published posthumously in \"A Sand County Almanac\" (1949), Leopold proposes that the next step in the evolution of ethics is the expansion of ethics to include nonhuman members of the biotic community, collectively referred to as \"the land.\" Leopold states the basic principle of his land ethic as: \"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\"\n\nHe also describes it in this way: \"The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land . . . [A] land ethic changes the role of \"Homo sapiens\" from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.\"\n\nLeopold was a naturalist, not a philosopher. There is much scholarly debate about what exactly Leopold's land ethic asserts and how he argues for it. At its core, the land ethics claims (1) that humans should view themselves as plain members and citizens of biotic communities, not as \"conquerors\" of the land; (2) that we should extend ethical consideration to ecological wholes (\"soils, waters, plants, and animals\"), (3) that our primary ethical concern should not be with individual plants or animals, but with the healthy functioning of whole biotic communities, and (4) that the \"summary moral maxim\" of ecological ethics is that we should seek to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. Beyond this, scholars disagree about the extent to which Leopold rejected traditional human-centered approaches to the environment and how literally he intended his basic moral maxim to be applied. They also debate whether Leopold based his land ethic primarily on human-centered interests, as many passages in \"A Sand County Almanac\" suggest, or whether he placed significant weight on the intrinsic value of nature. One prominent student of Leopold, J. Baird Callicott, has suggested that Leopold grounded his land ethics on various scientific claims, including a Darwinian view of ethics as rooted in special affections for kith and kin, a Copernican view of humans as plain members of nature and the cosmos, and the finding of modern ecology that ecosystems are complex, interrelated wholes. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by Roberta Millstein, who has offered evidence that Darwin's influence on Leopold was not related to Darwin's views about moral sentiments, but rather to Darwin's views about interdependence in the struggle for existence.\n\nLeopold's ecocentric land ethic is popular today with mainstream environmentalists for a number of reasons. Unlike more radical environmental approaches, such as deep ecology or biocentrism, it does not require huge sacrifices of human interests. Leopold does not, for example, believe that humans should stop eating or hunting or experimenting on animals. Nor does he call for a massive reduction in human population, or for permitting humans to interfere with nature only to satisfy vital human needs (regardless of economic or other human costs). As an environmental ethic, Leopold's land ethic is a comparatively moderate view that seeks to strike a balance between human interests and a healthy and biotically diverse natural environment. Many of the things mainstream environmentalists favor--preference for native plants and animals over invasive species, hunting or selective culling to control overpopulated species that are damaging to the environment, and a focus on preserving healthy, self-regenerating natural ecosystems both for human benefit and for their own intrinsic value--jibe with Leopold's ecocentric land ethic.\n\nA related understanding has been framed as global land as a commons. In this view biodiversity and terrestrial carbon storage - an element of climate change mitigation - are global public goods. Hence, land should be governed on a global scale as a commons, requiring increased international cooperation on nature preservation .\n\nSome critics fault Leopold for lack of clarity in spelling out exactly what the land ethic is and its specific implications for how humans should think about the environment. It is clear that Leopold did not intend his basic normative principle (\"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community\") to be regarded as an ethical absolute. Thus construed, it would prohibit clearing land to build homes, schools, or farms, and generally require a \"hands-off\" approach to nature that Leopold plainly did not favor. Presumably, therefore, his maxim should be seen as a general guideline for valuing natural ecosystems and striving to achieve what he terms a sustainable state of \"harmony between men and land.\" But this is vague and, according to some critics, not terribly helpful.\n\nA second common criticism of Leopold is that he fails to state clearly why we should adopt the land ethic. He often cites examples of environmental damage (e.g., soil erosion, pollution, and deforestation) that result from traditional human-centered, \"conqueror\" attitudes towards nature. But it is unclear why such examples support the land ethic specifically, as opposed to biocentricism or some other nature-friendly environmental ethic. Leopold also frequently appeals to modern ecology, evolutionary theory, and other scientific discoveries to support his land ethic. Some critics have suggested that such appeals may involve an illicit move from facts to values. At a minimum, such critics claim, more should be said about the normative basis of Leopold's land ethic.\n\nOther critics object to Leopold's ecological holism. According to animal rights advocate, Tom Regan, Leopold's land ethic condones sacrificing the good of individual animals to the good of the whole, and is thus a form of \"environmental fascism.\" According to these critics, we rightly reject such holistic approaches in human affairs. Why, they ask, should we adopt them in our treatment of non-human animals?\n\nFinally, some critics have questioned whether Leopold's land ethic might require unacceptable interferences with nature in order to protect current, but transient, ecological balances. If the fundamental environmental imperative is to \"preserve\" the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems, wouldn't this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments? In nature, the \"stability and integrity\" of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought, fire, storms, pests, newly invasive predators, etc. Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes, and if so, at what cost? Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances? Why think it is our role to be nature's steward or policeman? According to these critics, Leopold's stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly human-centered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves.\n\n\n"}

A number of these settlements were Dacian and Thracian, but some were Celtic, Greek, Roman, Paeonian, or Persian.\n\nA number of cities in Dacia and Thrace were built on or close to the sites of preexisting Dacian or Thracian settlements. Some settlements in this list may have a double entry, such as the Paeonian \"Astibo\" and Latin \"Astibus\". It is believed that Thracians did not build true cities even if they were named as such; the largest Thracian settlements were large villages. The only known attempt to build a polis by the Thracians was Seuthopolis., although Strabo considered the Thracian cities with \"bria\" ending polises. Some of the Dacian settlements and fortresses employed the traditional Murus Dacicus construction technique.\n\nNote: Throughout these lists, an asterisk [*] indicates that the toponym is reconstructed.\n\nMany city names were composed of an initial lexical element affixed to \"-dava\", \"-daua\", \"-deva\", \"-deba\", \"-daba\", or \"-dova\", which meant \"city\" or \"town\" Endings on more southern regions are exclusively \"-bria\" (\"town, city\"), \"-disza\", \"-diza\", \"-dizos\" (\"fortress, walled settlement\"), \"-para\", \"-paron\", \"-pera\", \"-phara\" (\"town, village\"). Strabo translated -bria as polis, but that may not be accurate. Thracian \"-disza\", \"-diza\", and \"-dizos\" are derived from Proto-Indo-European \"*dheigh-\", \"to knead clay\", hence to \"make bricks\", \"build walls\", \"wall\", \"walls\", and so on. These Thracian lexical items show a satemization of PIE \"*gh-\". Cognates include Ancient Greek \"teichos\" (\"wall, fort, fortified town\", as in the town of Didymoteicho) and Avestan \"da?za\" (\"wall\").\n\nIt is suggested that the \"dava\" endings are from the Dacian language, while the rest from the Thracian language. However \"dava\" towns can be found as south as Sandanski and Plovdiv. Some \"dava\" toponyms contain the same linguistic features as \"diza\" toponyms, e.g. Pirodiza and Pirodava. The first written mention of the name \"Dacians\" is in Roman sources. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae, identified as a Thracian tribe. The Dacians, Getae and their kings were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder) and were said to speak the same language. The Dacian language is considered a variety of the Thracian language. Such lexical differentiation -dava vs. para, would be hardly enough evidence to separate Dacian from Thracian, thus they are classified as dialects. It is also possible that '-dava' and '-bria' mean two different things in the same language, rather than meaning the same thing in two different languages. Thus bria could have been used for urbanized settlements, similar in scale and design to those of the \"civilised\" peoples like Greeks and Romans, whereas '-dava' could mean a settlement which is rural, being situated in the steppe-like part of the Thracian lands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46889478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46889478", "title": "Name of the Franks", "text": "Name of the Franks\n\nThe name of the Franks (Latin \"Franci\") and the derived names of \"Francia\" and \"Franconia\" (and the adjectives \"Frankish\" and \"Franconian\") are derived from the name given to a Germanic tribal confederation which emerged in the 3rd century.\n\nThe Frankish Empire rose to the main successor of Roman imperial power in Western Europe, and as a result, the Franks ultimately gave their name to both the kingdom of France, and to Franconia, one of the stem duchies of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIt is traditionally assumed that Frank comes from the Germanic word for \"javelin\" (such as in Old English \"franca\" or Old Norse \"frakka\", Latinized \"francisca\" \"throwing axe\").\n\nWords in other Germanic languages meaning \"bold\" or \"fierce\" (Middle Dutch \"vrac\", Old English \"frǣc\" and Old Norwegian \"frakkr\"), may also be significant.\nEumenius addressed the Franks in the matter of the execution of Frankish prisoners in the circus at Trier by Constantine I in 306 and certain other measures: \"Ubi nunc est illa ferocia? Ubi semper infida mobilitas?\" (\"Where now is that famed ferocity of yours, that ever untrustworthy fickleness?\"). \n\"Feroces\" was used often to describe the Franks. Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view.\n\nIn a tradition going back to the 7th-century Chronicle of Fredegar, the name of the Franks is taken from \"Francio\", one of the Germanic kings of Sicambri, c. 61 BCE, whose dominion extended all along those lands immediately joining the west-bank of the Rhine River, as far as Strasbourg and Belgium. This nation is also explicitly mentioned by Julius Caesar in his \"Notebooks on the Gallic War\" (\"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\").\n\nWriting in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that \"the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the Loire everyone seems to have been considered a Frank by the mid-seventh century at the latest; Romani were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that\". On the other hand, a formulary written by Marculf about AD 700 described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that \"all the peoples who dwell [in the official's province], Franks, Romans, Burgundians, and those of other nations, live ... according to their law and their custom.\"\n\nThe Middle English adjective \"frank,\" \"free, liberal, generous,\" was adopted in c. 1300 from Old French \"franc\" \"free (not servile)\", from Medieval Latin \"francus\" \"free, at liberty\", as a noun \"a freeman, a Frank\".\nThe generalised meaning of \"freeman\" and adjectival \"free\" developed because under Frankish rule in Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation.\n\nThe Gallo-Roman population held a lower rank in Frankish society. \"Salic law\" \nwas the germanic law codified in the early 6th century to apply to Franks within the Frankish Empire. The legal system in Francia tried every man according to the law of his own race, the Gallo-Roman subject population fell under separate laws, and yet separate laws concerned the interaction between Franks (freemen) and Gallo-Roman subjects. The most notable of these are the \"Lex Romana Visigothorum\" or \"Breviary of Alaric\" (506), the \"Lex Romana Curiensis\" and the \"Lex Romana Burgundionum\".\nThis led to obvious complications, as expressed by Agobard of Lyons, who was pleading for a unified legal system in the Frankish Empire, \"Of five men sitting or walking together none will have the same law as his fellow.\"\n\nThe Modern French adjective \"franc\" (feminine \"franche\", adverb \"franchement\") still means \"free, tax-exempt\" as well as \"frank, outspoken\".\nIt is seen in the name of Franche-Comté, the area of the Free County of Burgundy (982–1678), so named because its sovereign had the unusual title of \"free count\" (, or \"\").\n\n\"Franklin\" (\"fraunclein\") was the Anglo-Norman term for a free landowner not of noble birth, giving rise to the given name \"Franklin\" and eventually the surname.\n\nThe name of France directly continues Latin \"Francia\", originally applied to the entire Frankish Empire.\nUnder the reign of the Franks' Kings Clovis I, Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne, the country was known as Kingdom of Franks or Francia. At the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the Frankish Empire was divided in three parts : West Francia (\"Francia Occidentalis\"), Middle Francia and East Francia (\"Francia Orientalis\").\n\nThe rulers of \"Francia Orientalis\", who soon claimed the imperial title and wanted to reunify the Frankish Empire, dropped the name \"Francia Orientalis\" and called their realm the Holy Roman Empire (see History of Germany). The kings of \"Francia Occidentalis\" successfully opposed this claim and managed to preserve \"Francia Occidentalis\" as an independent kingdom, distinct from the Holy Roman Empire. The Battle of Bouvines in 1214 definitively marked the end of the efforts by the Holy Roman Empire to reunify the old Frankish Empire by conquering France.\n\nSince the name \"Francia Orientalis\" had disappeared, there arose the habit to refer to \"Francia Occidentalis\" as \"Francia\" only, from which the word France is derived. The French state has been in continuous existence since 843 (except for a brief interruption in 885-887), with an unbroken line of heads of states since the first king of \"Francia Occidentalis\" (Charles the Bald) to the current president of the French Republic. Noticeably, in German, France is still called \"Frankreich\", which literally means \"\"Reich\" (empire) of the Franks\". In order to distinguish it from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, France is called \"Frankreich\", while the Frankish Empire is called \"Frankenreich\".\n\nIn most of the Germanic languages, France is known as the historical \"Land of the Franks\", for example \"Frankreich\" (Reich of the Franks) in German, \"Frankrijk\" (Rijk of the Franks) in Dutch, \"Frankrike\" (Rike of the Franks) in Swedish and Norwegian, \"Frankrig\" in Danish.\n\nIn a more restricted meaning, \"France\" refers specifically to the province of Île-de-France (with Paris at its centre) which historically was the heart of the royal demesne. This meaning is found in some geographic names, such as French Brie (\"Brie française\") and French Vexin (\"Vexin français\"). French Brie, the area where the famous Brie cheese is produced, is the part of Brie that was annexed to the royal demesne, as opposed to Champagne Brie (\"Brie champenoise\") which was annexed by Champagne. Likewise, French Vexin was the part of Vexin inside Île-de-France, as opposed to Norman Vexin (\"Vexin normand\") which was inside Normandy.\n\nThis meaning is also found in the name of the French language (\"langue française\"), whose literal meaning is \"language of Île-de-France\". It is not until the 19th and 20th centuries that the language of Île-de-France indeed became the language of the whole country France. In modern French, the French language is called \"le français\", while the old language of Île-de-France is called by the name applied to it according to a 19th-century theory on the origin of the French language - \"le francien\".\n\n\"Franconia\" became the Latin name of East Francia, derived from the German name \"Franken\" \"realm of the Franks\",\n\"Franconia\" was introduced as a synonym of \"Francia orientalis\" by the 12th century (Annalista Saxo),\nand came to be used of the Duchy of Franconia as it stood during the 9th and 10th centuries, divided Franconia during the later medieval period, and the Franconian Circle of the early modern period.\n\nThe division made between \"Franconia\" and \"Francia\" for German and French territories of the former Frankish Empire leads to terminological difficulties in English.\n\nEnglish has the two adjectives \"Franconian\" and \"Frankish\" translating what in Dutch and German is expressed by a single adjective (\"frankisch\" and \"fränkisch\", respectively).\n\"Franconian\" translates German \"fränkisch\" when referring to the \"Franconia\" within the Holy Roman Empire from the 10th century onward, while \"Frankish\" tends to refer to the period of the unified Frankish realm, during the 5th to 9th centuries.\n\nBut there are exceptions, most notably in the context of linguistics, where the term Franconian languages translates German \" fränkische Sprachen\", French \"Langues franciques\".\nThis group of dialects has a complicated history due to the geographical spread of the High German consonant shift as it developed during the medieval period.\nLow Franconian (Dutch) remained unaffected by the consonant shift and is technically part of Low German, but classified as a separate language for historical and political reasons,\nwhile Central and Rhenish and High Franconian form a dialect continuum within High German.\n\nSince these dialects are all derived from the early medieval language of the Franks, linguistic terminology in English varies between the names \"Frankish\" and \"Franconian\", the Germanic language of Merowingian Francia being variously known as \"Old Frankish\", \"Old Franconian\" or simply \"Frankish\".\n\nThe German term \"altfränkisch\" as it was introduced in the mid 19th century did not refer to the early medieval period, but was used as a nostalgic term for \"old-timey\" Franconia (compare Old English vs. Olde England).\nThis was rendered into English as \"Old Franconian\", with 19th-century sources talking about Old Franconian towns, songs, people, etc.\nBut the same term \"altfränkisch\" came to be used of the Frankish language of the Merovingian period.\n\nGustave Solling's \"Diutiska\" (1863) used the adjective \"Franconian\" in reference to the Merowingian period, and \"Old Franconian\" for the language of the Pledge of Charles the Bald.\n\nIn 1890 Ernest Adams defined \"Old Franconian\" as an Old High German dialect spoken on the middle and upper Rhine; i.e., it went beyond the limits of Franconia to comprise also the dialect continuum of the Rhineland.\n\nIn 1862 Max Müller pointed out that Jacob Grimm had applied the concept of \"German\" grammar to ten languages, which \"all appear to have once been one and the same.\"\nOne of these was the \"Netherland Language, which appears to have been produced by the combined action of the older Franconian and Saxon, and stands therefore in close relation to the Low German and the Friesian. Its descendants now are the Flemish in Belgium and Dutch in Holland.\" Müller, after describing Grimm's innovation of the old, middle and new phases of High German, contradicts himself by reiterating that Franconian was a dialect of the upper Rhine.\n\nThe overlapping concepts of \"Franconian\" and the division of German into High German and Low German dialects by the 1880s gave rise to the term \"Low Franconian\" for the \n\"Franconian\" dialects that fall into the Low German category.\nStrong and Meyer (1886) defined Low Franconian as the language \"spoken on the lower Rhine.\" Their presentation included an Upper, Middle and Lower Franconian, essentially the modern scheme.\n\nAccording to Strong and Meyer, \"Franconian ceases to be applied to this language; it is then called Netherlandish (Dutch)….\" Only the English ever applied Franconian anywhere; moreover, Netherlandish had been in use since the 17th century, after which Dutch was an entirely English word. The error had been corrected by the time of Wright's \"Old High German Primer\" two years later, in 1888. Wright identifies Old Low Franconian with Old Dutch, both terms used only in English.\n\nVan Vliet and his 17th century contemporaries inherited the name and the concept \"Teutonic\". \"Teutones\" and \"Teutoni\" are names from classical Latin referring to the entire population of Germanics in the Proto-Germanic era, although there were tribes specifically called Teutons. Between \"Old Dutch\" (meaning the earliest Dutch language) and \"Old Teutonic\", Van Vliet inserted \"Frankish\", the language of the Old Franks. He was unintentionally ambiguous about who these \"Old Franks\" were linguistically. At one point in his writing they were referred to as \"Old High German\" speakers, at another, \"Old Dutch\" speakers, and at another \"Old French\" speakers. Moreover, he hypothesized at one point that Frankish was a reflection of Gothic. The language of the literary fragments available to him was not clearly identified. Van Vliet was searching for a group he thought of as the \"Old Franks\", which to him included everyone from Mainz to the mouth of the Rhine.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the concept of Old Frankish, the ancestor language of Dutch, German, and the Frankish words in Old French had been firmly established. After the death of Junius, a contemporary of Van Vliet, Johann Georg Graevius said of him in 1694 that he collected fragments of \"vetere Francica\", \"Old Frankish,\" \"ad illustrandam linguam patriam\", \"for the elucidation of the mother tongue.\" The concept of the Dutch \"vetere Francica\", a language spoken by the Franks mentioned in Gregory of Tours and of the Carolingian Dynasty, which at one end of its spectrum became Old Dutch, and at the other, Old High German, threw a shadow into neighboring England, even though the word \"Franconian\", covering the same material, was already firmly in use there. The shadow remains.\n\nThe term \"Old Frankish\" in English is vague and analogous, referring either to language or to other aspects of culture. In the most general sense, \"old\" means \"not the present\", and \"Frankish\" means anything claimed to be related to the Franks from any time period. The term \"Old Frankish\" has been used of manners, architecture, style, custom, government, writing and other aspects of culture, with little consistency. In a recent history of the Germanic people, Ozment used it to mean the Carolingian and all preceding governments and states calling themselves Franks through the death of the last admittedly Frankish king, Conrad I of Germany, in 919, and his replacement by a Saxon. This \"Old Frankish\" period, then, beginning in the Proto-Germanic period and lasting until the 10th century, is meant to include Old High German, Old Dutch and the language that split to form Low German and High German.\n\nA second term in use by Van Vliet was \"oud Duijts\", \"Old Dutch\", where \"Duijts\" meant \"the entire Continental Germanic continuum\". The terms \"Nederlandsch\" and \"Nederduijts\" were coming into use for contemporary Dutch. Van Vliet used the \"oud Duijts\" ambiguously to mean sometimes \"Francks\", sometimes Old Dutch, and sometimes Middle Dutch, perhaps because the terms were not yet firm in his mind. \"Duijts\" had been in general use until about 1580 to refer to the Dutch language, but subsequently was replaced by \"Nederduytsch\".\n\nEnglish linguists lost no time in bringing Van Vliet's \"oud Duijts\" into English as \"Old Dutch\". The linguistic noun \"Old Dutch\", however, competed with the adjective \"Old Dutch\", meaning an earlier writing in the same Dutch, such as an old Dutch rhyme, or an old Dutch proverb. For example, Brandt's \"old Dutch proverb\", in the English of his translator, John Childe, mentioned in 1721: \"Eendracht maekt macht, en twist verquist\", \"Unity gives strength, and Discord weakness,\" means contemporary Dutch and not Old Dutch. On the frontispiece, Childe refers to the language in which the book was written as \"the original Low Dutch\". Linguistic \"Old Dutch\" had already become \"Low Dutch\", the contemporary language, and \"High Dutch\", or High German. On the other hand, \"Old Dutch\" was a popular English adjective used in the 18th century with reference to people, places and things.\n"}
{"id": "183082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183082", "title": "Namib", "text": "Namib\n\nThe Namib is a coastal desert in southern Africa. The name \"Namib\" is of Nama origin and means \"vast place\". According to the broadest definition, the Namib stretches for more than along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa, extending southward from the Carunjamba River in Angola, through Namibia and to the Olifants River in Western Cape, South Africa. The Namib's northernmost portion, which extends from the Angola-Namibia border, is known as Moçâmedes Desert, while its southern portion approaches the neighboring Kalahari Desert. From the Atlantic coast eastward, the Namib gradually ascends in elevation, reaching up to inland to the foot of the Great Escarpment. Annual precipitation ranges from in the most arid regions to at the escarpment, making the Namib the only true desert in southern Africa. Having endured arid or semi-arid conditions for roughly 55–80 million years, the Namib may be the oldest desert in the world and contains some of the world's driest regions, with only western South America's Atacama Desert to challenge it for age and aridity benchmarks.\n\nThe desert geology consists of sand seas near the coast, while gravel plains and scattered mountain outcrops occur further inland. The sand dunes, some of which are high and span long, are the second largest in the world after the Badain Jaran Desert dunes in China. Temperatures along the coast are stable and generally range between annually, while temperatures further inland are variable—summer daytime temperatures can exceed while nights can be freezing. Fogs that originate offshore from the collision of the cold Benguela Current and warm air from the Hadley Cell create a fog belt that frequently envelops parts of the desert. Coastal regions can experience more than 180 days of thick fog a year. While this has proved a major hazard to ships—more than a thousand wrecks litter the Skeleton Coast—it is a vital source of moisture for desert life.\n\nThe Namib is almost completely uninhabited by humans except for several small settlements and indigenous pastoral groups, including the Ovahimba and Obatjimba Herero in the north, and the Topnaar Nama in the central region. Owing to its antiquity, the Namib may be home to more endemic species than any other desert in the world. Most of the desert wildlife is arthropods and other small animals that live on little water, although larger animals inhabit the northern regions. Near the coast, the cold ocean water is rich in fishery resources and supports populations of brown fur seals and shorebirds, which serve as prey for the Skeleton Coast's lions. Further inland, the Namib-Naukluft National Park, the largest game park in Africa, supports populations of African Bush Elephants, Mountain Zebras, and other large mammals. Although the outer Namib is largely barren of vegetation, lichens and succulents are found in coastal areas, while grasses, shrubs, and ephemeral plants thrive near the escarpment. A few types of trees are also able to survive the extremely arid climate.\n\nThe Namib Desert is one of the 500 distinct physiographic provinces of the South African Platform physiographic division. It occupies an area of around 80,950 km² (31,200 square miles), stretching from the Usiab River (north) to the town of Lüderitz (south) and from the Atlantic Ocean (west) to the Namib Escarpment (east). It is about long from north to south and its east-west width varies from . To the north, the desert leads into the Kaokoveld; the dividing line between these two regions is roughly at the latitude of the city of Walvis Bay, and it consists in a narrow strip of land (about 50 km wide) that is the driest place in Southern Africa. To the south, the Namib borders on the South African Karoo semi-desert.\n\nSouthern Namib (between Lüderitz and the Kuiseb River) comprises a vast dune sea with some of the tallest and most spectacular dunes of the world, ranging in color from pink to vivid orange. In the Sossusvlei area, several dunes exceed in height. The complexity and regularity of dune patterns in its dune sea have attracted the attention of geologists for decades, but it remains poorly understood.\n\nMoving north from Sossusvlei, the sand gradually gives way to a rocky desert that extends all the way from Sossusvlei to the Swakop river. This area is traversed by the Tropic of Capricorn and is mostly flat, although some scenic canyons and elevations are found in some areas, for example in the Moon Valley system. While most of the soil is rocky, sand dunes are still occasionally found in this region; for example, sand dunes occupy much of the coastline between Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.\n\nThe Namib desert is an important location for the mining of tungsten, salt and diamonds.\n\nSeveral rivers and streams run through the Namib, although all of the rivers south of the Cunene River and north of the Orange River are ephemeral and rarely or never reach the ocean. These rivers arise in the interior mountains of Namibia and flow after summer rain storms.\n\nThe Namib's aridity is caused by the descent of dry air of the Hadley Cell, cooled by the cold Benguela current along the coast. It has less than of rain annually and is almost completely barren. Besides rain being scarce, it is also hardly predictable. The western Namib gets less rain (5 mm) than the eastern Namib (85 mm). This is due to several factors. Winds coming from the Indian Ocean lose part of their humidity when passing the Drakensberg mountains, and are essentially dry when they reach the Namib Escarpment at the eastern end of the desert. Winds coming from the Atlantic Ocean, on the other hand, are pressed down by hot air from the east; their humidity thus forms clouds and fog. Morning fogs coming from the ocean and pushing inwards into the desert are a regular phenomenon along the coast, and much of the life cycle of animals and plants in the Namib relies on these fogs as the main source of water.\n\nThe dry climate of the Namib reflects the almost complete lack of bodies of water on the surface. Most rivers flow underground and/or are dry for most of the year, and even when they are not, they usually drain into endorheic basins, without reaching the sea. The Swakop and the Omaruru are the only rivers that occasionally drain into the ocean.\n\nAll along the coast, but mostly in the northernmost part of it, interaction between the water-laden air coming from the sea via southerly winds, some of the strongest of any coastal desert, and the dry air of the desert causes immense fogs and strong currents. It causes sailors to lose their way; this is testified by the remnants of a number of shipwrecks that can be found along the Skeleton Coast, in northern Namib. Some of these wrecked ships can be found as much as inland, as the desert slowly moves westwards into the sea, reclaiming land over a period of many years.\nBenguela's El Niño (similar to the Pacific event in its environmental change in the seas) spreads from the Kunene estuary southward to, on occasion, south of Luderitz. Warm waters with depth and associated water flows from the northwest were first fully catalogued by Sea Fisheries researchers, Cape Town (L V Shannon \"et al.\"). The research noted the positive effect of Benguela's El Niño on the rainfall of the interior. Rainfall records also show positive values variously across the Namib, Desert Research Station, Gobabeb for instance. This event recurs approximately mid-decade (1974, 1986, 1994, 1995 and 2006 are recent examples)\n\nA number of unusual species of plants and animals are found in this desert, many of which are endemic and highly adapted to the specific climate of the area. One of the most well-known endemic plants of the Namib is the bizarre \"Welwitschia mirabilis\"; a shrub-like plant, it grows two long strap-shaped leaves continuously throughout its lifetime. These leaves may be several meters long, gnarled and twisted from the desert winds. The taproot of the plant develops into a flat, concave disc in age. \"Welwitschia\" is notable for its survival in the extremely arid conditions in the Namib, mostly deriving moisture from the coastal sea fogs. An area where \"Welwitschias\" are a common sight is found in the surroundings of the Moon Valley, including the eponymous Welwitschia Plains.\n\nThe Namib fauna mostly comprises arthropods and other small animals that can live on little water, but a few species of bigger animals are also found, including antelopes (such as oryxes and springboks), ostriches, and in some areas even desert elephants. All these species have developed techniques to survive in the Namib environment. A number of endemic darkling beetles species — such as the Namib Desert beetle — have bumpy elytrons with a pattern of hydrophilic bumps and hydrophobic troughs. These cause humidity from the morning fogs to condense into droplets, which roll down the beetle's back to its mouth; they are collectively known as \"fog beetles\". Another beetle, the \"Lepidochora discoidalis\", builds \"water-capturing\" webs. Black-backed jackals lick humidity from stones. Gemsboks (also known as Oryxes) can raise the temperature of their bodies to 40 °C in the hottest hours of the day. The desert is also home to meerkats and several species of lizards.\n\nBefore the 20th century, some San roamed the Namib, gathering edible plants on the shore, hunting in the interior, and drinking the juice of the tsama melon for water. Nowadays, some Herero still herd their livestock in the Kaokoveld in the Namib and take them from waterhole to waterhole. A few Nama Khoikhoi still graze their livestock on the banks of the Kuiseb River in the desert. Most of the native people have left, however, leaving the vast majority of the desert uninhabited.\n\nThe steppes in the southern half of the desert are mostly made up of ranches run by Europeans, who raise Karakul sheep with local help and send the wool of the lambs to Europe for use in fur coats. Most of the rest of the desert is set aside for conservation. A vast portion of the desert, called the Sperrgebiet, was access-restricted due to the presence of diamonds, which are mined in the area at the mouth of the Orange River. Although the desert is largely unpopulated and inaccessible, there are year-round settlements at Sesriem, close to the famous Sossusvlei area, and other small outposts in other locations. Moçâmedes in Angola, and Lüderitz, Walvis Bay and Swakopmund in Namibia, bordering on the desert, are the main settlements in the area.\n\nThe Namib-Naukluft National Park, that extends over a large part of the Namib Desert, is the largest game reserve in Africa and one of the largest of the world. While most of the park is hardly accessible, several well-known visitor attractions are found in the desert. The prominent attraction is the famous Sossusvlei area, where high orange sand dunes surround vivid white salt pans, creating a fascinating landscape.\n\nAccess to the park is either by gravel roads or dust roads (except for 60 km of concrete road from the Sesriem gate to Sossusvlei) or by light aircraft from Windhoek (the capital of Namibia, about north-east of the centre of the desert), or Swakopmund and Walvis Bay at the north end of the desert.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Edwin Baker, was a merchant, and his mother, Martha Ranney Thomas, had been a schoolteacher. His health in his early life was so poor that he did not begin school until the age of 12, before which time he was taught by his mother. After graduating public school he went on to Heidelberg College. He graduated with a B.S. degree in history and mathematics at the age of 19 in 1903, and took an M.S. degree in philosophy and sociology a year later. The next year he went on to Columbia University, receiving an M.A. in political science in 1905. He studied forestry at Yale University School of Forestry from 1907 to 1908, and later did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in agriculture. From 1908 to 1912 he worked with the University of Wisconsin–Madison's Agricultural Experiment Station. Baker co-authored a bulletin for the Experiment Station, which studied the climate of Wisconsin and its effects on agriculture, published in 1912. From 1910 to 1912 he also worked with the Wisconsin Soil Survey during the summers.\n\nBy 1912 he took a job with the United States Department of Agriculture, where he would stay for the next thirty years. Baker's work was noticed rather quickly, in part because of his contributions to the \"Yearbooks\" from 1915 to 1938, several of which he edited. For the first eighteen years at the USDA he was devoted to studying the geographical aspects of land use. One of his first works, co-authoring \"Geography of the World's Agriculture\" (1917) with Vernor Clifford Finch, led him to even wider recognition. Shortly after its publication, Baker returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for further graduate study, in economics, and earned his Ph.D. in 1921 with a dissertation on land utilization. While there, Baker had been influenced by Henry Charles Taylor and Richard T. Ely, two notable economists, to shift his work more toward the economic aspect of geography and agriculture. In 1922 he joined the USDA's new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, headed by Henry C. Taylor. With the success of the \"Geography of the World's Agriculture\", he instigated work on the \"Atlas of American Agriculture\", on which he himself was planner and editor. The massive work was released in six parts between 1918 and 1936.\n\nBaker acted as a part-time professor at Clark University from 1923 to 1927, and later gave several series of lectures at other universities. With the appearance of the journal \"Economic Geography\", Baker became associate editor, and later a contributor of a notable series of articles on regional agricultural geography of North America. His interest in farm populations started around 1920, however it was during the 1930s that this field became a major focus of the USDA. Baker was particularly interested in the migration of rural youths into urban areas. Even into his later years, populations problems occupied much of his research and energies. Baker recognized that only a minority of the world's population lived under decent living conditions. He turned his attention to improving standards for American farmers. He hoped to achieve this by raising the level of appreciation for farmers and their contributions within the United States, and studying recent trends to aid in planning and forecasting potential problems. He also tried to encourage Americans to have larger families in order to ensure successful future generations in the country.\n\nBaker had been critical of many aspects of urban life, and collaborated with Ralph Borsodi on \"Agriculture in Modern Life\" (1939), advocating a return to rural living. He himself however suggested more of a \"rurban\" lifestyle, which combined aspects of both urban and rural life. He married in 1925 to Alice Hargrave Crew. They had four children together- Helen, Sabra, Edwin, and Mildred- and raised them in then-suburban College Park, Maryland with five acres where they were able to raise chicken and cows and have a garden. He later bought a large farm near New Market, Virginia where he could take up his interest in soil conservation.\n\nIn 1931 he was elected president of the Association of American Geographers, and received honorary doctorates from Heidelberg College in Ohio and the University of Göttingen in Germany.\n\nBaker left Washington D.C. for the University of Maryland, College Park in 1942, accepting an invitation to establish a Department of Geography there. Baker assembled the Department's faculty himself and attracted many students, as well as promoted many research projects. He retired from his position in July 1949 in order to devote himself to completing his various research projects. His main work at the time was the \"Atlas of World Resources\", which was being created by the USDA and the Bureau of Mines, but also initiated the \"China Atlas\", continuing a long interest of his in China. However, neither of these works were completed by the time of his death. Baker had always been highly dedicated to teaching and gave his time generously to students and visitors.\n\nHaving suffered from health problems his entire life, he died in his home in College Park, Maryland.\n"}

{"id": "10063238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10063238", "title": "Palsa", "text": "Palsa\n\nA palsa is a low, often oval, frost heave occurring in polar and subpolar climates, which contain permanently frozen ice lenses. Like pingos, palsas consist of an ice core with overlying soil, but they are generally smaller than pingos, often occur in groups and may develop from ground water without additional hydrostatic pressure. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost, and in such areas they may be the only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. Surface water, found in bogs, enhances palsa formation in areas called palsa bogs.\n\nPalsas may be initiated in areas of a moor or bog where the winter freezing front penetrates relatively faster than surrounding areas, perhaps due to an unusually thin cover of snow. The lack of thermal insulation provided by thick snow permits much deeper freezing in winter. This ice may then last through the summer with a persistent 'bump' of up to several cm due to frost heave. The elevated surface of a palsa will tend also to have thinner snow cover, allowing greater winter cooling, while in summer the surface material (especially if organic) will dry out and provide thermal insulation. Thus the interior temperature is consistently lower than that of adjacent ground. This contributes to the formation of an ice lens which grows by drawing up surrounding water. The expansion of the ice upon freezing exerts pressure on the surrounding soil, further forcing water out of its pore spaces which then accumulates on and increases the volume of the growing ice lens. A positive feedback loop develops. Changes in surface moisture and vegetation will then be such as to preserve the newly formed permafrost. \n\nThe overlying soil layer is gradually lifted up by frost heaving. In cross-section, the ice cores of a palsa show layering, which is caused by the successive winter freezing intervals. The pressing out of water from the pores is not crucial, however, since the boggy soil is water-saturated and thus always provides enough water for ice core growth.\n\nPalsas appear to go through a developmental cycle that eventually leads to thawing and collapse. Open cracks that commonly accompany palsa growth and the water that tends to accumulate around palsas, probably as a result of their weight depressing the adjacent bog surface, are important factors in this process. The fact that palsas in various stages of growth and decay occur together shows that their collapse is not necessarily indicative of climatic change. All that is usually left after a palsa collapses is a depression surrounded by a rim.\n\nPalsa forms include mounds, moderately straight ridges, and winding ridges. Palsas in Iceland have been described as hump shaped, dike shaped, plateau shaped, ring shaped, and shield shaped, those in Norway as palsa plateaus, esker palsas, string palsas, conical or dome-shaped palsas, and palsa complexes. \n\nWidths are commonly 10–30 m, and lengths 15–150 m. However, lengths of up to 500 m have been reported for esker-like palsa ridges running parallel to the gradient of a bog. Heights range from less than 1 m to about 10 m at a maximum above the surrounding area. Large forms tend to be considerably less conical than small ones. In places, palsas combine to form complexes several hundred meters in extent. The permafrost core contains ice lenses no thicker than 2–3 cm, though locally lenses up to almost 40 cm thick have been described. \n\nPalsas form in groups or \"fields\" and the individual palsa can show its age difference from the others.\n\nPalsa surfaces are frequently traversed by open cracks, caused by doming (dilation cracking), frost cracking, or desiccation. The vegetation of a palsa may comprise low shrubs and lichen in addition to the sedges characterizing the peat. Also, the higher a palsa grows the dryer the peat covering the palsa becomes leading to more insulation which protects the inner core from melting.\n\nThere are two types of palsas, those with a peat core and those with a core of mineral soil, usually silt. The peat-core type is the most common, the other being regarded as exceptional by some, but more common than formerly thought.\n\nPermafrost plateaus are structures of coalesced palsas that form a continuous elevated flatland area usually in a peat bog. Permafrost plateaus may have parts suffering decay while others are growing at the same time. Permafrost plateaus are usually surrounded by wetlands but have often internal water pools during summer due to uneven relief, partial decay and thaw.\n\nPalsas are typical forms of the discontinuous permafrost zone regions and are therefore found in Subarctic regions of northern Canada and Alaska, Siberia, northern Fennoscandia and Iceland. They are almost exclusively associated with bogs and commonly occur in areas where the winters are long and the snow cover tends to be thin. In some places palsas extend into underlying permafrost; in others they rest on an unfrozen substratum. \n\nIn the southern hemisphere palsa remains from the last glacial maximum have been identified on the Argentine side of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego just north of Cami Lake. Remainders of Ice-Age palsas are to be found also in Hochmooren of Central Europe, such as Hohen Venn in the German-Belgian border area.\n\nPalsas are structurally similar to pingos, however with heights between approx. 0.5 and 2 m and lengths between approx. 5 and 25 m, palsas are significantly smaller than pingos. Both however are considered to be true perennial permafrost mounds since both occur in areas of continuous permafrost. Moreover, contrary to pingos which are usually isolated, palsas usually arise in groups with other palsas, such as in a so-called palsa bog. Unlike pingos, palsas do not require surrounding permafrost to grow, seeing as palsa are permafrost. Pingos also grow below the active layer, which is the depth that the annual freeze-thaw cycle occurs, and palsa grow in the active layer.\n\nBoth palsas and pingos result from freezing of water to an ice core. Palsas, however, do not necessarily require positive hydrostatic pressure (to inject water), since the boggy soil is water-saturated and therefore has sufficient supply for the growing ice core.\n\nPalsa (plural: palsas) is a term from the Finnish language meaning \"a hummock rising out of a bog with a core of ice,\" which in turn is a borrowing from Northern Sami, \"balsa\". As palsas particularly develop in moorlands they are therefore also named \"palsamoors\". \"Bugor\" and \"bulginniakhs\" are general terms in the Russian language (the latter of Yakutian origin) for both palsas and pingos.\n\nPictures of palsas and further information: \n"}

QST assumes that in an interconnected society more frameworks and worldviews are legitimately upheld by different constituencies and social actors. QST looks critically to models used in evidence-based policy (EBP). These are often in the form of risk analyses or cost benefit analyses, and necessarily focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. QST suggest corrective approaches to this practice. \n\nQuantitative storytelling (QST) addresses evidence based policy and can be considered as a reaction to a style of quantification based on cost benefir or risk analysis which - in the opinion of QST proponents - may contain important implicit normative assumptions.\n\nIn the logic of QST, a single quantification corresponding to a single view of what the problem is runs the risk of distracting from what could be alternative readings.\n\nAlternative frames (Ravetz, 1987 ; Rayner, 2012) may represent ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, which is removed from the policy discourse. Thus, extensive mathematical modelling in EBP to support a given policy may lead to a simplification of the available perceptions and generate - rather than resolve – controversies. The word ‘hypo-cognition’ has been used in the context of these instrumental use of frames (Lakoff et al., 2008; Lakoff, 2010). \n\nUnder this critical viewpoint, mathematical models can be seen as a tool for ‘displacement’. Displacement occurs where a model becomes the end instead of the tool, e.g. when an institution chooses to monitor and manage the outcome of a model rather than what happens in reality. Once exposed, the strategic use of hypo-cognition erodes the trust in the involved actors and institutions.\n\nQST suggests acknowledging ignorance, as to work out ‘clumsy solutions’ (Rayner, 2012), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. This is in turn close to the PNS suggested style of inquiry known as ‘working deliberatively within imperfections’ (van der Sluijs and Petersen, 2008), and to the exigence for a ‘rediscovery of ignorance’ (see preface to Pereira and Funtowicz, 2015).\nQST also calls attention to the power relationships at play in the use of evidence. Saltelli and Giampietro (2017) suggest that our present approach to evidence-based policy, even in the more nuanced formulation of evidence-informed policy (Gluckman, 2014)– needs our urgent attention. Unavoidable asymmetries are generated by the fact that stronger players have access to better evidence, and can use it strategically (Boden and Epstein, 2006; Strassheim and Kettunen, 2014). The decline of pollinators challenge (Insectageddon, Mombiot, 2017) show that interest groups have more scope to capture regulators than the average citizen ad consumer.\n\nQST encourages an effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis to map a socially robust (i.e. inclusive of the interest of different stakeholders) universe of possible frames. QST expands on one of the rules sensitivity auditing by asking the question of ‘what to do’ in order to avoid that an issue is framed unilaterally. Obviously, the medicine for a diseased evidence-based policy is not a prejudice - or superstition-based policy, but a more democratic and dialogic access to the provision of evidence – even in terms of agenda setting. For this a new institutional setting is needed. \n\nQST does not eschew the use quantitative tools altogether. It suggests instead to explore quantitatively multiple narratives, avoiding spurious accuracy and focusing on some salient features of the selected stories. Rather than attempting to amass evidence in support to a given reading or policy, or to optimise it with modelling, QST operates ‘via negativa’, i.e. it tries to test whether the said framing runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytical check. Here QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if these violate constraints of (Giampietro et al., 2014): \n\n\nPerhaps the best application of the concept of QST is an old study of GMO-related perceptions (Marris, 2001) which has lost very little of its actuality since the ongoing GMO and pesticide debate. \nBy direct interview and measurements of stakeholders’ expectation and worldviews, Marris and co-authors showed that the prevailing narrative of the reaction to GMO as a ‘food scare’ – i.e. as an issue of safety to consume GMO food – did not show up among the concerns raised by the interviewed citizens, which worried instead about who would benefit from these technologies, why were they introduced in the first place, and whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.\n\nOther applications of approaches which can be referred to QST are to the analyses for the cost of climate change, to the controversy surrounding the OECD-PISA study), to food security, to the controversy surrounding the use of Golden Rice, a GMO crop, and to the ecological footprint of the Ecological Footprint Network.\n"}

{"id": "4174161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4174161", "title": "Severn Valley (Cthulhu Mythos)", "text": "Severn Valley (Cthulhu Mythos)\n\nThe Severn Valley is the setting of several fictional towns and other locations created by horror writer Ramsey Campbell. Part of the Cthulhu Mythos started by H. P. Lovecraft, the fictional milieu is arguably the most detailed mythos setting outside of Lovecraft Country itself.\n\nThe River Severn is an actual river in Wales and western England. Campbell's stories mention various real-world locales, including the Cotswold Hills, Berkeley, and the A38 road. These references place \"Campbell Country\" in the southern part of Gloucestershire, roughly between the cities of Gloucester and Bristol. This area is more correctly referred to as the Vale of Berkeley or the Severn Estuary; the real-world Severn Valley refers to an area around fifty miles (80 km) further north.\n\nCampbell invented his locales, when, as a 15-year-old Lovecraft fan, he submitted Lovecraftian pastiches, set in Lovecraft's New England, to Arkham House's August Derleth. \"Derleth told me to abandon my attempts to set my work in Massachusetts,\" Campbell wrote in the introduction to his collection \"Cold Print\", and he accordingly rewrote his stories with an English setting. His short story \"The Tomb-Herd\", for example, was originally set in Lovecraft's Kingsport, Massachusetts. It was transposed to the Cotswold town of Temphill when it appeared as \"The Church in High Street\", Campbell's first published story, in the 1962 Arkham House anthology \"Dark Mind, Dark Heart\".\n\nIn that story, Campbell refers to hints \"of actual worship of trans-spatial beings still practiced in such towns as Camside, Brichester, Severnford, Goatswood, and Temphill,\" indicating that he had already conceived of most of the principal locations of his Severn Valley setting. At the time, the teenage Campbell had never been to the actual Severn Valley; the imaginary landscapes he described may relate more to the post-World War II Merseyside scenes he was familiar with. He recalled in an interview:\n\nThere was probably a period when I was reading and trying to imitate Lovecraft, whilst equally exploring what was then a considerably ruined Merseyside landscape. Whole slews of ruined streets, which I was perfectly happy to wander through on my way to odd, out of the way cinemas. And because I saw the city all around me as this kind of gothic, almost supernatural landscape, I think a lot of that fed into my writing.\n\nCampbell's first collection of short stories, \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\" (1964), was filled with stories that take place in the Severn Valley setting, including \"The Room in the Castle\", \"The Horror From the Bridge\", \"The Insects From Shaggai\", \"The Render of the Veils\", \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\", \"The Moon-Lens\", \"The Mine on Yuggoth\", \"The Plain of Sound\", and \"The Stone on the Island\". His next collection, \"Demons by Daylight\" (1973), though described by Campbell as a conscious effort to throw off Lovecraft's influence, again used this Cthulhu Mythos-linked setting for several tales: \"Potential\", \"The Sentinels\", \"The Interloper\", \"The Enchanted Fruit\", \"Made in Goatswood\", and a metafictional examination of Campbell's own Lovecraftian beginnings called \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\".\n\nAfter \"Demons by Daylight\", Campbell returned to the Severn Valley sporadically, in such works as \"Dolls\" (in 1986's \"Scared Stiff\"), \"The Tugging\" (\"The Disciples of Cthulhu\" 1996), and the 2003 novel \"The Darkest Part of the Woods\". In 1995 he contributed a rather tongue-in-cheek story set in the Severn Valley, \"The Horror Under Warrendown\", to an anthology of horror fiction called \"Made in Goatswood\".\n\n\"Made in Goatswood\", edited by Scott David Aniolowski, and published by Chaosium, is a collection of stories by various writers set in Campbell's fictionalized Gloucestershire. Contributors to the anthology include A. A. Attanasio, Richard A. Lupoff and Robert M. Price.\n\nSome of the major sites of Campbell's Severn Valley include Brichester, Goatswood, Temphill, Severnford, Clotton and Camside.\n\nBrichester is the main town of Campbell's Severn Valley, the setting of several tales and often a background element of stories that take place elsewhere. (It plays the same role in Campbell's stories that Arkham does in Lovecraft's.) \"These days Brichester has an impressively mundane surface,\" Campbell writes in \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\", \"but I still sense that it may crack.\"\n\n\"The Enchanted Fruit\" portrays \"the daily press of Brichester, the false harsh rainbow of packed cars,\" and \"churches robbed of dignity by plummeting iron balls\" (though the protagonist recalls \"streets where some lone house had struck him speechless with its silent pride, the noble bearing of its age and history\").\n\nBrichester has a wide variety of media outlets. \"The Moon Lens\" refers to the \"Brichester Weekly News\". \"The Tugging\" establishes that the town also has a daily—\"The Brichester Herald\", advertised as \"Brichester's Evening Voice\"—as well as a radio station, Radio Brichester. A reporter for the \"Herald\", Ingels, is that story's main character; he complains at one point that the town lacks a TV studio. \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\" gives Brichester a horror fanzine, \"Spirited\".\n\n\"Cold Print\" refers to Brichester's Ultimate Press, who are described as publishing an important manuscript, once written by the medieval heretic Johannes Henricus Pott, a new 12th volume of the \"Revelations of Glaaki\", and an entire line of bondage-related pornography. Brichester also has the True Light Press, mentioned in \"The Franklyn Paragraphs,\" which turns out to be Roland Franklyn's self-publishing operation.\n\nBrichester Central Library appears in \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\", where Errol Undercliffe notes of it, \"You couldn't get farther from a Lovecraft setting.\" It does, however, carry a copy of Roland Franklyn's \"We Pass From View\"—as well as Ramsey Campbell's \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\".\n\n\"Potential\" opens at the town's Cooperative Hall, site of \"Brichester's First Be-In-Free Flowers and Bells!\" (The name of one of the bands that plays the be-in, the Faveolate Collosi, alludes to Campbell's story \"The Mine on Yuggoth.\") The Co-operative Social Club is also referred to in \"The Interloper.\"\n\nWhile \"The Enchanted Fruit\" mentions \"the hard bleached University smashing and swallowing ornate facades,\" in \"The Darkest Part of the Woods,\" Brichester University's architecture is more traditional, with a \"long, lofty Gothic facade, and high pointed windows.\" An \"echoing vaulted sandstone corridor\" leads from \"the towering front doors of the university.\" \n\nOne of the first mentions of Brichester University' is in \"The Horror From the Bridge,\" where it is said \"they were familiar with things whose existence is not recognized by science.\" In that story, Philip Chesterton, formerly a librarian at the British Museum, takes a job in the university's library in 1901 in order to keep an eye on strange goings on in Clotton. The library once kept copies, in a locked case, of \"the \"Necronomicon\", the \"Revelations of Glaaki\", \"De Vermis Mysteriis\", and other titles as ominous,\" but in the 1960s \"a Muslim student... spray(ed) them with lighter fluid and set fire to them,\" destroying them completely.\n\nIn \"The Mine on Yuggoth\", Brichester native Edward Taylor enrolled in the university in 1918, where he \"led a witch cult, centering around a stone slab in the woods off the Severnford road.\" Taylor, along with other participants including \"the artist Nevil Craughan, and the occultist Henry Fisher,\" were subsequently expelled.\n\nThere is a science-fiction shop, \"Worlds Unlimited\", near the University campus \"in the dilapidated Victorian streets which have become the student quarter\". In the same neighborhood is the Scholar's Rest: \"Beneath a jauntily sagging slate roof the squat sandstone building faced the university campus... Each window of the pub held a swelling like a great blind eye... (T)he dim low-timbered interior was lined with old books.\" The pub's strongest ale is called Witch's Brew. Another near-campus dining option is Peace & Beans, a vegetarian restaurant with \"rough wooden tables\" and a clientele of \"students and a few health-conscious oldsters.\"\n\nMercy Hill, a Brichester neighbourhood with \"ribs of terraced streets,\" stands out in Campbell's world for its \"mundanity,\" as he describes the scene in \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\":\n\n\"In the streets, couples were taking their ice-creams for a walk; toward the Hill, tennis-balls were punctuating their pauses, girls were leaping, bowls were clicking, and from behind the houses, a procession was bearing trays of cakes to the pavilion.\"\n\nIn the same story, however, at the \"bottom of Mercy Hill\" is Dee Terrace, the address of the house of Roland Franklyn, which is described as \"look(ing) like Satan was in residence\":\n\n\"(A)n extra room had been added on the left, and its windows had been blocked out with newer brick; all the curtains, except those of one ground-floor window draped in green, were black. The house looked deserted, the more so for its garden, which could not have been tended for years; grass and weeds grew knee-high.\"\n\nMercy Hill is mentioned in \"The Horror From the Bridge\" as the site of a 19th-century prison; in \"The Moon Lens,\" Mercy Hill Hospital is the name of the institution where, in 1961, Roy Leakey seeks mercy killing from Dr. James Linwood, an advocate of euthanasia. The story \"The Mine on Yuggoth\" records that Edward Taylor was taken to Mercy Hill Hospital, shortly after his failed 1924 ascent of the Devil's Steps, and ever since then, his X-ray scans have been placed in a restricted file.\n\nFranklyn is buried in the graveyard next to Mercy Hill Hospital, where:\n\n\"(w)illows, their branches glowing stippled curves, were spaced carefully toward the Hill out of which the cemetery was carved; in the hill itself were catacombs, black behind ivy or railings, and straight above stood the hospital, a grey reminder of hope or despair... The avenues were guarded by broken-nosed angels yearning heavenward; one showed a leprous patch where her left eye and cheek had sloughed away. Urns stood here and there like empty glasses at a sick bed.\"\n\nThe seedier side of town is known as Lower Brichester, a neighborhood described in \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\" as \"the sort of miniature cosmopolis one finds in most major English towns: three-story houses full of errant lodgers, curtains as varied as flags at a conference but more faded, the occasional smashed pane, and the frequent furtive watchers.\" While in \"The Tugging\", a tale with an apocalyptic theme, the neighborhood is depicted as being in an advanced state of dereliction:\n\n\"Dogs scrabbled clattering in gouged shop-fronts, an uprooted streetlamp lay across a road, humped earth was scattered with disembowelled mattresses, their entrails fluttering feebly. He passed houses where one window was completely blinded with brick, the next still open and filmy with a drooping curtain... (W)hole streets were derelict... gaping houses and uneven pavements... Houses went by, shoulder to shoulder, ribs open to the sky, red-brick fronts revealing their jumble of shattered walls and staircases.\"\n\nThe observer finds himself sympathizing with the district's \"abandonment, and indifference to time\".\n\nIn \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\", Lower Brichester's Pitt Street is the former address of Errol Undercliffe (1937–1967), a writer who specializes in \"contemporary treatments of traditional macabre themes.\" In \"The Tugging,\" it's the location of the Brichester Arts Lab, a program run by Annabel Pringle that practices \"associational painting\"—a technique that uses free association to discover images, starting with suggestions from the \"I Ching\".\n\n\"Cold Print\" takes place in Lower Brichester, at a bookshop known only in the story as American Books Bought and Sold. This store was the site of a manifestation of the entity Y'golonac.\n\nNorth of Brichester is the body of water referred to in \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\". Supposedly once an impact-crater, the lake is overlooked by a row of houses called Lakeside Terrace, built to serve as dwellings for a small cult who worshiped the extraterrestrial being Glaaki. Led by one Thomas Lee, and remaining at the lake from 1790 until shortly after 1865, the cult received the \"Revelations of Glaaki\" as dream-sendings, and soon published an expurgated nine-volume set from an original 11-volume manuscript. Long after the cult's disappearance, local painter, Thomas Cartwright, took up residence at Lakeview Terrace, where he worked on the painting \"The Thing in the Lake\", before his mysterious demise.\n\nAs described in \"The Mine on Yuggoth\", the Devil's Steps are a \"rock formation beyond Brichester\" which:\n\n\"stretched fully 200 feet up in a series of steps to a plateau; from some way off the illusion of a giant staircase was complete, and legend has it that Satan came from the sky to walk the earth by way of those steps... In the center of the plateau stood three stone towers joined by narrow catwalks of black metal between the roofs... The (central) tower is approximately 30 ft. in height, windowless, and with a strangely angled doorway opening on a staircase leading into darkness.\"\n\nAt the top of the main tower is a dimensional gate to the planet Yuggoth. The towers are surrounded by an \"alien species\" of fungus, with \"a grey stem covered with twining leaves\" that uncurl toward approaching visitors.\n\nGoatswood, first described in the short story \"The Moon-Lens\", is an isolated town surrounded by woods to the east of Brichester. The narrator of that story is struck by the town's atmosphere: \"The close-set dull-red roofs, the narrow streets, the encircling forests—all seemed somehow furtive.\" As in Lovecraft's Innsmouth, the residents of Goatswood have a distinctive, offputting appearance; a typical resident is described as \"revoltingly goatlike,\" resembling \"a medieval woodcut of a satyr,\" and clad in \"grotesquely voluminous\" garments. Instead of worshiping a race of monsters from the sea (the Deep Ones), however, they worship Shub-Niggurath.\n\nThe most prominent feature of Goatswood is the titular Moon-Lens: A \"metal pylon, 50 feet high, rose from the center of the square. At the top (is)... a large convex lens surrounded by an arrangement of mirrors, and all hinged on a pivot attached to the ground by taut ropes.\" It is said, by perhaps an unreliable character, to have originally been built by the Romans.\n\nGoatswood is sometimes an unavoidable connection on the train route from Exham to Brichester. The infrequent visitors to Goatswood, \"The Moon Lens\" reveals, eat at the Station Cafe and stay at the Central Hotel.\n\nIn a later story, \"Made in Goatswood\", the village has more to offer to outsiders: a curiosity shop with a toad-like proprietor whose \"hands were brown and crinkled as the paper in which he wrapped the parcels,\" selling disturbing lawn ornaments; a fruit stand in a \"canvas stall like a shrine\" where fruit resembling peaches are offered by a girl whose \"eyelids lowered wickedly.\" There's even a red light district, Fitzroy Street, on the edge of town:\n\n\"Before the woods closed in, a last street of dingy houses lay exhausted between gardens high with grass, uneven with rocks, and, on the corner, a newspaper-shop, its cramped windows full of yellow cards; baked mud preserved the tracks of cars.\"\n\n\"The Franklyn Paragraphs\" mentions a number of places visited by \"the circle of young men\" around occultist Roland Franklyn; Goatswood is among them.\n\nIn the \"woods toward Goatswood\" is a clearing, according to \"The Insects of Shaggai\", where a meteorite once fell in the 17th century; a coven that subsequently worshiped there was executed by real-life witchfinder Matthew Hopkins. Within the clearing is a mysterious gray cone, home to the titular creatures; the story \"The Moon Lens\" also alludes to this artifact.\n\nThese woods are also featured in \"The Enchanted Fruit\", whose protagonist at first finds them enticing; \"Each corridor of trees seemed made to be explored, each green shadow promised mystery;\" and later forbidding; \"A screen of leaves seemed secretive; parted, it revealed only vistas of dim branches.\" In the forest, he finds a tree whose \"rich trunk, dark yet warm, stood alone on a mound of autumn built high from the edge of the glade;\" he eats the fruit of this tree, \"large as apples, soft and shaped as peaches,\" to his immediate delight and eventual regret.\n\nTemphill is the main setting for \"The Church in High Street\", Campbell's first published story in the Severn Valley. There it's described as a \"decaying Cotswold town\" and \"a place of ill repute.\" Describing the town, the narrator notes that:\n\n\"around the blackened hotel at the center of Temphill, the buildings were often greatly dilapidated... gabled dwellings, often with broken windows, and patchily unpainted fronts, but still inhabited. Here scattered unkempt children stared resignedly from dusty front steps or played in pools of orange mud on a patch of wasted ground, while the older tenants sat in twilit rooms.\"\n\nThe church of the title is set on a hill near the center of town, around which the town was built. It is said to exist \"conterminously\" with a temple of Yog-Sothoth. It is described:\n\n\"The steps... rose between green ruins of brick walls, to the black steeple of a church, among pallid gravestones... The tottering gravestones, overgrown with repulsively decaying vegetation, cast curious shadows over the fungus-strewn grass.\"\n\nThose who penetrate the catacombs beneath the church; reached via a trap door beneath the first set of pews; find themselves unaccountably unable to leave the town, as if the streets were turning back on themselves.\n\nIn \"The Church on High Street\", Temphill is home to John Clothier, \"a man possessed of an extraordinary amount of ancient knowledge,\" and Albert Young, a young man working on a \"book on witchcraft and witchcraft lore.\" In the subsequent story \"The Horror From the Bridge,\" Temphill is where James Phipps acquires \"extremely rare chemicals,\" as well as his mysterious wife.\n\n\"The Franklyn Paragraphs\" lists Temphill as one of the places that \"the circle of young men\" around Roland Franklyn visit. Franklyn's widow, complaining about the horrors he had put her through, says: \"He took me down to Temphill, and made me watch those things dancing on the graves.\"\n\nSevernford, a community on the River Severn, almost directly northwest of Brichester, is described in \"The Plain of Sound\" as a dull place to visit:\n\n\"Once one leaves behind the central area of Severnford, where a group of archaic buildings is preserved, and comes to the surrounding red-brick houses, there is little to interest the sight-seer. Much of Severnford is dockland, and even the country beyond is not noticeably pleasant to the forced hiker... (S)ome of the roads are noticeably rough.\"\n\nThe \"forced\" is a reference to the fact there is only one bus-route daily from Severnford to Brichester, which leaves in the morning; if visitors miss it, walking may be the only alternative. It is a full morning's walk away, and the route is not well-marked. (The motor route between Brichester and Severnford passes by \"hills... like sleeping collosi.\")\n\nOne attraction is the Inn at Severnford, a facility in central Severnford which is said to be \"one of the oldest (inns) in England\". However, in 1958 it was found to be \"temporarily\" closed to the public, reportedly because of repeated vandalism.\n\nSevernford and its outskirts are the main setting of Campbell's \"The Room in the Castle\", in which the Anglican church in Severnford is noted for having \"a stone carving depicting an angel holding a large star-shaped object in front of a cowering toad-like object.\"\n\nThe castle of the title is a ruined mansion on the outskirts of town, past Cotton Row: \"It was set on the crest of the hill, three walls still standing, though the roof had long ago collapsed. A lone tower stood like a charred finger against the pale sky.\" It was once the home of Sir Gilbert Morley, described as an \"18th-century warlock\" who imprisoned the Great Old One Byatis in the castle's basement.\n\nCampbell returned to Severnford in the story \"Potential\", a setting in which \"(t)he streets were lit by gas-lamps, reflected flickering in windows set in dark moist stone.\" The climactic scene of that story is set in a disused Severnford pub called \"The Riverside\", used as a sort of clubhouse by cultists who listen to Penderecki and read Roland Franklyn and Ultimate Press pornography. There is a suggestion that the Severnford authorities are complicit in the cult's activities: \"Oh, the police know about this,\" one cult member says. \"They're used to it by now, they don't interfere.\"\n\nAbout two-and-a-half miles (by foot) out of Severnford, after passing a \"thickly overgrown forest, where (one) would certainly have become further lost,\" and crossing \"montonous fields (without) seeing a building or another human being,\" one comes to \"an area of grassy hillocks,\" followed by a region of \"miniature valleys\". It is in one of these that the title phenomenon of \"The Plain of Sound\" was encountered, next to a house once inhabited by former Brichester University professor Arnold Hird. This peculiar phenomenon can become a gateway into the Gulf of S'glhuo.\n\nIn the story \"The Faces at Pine Dunes,\" Severnford is named by the fictional book \"Witchcraft in England\" as one of several centers of witchcraft activity—apparently the only place in the Severn Valley so listed.\n\nThe island beyond Severnford is referred to in the title of the story \"The Stone on the Island\". Notes found in the story describe it:\n\n\"Approx. 200 feet across. roughly circular. Little vegetation except short grass. Ruins of Roman temple to unnamed deity at the center of island (top of slight hill). Opp. side of hill from Severnford, about 35 ft. down, artificial hollow extending back 10 ft. and containing stone.\"\n\n\"Island continuously site of worship. Poss. pre-Roman nature deity (stone predates Roman occupation); the Roman temple built. In medieval times witch supposed to live on island. In 17th cen. witch-cult met there and invoked water elementals. In all cases stone avoided. Circa. 1790, witch-cult disbanded, but stray believers continued to visit.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the island became associated with a series of shocking mutilations. Victims, only some of whom survive the ordeal, began with witch-cult follower Joseph Norton in 1803, followed by Severnford clergyman Nevill Rayner in 1826, an unnamed prostitute in 1866, who was taken to Brichester Central Hospital, a local folk customs investigator named Alan Thorpe in 1870, a Brichester University student in 1930, and Mercy Hill paranormal researcher Dr. Stanley Nash and his son Michael (the latest victim) in 1962.\n\n\"The island beyond Severnford\" is visited by Franklyn's circle in \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\". The island is reachable via: \"a small hut\" \"on the edge of the docks\" that advertises, \"Hire a boat and see the Severn at its best!\" \n\nClotton, the scene of Campbell's \"Dunwich Horror\" pastiche, \"The Horror From the Bridge\", is a small town set where the river Ton flows into the Severn. Only a \"few leaning red-brick houses... remain of the uptown section of the once-prosperous town;\" the rest of the town was deliberately destroyed in 1931, for reasons explained in the story. In \"The Horror Under Warrendown,\" Clotton is mentioned as \"a small settlement which appeared to be largely abandoned, its few occupied houses huddling together on each side of a river.\" The story notes the town's \"stagnant almost reptilian smell and chilly haze.\"\n\nThe town's most noteworthy feature, also dating to 1931, is a \"20-foot high concrete building...on the bank of the Ton\", with an \"eldritch sign clumsily engraved on each wall\", carvings that \"were blurred by moss and weather.\"\n\nThe town was once home to James Phipps, \"a gaunt pallid-faced man, with jet-black hair, and long bony hands\" who died in 1898, aged well over a century, and his son Lionel Phipps (1806–1931). Both were odd individuals given to \"unorthodox scientific researches\" and nocturnal excavation. They lived on Riverside Alley, \"a little-tenanted street within sight of a bridge over the Ton\".\n\nOutside of Clotton, according to \"The Horror From the Bridge\", there is a \"pit on a patch of waste ground on what used to be Canning Road, near the river,\" containing \"roughly-cut steps, each carrying a carven five-pointed sign, which led down into abysmal darkness.\"\n\nIn \"The Franklyn Paragraphs,\" which mentions Clotton as another place visited by the Franklyn circle, Franklyn's widow notes that \"we went down the steps below Clotton.\"\n\nCamside is home to the occultist Henry Fisher, who summons the Elder God Daoloth in the story \"The Render of the Veils\". The town's paper, the \"Camside Observer\", is mentioned in that story, as well as in \"The Room in the Castle\", which also notes that the town was the home of James Phipps, until he was expelled in 1800 for practicing weird science, resettling in Clotton.\n\nIn \"The Mine on Yuggoth\", Edward Taylor is committed to the Camside Home for the Mentally Disturbed in 1924, after his ascent of the Devil's Steps.\n\nIn \"The Horror Under Warrendown\", written for the 1995 Severn Valley anthology \"Made in Goatswood\", Campbell introduced Warrendown, a village off the main road between Birmingham and Brichester. (Clotton, the story notes, is between Brichester and Warrendown.) The narrator describes it as:\n\n\"an insignificant huddle of buildings miles from anywhere... Where the road descended to the level of the village it showed me that the outermost cottages were so squat they appeared to have collapsed or to be sinking into the earth of the unpaved road. Thatch obscured their squinting windows... At the center of Warrendown the cottages, some of which I took to be shops without signs, crowded towards the road as if forced by the mounds behind them, mounds as broad as the cottages but lower, covered with thatch or grass. Past the center the buildings were more sunken; more than one had collapsed, while others were so overgrown that only glimpses through the half-obscured unglazed windows of movements, ill-defined and sluggish, suggested that they were inhabited.\"\n\nNear the edge of the village, which is only half a mile wide, there is a school, described as \"one long mound fattened by a pelt of thatch, grass, and moss.\" The school is connected to a rotting, half-ruined church that \"once possessed a tower, the overgrown stones of which were scattered beyond the edge of the village.\" Inside the church, \"the dozen or so pews on either side of the aisle, each pew broad enough to accommodate a large family, were only bloated green with moss and weeds; but the altar before them had been levered up, leaning its back against the rear wall of the church and exposing the underside of its stone.\" Where the altar used to be is the entrance to a system of tunnels that lead to the entity referred to in the story's title.\n\nThe air in the village is filled with a \"rotten vegetable sweetness\". The inhabitants, like those of Lovecraft's Innsmouth, share a \"look\", but while the people of Innsmouth resemble frogs, those of Warrendown call to mind rabbits, with \"plump yet flattish face(s)\" that sometimes appear furry, \"swollen\" eyes, \"bestial\" teeth, and outsized ears and feet.\n"}

It is bordered by the Penghu Uplift (Chinese: 澎湖隆起) in the north, the Dongsha Uplift in the southwest, and the South China Sea basin in the south. It is separated from the Zhujiangkou Basin (Chinese: 珠江口盆地) by the Dongsha Uplift. In the northeast, it stretches inland onto the southwest Taiwan Island.\n\nTaixinan Basin is located on the continental shelf, on the margin of the continental crust. Its tectonic evolution can be divided in three periods. The first period was from Paleocene to Oligocene. Starting in the Paleocene, Taixinan Basin had been experiencing the effect of rifting, which eventually caused the formation of the basin. The tensile stress field was in the NE-SW direction. Many normal faults developed at this period. The second period was the end of Oligocene. During this period, the Taixinan Basin experienced the effect of compression. Part of the early normal faults underwent tectonic inversion, and a lot of reverse faults and related folds developed. The third period was the thermal subsidence beginning from Miocene. Since the late Miocene, the South China Sea basin stopped its expansion. During this period, the sediment layers are horizontal and basically not controlled by the effects of faulting.\n\nThe Taixinan Basin is in the direction of NE, with a length of about 400km, average width of 150 km, and an area of more than 60000 km.\n\nIn the Taixinan Basin, there are two depressions in the north and the south, separated by an uplift in the NE direction. The thickness of the Cenozoic sediments in the depressions can reach 8000 m, increasing from west to east. In the eastern part of the basin, the thickness of the sediments can reach 7000 m offshore Kaohsiung.\n\nOnshore, on the southwest Taiwan Island, there is a distribution of normal faults of Paleogene.\n"}

By facilitating efficient global and local access, exchange and utilization of geospatial information, UNSDI will make the United Nations system more effective and support its “Delivering as One” policies.\n\nSpatial data infrastructures provide the institutional and technical foundation of policies, standards and procedures that enable organizations and information systems to interact in a way that facilitates spatial data discovery, evaluation and applications.\n\nGiven that UN agencies vary in their ability to utilise and manage geospatial information it is foreseen that UNSDI will reduce development and operational costs by working together to achieve economies of scale through generic standards, guidelines and implementation tools. Thus, the development of UNSDI is considered essential for increasing system coherence in the use and exchange of geospatial data and information for UN activities.\n\nIn the short term, UNSDI is an investment into the capacities of the United Nations System to manage its existing geo-spatial assets more effectively. Additionally UNSDI may serve as a model and vehicle for capacity building in some Member States that request assistance from the United Nations in managing and applying geospatial data to support their national development agenda.\n\nAt present the Center of Excellence for UNSDI has been established. The first phase of UNSDI developments consist of a Gazetteer, a Geospatial Data Warehouse, and a Visualization Facility. Two donor countries are involved in the present developments: Australia and Germany. Australia is funding the Gazetteer project, Germany has supplied office and staffing facilities for the UNSDI Center of Excellence in Bonn. The proposal for funding of the Geospatial Data Warehouse and associated activities is to be submitted to the Netherlands in Q4 of 2012.\n\nThe following Regional Organizations joined the process:\n\nUnderlying the UNSDI is the need to link UNSDI with national public and private geospatial and SDI capacities, both in developed and developing countries. To this end National Coordination Offices (NCOs) for UNSDI are to be established. Below the established NCOs are listed.\n\nAlthough some of the NCOs use the acronym UN and the UN emblem in their official title, they are not affiliated with the United Nations. Use of the emblem is restricted, based on General Assembly resolution 92(I),1946, and should be not be used by non-UN entities.\n\nWith the following countries discussions on UNSDI participation are ongoing: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Cape Verde, Chile, Jamaica, India, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Mongolia, Nigeria, Spain and South Africa.\n\n\n\nKey documentation on the UNSDI initiative can be found at and downloaded from http://www.ungiwg.org/documents\n\n"}
