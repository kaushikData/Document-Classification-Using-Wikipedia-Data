{"id": "23450595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23450595", "title": "350.org", "text": "350.org\n\n350.org is an international environmental organization addressing climate change with the goal of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide to 350ppm from the current level of 400 ppm. It was founded by author Bill McKibben with the goal of building a global grassroots movement to raise awareness about human-driven climate change, to confront climate change denial, and to cut emissions of carbon dioxide in order to slow the rate of global warming. 350.org takes its name from the research of Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientist James E. Hansen, who posited in a 2007 paper that 350 ppm of CO in the atmosphere is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point.\n\n350.org was founded by author Bill McKibben and a group of students from Middlebury College. McKibben is an American environmentalist and writer who wrote one of the first books on global warming for the general public, and frequently writes about climate change, alternative energy, and the need for more localized economies.\n\nThe organizing effort drew its name from NASA climate scientist James Hansen's contention that any atmospheric concentration of CO above 350 parts per million was unsafe. James Hansen opined that \"if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that.\" Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, rose by 2.6 parts per million to 396 ppm in 2013 from the previous year (annual global averages). It already crossed 400 ppm in May 2012 on monitors in the industrialized Northern Hemisphere's Arctic region.\n\nMcKibben first started to organize against climate change with a walk across Vermont, his home state. His \"Step It Up\" campaign in 2007 involved 1,400 demonstrations at famous sites across the United States. McKibben credits these activities with making Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama change their energy policies during the presidential campaign. Starting in 2008, 350.org built upon the \"Step It Up\" campaign and made it into a global organization.\n\nRajendra Pachauri, the UN's \"top climate scientist\" and leader of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has come out, as have others, in favor of reducing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to 350 ppm. McKibben called news of Pachauri's embrace of the 350ppm target \"amazing\". Some media have indicated that Pachauri's endorsement of the 350 ppm target was a victory for 350.org's activism.\n\nThe organization had a lift in prominence after McKibben appeared on The Colbert Report television show on Monday August 17, 2009. McKibben promotes the organization on speaking tours and by writing articles about it for many major newspapers and media, such as the Los Angeles Times and The Guardian.\n\nIn 2012 the organization was presented with the 2012 Katerva Award for Behavioural Change.\n\nThe 350.org movement considers the atmospheric concentration 350ppm of CO as a safe upper limit. This limit was the focus a 2009 COP15 international treaty. 350.org's goal is to have governments adopt policies to lower carbon dioxide emissions. In spite of this goal, \"[i]n 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400 ppm for the first time in recorded history.\" 350.org reports: \"This March [2015], global levels of CO2 passed 400 parts per million.\"\n\n350.org aims to build a global, grassroots movement to take on the fossil fuel industry and solve the climate crisis. Through online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions, 350.org has mobilized thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries. \n\nClimate safety and climate justice for people across the globe is a critical part of 350.org's mission. By working with local community groups, 350.org aims to hold corporations and world leaders accountable to the realities of science and the principles of social justice.\n\n350 parts per million is what scientists, climate experts, and progressive national governments are now saying is the safe upper limit for CO in our atmosphere. In May 2013, two independent teams of scientists measuring CO near the summit of Mauna Loa in Hawaii recorded that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million, probably for the first time in more than 3 million years of Earth history. The amount of CO in the atmosphere is continuing to rise at about 2 ppm every year.\n\nFossil-fuel companies currently have about 2,795 gigatons of carbon already contained in their proven coal and oil and gas reserves, and is the amount of fossil fuels they are currently planning to burn. 2,795 gigatons is five times higher than the limit of 565 gigatons that would keep Earth under a global temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n350.org has named the Keystone XL pipeline as a critical issue and turning point for the environmental movement, as well as for President Obama's legacy. NASA climatologist James Hansen labeled the Keystone XL pipeline as \"game over\" for the planet, and called the amount of carbon stored in Canadian bitumen sands a \"fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet.\"\n\n350.org cites oil spills along the proposed pipeline route, which would pass near Texas' Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to more than 12 million people. It could also pose danger to the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest aquifer in western North America that supplies drinking water and irrigation to millions of people and agricultural businesses. 350.org has opposed the economic argument that has been made by proponents of the pipeline, arguing that Keystone XL would create only a few thousand temporary jobs during construction. The State Department estimated that ultimately the pipeline will create 35 permanent jobs.\n\nContrary to oil industry claims, the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has said that the Keystone XL pipeline will increase gas prices instead of lowering them. The NRDC's study also refutes the claim that the pipeline will lead to energy independence, because the pipeline will carry tar sands from Canada to Texas which will then be sold on the global market.\n\nPartly due to efforts from 350.org and other organizations, President Obama officially rejected the building of Keystone XL on November 6, 2015. This marked the end of a seven-year review on the pipeline. Speaking on the decision, Bill McKibben said, “President Obama is the first world leader to reject a project because of its effect on the climate. That gives him new stature as an environmental leader, and it eloquently confirms the five years and millions of hours of work that people of every kind put into this fight.”\n\n350.org launched their \"Go Fossil Free: Divest from Fossil Fuels!\" campaign in 2012 with Bill McKibben's \"Do The Math\" speaking tour around the country. The campaign calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: \"If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.\" 350.org states their demand as the following \"We want institutions to immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within 5 years.\"\n\nThere are currently fossil fuel divestment campaigns at 308 colleges and universities, 105 cities and states, and 6 religious institutions. As of July 2013, six colleges and universities (San Francisco State University, Hampshire, College, Unity College, Sterling College, College of the Atlantic, and Green Mountain College) have committed to fossil fuel divestment. Seventeen cities (Seattle, WA; San Francisco, CA; Portland, OR; Eugene, OR; Berkeley, CA; Richmond, CA; Santa Monica, CA; Boulder, CO; Santa Fe, NM; Madison, WI; Bayfield, WI; State College, PA; Ithaca, NY; Truro, MA; Provincetown, MA; Providence, RI; and Cambridge, MA) have made commitments to divest. Twelve religious institutions (United Church of Christ – National, Massachusetts United Church of Christ, Minnesota United Church of Christ, Evangelical Lutheran Church of Oregon, First Unitarian Church of Salt Lake City, First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge, MA, Portsmouth South Church Unitarian, First Unitarian Church of Pittsfield, ME, First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee, Uniting Church, New South Wales & ACT, Australia, Dover Friends Meeting, Dover, NH, Melbourne Unitarian Church, Australia) have also committed to fossil fuel divestment.\n\nThe \"Do The Math\" movie is a 42-minute documentary film about the rising movement to change the terrifying math of the climate crisis and challenge the fossil fuel industry. The math revolves around these three numbers: to stay below 2 degrees Celsius of global warming we can emit only 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide versus the 2,795 gigatons held in proven reserves by fossil fuel corporations. This warming rise was agreed to in the 2009 Copenhagen Summit as a limit. NASA scientist James Hansen says \"2 degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster.\"\n\nPhase 1 of Global Power Shift was a convergence in Istanbul, Turkey in June 2013 of about five-hundred climate organizers from 135 countries. Stated objectives include sharing and developing skills to organize movements, building upon existing plans to organize in-country Power Shift events after the kickoff event in Turkey, building political alignment and a clear theory of change, sharing experiences from different countries, formulating strategies to overcome challenges, and building relationships to strengthen regional and international cooperation and collaboration.\n\nPhase 2 of Global Power Shift involves the organizers who were in Turkey in June 2013 to bring home what they learned to organize summits, events, and mobilizations.\n\n350.org launched the Summer Heat campaign in the Summer of 2013, and was a wave of mass mobilizations across the country. Summer Heat actions took place at eleven locations: Richmond, CA; Vancouver, WA; Green River, UT; Albuquerque, NM; Houston, TX; St. Ignace, MI; Warren, OH; Washington, D.C.; Camp David, MD; Somerset, MA; and Sebago Lake, ME. Participants included grassroots organizers, labor unions, farmers, ranchers, environmental justice groups, and others. The slogan that was used for the Summer Heat campaign was: \"As The Temperature Rises, So Do We.\"\n\nAn \"International Day of Climate Action\" on October 24, 2009, was organized by 350.org to influence the delegates going to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in December, 2009 (COP15). This was the first global campaign ever organized around a scientific data point. The actions organised by 350.org included gigantic depictions of the number \"350\", walks, marches, rallies, teach-ins, bike rides, sing-a-thons, carbon-free dinners, retrofitting houses to save energy, tree plantings, mass dives at the Great Barrier Reef, solar-cooked bake-outs, churches bell ringings, underwater cabinet meetings (Maldives), and armband distributions to athletes. The organization reported that over 5,200 synchronized demonstrations occurred in 181 countries on the day.\nThe group reports that they organised the world's \"most widespread day of political action\" on Saturday October 24, 2009, reporting 5,245 actions in 181 countries.\n\nAs a follow-up to 2009's International Day of Climate Action, 350.org and the joined to help coordinate another global day of action which occurred on October 10, 2010. The 2010 campaign was focused on concrete actions that can be taken locally to help combat climate change. Actions from tree-plantings to solar panel installations to huge electricity service-provider switching parties occurred in almost every country around the world.\n\nThe organization's efforts continued into 2012 with a planned May 5 worldwide series of rallies under the slogan \"Connect the Dots,\" to draw attention to the links between climate change and extreme weather. Per the 350.org website the day is called Climate Impacts Day.\n\n350 helped organize the People's Climate March, which took place on September 21, 2014.\n\nApart from special events, 350.org organizes actions on an ongoing basis to promote its message. These activities include tree plantings (350 trees in each instance) for biosequestration, promoting the term \"350\", publishing adverts in major newspapers calling for the target level of carbon dioxide to be lowered to 350ppm, conducting polls on the subject of climate change, educating youth leaders, lobbying governments on the issue of carbon targets, and joining a campaign to establish a .eco top-level domain or \"tld\". In December 2009, the group petitioned the United States Environmental Protection Agency to set national limits for greenhouse gases using the Clean Air Act, asking the agency to cap atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at 350 parts per million. The organization created and distributed a time-lapse video showing the recent retreat of Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, graphically depicting the impacts of warming climates. On President's Day, February 18, 2013,\nit is co-organizing a national day of action to call on President Obama to address climate change.\n\n350.org claims alliance with 300 organizations around the world and has enlisted \"350 messengers\" who have publicly allied themselves with the organization or its goal to spread the 350 movement, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Steffen, Bianca Jagger, David Suzuki, and Colin Beavan.\n\n1Sky merged into 350.org in 2011.\n\nNaomi Klein (author of \"\") is a member of the board of directors of 350.org.\n\n\n"}

Several universities elected to undertake the huge task of digitizing this information so that other researchers could use it.\n\nThe two earliest projects were conducted by The Australian Consortium for the Asian Spatial Information and Analysis Network (ACASIAN) at Griffith University and the China Data Center at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. ACASIAN specialized solely in spatial coverages while the China Data Center included GIS coverages as a supplemented to their primary mission of providing Chinese statistical and census data.\n\nThere is a great deal of high quality GIS data being produced in China by both government organizations and private companies.

China has now more than 500 institutions of higher learning training GIS-related professionals, of which more than 200 universities and colleges have established a GIS lab.\n\nThe GIS industry in China is worth 400 billion yuan per annum as of November 2007. More than 300,000 people were involved in either building or using these systems, according to Zondy Cyber Group president Wu Xincai, who is also the president of the China Association for Geographic Information System. Almost 20,000 enterprises are estimated to have engaged in the industry. The biggest vendor of GIS in China is Zondy Cyber Group, followed by SuperMap. Around 2000 of these have GIS as a core discipline or function. The industry's rapid expansion is attributed to the country's economic development, which has led to an increase in capital input, from both government and businesses. Between 2001 and 2005 the Ministry of Information Industry allocated more than 20 million yuan to fund the development and application of GIS. GIS has been put to use in many spheres, including land survey, mineral exploitation, water conservancy and environmental protection.

It measures about 250 km from north to south and 524 km from east to west. It has 2,106 km of boundaries, shared with Austria to the west, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia to the south and southwest, Romania to the southeast, Ukraine to the northeast, and Slovakia to the north.\n\nHungary's modern borders were first established after World War I when, by the terms of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, it lost more than 71% of what had formerly been the Kingdom of Hungary, 58.5% of its population, and 32% of the Hungarians. The country secured some boundary revisions from 1938 to 1941: In 1938 the First Vienna Award gave back territory from Czechoslovakia, in 1939 Hungary occupied Carpatho-Ukraine. In 1940 the Second Vienna Award gave back Northern Transylvania and finally Hungary occupied the Bácska and Muraköz regions during the Invasion of Yugoslavia. However, Hungary lost these territories again with its defeat in World War II. After World War II, the Trianon boundaries were restored with a small revision that benefited Czechoslovakia.\n\nMost of the country has an elevation of less than 200 m. Although Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains, those reaching heights of 300 m or more cover less than 2% of the country. The highest point in the country is Kékes (1,014 m) in the Mátra Mountains northeast of Budapest. The lowest spot is 77.6 m above sea level, located in the south of Hungary, near Szeged.\n\nThe major rivers in the country are the Danube and Tisza. The Danube is navigable within Hungary for 418 kilometers. The Tisza River is navigable for 444 km in the country. Less important rivers include the Drava along the Croatian border, the Rába, the Szamos, the Sió, and the Ipoly along the Slovakian border. Hungary has three major lakes. Lake Balaton, the largest, is 78 km long and from 3 to 14 km wide, with an area of 600 square km . Hungarians often refer to it as the \"Hungarian Sea\". It is Central Europe's largest freshwater lake and an important recreation area. Its shallow waters offer good summer swimming, and in winter its frozen surface provides excellent opportunities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water are Lake Velence (26 square km) in Fejér County and Lake Fertő (Neusiedler See—about 82 square km within Hungary), and the artificial Lake Tisza.\n\nHungary has three major geographic regions (which are subdivided to seven smaller ones): the Great Alföld, lying east of the Danube River; the Transdanubia, a hilly region lying west of the Danube and extending to the Austrian foothills of the Alps; and the North Hungarian Mountains, which is a mountainous and hilly country beyond the northern boundary of the Great Hungarian Plain.\n\nThe country's best natural resource is fertile land, although soil quality varies greatly. About 70% of the country's total territory is suitable for agriculture; of this portion, 72% is arable land. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for industrial development.\n\nThe Little Alföld or Little Hungarian Plain is a plain (tectonic basin) of approximately 8,000 km in northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and eastern Austria, along the lower course of the Rába River, with high quality fertile soils.\n\nThe Transdanubia region lies in the western part of the country, bounded by the Danube River, the Drava River, and the remainder of the country's border with Slovenia and Croatia. It lies south and west of the course of the Danube. It contains Lake Fertő and Lake Balaton. The region consists mostly of rolling hills. Transdanubia is primarily an agricultural area, with flourishing crops, livestock, and viticulture. Mineral deposits and oil are found in Zala county close to the border of Croatia.\n\nThe Great Alföld contains the basin of the Tisza River and its branches. It encompasses more than half of the country's territory. Bordered by mountains on all sides, it has a variety of terrains, including regions of fertile soil, sandy areas, wastelands, and swampy areas. Hungarians have inhabited the Great Plain for at least a millennium. Here is found the puszta, a long, and uncultivated expanse (the most famous such area still in existence is the Hortobágy National Park), with which much Hungarian folklore is associated. In earlier centuries, the Great Plain was unsuitable for farming because of frequent flooding. Instead, it was the home of massive herds of cattle and horses. In the last half of the 19th century, the government sponsored programs to control the riverways and expedite inland drainage in the Great Plain. With the danger of recurrent flooding largely eliminated, much of the land was placed under cultivation, and herding ceased to be a major contributor to the area's economy.\n\nAlthough the majority of the country has an elevation lesser than 300 m, Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains. They can be classified to four geographic regions, from west to east: Alpokalja, Transdanubian Mountains, Mecsek and North Hungarian Mountains. Alpokalja (literally \"the foothills of the Alps\") is located along the Austrian border; its highest point is Írott-kő with an elevation of 882 metres. The Transdanubian Mountains stretch from the west part of Lake Balaton to the Danube Bend near Budapest, where it meets the North Hungarian Mountains. Its tallest peak is the 757 m high Pilis. Mecsek is the southernmost Hungarian mountain range, located north from Pécs - Its highest point is the Zengő with 682 metres.\n\nThe North Hungarian Mountains lie north of Budapest and run in a northeasterly direction south of the border with Slovakia. The higher ridges, which are mostly forested, have rich coal and iron deposits. Minerals are a major resource of the area and have long been the basis of the industrial economies of cities in the region. Viticulture is also important, producing the famous Tokaji wine. The highest peak of it is the Kékes, located in the Mátra mountain range.\n\nHungary has a mainly continental climate, with cold winters and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is about , in summer , and in winter , with extremes ranging from about in summer to in winter. Average yearly rainfall is about . Distribution and frequency of rainfall are unpredictable. The western part of the country usually receives more rain than the eastern part, where severe droughts may occur in summertime. Weather conditions in the Great Plain can be especially harsh, with hot summers, cold winters, and scant rainfall.\n\nBy the 1980s, the countryside was beginning to show the effects of pollution, both from herbicides used in agriculture and from industrial pollutants. Most noticeable was the gradual contamination of the country's bodies of water, endangering fish and wildlife. Although concern was mounting over these disturbing threats to the environment, no major steps had yet been taken to arrest them.\n\nHungary, with its plains and hilly regions, is highly suitable for agriculture.\n\nDoubtless, one of Hungary's most important natural resources is arable land. It covers about 48.57% of the country, which is outstanding in the world (see the related ). The mass majority of the fertile soil has a good quality.\n\nThe most important agricultural zones are the Little Hungarian Plain (it has the highest quality fertile soil in average), Transdanubia, and the Great Hungarian Plain. The last covers more than half of the country (52,000 km in number), whereas soil quality varies extremely; the territory even contains a small, grassy semi-desert, the so-called puszta (steppe in English). Puszta is exploited by sheep and cattle raising.\n\nThe most important Hungarian agricultural products include corn, wheat, barley, oat, sunflower, poppy, [[potato]], [[millet]], [[beet|sugar-beet]], [[flax]], and many other plants. There are also some newly naturalized plants too, for example [[amaranth]]. [[Poppy seed]] is part of the traditional [[Hungarian cuisine]].\n\n[[File:Paprikahungarian.jpg|right|thumb|A greengrocer's in Hungary]] The country is well known for producing high quality [[Capsicum annuum|peppers]], which are often made into [[paprika]]. There are numerous fruits reared, including many subspecies of [[apple]], [[pear]], [[peach]], [[grape]], [[apricot]], [[watermelon]], [[cantaloupe]], etc.\n\nHungary does not grow any [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] products, thus these products are mainly imported from the [[United States]]. They cannot, however, be distributed without a mark on the wrapping.\n\nWine production has a long history in Hungary. There are two languages in [[Europe]] in which the word for \"wine\" does not derive from the [[Latin language|Latin]], being [[Greek language|Greek]] – and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The Hungarian word is \"bor\".\n\nViticulture has been recorded in the territory of today's Hungary since the Roman times, who were responsible for the introduction of the cultivation of wines. The arriving Hungarians took over the practice and have maintained it ever since.\n\nToday, there are numerous wine regions in Hungary, producing quality and inexpensive wines as well, comparable to Western European ones. The majority of the country's wine regions are located in the mountains or in the hills, such as [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[North Hungarian Mountains]], [[Villány Mountains]], and so on. Important ones include the regions of [[Eger]], [[Hajós]], [[Somló]], [[Sopron]], [[Villány]], [[Szekszárd]], and [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]].\n\n19% of the country is covered by [[forest]]s. These are mainly mountainous areas, such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the [[Alpokalja]]. The composition of forests is various, with trees like [[fir]], [[beech]], [[oak]], [[willow]], [[acacia]], [[Platanus|plane]], etc. \n\nHungary's current [[Counties of Hungary|counties]] are largely based on the country's historic regions. The counties are subdivided into \"[[Districts of Hungary|district]]s\" (\"járás\"), and these are further divided into \"[[municipality|municipalities]]\" (\"település\").

With a crew of six, Roald Amundsen traversed the passage in a three-year journey, finishing in 1906.\n\nThe square-sterned sloop of 45 net register tonnage () was built by Knut Johannesson Skaale in Rosendal, Norway in 1872, the same year Amundsen was born. She was named \"Gjøa\" after her then owner's wife. (\"Gjøa\" is a modern form of the Norse name \"Gyða\" - this again is a compressed form of \"Guðfríðr\", a compound of \"guð\" 'god' and \"fríðr\" 'beautiful'.) For the next 28 years the vessel served as a herring fishing boat.\n\nOn March 28, 1901, Amundsen bought her from Asbjørn Sexe of Ullensvang, Norway, for his forthcoming expedition to the Arctic Ocean. \"Gjøa\" was much smaller than vessels used by other Arctic expeditions, but Amundsen intended to live off the limited resources of the land and sea through which he was to travel, and reasoned that the land could sustain only a tiny crew (this had been the cause of the catastrophic failure of John Franklin's expedition fifty years previously). Her shallow draught would help her traverse the shoals of the Arctic straits. Perhaps most importantly, the aging ship was all that Amundsen (who was financing his expedition largely by spending his inheritance) could afford.\n\nAmundsen had little experience of Arctic sailing, and so decided to undertake a training expedition before braving the Arctic ice. He engaged Hans Christian Johannsen, her previous owner, and a small crew, and sailed from Tromsø in April 1901. The next five months were spent sealing on the pack ice of the Barents Sea. Following their return to Tromsø in September, Amundsen set about remedying the deficiencies in \"Gjøa\" that the trip had exposed. He had a 13 horsepower single-screw marine paraffin motor installed (she had hitherto been propelled only by sail, and had proved to be sluggish). Much of the winter was spent upgrading her ice sheathing; Amundsen knew she would spend several winters iced-in.\n\nIn the spring of 1902, her refit complete, Amundsen sailed her to Christiania (later called Oslo), the capital of Norway. At this time Norway was still in an (increasingly unhappy) union with Sweden, and Amundsen hoped the nationalistic spirit which was sweeping the country would attract sponsors willing to underwrite the expedition's burgeoning costs. After much wrangling, and a donation from King Oscar, he succeeded. By the time Amundsen returned, Norway had gained its independence and he and his crew were among the new country's first national heroes.\n\nAmundsen was to serve as the expedition leader and \"Gjøa's\" master. His crew were Godfred Hansen, a Danish naval lieutenant and \"Gjøa\"'s first officer; Helmer Hanssen, second officer, an experienced ice pilot who would accompany Amundsen on many of his subsequent expeditions; Anton Lund, an experienced sealing captain; Peder Ristvedt (1873-1955), chief engineer; Gustav Juel Wiik, second engineer, a gunner in the Royal Norwegian Navy; and Adolf Henrik Lindstrøm (1866-1939), cook.\n\n\"Gjøa\" left the Oslofjord on June 16, 1903, and made for the Labrador Sea west of Greenland. From there she crossed Baffin Bay and navigated the narrow, icy straits of the Arctic Archipelago. By late September \"Gjøa\" was west of the Boothia Peninsula and began to encounter worsening weather and sea ice. Amundsen put her into a natural harbour on the south shore of King William Island; by October 3 she was iced in.\n\nThere she remained for nearly two years, with her crew undertaking sledge journeys to make measurements to determine the location of the North Magnetic Pole, and learning from the local Inuit people. The harbour, known as Uqsuqtuuq (\"lots of fat\") in Inuktitut, has become the only settlement on the island - Gjoa Haven, Nunavut has a population of over a thousand people (1,279 at the 2011 census).\n\"Gjøa\" left Gjoa Haven on August 13, 1905, and motored through the treacherous straits south of Victoria Island, and from there west into the Beaufort Sea. By October \"Gjøa\" was again iced-in, this time near Herschel Island in the Yukon. Amundsen left his men on board and spent much of the winter skiing 500 miles south to Eagle, Alaska to telegraph news of the expedition's success. He returned in March, but \"Gjøa\" remained icebound until July 11. \"Gjøa\" reached Nome on August 31, 1906. She sailed on to earthquake ravaged San Francisco, California, where the expedition was met with a hero's welcome on October 19.\n\nRather than sail her round Cape Horn and back to Norway, the Norwegian American community in San Francisco prevailed on Amundsen to sell her to them. The ship was donated to the city of San Francisco and the ship was dragged up the beach to the northwest corner of Golden Gate Park, surrounded by low fence and put on display. Amundsen knew that the notoriety that his exploits aboard \"Gjøa\" had earned him would allow him access to Nansen's ship \"Fram\", which had been custom-made for ice work and was owned by the Norwegian state. Amundsen and his crew traveled back to Norway by commercial ship. Of the expedition members, only Wiik did not return to Norway; he had died of illness during the third Arctic winter.\n\nOver the following decades \"Gjøa\" slowly deteriorated, and by 1939 she was in poor condition. Refurbishment was delayed by World War II, and repairs were not completed until 1949. Being displayed outdoors and having faced 66 years of high winds, ocean salt and sand, the boat once again suffered deterioration, until in 1972, with the help of Erik Krag, a Danish American shipping company owner of San Francisco, \"Gjøa\" was returned to Norway. Erik Krag was knighted by the King of Norway for his efforts in shipping home \"Gjøa\".\n\nThe \"Gjøa\" was displayed in the Norwegian Maritime Museum (Norwegian: \"Norsk Maritimt Museum\") in Bygdøy, Oslo. In May 2009 the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Fram Museum (Norwegian: \"Frammuseet\") signed an agreement for the Fram Museum of Bygdøy to take over the exhibition of the \"Gjøa\". It is currently displayed in a separate building at Fram Museum.\n\nA \"bauta\" (memorial pillar) now stands near \"Gjøa\"'s former home in San Francisco. The \"Gjøa\" was also featured as a filming location in the 2005 documentary,\" The Search for the Northwest Passage\", in which Kåre Conradi played Amundsen.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32798033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32798033", "title": "Joint Council of Municipalities (Croatia)", "text": "Joint Council of Municipalities (Croatia)\n\nThe Joint Council of Municipalities in Croatia (; / ; shortly: ЗВО / \"ZVO\") is elected sui generis body formed on the basis of Erdut Agreement that aligns interests of the Serb ethnic community in the historical regions of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Syrmia that are part of Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Srijem County. Those areas at one time all were under the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. Joint Council of Municipalities coordinates initiatives and proposals to the institutions of government, international organisations and NGOs. Joint Council of Municipalities is not an autonomous administrative unit. It is founding member of the Serb National Council.\n\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence, a self-proclaimed Serb Autonomous Region SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was formed. SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina, which committed numerous war crimes against Croats, Hungarians, Ruthenians and other non-Serbs. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after occupation Eastern Croatia. After the Croatian army took control of the rest of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, the only area of Croatia that remained under Serb control was Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.\n\nLocal Serbs therefore concluded that without an agreement, they would face the same fate as those in the western part of Krajina. Meanwhile, Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tuđman reached a consensus via the Dayton Agreement and on 12 November, the Erdut Agreement ended the war in eastern Croatia. There was established transition period in which region was reintegrated with help of United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium.\n\nThe Erdut agreement guarantees the Serbs \"the highest level of internationally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms\". The Serb community was given the right to \"appoint a joint Council of Municipalities\". The Council was established in 1997 The Council is one of the organisations that comprise the Serb National Council.\n\nThe founding Charter was signed on 15 July 1997 at Osijek Airport in the presence of UNTAES Head Jacques Paul Klein. In early August the president of Committee for Civic, Human and Minority Rights, Branko Jurišić, complained to representatives of the European Union Monitoring Mission that the Council had not been registered in Zagreb although it had already begun to carry out most of the powers on the ground. This condition would last until the end of UNTAES mission in 1998.\n\nAlthough the Erdut Agreement established the Council as a legal entity, its function was not clearly defined. From the end of the war until 2010 the Council functioned as an association of municipalities. In this period, the Government was required to fund its work, but the Council's legal position was below the level anticipated by the Croatian Government. In 2010, Croatian parliament amended to the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities. According to the proposal, the Council was to become a special administrative unit of Croatia that would be located in the territory of two counties. The proposed article of the constitutional law was\n\nThis decision provoked a heated Parliamentary debate. Opponents argued that this created a kind of local government with no parallel in the rest of the country. Milorad Pupovac, MP of the Serbian national minority condemned the MPs who were willing to recognise the full independence of Kosovo, while objecting to the autonomy of the local Serbian community. President of the Independent Democratic Serbian Party Vojislav Stanimirović attacked MP Vesna Pusić (then-President of the National Committee for Monitoring Accession Negotiations with EU).\n\nAt an emergency Council meeting the day after the constitutional changes, President Dragan Crnogorac condemned statements by Pusić, Ingrid Antičević-Marinović, Josip Leko and Zoran Vinković. He also said, \"We are not autonomists or separatists, we are legally elected representatives in local government and members of Council\". Pusić explained her attitude later in weekly Novosti where she said she believed that the Council should definitely exist but that it did not need constitutional protection. Eventually a compromise was reached that the Council would receive preferred status, ensured by an ordinary, not constitutional law.\n\nJCM is the target of sharp criticism of Croatian right-wing groups. The Croatian Party of Rights claims that the council represents a continuation and continuity of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia.\n\nThe Council consists of an elected Council Assembly, the Commission for Election and Appointment, the Secretariat, the Office of the President and two Offices of Vice-Presidents who are the Vice-Presidents of the two counties. Four committees are an integral part of the Council:<ref name=\"ZVO/odbori\"></ref>\n\n\nAt least once every four months, the Council delegation meets with the President.\n\nThe Council has established contacts with the Republic of Serbia. The Council takes part in projects with the EU and the Ministry of Diaspora of Republic of Serbia.\n\nThe Assembly is made up of members of the Serbian ethnic community, regardless of their party affiliation. They are elected in Vukovar-Srijem and Osijek-Baranja counties. The members are determined as follows:\n\nThe municipal councils in which the Serbian community makes majority, appointed 2 councillors.\n\nThe city councils in which Serbian community has a majority, appoints the following number of councillors:\n\nThe municipal or city councils in which the Serbian community is a minority, appoint half these numbers.\n\nMost members of Council Assembly of Joint Council of Municipalities are members of Independent Democratic Serb Party.\n\nThe third JCM President is Dragan Crnogorac from Independent Democratic Serb Party.\n\nInternational guarantees of JCM took effect in 1996, following United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037. Over the years, JCM officials had formal meetings with foreign officials, including with former President of Serbia Boris Tadić, US Ambassador in Zagreb, and President of the Government of Vojvodina, Bojan Pajtić.\n\nThe municipalities part of the Council are: Trpinja, Erdut, Markušica, Borovo, Jagodnjak, Negoslavci and Šodolovci. These municipalities are all located in Vukovar-Syrmia and Osijek-Baranja counties. Jagodnjak, Markušica, Šodolovci and Trpinja have a development index of less than 50% of the Croatian average, among the poorest municipalities in Croatia. Borovo, Erdut and Negoslavci have an index of between 50–75%. According to 2001 census, these municipalities had a population of 29,254 inhabitants and an area of 587.65 square kilometres, comparable with Isle of Man by territory and with Gibraltar by population. The Council's mandate extends to protecting the rights of all 60,500 Serbs who live in territory of the former Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. The Joint Council of Municipalities is not a body of territorial autonomy although its mandate is territorially defined.\n\nAny municipality or town in these two counties where Serbs constitute a certain percentage of the population automatically participate in its work. However, no authority of municipalities was formally transferred to the Council. The municipalities also co-operate outside the Council in matters that are not within Council jurisdiction, such as joint appearances at fairs.\n\nOn the territory of JCM members, in most public schools classes are given in separate Serbian and Croatian language classes. This practice is followed in Vukovar, Beli Manastir and villages inhabited by minority communities that are located outside member municipalities. No private schools operate in the area. Secondary schools are located in Dalj (High School Dalj) and Borovo (part of Vukovar high school). No institutions of higher education operate there. The majority of students attend University of Novi Sad, University of Osijek, University of Belgrade, University of Zagreb and University of Banja Luka. The Cultural and Scientific Center \"Milutin Milanković\" is located in Dalj. Committee for Education, Culture and Sport of Joint Council of Municipalities conducts activities aimed at fostering the Serbian language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, through preservation of memories of important individuals and events from the past of Serbian state and ethnic group. Joint Council of Municipalities supports the registration of Serbian language public schools in which classes.\n\nJCM organises multiple cultural events: \"Selu u pohode\" \"(English: \"Village Revisited\")\", \"Međunarodni festival dečijeg folklora\" \"(English: \"International Festival of Child Folklore\")\", \"Horsko duhovno veče\" \"(English: \"Choir Spiritual Night\")\" and \"Izložba likovnog stvaralaštva\" \"(English: \"The exhibition of fine art\")\". Veteran Football League brings together 10 soccer clubs. The Council sponsors Chess Leagues and a Shooting League. The Council also publishes a monthly magazine \"Izvor\" \"(English: \"Source\")\" and, in co-operation with Radio Television of Serbia and Radio Television of Vojvodina, it broadcasts twice per month a TV show named \"Hronika Slavonije, Baranje i zapadnog Srema\" \"(English: \"Chronicle of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia\")\". New media project named srbi.hr started in April 2018 in a form of web portal. JCm collaborates with local minority media such as Radio Borovo, and has a 25% stake in Radio Dunav in Vukovar and educational institutions such as Serbian Orthodox Secondary School.\n\nOn 23 May 2011, JCM celebrated the \"Day of the Joint Council of Municipalities\". The day began by laying flowers on the grave of the first President of Council, Miloš Vojnović at a New cemetery in Vukovar. After that, in the hotel \"Lav\", a ceremony took place. Council President Dragan Crnogorac stated:\n\n\n\n"}

Sá was also a member of the group who accompanied Gama on his first trip into Calicut on 20 May 1498.\n\nOn the return voyage the \"São Rafael\" was scuttled off the East African coast, and the crew re-distributed to the remaining two ships, the \"São Gabriel\" and the \"Berrio\", as by this point there were not enough crewmen left standing to manage all three ships. This was due to the loss of almost half the crew during the voyage across the Indian Ocean, and to scurvy being rife amongst the survivors. João de Sá transferred to the \"São Gabriel\". Later on, after having sailed around Africa, Sá was given command of the ship because Vasco da Gama decided to remain at Santiago island with his brother Paulo, who had fallen seriously ill. The \"S. Gabriel\" under Sá arrived in Lisbon sometime in late July or early August. Although Paulo was later able to travel on with his brother towards Portugal, he died whilst en route and was buried at the monastery of São Francisco in Angra do Heroismo.\n\nJoão de Sá is one of the purported authors of the anonymous \"Journal of Vasco Da Gama's trip of 1497\" (the other being Álvaro Velho). This work survives in a single manuscript copy preserved at the Biblioteca Pública Municipal of Porto and first published in Porto in 1838. In 1945, historian Franz Hümmerich identified the author of this manuscript with an Álvaro Velho who had spent eight years in Guinea and provided information about the Gambia region to Valentim Fernandes. However, more recent studies by Carmen Radulet have exposed weaknesses in this theory and attributed the \"Journal\" with more certainty to scrivener João de Sá.\n\nLike Vasco da Gama, João de Sá appears to have been closely associated with the Almeida family. It is believed that he spent some time at Safi (North Africa) after his return from India, possibly at the same time as being \"criado\" to the Bishop of Coimbra, D. Jorge de Almeida.\n\nBetween February 1511 and April 1514, de Sá, who was a trained scrivener, was the \"treasurer of spices\" in the Casa da Índia.

The mountain is located within Nyanga National Park in Nyanga District, is about north west Mutare. The summit lies atop a small outcrop of rock around 40m above the surrounding area. The remainder of the peak is a broad moor of mainly rolling hills and plateau with an area of about 8 km. The edges of this plateau then fall steeply to the east and west sides. The mountain vegetation is largely composed of heath around the summit plateau with evergreen forest along the wetter eastern slopes and grassland to the western side. Annual rainfall totals are high (around 2200 mm) but long spells of dry weather occur during the winter period of May to August. Due to its relatively low altitude and tropical location, snow falls very rarely, last recorded in August 1935.\n\nThe mountain is composed of an upper sill of dolerite and sandstone, with the harder dolerite forming cliffs and ridges. The dolerite sill and the sediments underlying it are probably part of the Umkondo Group. The Umkondo Group dolerite sill north of Nyangani, on the Kwaraguza Road, has been dated at 1099 Ma \n\nThe mountain can be accessed from four base points within Nyanga National Park:\n\n(1) The official car park, at the base of the Tourist Route. This is reached from Circular Drive.\n\n(2) The Mountain Club of Zimbabwe hut, on the Kwaraguza Road, accessed via Circular Drive.\n\n(3) Nyazengun Substation of Nyanga National Park, accessed via a road which goes south from just before the official car park.\n\n(4) Gleneagles Substation of Nyanga National Park, accessed via the Circular Drive, Kwaraguza Road and the Gleneagles road or from Troutbeck via Nyafaru.\n\nThe peak can be reached within 1–3 hours by anyone of average fitness. This ascent brings the hiker to an altitude of about 2200m and the remainder is mostly walking across the gentler gradients of the summit plateau. The hazards here are produced by bewilderingly fast weather changes that can switch from sunny skies to thick fog, and under these conditions several fatalities have occurred due to hikers losing their way and falling down ravines. There are three ascents that follow paths:\n\n\nThe mountain can also be ascended using the following routes which do not have paths or markings:\n\n\nThe above are all walks or scrambles, without rock climbing involved. However, caution is advised, especially on unmarked routes, as the weather may change very rapidly: descent of cloud can result in visibility of less than 50 m. This may well be the cause for a number of disappearances on the mountain, such as that of two teenage children of the then Minister of Finance, Tichaendepi Masaya.\n\nThree rivers have their sources on Mount Nyangani: the Nyamuziwa River, the Kairezi (Gairezi) River and the Pungwe River. The first two are tributaries of the Mazowe River, which is itself a tributary of the Zambezi River.\n\nThe Nyama River, a tributary of the Kayirezi, falls off the main plateau in a waterfall on the northeast of the mountain and the Kairezi Falls are located on the east edge of the main plateau.\n\nThe fauna of the area is described under Nyanga National Park. Additional information:\n\n\nIron Age ruins have been found on Little Nyangani and on a hill west of the summit, the latter better-preserved, but not on the summit plateau itself.\n\nThe film \"Mysteries of Mount Inyangani\" looks at some of the mysteries and myths about the mountain.\n\n\n"}

This was the first man-made satellite orbiting the Earth. Subsequent successful launches, both in the Soviet Union (e.g., the Sputnik and Cosmos programs), and in the U.S. (e.g., the Explorer program), quickly led to the design and operation of dedicated meteorological satellites. These are orbiting platforms embarking instruments specially designed to observe the Earth's atmosphere and surface with a view to improve weather forecasting. Starting in 1960, the TIROS series of satellites embarked television cameras and radiometers. This was later (1964 onwards) followed by the Nimbus satellites and the family of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) platforms. The latter measures the reflectance of the planet in red and near-infrared bands, as well as in the thermal infrared. In parallel, NASA developed the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS), which became the precursor to the Landsat program. These early sensors had minimal spectral resolution, but tended to include bands in the red and near-infrared, which are useful to distinguish vegetation and clouds, amongst other targets.\n\nWith the launch of the first ERTS satellite – which was soon to be renamed Landsat 1 – on July 23, 1972 with its MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) NASA funded a number of investigations to determine its capabilities for Earth remote sensing. One of those early studies was directed toward examining the spring vegetation green-up and subsequent summer and fall dry-down (the so-called “vernal advancement and retrogradation”) throughout the north to south expanse of the Great Plains region of the central U.S. This region covered a wide range of latitudes from the southern tip of Texas to the U.S.-Canada border, which resulted in a wide range of solar zenith angles at the time of the satellite observations.\n\nThe researchers for this Great Plains study (PhD student Donald Deering and his advisor Dr. Robert Hass) found that their ability to correlate, or quantify, the biophysical characteristics of the rangeland vegetation of this region from the satellite spectral signals was confounded by these differences in solar zenith angle across this strong latitudinal gradient. With the assistance of a resident mathematician (Dr. John Schell), they studied solutions to this dilemma and subsequently developed the ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum as a means to adjust for or “normalize” the effects of the solar zenith angle. Originally, they called this ratio the “Vegetation Index” (and another variant, the square-root transformation of the difference-sum ratio, the “Transformed Vegetation Index”); but as several other remote sensing researchers were identifying the simple red/infrared ratio and other spectral ratios as the “vegetation index,” they eventually began to identify the difference/sum ratio formulation as the normalized difference vegetation index. The earliest reported use of NDVI in the Great Plains study was in 1973 by Rouse et al. (Dr. John Rouse was the Director of the Remote Sensing Center of Texas A&M University where the Great Plains study was conducted). However, they were preceded in formulating a normalized difference spectral index by Kriegler et al. in 1969. Soon after the launch of ERTS-1 (Landsat-1), Compton Tucker of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center produced a series of early scientific journal articles describing uses of the NDVI.\n\nThus, NDVI was one of the most successful of many attempts to simply and quickly identify vegetated areas and their \"condition,\" and it remains the most well-known and used index to detect live green plant canopies in multispectral remote sensing data. Once the feasibility to detect vegetation had been demonstrated, users tended to also use the NDVI to quantify the photosynthetic capacity of plant canopies. This, however, can be a rather more complex undertaking if not done properly, as is discussed below.\n\nLive green plants absorb solar radiation in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region, which they use as a source of energy in the process of photosynthesis. Leaf cells have also evolved to re-emit solar radiation in the near-infrared spectral region (which carries approximately half of the total incoming solar energy), because the photon energy at wavelengths longer than about 700 nanometers is too large to synthesize organic molecules. A strong absorption at these wavelengths would only result in overheating the plant and possibly damaging the tissues. Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared. By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near-infrared.\nThe pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7 µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1 µm). The more leaves a plant has, the more these wavelengths of light are affected, respectively.\nSince early instruments of Earth Observation, such as NASA's ERTS and NOAA's AVHRR, acquired data in visible and near-infrared, it was natural to exploit the strong differences in plant reflectance to determine their spatial distribution in these satellite images.\n\nThe NDVI is calculated from these individual measurements as follows:\n\nwhere red and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red (visible) and near-infrared regions, respectively. These spectral reflectances are themselves ratios of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band individually, hence they take on values between 0.0 and 1.0. By design, the NDVI itself thus varies between -1.0 and +1.0. It should be noted that NDVI is functionally, but not linearly, equivalent to the simple infrared/red ratio (NIR/VIS). The advantage of NDVI over a simple infrared/red ratio is therefore generally limited to any possible linearity of its functional relationship with vegetation properties (e.g. biomass). The simple ratio (unlike NDVI) is always positive, which may have practical advantages, but it also has a mathematically infinite range (0 to infinity), which can be a practical disadvantage as compared to NDVI. Also in this regard, note that the VIS term in the numerator of NDVI only scales the result, thereby creating negative values. NDVI is functionally \"and linearly\" equivalent to the ratio NIR / (NIR+VIS), which ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus never negative nor limitless in range. But the most important concept in the understanding of the NDVI algebraic formula is that, despite its name, it is a transformation of a spectral ratio (NIR/VIS), and it has no functional relationship to a spectral difference (NIR-VIS).\n\nIn general, if there is much more reflected radiation in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible wavelengths, then the vegetation in that pixel is likely to be dense and may contain some type of forest. Subsequent work has shown that the NDVI is directly related to the photosynthetic capacity and hence energy absorption of plant canopies. Although the index admits to go from -1 to 1, even in more densely populated urban areas the value of normal NDVI is positive, although closer to zero. Negative values are more likely to be disturbed in the atmosphere and some specific materials.\n\nIt can be seen from its mathematical definition that the NDVI of an area containing a dense vegetation canopy will tend to positive values (say 0.3 to 0.8) while clouds and snow fields will be characterized by negative values of this index. Other targets on Earth visible from space include\n\n\nIn addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its capacity to broadly distinguish vegetated areas from other surface types, the NDVI also has the advantage of compressing the size of the data to be manipulated by a factor 2 (or more), since it replaces the two spectral bands by a single new field (eventually coded on 8 bits instead of the 10 or more bits of the original data).\n\nThe NDVI has been widely used in applications for which it was not originally designed. Using the NDVI for quantitative assessments (as opposed to qualitative surveys as indicated above) raises a number of issues that may seriously limit the actual usefulness of this index if they are not properly addressed. The following subsections review some of these issues.\n\n\nAlso, the calculation of the NDVI value turns out to be sensitive to a number of perturbing factors including\n\n\nFor these reasons, the NDVI should be used with great caution. In any quantitative application that necessitates a given level of accuracy, all the perturbing factors that could result in errors or uncertainties of that order of magnitude should be explicitly taken into account; this may require extensive processing based on ancillary data and other sources of information. More recent versions of NDVI datasets have attempted to account for these complicating factors through processing.\n\nA number of derivatives and alternatives to NDVI have been proposed in the scientific literature to address these limitations, including the Perpendicular Vegetation Index, the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index and the Global Environment Monitoring Index. Each of these attempted to include intrinsic correction(s) for one or more perturbing factors. It is not until the mid-1990s, however, that a new generation of algorithms were proposed to estimate directly the biogeophysical variables of interest (e.g., the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation or FAPAR), taking advantage of the enhanced performance and characteristics of modern sensors (in particular their multispectral and multiangular capabilities) to take all the perturbing factors into account. In spite of many possible perturbing factors upon the NDVI, it remains a valuable quantitative vegetation monitoring tool when the photosynthetic capacity of the land surface needs to be studied at the appropriate spatial scale for various phenomena.\n\n\n\n"}

The capture by the English is the subject of Auguste Rodin's 1889 sculpture \"The Burghers of Calais\". In 1558, the expanding Kingdom of France took the Pale of Calais in the aftermath of the Siege of Calais.\n\nThe region was represented in the Parliament of England by two members sitting for the Calais constituency.\n\nCalais fell after the Battle of Crécy in 1346 to Edward III of England following a desperate siege. Its seizure gave him a defensible outpost where his army could regroup, and the city's position on the English Channel meant that, once it was taken, it could be resupplied easily by sea. Its retention was confirmed under the Treaty of Brétigny, signed on 8 May 1360, when Edward renounced the throne of France, in return for substantial lands in France, namely Aquitaine and the area around Calais. By 1453, at the end of the Hundred Years' War, it was the only part of mainland France to remain in English hands. It was used as a base for English expeditions operating against France such as in 1492 when Henry VII oversaw an attempt to capture Boulogne.\n\nWhile it was possible to resupply and defend Calais easily by sea, in the absence of any natural defence it depended on fortifications built up and maintained at some expense. However, its main defence had been that both the French and the Burgundians coveted the city, but each preferred to see it under the English rather than their rival. Changing political circumstances with the division of Burgundian interests in the Low Countries between France and Spain meant that, in 1550 when England surrendered the area around Boulogne, which Henry VIII had taken in 1544, the approaches to Calais were opened.\n\nThe Pale of Calais remained controlled by England until lost by Mary I to France in 1558 when, following secret preparations, 30,000 French troops, led by Francis, Duke of Guise, took the town of Calais. Its loss was recognised under the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559). In England there was shock and disbelief at the loss of this final Continental territory. The chronicler Raphael Holinshead reported that a few months later Mary, on her death bed, told her family: \"When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Calais' lying in my heart\". However the loss of the Pale of Calais was not as severe on the English economy as might have been expected, as by this time England was focusing its trade on the Netherlands.\n\nDuring the English rule, the people of the Pale of Calais retained their identity as French and Flemish speakers.\n\nThe area of the Pale of Calais comprised the communes of Andres, Balinghem, Bonningues-lès-Calais, Calais, Campagne-lès-Guines, Coquelles, Coulogne, Fréthun, Guemps, Guînes, Hames-Boucres, Hervelinghen, Marck, Nielles-lès-Calais, Nouvelle-Église, Offekerque, Oye-Plage, Peuplingues, Pihen-lès-Guînes, Sangatte, Saint-Pierre (Calais absorbed Saint-Pierre-lès-Calais inhabited with inhabitants in 1885, now southern part of Calais), Saint-Tricat, and Vieille-Église.\n\nThe area of the Pale of Calais is difficult to define because the boundaries were not clearly defined, due to swampy land and artificial waterways, and were constantly changing, but extended from Gravelines almost to Wissant and covered about . Furthermore, the French were continually reclaiming small pieces of the territory, particularly in the southwest.\n\nMuch of the area of the Pale consisted of wetlands, and the territory was roughly divided into highlands in the west and lower country in the east.\n\n"}

Originally developed as an ICBM site for the R-7 missile, it also served for numerous satellite launches using the R-7 and other rockets. Its high latitude makes it useful only for certain types of launches, especially the Molniya orbits, so for much of the site's history it functioned as a secondary location, with most orbital launches taking place from Baikonur, in the Kazakh SSR. With the end of the Soviet Union, Baikonur became foreign territory, and Kazakhstan charged $115 million usage fees annually. Consequently, Plesetsk has seen considerably more activity since the 2000s.\n\nPlesetsk () is used especially for military satellites placed into high inclination and polar orbits since the range for falling debris is clear to the north which is largely uninhabited Arctic and polar terrain. It is situated in a region of taiga, or flat terrain with boreal pine forests.\n\nThe Soyuz rocket, Cosmos-3M, Rockot, Tsyklon, and Angara are launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The heavy Proton and Zenit rockets can only be land-launched from Baikonur (Zenit may also be launched at sea).\n\nPlesetsk Cosmodrome was originally developed by the Soviet Union as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles under the leadership and supervision of lieutenant general Galaktion Alpaidze. On 11 January 1957 the Soviet government passed the resolution about the foundation of special military object with secret name \"Angara\". This secret object had to be situated in Plesetsk District, Arkhangelsk Oblast. It was named after the town of Plesetsk. The first Soviet Combat formation of intercontinental ballistic missiles R-7 of general designer Sergei Korolev had to be located in that place, in thick northern taiga to the south of Arkhangelsk. The official birthday of the proving ground was 15 July 1957. That day Colonel Gregorjev assumed his post as the missile unit commander. By 15 July 1961, four missile complexes for R-7 ICBMs were at combat status.\n\nIn January 1963, a joint decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers created the \"Research Proving Ground missile and space weapons USSR Ministry of Defense\" near the Ilez railway station, Belsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. In the summer of 1963, the leadership of the state is decided on the use of launch facilities in Plesetsk for launching spacecraft. In September 1963 the Council of Ministers of the USSR 3rd ALM and NIIP converted to \"53 minutes Research Proving Ground.\" Three test management, employees of combat duty, tests of rocket and space complexes, holding and processing of telemetry and trajectory measurements. And from 1964 on the basis of rocket connection started the establishment of research proving ground missiles and space weapons. Such conversion were the favorable geographical location and a significant number of systems already deployed by the end of 1964 were on duty, four launchers R-7A, seven PU P-16U and three PU R-9A. Since then, the landfill has developed in two directions: rocket and space.\n17 March 1966 was the space birthday of Plesetsk. That day was the first missile launching of the rocket booster Vostok with space vehicle Cosmos 112. Since that time the rocket base \"Angara\" has become cosmodrome Plesetsk. Construction started in 1957 and it was declared operational for R-7 rockets in December 1959. The urban-type settlement of Plesetsk in Arkhangelsk Oblast had a railway station, essential for the transport of missile components. A new town for the support of the facility was named Mirny, Russian for \"peaceful\". By 1997, more than 1,500 launches to space had been made from the site, more than for any other launch facility, although the usage has declined significantly since the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nBecause Plesetsk was used primarily for military launches, especially Zenit photoreconnaissance satellites, which were launched in large numbers during the 1970s-80s, the USSR did not admit to its existence, but it was discovered by British physics teacher Geoffrey Perry and his students at Kettering Grammar School, who carefully analyzed the orbit of the Cosmos 112 satellite in 1966 and deduced it had not been launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Meteor 1-2 satellite launch from Plesetsk on 6 October 1969 was one of the earliest launches observed and photographed from Finland. After the end of the Cold War it was learned that the CIA had begun to suspect the existence of an ICBM launch site at Plesetsk in the late 1950s. The Soviet Union did not officially admit the existence of Plesetsk Cosmodrome until 1983.\n\nThe use of the cosmodrome will likely increase in the future since there are concerns with security in operating the Baikonur Cosmodrome in now-independent Kazakhstan, which also demands rent for its continued use. Plesetsk is not ideally suited for low inclination or geostationary launches because of its high latitude of 62 degrees north (as compared to the Guiana Space Centre at 5° north or the Kennedy Space Center at 28° 31′ north). In addition, the high latitude means that lift capacity for boosters launched from Plesetsk is slightly lower than Baikonur launches. By the 2000s, Russia had completely phased out military launches from Baikonur.\n\nThe new all-Russian Angara rocket was designed to be launched primarily from Plesetsk (and also eventually from the Vostochny Cosmodrome).\n\nIn May 2007, a new ICBM, called the RS-24 has been tested and launched there, and is seen as eventually replacing the aging RS-18/UR-100Ns (SS-19 Stiletto) and RS-20/R-36Ms (SS-18 Satan) that are the backbone of Russia's missile forces.\n\nIn September 2011, Space Forces spokesman Colonel Alexei Zolotukhin said Russia will spend over 5 billion rubles ($170m) on the development and expansion of the cosmodrome in 2011. This includes the reconstruction of a local motorway and modernizing the energy supply system. New facilities will be built, including a dormitory and hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17837335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17837335", "title": "Position resection", "text": "Position resection\n\nResection is a method for determining an unknown position (position finding) measuring angles with respect to known positions. Measurements can be made with a compass and topographic map (or nautical chart), Theodolite or with a total station using known points of a Geodetic network or landmarks of a map.\n\nResection and its related method, \"intersection\", are used in surveying as well as in general land navigation (including inshore marine navigation using shore-based landmarks). Both methods involve taking azimuths or bearings to two or more objects, then drawing \"lines of position\" along those recorded bearings or azimuths.\n\nWhen intersecting lines of position are used to fix the position of an unmapped feature or point by fixing its position relative to two (or more) mapped or known points, the method is known as \"intersection\". At each known point (hill, lighthouse, etc.), the navigator measures the bearing to the same unmapped target, drawing a line on the map from each known position to the target. The target is located where the lines intersect on the map. In earlier times, the \"intersection\" method was used by forest agencies and others using specialized alidades to plot the (unknown) location of an observed forest fire from two or more mapped (known) locations, such as forest fire observer towers.\n\nThe reverse of the \"intersection\" technique is appropriately termed \"resection\". Resection simply reverses the intersection process by using \"crossed back bearings\", where the navigator's position is the unknown. Two or more bearings to mapped, known points are taken; their resultant lines of position drawn from those points to where they intersect will reveal the navigator's location.\n\nWhen resecting or fixing a position, the geometric strength (angular disparity) of the mapped points affects the precision and accuracy of the outcome. Accuracy increases as the angle between the two position lines approaches 90 degrees. Magnetic bearings are observed on the ground from the point under location to two or more features shown on a map of the area. Lines of reverse bearings, or \"lines of position\", are then drawn on the map from the known features; two and more lines provide the resection point (the navigator's location). When three or more lines of position are utilized, the method is often popularly (though erroneously) referred to as triangulation (in precise terms, using three or more lines of position is still correctly called \"resection\", as angular law of tangents (cot) calculations are not performed). When using a map and compass to perform resection, it is important to allow for the difference between the magnetic bearings observed and grid north (or true north) bearings (magnetic declination) of the map or chart.\n\nResection continues to be employed in land and inshore navigation today, as it is a simple and quick method requiring only an inexpensive magnetic compass and map/chart.\n\nIn surveying work, the most common methods of computing the coordinates of a point by (angular) resection are Cassini's Method and the Tienstra formula, though the first known solution was given by Willebrord Snellius (see Snellius–Pothenot problem). For the type of precision work involved in surveying, the unmapped point is located by measuring the angles subtended by lines of sight from it to a minimum of three mapped (coordinated) points. In geodetic operations the observations are adjusted for spherical excess and projection variations. Precise angular measurements between lines from the point under location using theodolites provides more accurate results, with trig beacons erected on high points and hills to enable quick and unambiguous sights to known points.\nWhen planning to perform a resection, the surveyor must first plot the locations of the known points along with the approximate unknown point of observation. If all points, including the unknown point, lie close to a circle that can be placed on all four points, then there is no solution or the high risk of an erroneous solution. This is known as observing on the \"danger circle\". The poor solution stems from the property of a chord subtending equal angles to any other point on the circle.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47255029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47255029", "title": "Wutach Gorge", "text": "Wutach Gorge\n\nThe Wutach Gorge () is a narrow, steep-sided valley in southern Germany through in the upper reaches of the River Wutach with three gorge-like sections, the lowest of which is also called the \"Wutachflühen\". The gorge cuts through the southern part of the Baar region from the eastern side of the High Black Forest heading eastwards to the \"Trauf\" the steep, northwestern flank of the Swabian Jura, which transitions to the Randen mountains here.\n\nThe 60- to 170-metre-deep gorges stretch for over 33 river kilometres (excluding side gorges) and are notable for many reasons. Their geologically young, prototypical and actively continuing development results in a great variety of geotopes and biotopes that support a correspondingly rich range of flora and fauna. The gorges are very popular with tourists and played an important role in the establishment of conservation consciousness in southwestern Germany. The Wutach Gorge is part of the Southern Black Forest Nature Park.\n\nThe ravines start in the valley of the \"Gutach\" (the upper reaches of the Wutach) below Neustadt and in the valley of the \"Haslach\" below Lenzkirch. After they merge to form the \"Wutach\" they run, with small changes of direction, initially generally eastward and end at the village of Grimmelshofen in the municipality of Stühlingen after the Wutach turns sharply southwards in the area of the former mining town of Blumberg on meeting the steep slopes of the \"Baaralb\". Initially, the gorge is bordered by the wooded plateaus of the eastern slopes of the Black Forest. Later, its northern border is formed by the historical \"Bertholdsbaar\" with the population centre of Löffingen and the village of Rötenbach. To the south is a similar muschelkalk plateau with the settlements of Bonndorf and Wutach.\n\nOver a straight-line distance of barely 20 kilometres, the Wutach and several of its tributaries have cut a natural profile section through almost all of the strata of South German Scarplands, which fan out a further 200 kilometres to the north, but surface here in close succession. The Mesozoic rock layers were clearly inclined more steeply than usual here (on average 7%) by the uplifting of the southern Black Forest and have been cut through here in succession by the Wutach. Because the Wutach \"only\" descends through a gradient of around 1% as it flows eastward, increasingly younger rocks are encountered, each overlaid over its predecessor, as one progresses down the gorge. This has created a continuous sequence of rock outcrops from the basement (here mostly granite) through the Triassic to the Jurassic. As these rocks each produce their own peculiar and very different landforms when they are cut by vertical erosion, one of the most diversified and most interesting gorge landscapes in Central Europe has resulted. The gorges often transition seamlessly into wide valleys where it is hard to imagine that steep ravines are so nearby.\n\nNot only do the gorges themselves form their own natural regions, but the plateaux across which they cut have also been given the status of independent natural regional units. So the Central Wutach Region (\"Mittlere Wutachgebiet\") lies between the natural regions of the Baar to the north and the Klettgau Hills (\"Klettgauer Hügelland\") to the south, both of which are similar in terms of their bedrock. The region is also a bridge between the mountains of the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura.\n\nAt the exit of the wide bottomed valleys of the Gutach and the Haslach from the eastern Black Forest, which were heavily shaped by the ice age, the streams often cut through narrow gorges as the gradient increases suddenly. In the granite that initially dominates, dark, trackless ravines alternate with short sections where the valley broadens out. The rocky sides of the valley also have naturally high proportion of conifers. Downstream, in the area of the less resistant beds of bunter sandstone, spectacular gorge scenery is absent. The side gorges of this upper section of the main gorge are narrow; several would be impassible without man-made paths being laid through them.\n\nThe gorge of the main headstream, the Gutach, begins with a noticeably increased gradient just above the Gutach Bridge (built 1900) on the Höllental Railway, whose stone arches support a span of 64 metres, then the longest in Germany. The deepest point of the Haslach Gorge, which joins from the right, is the \"Rechenfelsen\", a short ravine that is a good 20 metres deep. The Rötenbach Gorge, which merges from the left soon thereafter, culminates in a waterfall with two cascades and a total height of 6 metres. Below the few remains of Stallegg Castle the Wutach is quietened by a small reservoir belonging to the Stallegg Electricity Works and built in 1895. Shortly afterwards the stream passes the covered, wooden Stallegg Bridge, on the old path between the Fürstenberg estates on either side of the gorge. At point where it is joined by the Reichenbach Gorge the river forces itself through the granite \"schrofen\" of the trackless Stallegg Gorge (\"Stallegger Schlucht\"). It ends at the \"Räuberschlössle\" rocks with their ruined castle, the New Blumberg (also \"New Blumegg\"). The rocks lie north of the Wutach and are quartz porphyry formation up to 80 metres high that are also called the \"Nägelefels\" due to the presence of Cheddar Pinks. Near the mill of Schattenmühle and the road crossing the Lotenbach Gorge (\"Lotenbachklamm\") joins from the right, a granite gorge with four waterfalls up to 8 metres high, as well as a tributary stream that plunges 20 metres into the river.\n\nAs the river enters the Lower and Middle Muschelkalk rock, the typical Black Forest landscape ends. The limestones, which have been heavily deformed and made slippery by the leaching of gypsum deposits, have given rise to a slightly wider V-shaped valley with a great diversity of habitats and constantly changing local relief. For example, extensive tufa formations rise above the footpath on the sunny slopes of the \"Schelmenhalde\" with its wide, plunging waterfall, whilst, opposite, a Muschelkalk formation called the \"Drei Zinnen\" (\"Three Battlements\"), which was once perforated by cavities and has now collapsed, slips downstream on slippery masses of Middle Muschelkalk towards the Wutach. Deciduous forest communities now dominate, although occasional meadows interrupt the riparian woodland.\n\nFurther down the valley, initially on the upper slopes, elongated rock faces made of Upper Muschelkalk strata are typical, especially the roughly one-kilometre-long \"Rappenfelsen\" on the left above the subsiding subsoil. This is where the \"Gaisloch\", which has collapsed to create an open gorge, joins the main valley. Below it, the oldest and very steep gorge crossing led over the river by the former mill at the Dietfurt; there was a bridge in here in 1614-1632. The centre of the valley was the historic \"Badhof\" near the Fritz Hockenjos Footbridge; an avenue and the remains of the park have survived.. On a rocky spur above it, New Tannegg Castle (built by about 1200) had to be abandoned before 1500, because it had partially collapsed down the precipitous cliff. Immediately below the Boller Waterfall cascades for 40 metres in two stages into the Wutach from the right. This is the highest waterfall in the Wutach Gorge and was, when Bad Boll was still a spa resort, lit up at night. Today it is almost impossible to get to. At the \"Felsenweiher\", an old backwater below a rock face of the Upper Muschelkalk, the Tannegg Waterfall (named after the ruins of Old Tannegg Castle) tumbles 15 metres over a bizarre tufa formation. Roughly opposite is the \"Münzloch\", the longest cave of the Wutach Gorge, 84 metres in length.\n\nFurther downstream, as soon as the Muschelkalk rock faces reach the valley bottom, the canyon-like second gorge section begins. It was the earliest part of the gorge to be developed and remains the most interesting part of the gorge for tourists today. Here the Wutach swings from one rock face to another on its broad gravel bed, sometimes undercutting the rock, which is left overhanging and is up to about 80 metres high.\n\nThe Ludwig Neumann Way (\"Ludwig-Neumann-Weg\") is one of the most elaborate trail systems maintained by the Black Forest Club and, after almost all the bridges in the original network were destroyed by floods, is exposed but protected by the rock faces. At the very beginning it crosses the \"Amselfels\" rock, nearly 70 metres high, with views of the \"Großer Kanzelfels\" (\"Great Pulpit Rock\") to the north. Parts of its right-hand pulpit collapsed in 1983 about 80 metres into the Wutach. The following long, partly overhanging, rock refuge, \"Engländerfels\" was named in memory of an Englishman who fell to his death here in 1906. The \"Forellenfelsen\" also recalls the early English fashion of travelling to the Black Forest for \"fishing holidays\" in the Wutach Gorge. The central rest stop in the middle gorge is in a spot where the valley widens and is called the Schurhammer Hut. In the following section, the Wutach sinks largely into crevices in the muschelkalk rocks and re-emerges after 1.3 kilometres at the foot of an overhanging section of the rock face. In 1953, the cavern-like Old Wutach portal by the old \"Rümmelesteg\" footbridge collapsed; leaving half the suspension bridge anchored to the rock. The \"Josefsfelsen\" rocks with their crowning rock pinnacle and the \"Josefssteg\" footbridge commemorate another victim of a fall in 1907. The end of the middle gorge is marked by the covered Canadian Bridge (\"Kanadiersteg\"), which was built in 1976 by Canadian engineers. It runs from mouth of the Gauchach to the high mountain spur on the southern side with its old spur castle, the Hörnle.\n\nAfter the Gauchach Gorge joins the main artery from the north, the valley widens again and is open, accessible and populated. At the first road bridge is the \"Wutachmühle\" with its sawmill and kiosk. The almost undeveloped valley sides with their rugged, sometimes bizarre relief, leave one to conjecture at the almost continual slip and creep processes of the few remaining solid formations of Keuper rock. Four of the nine villages that once existed in this so-called \"Achdorfer Tal\" (Achdorf Valley ) have fallen victim to the unstable subsoil and been abandoned. Clearly visible are three large landslides: the Eschach Slip (\"Eschacher Bergsturz\") on the eastern precipice of the \"Scheffheu\" (1880, 1940 and 1966), the 1966 landslide at Eichberg with its resulting waterfall and the 1976 landslide on repeatedly closed \"Wellblechsträßle\" at the foot of the \"Buchberg\". The larger villages of Aselfingen and Achdorf lie at the mouths of the Aubach valley (with its Mundelfingen Waterfall and ruins of \"Hardegg\") and Krottenbach valley. To the east, prominent mountain landforms of the \"Eichberg\" (913.6 metres) and the \"Buchberg\" (879.9 metres) tower above the valley; between them the upper Aitrach valley ends 170 metres above the Wutach valley seemingly in mid-air, forming the Blumberg Gate (\"Blumberger Pforte\"). Below the former castle of Blumberg the Schleifebach Falls cascade into the valley (4, 9 and 5 metres high).\n\nAfter turning sharply at the prominent Wutach Knee (\"Wutachknie\") the Wutach crosses and important fault line, south of which the Upper Muschelkalk, which descends deeply, accompanies the upper valley slopes once more in the form of rock faces. In this third gorge, the \"Flühen\" (Alemannic: rock faces), the dimensions of the gorge and its rock faces reach their greatest extent. Here lies the heavily fissured Swabian Jura with its highest precipice, the \"Walenhalde\"(350 m). The \"Flühen\" are, however, exhibit less variety and were did not become a tourist attraction until the opening of the Wutach Valley Railway, which crosses over them.\n\nThe narrow valley begins with the little Letterngraben Waterfall on the right hand side of the valley and with waterfalls in the \"Sackpfeiferdobel\" and \"Sturzdobel\" (15 metres, tufa crags) on the left hand side. The actual \"Wutachflühen\" are a 3-kilometre-long, up to 85-metre-high rock wall in the left hand side; it is the greatest outcropping of the Upper Muschelkalk in Germany. Rock pinnacles such as the \"Lunzistein\" (also \"Brautfluh\", about 15 metres high) or the \"Mannheimer Felsen\" break out of the jagged rocks. Opposite, on a free-standing, 30-metre-high rock plateau, are the ruins of Blumegg Castle. The counterpart of the Gutach Bridge at the start of the Lower Gorge is the viaduct of the Wutach Valley Railway, which marks the lower end of the Wutach gorges.\n\nThe most important side gorge, the Gauchach Gorge, which contains the Gauchach stream, is characterised by its narrowness and its cascade-like stream bed formed in the beds of the Upper Muschelkalk. Roughly in the middle of the gorge it is joined near the old mill of \"Bergmühle\" by the rather straight, rugged ravine known as the \"Engeschlucht\" through which the \"Tränkebach\" stream runs. Together with the Gauchach and Wutach Gorge it forms the Bachheim Gorge Rectangle (\"Bachheimer Schluchtenviereck\"). Here, too, at low water it drains away underground to the Wutach.\n\nAfter the valley broadens out below the Gauchach Viaduct (which carries the Bundesstraße 31) the first narrow section begins near the restored and functional mill of \"Guggenmühle\". The actual gorge begins near the castle ruins of the \"Grünburg\" (wall remains measuring 15 x 12 m) and the \"Lochmühle\" mill, which was destroyed in a flood. Opposite stands the \"Grünburg Chapel\" with a votive picture of a flood in 1804 and again in 1895. Below the ruins of the \"Neuenburg\", which is barely recognisable following a landslip, the \"Burgmühle\" Hiking Hostel run by the Friends of Nature acts as a tourist base. In the lowest part of the gorge an educational path leads past impressive tufas and communities of giant horsetail.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55849584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55849584", "title": "Yang Shoujing", "text": "Yang Shoujing\n\nYang Shoujing (; 1839 – 9 January 1915) was a late-Qing dynasty historical geographer, calligrapher, antiquarian, bibliophile, and diplomat. He is best known for the historical atlas of China \"Lidai yudi tu\", commonly called the \"Yangtu\" (\"Yang's atlas\"), the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. He devoted most of his life to the annotation of the 6th-century geographic work \"Shui jing zhu\", which was completed by his disciple Xiong Huizhen and published as the \"Shui jing zhu shu\".\n\nAs a Qing diplomat posted in Japan, Yang purchased tens of thousands of ancient Chinese books from Japanese libraries and archives, many of which had become rare or lost in China. After his death, the government of the Republic of China purchased his collection and preserved most of the books in the National Palace Museum.\n\nYang was an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School and became highly influential in Japan. The introduction of his art was said to have \"offered virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style\" to Japan and \"revolutionized\" Japanese calligraphy. Yang's former residence and tomb in Yidu, Hubei are now protected as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China.\n\nYang was born in 1839, during the Qing dynasty, in Lucheng Town, Yidu County, Hubei Province. His courtesy name was Xingwu (惺吾). After passing the provincial examination and earning the \"juren\" degree in 1862 (first year of the Tongzhi reign), he lived for ten years in Beijing trying to pass the imperial examination for the highest \"jinshi\" degree, without success. Although he failed the examinations, he became friends with the prominent officials Pan Zuyin and Zhang Zhidong, who shared his passion for antiques. He attended Pan's lavish parties and shopped for antiques in Beijing's Liulichang with Zhang.\n\nFrom a young age Yang was interested in geography, and spent much of his life annotating Li Daoyuan's 6th-century work \"Commentary on the Water Classic\" (\"Shui Jing Zhu\"). His knowledge in geography earned him a diplomatic post to Japan, despite his repeated examination failure. In Tokyo he worked under the career diplomat Li Shuchang, an abrasive superior who nevertheless appreciated Yang's knowledge in antiques. As Japan was quickly westernizing during the Meiji Restoration, traditional Chinese publications fell out of fashion and were sold cheaply. Working with Li as well as Japanese antiquarians, Yang purchased tens of thousands of old Chinese books preserved in Japanese collections, many of which had become rare or even lost in China. They were later published as \"Guyi congshu\" (古逸丛书). After Yang's death, the Republic of China government purchased his collection and preserved most of his books in the National Palace Museum.\n\nYang was posted in Japan from 1880 to 1884. After returning to China, he taught at the in Wuchang and then became dean of the Qincheng School (勤成学堂), later renamed as Cungu School (存古学堂). In 1909 he served as an advisory official of the Ministry of Rites. He died in Beijing on 9 January 1915, and was buried in his hometown Yidu.\n\nYang devoted most of his lifetime to the annotation of the \"Commentary on the Water Classic\" (\"Shui jing zhu\"). He wrote 40 volumes of annotation but died before completing the work. His disciple Xiong Huizhen carried on the project and wrote another 40 volumes of annotation. It was published in the 1950s as the \"Shui jing zhu shu\" (水經註疏). The influential historian Gu Jiegang remarked that the work \"brought to a point of culmination the textual research of \"The Classic of Waterways\" of the previous three centuries.\" He greatly admired the authors' \"single-minded devotion\" to the task, and Xiong's devotion to his master.\nAnother of Yang's important works is the \"Lidai yudi tu\" (歷代輿地圖), his historical atlas of China which is often simply called the \"Yangtu\" (Yang's atlas). Yang began the work in 1866 with the assistance of Deng Yongxiu, and was joined by Rao Dunzhi in the late 1870s. They plotted historical geographical data on a Qing dynasty map, but left out non-Han Chinese kingdoms such as Nanzhao and Dali. Published between 1906 and 1911, it was the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. Based on Yang's atlas, historian Tan Qixiang compiled \"The Historical Atlas of China\", which was published in the 1980s and is considered the most authoritative atlas of Chinese history ever published.\n\nWith the encouragement of Pan Zuyin, Yang became an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School of Chinese calligraphy. When he went to Japan, he introduced the style to Japanese calligraphers, offering them \"virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style\" and revolutionizing Japanese calligraphy. He was considered a talented artist by famous Japanese calligraphers such as Miyajima Seiichiro, Kusakabe Meikaku, Iwaya Osamu, and Matsuda Sekka. and others bought hundreds of sheets of Yang's works. Yang wrote many essays on the Stele School of calligraphy, which were published by Japanese scholars in two volumes, \"Ping bei ji\" (評碑記, \"Record of stelae criticism\") and \"Ping tie ji\" (評帖記, \"Record of model-letters criticism\").\n\nIn September 1986, the government of Yidu city repaired Yang Shoujing's tomb and former residence, which was turned into the Yang Shoujing Museum. His residence and tomb are now protected as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China (designation 6-995).\n\n\n"}
