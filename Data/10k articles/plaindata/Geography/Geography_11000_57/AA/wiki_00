It was discovered on 7 March 1924, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in Heidelberg, Germany. The asteroid was named after the Greek region of Arcadia.\n\n\"Arcadia\" is a member of the Agnia family (), a very large family of stony asteroids with more than 2000 known members. They most likely formed from the breakup of a basalt object, which in turn was spawned from a larger parent body that underwent igneous differentiation. The family's parent body and namesake is the asteroid 847 Agnia.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.7–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,703 days; semi-major axis of 2.79 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in March 1924, six days after its official discovery observation.\n\nIn the SMASS classification, \"Arcadia\" is a common, stony S-type asteroid. It has been characterized as an S-type by Pan-STARRS photometric survey, as well as by SDSS-MFB (Masi Foglia Bus).\n\nIn November 2011, a fragmentary rotational lightcurve of \"Arcadia\" was obtained from photometric observations by Gordon Gartrelle at the University of North Dakota. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 17.02 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.05 magnitude (). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained.\n\nAccording to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, \"Arcadia\" measures between 10.067 and 13.02 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.150 and 0.2364. The \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link\" assumes an albedo 0.057, i.e. an albedo for a carbonaceous rather than for a stony asteroid, and consequently calculates a much larger diameter of 21.16 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.1. It may be speculated whether this anomaly is a glitch in the data base.\n\nThis minor planet was named after named after the Greek region of Arcadia in central Peloponnese. It is also a celebrated mythological region, where the shepherd god Pan lived. The official naming citation was mentioned in \"The Names of the Minor Planets\" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().\n\n"}

The type area of the surface lies in South Africa where the surface was first identified as such by Lester Charles King in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe term was coined by King for certain high surfaces in Southern Africa. Over the years he redefined it various times leaving some confusion not on its reality but on the matter of its precise meaning and extent. Burke and Gunnell redefined it as a composite surface. According to Guillocheau \"et al\". (2008) the African Surface is made up by etchplains formed between 70 and 40 million years ago. In this sense the existence of parts of the African Surface at different elevations is the result of continental-scale warping due to endogenic forces.\n\nIn Central Africa the African Surface can be found in uplifted position in several domes and elongated bulges between these domes and also in downwarped basins. The domes include the East African, Ethiopian, Cameroon and Angola. The Central African Atlantic Swell and the Central African Rise. Subdued regions include the Congo Basin where the African Surface lies about 300 m a.s.l. and the Turkana Gap. In the interior of Western Africa the so-called Bauxitic Surface has been identified as equivalent to the African Surface.\n\n\n"}

This form of ice is also called overflow, icings, or the Russian term, naled. The term was first used in 1859 by A. T. von Middendorff following his observations of the phenomenon in northern Siberia.\n\nAufeis accumulates during winter along stream and river valleys in arctic and subarctic environments. It forms by upwelling of river water behind ice dams, or by ground-water discharge. The latter mechanism prevails in high-gradient alpine streams as they freeze solid. Ground-water discharge is blocked by ice, perturbing the steady-state condition and causing a small incremental rise in the local water table until discharge occurs along the bank and over the top of the previously formed ice. Successive ice layers can lead to aufeis accumulations that are several meters thick. Aufeis typically melts out during summer and will often form in the same place year after year.\n\nSheets of aufeis may block stream channels and cause their flood plains to widen as spring floodwaters are forced to flow around the ice. Research on aufeis has to a large extent been motivated by the variety of engineering problems the ice sheets can cause (e.g. blocking drainages and causing flooding of roads). Culverts and pipelines can actually help to block flow and lead to the development of more extensive aufeis.\n\nAufeis can present an extreme danger to recreational boaters even during summer months, who can find themselves trapped between walls of ice or pulled under aufeis by the current of the river. Breaking dams of aufeis can also cause flash floods downriver. Proper scouting and precautions when choosing campsites can minimize these risks .\n\nIn late 2011, Mongolia planned to test the use and storage of artificial naleds as a way of cooling Ulan Bator in the hot Mongolian summer, and reducing the use of energy-intensive air conditioning.\n\nSheets of aufeis have been observed in Alaska, Arctic Canada, Russia, and Mongolia.\n\nAnalysis of satellite imagery from 2000-2015 has shown that the extent and duration of many Alaskan river icings has decreased.\n"}

There are 72 economic deposits of copper/cobalt and four large mining centers. Taken together, the DRC and Zambian copper belts are the second largest global reserve of copper, about 1/3 the size of the Chilean reserve.\n\nThe DRC copper belt includes some of the highest grade copper deposits in the world. In some reserves the grades are above 5%. The ore also has high grades of cobalt and may hold 34% of the world's cobalt reserves. There are large deposits that have yet to be explored using modern technology, so the size of the reserves may be understated. Demand is growing, led by China.\n\nPrehistoric mines in the Katanga belt have been found at Dikuluwe near Musonoi, Tenke-Fungurume, Kambove, Luishia, Ruashi and Etoile, and at the Naviundo and Luano archaeological sites. Monseigneur de Hemptinne watched Yeke people working at Dikuluwe as late as 1924. They worked in the dry season and stopped when the first rains arrived. The mining camp was near a stream where millet could be planted. Women and children collected malachite from the surface, while men used iron picks to excavate pits and shafts, using fire to crack the rocks when needed. The mines were between and deep with galleries up to long. The ore would be sorted and then taken to a nearby stream for concentration before being smelted.\n\nCommercial mining began in the 1920s, with a forcibly recruited workforce. The Union Minière constantly struggled to prevent recruits fleeing from the mines, sometimes taking refuge in Angola. Workers were mistreated and suffered badly from disease brought on by the working conditions. The lowest death rate at the Panda, Lubumbashi, Kisanga and Musonoi work sites in 1928 was four men per month. Today, mine worker exploitation is still prevalent and instances of slave labor, and especially child labor, are still observed in the mining industry according to the 2014 U.S. Department of Labor's \"List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor\".\n\nBetween 1970 and 1988 copper metal production was roughly constant at between 400,000 and 500,000 tonnes. Production then dropped steeply to under 50,000 tonnes annually between 1992 and 2001. Since then, production has steadily grown, reaching about 300,000 tonnes in 2008.\n\nIn 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore, an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company, were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the country (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008). In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.\n\nThe government of the DRC began to review about 60 mining contracts in 2008, and started to release their findings to the mining companies in February 2008.\nFor example, TEAL, a subsidiary of African Rainbow Minerals, was asked by letter to submit their feasibility study for their Kalumines property to identify the real contribution of each of the parties \"in order to achieve a fair attribution of shares\".\nThe letter said the feasibility study should present a planning of \"realisation of social actions with a visible impact\".\nIt also said that the state-owned Gécamines should actively participate in the daily management of the operation.\n\nIn August 2009, the DRC government revoked First Quantum Minerals' (FQM) license to operate the Kolwezi tailings project, alleging \"unreasonable behaviour\" in negotiations to change the contract.\nFirst Quantum had spent $750 million on acquiring and developing the property.\nFirst Quantum took out an action against the DRC government in the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration.\nIn May 2010 a Congolese court ruled that FQM's Lonshi and Frontier copper mines had been awarded illegally and that they should revert to state-owned Sodimico.\nAccording to FQM the ruling was due to FQM's decision to contest the expropriation of their Kolwezi project, which was later sold to the Kazakh mining company Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.\n\nMany companies are involved in different aspects of copper mining in the DRC, and the names change constantly due to start-ups, acquisitions and divestitures. The list of companies participating in the industry that follows is incomplete.\n\nGécamines (La Générale des Carrières et des Mines), is a state-owned mining company in the DRC. Its principal products are copper (which often accounted for 50% of export earnings), cobalt and zinc.\nCopper mines in which Gécamines has a major interest include Kambove, Kipushi and Kolwezi. Gécamines also owns a copper smelter at Lubumbashi and a hydrometallurgical plant at Shituru.\n\nThe Industrial Development and Mining Corporation of Zaire (Société de développement industriel et minier du Zaire - SODIMIZA)\nis an operating company for copper and its derivatives in Katanga. The company also operates cobalt and zinc. It was created in 1967 and acquired by Gécamines in 1987.\n\nThe Kababankola Mining Company (KMC) is a joint-venture between Gécamines (20%) and Tremalt (80%) with the objective of exploiting Copper and cobalt.\n\nAnvil Mining is a copper producer that has been operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2002. The company headquarters are in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nAnvil is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange.\nAs of September 2011 its major shareholder was Trafigura Beheer.\nAnvil's main asset is the Kinsevere an open pit mine and Heavy Media Separation plant\n\nMetorex, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, has assets in the DRC that include the existing Kinsenda Mine, the new Ruashi copper and cobalt mine, and the Dilala East and Lubembe deposit greenfields sites.\n\nCopper Resources Corporation is a subsidiary of Meterox.\nAs of November 2011 it held a 92.5% interest in the Hinoba-an Porphyry Copper project in the Philippines,\nand a 75% interest in Miniere de Musoshi et Kinsenda (MMK).\nMMK in turn owns the flooded Kinsenda and Musoshi copper mines in Katanga. MMK was formerly a subsidiary of Forrest Group. As of 30 November 2005 it became a subsidiary of Copper Resources Corporation.\nMMK also holds the Lubembe high-grade deposit.\n\nAfrimines Resources SPRL, based in Democratic Republic of the Congo, owns various mining resources.\nIn May 2008 Tiger Resources announced that it had secured the rights to explore several new and highly prospective tenements in Katanga in partnership with Afrimines Resources and Katanga Minerals Holdings.\nKatanga Mining produces copper and cobalt at the Kamoto Mine, which also includes the Kamoto concentrator, the Luilu metallurgical plant, the Kamoto underground mine and two oxide open pit resources in the Kolwezi district.\nA joint venture of Katanga Mining (75%) and Gécamines (25%) began mining Tilwezembe, an open-pit copper and cobalt mine, in 2007.\nAs of 2011 Katanga Mining was 74.8% owned by Glencore.\nThe Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) has a significant presence, particularly with the Mukono Mine asset, since its takeover of the Central African Mining and Exploration Company (CAMEX).\n\n\n"}

Damhus Meadow (), once a part of the lake, is located on the north side of the lake.\n\nDamhus Lake is an artificial lake which was created some time during the Middle Ages when a dam was built on Harrestrup River (Harrestrup Å). The first known reference to it is from 1561 when king Frederick II gives it to the University of Copenhagen. From 1618, the lake played a role in Copenhagen's water supply. It was then known as Langevadsdam. The name referred to the \"Lange vad\" (\"long ford\") to the south of the lake. The lake's current southern shoreline was defined in 1620–21 when an embankment was built across marshy stretch for the new Roskilde Road. The aim of the embankment was not only to protect the road against flooding but also to secure a more stable supply of water to Copenhagen by raising the water level in the lake. The water drained into St. Jørgen's Lake closter to the city through the artificial Ladegård Canal.\n\nThe Roskilde Road was a toll road until 1915, A building at the southwestern corner of the lake, Langevadsdamhuset, colloquially known as Damhuset, served as toll house. The lake gradually got its contemporary name from this toll house around 1800.\n\nIn 1849, a new embankment was constructed across the lake, separating it in two. In the 1920s and 1930s, Harestrup Å caused frequent floodings and it had also become known for its unpleasant odeur. In 1938 it was therefore decided to regulate it in connection with the city's establishment of the new public park Vigerslevparken. The stream was disconnected from the northern part of the lake, known as Bagsøen (\"The Rear Lake\"), which was drained and converted ito present-day Damhusengen (Damhus Meadow). In 1941, both lake and meadow were given status as public park. They were protected by the Conservation Authority in 1966.\n\n"}

{"id": "7080454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7080454", "title": "First wave of European colonization", "text": "First wave of European colonization\n\nThe first European colonization wave took place from the early 15th century (Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in 1415) until the early 19th-century (French invasion of Algeria in 1830), and primarily involved the European colonization of the Americas, though it also included the establishment of European colonies in India and in Maritime Southeast Asia. During this period, European interests in Africa primarily focused on the establishment of trading posts there, particularly for the African slave trade.\n\nThe time period in which much of the first wave of European colonization (and other exploratory ventures) occurred is often labeled the Age of Discovery. A later major phase of European colonization, which started in the late 19th-century and primarily focused on Africa and Asia, is known as the period of New Imperialism.\n\nReligious zeal played a large role in Spanish and Portuguese overseas activities. While the Pope himself was a political power to be heeded (as evidenced by his authority to decree whole continents open to colonization by particular kings), the Church also sent missionaries to convert the indigenous peoples of other continents to the Catholic faith. \nThus, the 1455 Papal Bull Romanus Pontifex granted the Portuguese all lands behind Cape Bojador and allowed them to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual slavery.\n\nLater, the 1481 Papal Bull \"Aeterni regis\" granted all lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal, while in May 1493 the Spanish-born Pope Alexander VI decreed in the Bull \"Inter caetera\" that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Spain while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. These arrangements were later precised with the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas.\n\nThe Dominicans and Jesuits, notably Francis Xavier in Asia, were particularly active in this endeavour. Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau and the Santisima Trinidad de Paraná in Paraguay, an example of a Jesuit Reduction.\n\nSpanish treatment of the indigenous populations provoked a fierce debate at home in 1550–51, dubbed the Valladolid debate, over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. Bartolomé de Las Casas, author of \"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies\", championed the cause of the natives, and was opposed by Sepúlveda, who claimed Amerindians were \"natural slaves\".\n\nThe School of Salamanca, which gathered theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria (1480–1546) or Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), argued in favor of the existence of natural law, which thus gave some rights to indigenous people. However, while the School of Salamanca limited Charles V's imperial powers over colonized people, they also legitimized the conquest, defining the conditions of \"Just War\". For example, these theologians admitted the existence of the right for indigenous people to reject religious conversion, which was a novelty for Western philosophical thought. However, Suárez also conceived many particular cases — a casuistry — in which conquest was legitimized. Hence, war was justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to idolatry; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity, warned Suárez, and for the advantage of the Indians. Henceforth, the School of Salamanca legitimized the conquest while at the same time limiting the absolute power of the sovereign, which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the notion of the divine right of kings.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Jesuits would become a main proponent of the Liberation theology which openly supported anti-imperialist movements. It was officially condemned in 1984 and in 1986 by then Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under charges of Marxist tendencies, while Leonardo Boff was suspended.\n\nIt was not long before the exclusivity of Iberian claims to the Americas was challenged by other European powers, primarily the Netherlands, France and England: the view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation attributed to Francis I of France demanding to be shown the clause in Adam's will excluding his authority from the New World.\n\nThis challenge initially took the form of privateering raids (such as that led by Francis Drake) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements, but later, Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as Aruba, Martinique and Barbados, that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands.\n\nWhereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via encomiendas (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was frequently bolstered by people fleeing religious persecution or intolerance (for example, the Mayflower voyage). The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat nor to spread one's faith but to start afresh in a new society, where life would be hard but one would be free to exercise one's religious beliefs. The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, and after a series of wars with the Dutch and the French the English overseas possessions came to dominate the east coast of North America, an area stretching from Virginia northwards to New England and Newfoundland, although during the 17th century an even greater number of English emigrants settled in the West Indies.\n\nHowever, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and cotton grown in Virginia and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil. Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting humans across the Atlantic on a massive scale – historians estimate that the Atlantic slave trade brought between 10 and 12 million individuals to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it.\n\nThe January 27, 1512 \"Leyes de Burgos\" codified the government of the indigenous people of the New World, since the common law of Spain wasn't applied in these recently discovered territories. The scope of the laws were originally restricted to the island of Hispaniola, but were later extended to Puerto Rico and Jamaica. They authorized and legalized the colonial practice of creating \"encomiendas\", where Indians were grouped together to work under colonial masters, limiting the size of these establishments to a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 150 people. The document finally prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the \"encomenderos\", reserving it for officials established in each town for the implementation of the laws. It also ordered that the Indians be catechesized, outlawed bigamy, and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish. It respected, in some ways, the traditional authorities, granting chiefs exemptions from ordinary jobs and granting them various Indians as servants. The poor fulfilment of the laws in many cases lead to inummerable protests and claims. In fact, the laws were so often poorly applied that they were seen as simply a legalization of the previous poor situation. This would create momentum for reform, carried out through the \"Leyes Nuevas\" (\"New Laws\") in 1542. Ten years later, Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas would publish \"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies\", in the midst of the Valladolid Controversy, a debate about the existence or not of souls in Amerindians bodies. Las Casas, bishop of Chiapas, was opposed to Sepúlveda, who claimed Amerindians were \"natural slaves\"...\n\nIn the French empire, slave trade and other colonial rules were regulated by Louis XIV's 1689 \"Code Noir\".\n\nFrom its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture. Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special convoys), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade monopolies to joint-stock companies such as the East India Companies and the Hudson's Bay Company. The Massachusetts Bay Company, founded in 1628/9, swiftly established a form of self-governance following the Cambridge Agreement of August 1629, whereby subsequent meetings of the board of governors took place in Massachusetts itself.\n\nIn 1498, the Portuguese arrived in Goa. Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the Dutch, British, French, Danish among others. The fractured debilitated kingdoms of India were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I accorded a charter, forming the East India Company to trade with India and eastern Asia. The British landed in India in Surat in 1624. By the 19th century, they had assumed direct and indirect control over most of India.\n\nThe arrival of the \"conquistadores\" caused the annihilation of most of the Amerindians. However, contemporary historians now generally reject the Black Legend according to which the brutality of the European colonists accounted for most of the deaths. It is now generally believed that diseases, such as the smallpox, brought upon by the Columbian Exchange, were the greatest destroyer, although the brutality of the conquest itself isn't contested. Genocidal policies were more common in post-colonial states, notably in 19th century United States and Argentina where indigenous populations were systematically exterminated. For example, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Argentinian \"caudillo\" from 1829 to 1852, openly pursued the extermination of the local population, an event related by Darwin in \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" (1839). He was then followed by the \"Conquest of the Desert\" in the 1870–80s. The result was the death of a lot of the mapuche and arauccan population in the Patagonia. After the Amerindians' quasi-total disparition, the mines and the sugar cane plantations thus led to the booming of the Atlantic slave trade, especially apparent in the Caribbean where the largest ethnic group is of African descent.\n\nContemporary historians debate the legitimacy of calling the quasi-disparition of the Amerindians a \"genocide\". Estimates of pre-Columbian population have ranged from a low of 8.4 million to a high of 112.5 million persons; in 1976, geographer William Denevan derived a \"consensus count\" of about 54 million people. \n\nDavid Stannard has argued that \"The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world\", with almost 100 million Amerindians killed in what he calls the \"American Holocaust\". Like Ward Churchill, he believes that the American natives were deliberately and systematically exterminated over the course of several centuries, and that the process continues to the present day.\n\nStannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been disputed because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease. In response, political scientist R. J. Rummel has instead estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls \"democide.\" \"Even if these figures are remotely true\", writes Rummel, \"then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history.\" \n\nSpain and Portugal sought the utilization of foreign and indigenous peoples during post colonial contact with the New World. The Portuguese and Spanish use of slavery in Latin America was seen as a lucrative business which ultimately led to internal and external development in gaining economic influence at any cost. The economic pursuits of the Spanish and Portuguese empires ushered in the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Portugal shifted its attention to the latter economic endeavor. Their ships sailed from the borders of the Sahara desert to the entirety of the West African coast. At the outset of the Atlantic Slave Trade, Manuel Bautista Pérez, a notable Portuguese slave trader, gives insight to the amount and treatment of the African slaves. Pérez and his men conducted slave trading in which thousands of African peoples were bought from local tribal leaders and transported across the Atlantic to South America. In contrast from popular belief, Portuguese slave traders did not acquire slaves in a forceful manner. According to documents written by Manuel Pérez, slaves were only made available by certain conditions. The most notable condition was bartering “items that the leaders wanted and were interested in”. Items such as bread, coal, precious stones, and firearms were provided in exchange for slaves. Furthermore, local tribal leaders did not simply give up their own people for the aforementioned commodities but rather through intertribal wars, debts, and civil crime offenders.\n\nLabor in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies became scarce. European diseases and forced labor began killing the indigenous people in insurmountable numbers. Therefore, slaves were seen only as a business venture due to the labor shortages. These slaves were forced to work in jobs such as agriculture and mining. According to David Eltis, areas controlled by the Spanish such as Mexico, Peru, and large parts of Central America used forced slave labor in \"mining activities\". In 1494 the Pope ushered in the Treaty of Tordesillas, granting Spain and Portugal two separate parts of the world. Due to this treaty, Portugal had the monopoly on acquiring the slaves from Africa. However, Spain, like Portugal, needed the labor force to pursue their personal economic gains. This gave Portugal an increased revenue stream. African slaves were sold to the Spanish colonies through an internal reform known as the \"asiento\"; which gave the right, by the Spanish Crown, for acquiring African slaves from the Portuguese traders.\n\nIn terms of the treatment of slaves, Portuguese external policies on the acquisition of slaves depict a malicious attempt to obtaining economic wealth. Nearly 3,600 slaves a year were traded by a single trader. This latter statement illuminates that traders tried to get as many slaves as they could in the shortest amount of time. Consequently, this led to the deaths of thousands of African peoples. Newly bought slaves were kept tightly packed in highly flammable huts in order to wait for transport. Once aboard the ships many hundreds of people would once again be shoved into lower ship compartments, collectively chained up, and given little to eat. By these actions \"nearly a quarter of the slaves transported died before ever reaching the destination\". Many of them suffocated in the lower compartments as the hatches upon the deck remained closed; restricting the circulation of air. Slaves were often branded with a mark upon their skin to identify either the ship they arrived on or the company that purchased them. In addition, the slaves were seen as a \"potentially economic utility\"; therefore they were often equated to cattle when moved about. Many African people died in large numbers in order to meet the demand for Spanish and Portuguese labor requirements.\n\nBoth Spain and Portugal share a similar history in regards to the treatment of slaves in their colonies. As time progressed and new generations of slaves lived under imperial rule, Spanish and Portuguese internal reforms dealt with African slaves in areas such as, \"the purchasing and selling of slaves, legal ownership, succession upon death of owner, the rights of slaves to buy their liberty, and penalties to those who ran away\". There was a constant strict social control amongst the slave population. Nevertheless, the goal was to create and sustain a labor force that would yield maximum economic output. The lucrative business the Portuguese sought on the West African coast ushered in an era in which human labor, at any cost, was used for the extraction of wealth.\n"}

The basements rocks are divided between the Chaillu Massif and North Gabon Massif. Like many other Archean cratons, the granitoid rocks are associated with potassic rocks, granite, monzonite, syenite and diorite-tonalite-granodiorite sequences. A large charnockitic body—a series of metamorphic rocks with varying chemical composition—exists in southern Gabon. Unlike other parts of Africa, Gabon lacks greenstone belt development.\n\nThe Franceville Supergroup is made up of two billion year old Paleoproterozoic rocks, located in the east-central part of the country. The Ogooue orogenic belt in west-central Gabon also dates to the Paleoproterozoic, made up of heavily deformed metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks from a fold and thrust belt. In the southwest, the Mayombe-Nyanga terrane contains high-grade Paleoproterozoic basement rocks, the Lambarene migmatite belt, as well as Doussa Supergroup metasedimentary rocks. Granites appear after the tectonic activity ended and are 1.9 billion years old. \nThe Mayombe Supergroup, within the Mayombe-Nyanga terrane, along with Franceville dolerite dykes from 970 million years ago are the only remnants of the Mesoproterozoic rocks. The Nyanga Basin and de-la-Noya in the western part of Gabon expose the Neoproterozoic West Congolian Supergroup, with deformed volcanic and sedimentary sequences, similar to others in southern Africa. A small carbonatite formation was deposited 669 million years ago in the Lambarene region.\n\nA horst from the Early Cretaceous splits the Lambarene-Chincoua basement rocks and divides the overlying western sedimentary basin in two. The eastern, interior basin is made of a mix of lacustrine and continental sedimentary rocks, while marine sediments are common in the western basin, from the Cretaceous to as recently as the Quaternary in the past 2.5 million years. \n\nGabon has the world's only site known to have self-sustaining natural nuclear fission, at the Oklo reactor zones near the town of Franceville in the Haut-Ogooué province. The site was discovered in 1972, during French mining for uranium to supply nuclear reactors. Geologists noticed an unusually low concentration of uranium-235, leading to the current theory that the site was a natural nuclear reactor two billion years ago. Although the original Oklo Mine's resources are now depleted, 17 other sites have been found in the same region that once sustained nuclear fission.\n\nHalf of the reactor zones lack carbonaceous material and in these locations, cesium, rubidium, strontium and boron escaped and were lost. However, in others uraninite is encased in solidified two billion year old bitumen. Some geologists have suggested that this natural bitumen encasement could be a way of storing human produced nuclear waste in permanent geologic disposal sites.\n\nThe petroleum sector is integral to the Gabonese economy. Oil and gas are produced from the western sedimentary basin, which extends into the Atlantic Ocean as far west as Sao Tome. Hydrocarbons formed in rift basins left over from the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Many of the oil and gas deposits are contained within salt diapirs, better known as salt dome features. The Rabi-Kounga oil field, the country's largest, was discovered onshore in 1985, 100 kilometers north of Gamba. It began producing in 1989.\nOther oil and gas fields are likely to be discovered as drilling and seismic research continues. Manganese ore is mined in lower Proterozoic deposits near Mounana in southeast Gabon. Uranium deposits were mined out of sandstones in the Franceville Basin until 1999. Diamonds are commonplace in Gabon, mainly extracted in the Makongonio area in the south as well as the Mitzic region in the north. Other resources include iron ore in the Makokou-Mekambo area, barite near Dourekiki and phosphate and niobium at Mabounie. Geologists have identified other deposits such as tantalite, zinc, lead, dolomitic limestone, talc, potash and a variety of other materials. \n"}

InstantAtlas is used by analysts, researchers, statisticians and GIS professionals. It provides tools to load data into pre-built templates, then tailor and brand the outputs, dynamic reports, to meet an almost infinite range of styles and audience capabilities. The dynamic reports utilise a range of graphical data presentation techniques to present a rich and intuitive picture of the data allowing end-users to discover patterns, trends, relationships and anomilies. The dynamic reports are examples of Rich Internet applications (RIAs). They are often described by customers as interactive atlases, area profiles, performance dashboards, and scorecards.\n\nInstantAtlas was developed by Geowise Ltd, a software company founded in 1997 and based in Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. In 2008 Geowise was acquired by ESRI Holdings Ltd. It is now managed and run independently as a sister company to ESRI (UK), which is a part of the global ESRI network.\n\nInstantAtlas Desktop is a tool for creating richly interactive dynamic reports, often termed 'atlases', for publication to a wider user audience. In many cases the dynamic reports are published on web sites to support interactive data exploration and communication. However they can also be used in standalone mode with no need for web or server connections. In this form they are ideal for supporting interactive presentations and demonstrations. The product has four components:\n(1) Publisher enables users to load their chosen geographic data and publish it in a dynamic report;\n(2) Designer and Style Editor allow users to customise and brand their dynamic reports;\n(3) Data Manager is used to store indicator-based data in Microsoft Excel or Access and publish it as an XML data file; and\n(4) Templates are pre-built styles of outputs and include Single Map, Double Map, Area Profile, Performance Analysis, and Funnel Plot.\nInstantAtlas Desktop is used by government, commercial companies and non-profits across the world for the presentation of geographic patterns and temporal trends in data in areas like public health, poverty and social deprivation, geodemographics, crime mapping, election results, performance reporting, economic monitoring, housing and education.\n\nInstantAtlas Server is a specialist, enterprise-scale web reporting solution for managing and disseminating geographically spread indicator data. Instead of storing data in files and publishing regular outputs as you would with InstantAtlas Desktop, you manage data in a standard relational database such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle Database. You can also pull data dynamically from other external information systems. InstantAtlas Server solutions can be termed Local information systems, Community Information Systems (see Community indicators), 'Neighborhood Reporting Systems' and 'Area Profiling Tools'. The product occupies a niche space between more mainstream areas of Business Intelligence and Geographic Information Systems. The two primary styles of report output are area profiles and interactive 'data views'. The product is used for a wide range of international, national, regional and local solutions globally. The technical and licensing model means it is well suited to federated web-based administration, often by a partnership of organisations, and unlimited levels of end-user access (with content access managed through user logins).\nOne of the primary drivers for customers is the need to engage better with citizens and empower communities with neighborhood level information through online channels. For example, Department of Health, New Zealand, uses it to publicly present patterns and trends in a wide range of health conditions across the country while Diabetes UK, a national charity, use it to highlight the differences in local service provision to citizens and to make their own lobbying more effective.\n\nIntegrating dynamic reports - InstantAtlas dynamic reports have been integrated into a number of third party products and solutions (examples include OLAP statistical reporting tools, performance management systems) as an effective method of enhancing data visualization and mapping capabilities. It is relatively easy to support a data feed based on the InstantAtlas XML schema.\n\nIntegration with ESRI software - InstantAtlas currently integrates with ESRI's ArcGIS product through a free toolbar add-in. InstantAtlas Server allows you to pull your geographic data dynamically from ArcGIS Server.\n\n\n"}

In the same year he started studying geography and history at the University of Vienna. His dissertation on the history of Croatian settlements in the south eastern border regions of the German-speaking lands was approved in 1937. Breu, who was a polyglot, worked at the Geography Department of the University of Vienna from 1936 to 1938. In 1939 he started teaching at the Abbey’s Secondary School at Melk, but was drafted to the Wehrmacht in the same year, where he worked for the cartographic service. After World War II Breu worked as a surveyor and private teacher, before he entered the service of the Federal Office for Metrology and Surveying at Vienna (Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen). From 1959 until 1966 he again taught at a grammar school. Already in 1959 Breu hat started collaborating with the Vienna based Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut). From 1966 until 1979, the year of his retirement, he was the head of the geographic department of that institution. After his habilitation in 1974 Breu became a docent at the Geography Department of the University of Vienna. In 1982 he became a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\nWithin the Institute for East and Southeast European Studies Breus main field of activity was the \"Atlas of the Danubian Countries\". Josef Breu was also very active in the sphere of toponomastics, especially in the standardization of geographical names. In 1969 he initiated the foundation of the Austrian Board on Geographical Names (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Kartographische Ortsnamenkunde), that functions as a clearinghouse of the main Austrian federal and provincial authorities and institutions of science and research as well as of private publishers concerned with geographical names. Breu held the chair of this board until 1982. In 1975 he published his \"Gazetteer of Austria\", edited in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations. This dictionary of geographical proper names of Austria, one of his main works, covers rivers, lakes, glaciers, mountains, passes, mountain ranges, populated places, roads, railways, waterways, etc. It gives a broad range of data with every name, such as correct spelling, pronunciation, indication of the respective topographic category, location, geographical coordinates, elevation above sea level, name of the administrative unit in which the name feature is situated, variant forms (if any) and grammatical references. From 1976 until 1982 Breu held the chair of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (Ständiger Ausschuss für Geographische Namen), a board which promotes and coordinates the standardization of toponyms in the German-speaking countries. In 1977 Josef Breu was elected Chair of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN), where he had already been active for several years before.

The same year, his family settled in Hong Kong, and he was raised there. His father died when he was four.\n\nHe began writing in the 1960s and quickly became known as a translator of foreign-language literature and for his editorial work on a number of literary publications targeted at young Chinese readers in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nAfter graduating from Hong Kong Baptist College (Now: Hong Kong Baptist University) with a bachelor's degree in English (BA in English Language and Literature), Yesi got a job first as a secondary school teacher, then as the editor of the South China Morning Post (SCMP). In 1978, he went to America for further studies. In 1984, Yesi got his PhD degree in comparative literature at the University of California, San Diego. His PhD thesis was \"Aesthetics of opposition: a study of the modernist generation of Chinese poets, 1936-1949\".\n\nYesi returned to Hong Kong after earning his doctorate. He taught at the Department of English Studies and Comparative Literature at the University of Hong Kong. In 1998 he got a position as a professor giving lectures on comparative literature in the Chinese Department at Lingnan University. Later on, he also became director of the Research Institute for the Humanities. He specialized in teaching literature and film, comparative literature, the literature of Hong Kong, modern literary criticism, and Chinese literary writing.\n\nYesi had achievements across many areas of literature, including poetry, prose, novels, drama, and literary and cultural criticism. He wrote mostly in Chinese. However, his English works were also published in the Hong Kong magazine \"Muse\" and his poetry and prose have been translated into English, French, Korean, Japanese, Arabic, Portuguese, and German.\n\nIn 2010, Yesi stated publicly that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 5 January 2013.\n\n\n\"Yesi\" is a combination of two meaningless words, both interjections, in Chinese. According to Yesi, people usually adopt a pen name that contains meanings, which would give the readers a fixed feeling or impression towards their works before they read them. Yesi wanted to break out of this, hence, he used the combination of two meaningless words, which usually appear in classical Chinese literary works, as his pen name.\n\n\"Images of Hong Kong\"\n\nThis poem embodies the spirit and concerns of Yesi's work, including tone and recurrent themes. Later, this poem would be used as an example for further analysis of Yesi's style.\nWe need a fresh angle, nothing added nothing taken away,\nAlways at the edge of things and between places.\nWrite with a different color for each voice;\nSo now, once again, they say it’s time to remodel\nand each of us finds himself looking around for –what?\nMany of Yesi's works are concerned with the way we look at the world, and also how we are perceived by other people—trying to discover new angles for observing the world, while inevitably the object of others’ perception as well. The opening sentence of “Images of Hong Kong” clearly declares: “I need a new angle”. In many of Yesi's works, the narrator wants not only to see the world, but also to look at it in a unique way, different from mainstream perceptions.\n\nHowever, Yesi's narrators are introspective and aware that they are part of what's happening. The novel \"Paper Cut-outs\" (剪紙) is composed of two story lines, each about the narrator's interaction with a female friend. The two story lines can be read as separate stories, yet, they contrast and complement each other in details and contents. Both his friends faced a catastrophe nearly at the end of the story, and the narrator says: 人與人之間的關係互相牽連，混合了我們這些其他人的感情。我們這些旁觀者一下子也牽涉其中了，我們可以指責某種偏激行為…但當不幸的事發生了，我們可以置身事外嗎?” (161)\n\nThe narrator feels sorry for what happened to his friends, and for not being able to do anything, except narrate and watch the problem grow, and turn into a catastrophe.\n\nObservation in Yesi's poems almost always associated with \"flânerie\". More precisely, the narrator is very often a \"flâneur\". Yesi writes about different places and even \"flânerie\" itself. \"Images of Hong Kong\" includes many different locations: Guangguang studio in Nathan Road, Star Ferry clock tower, Aberdeen, China Club, and so on. In the poem \"On a Road, A Wanderer\":\n\nI choose my own direction\nbig fish glide in the aquariums\nfood stalls offer whopper fishballs\nI'm not lured\nI don’t have to see so clearly\nif by chance the city glare\nblinds me\nI glance away,\nkeeping my own pace\n\nThe above describes how the narrator strolling unaffected by the surroundings. He observes and sees “big fish glide”, “food stalls”, and so on, yet uses the outer appearance of the city, to search his heart. It is notable that he “[doesn’t] have to see so clearly. Again, the narrator keeps himself different from others.\n\nThere is very often a sense of pity for the disappearing past in Yesi’s works. For example, in \"Images of Hong Kong\", the people do not paint on photos “any more”, and the “old portrait” cannot be reproduced. Like this portrait, in many of Yesi's works, we can see things that are disappearing with the past. Also, the narrator says that history is a “montage of images”, and evaluates if Hong Kong's past is only figures of famous buildings like the Star Ferry. He suggests that the past should be read with “a fresh angle\" and reviews the way to looking into the past.\n\nYesi is recognized as a Hong Kong poet, not only because he grew up in the city, but more importantly due to his concern for it. \"Images of Hong Kong\" show such concern, as the narrator wants to find a new angle to shoot Hong Kong. Moveover, Some of Yesi's other poems are about places in Hong Kong, such as \"Winter Scene from Tai Mei Tuk\", \"Reclaimed Land in Tai Kok Tsui\", and \"Midway, Quarry Bay\". Apart from the sense of place, Hong Kong serves as an important context for Yesi's novels. Again, take \"Paper Cut-outs\" as an example; the narrator's two female friends actually symbolize Hong Kong people's identity. This is also how Chinese culture and Western culture failed to understand or merge with one other in Hong Kong. For example, Qiáo (喬), a modern women, is a character showing that Hong Kong people do not understand their Chinese origin very well, but on the other hand, are not completely westernized. She cannot understand or grasp the feelings in traditional Chinese poems. Moreover, her face is so pale that it would reflect the color of her surroundings:\n\n外面廣告牌上的一大幅粉藍色填滿所有窗口，喬的臉孔染上一片粉藍。…經過一片淺黃，她的臉又泛上淺黃。\n\nThis symbolizes the cultural identity of Hong Kong, actually quite fragile. Without rooting in Chinese or Western culture, Hong Kong does not have, or has not created, any distinct culture. They are easily affected by others, and reflect others’ colors.\n\nEven in the most seemingly unlikely sphere to be associated with Hong Kong, Yesi shows his concern for the city. For him, travelling has a lot to do with home. The book \"Leung Ping Kwan (1949 – 2013), A Retrospective\" (回看.也斯), says that “[e]very foreign place he visited invoked in him even deeper thoughts about Hong Kong. He wrote copiously about his cross-border experiences, in prose and in poetry, from eastern culture to western culture, from literature and art to cultural observations, from old ideas to new concepts, posing questions that would not have been formulated if he had not left Hong Kong, and trying to portray, to a Hong Kong wallowing in old habits, new sets of emotion and knowledge in hope of a change.”\n\nIn short, Yesi's works are deeply concerned with Hong Kong, no matter what the topic or context.\n\nYesi often personified places and objects in his poems. Some of these poems include \"Central\", \"Europe After Rain\", and \"Bittermelon\". Yesi would talk gently to the personified objects, as if they were his friends. In \"Europe After Rain\", the narrator walks into a church, and talks to the place:\n\n“I shiver in the cold. You don't seem to have heard my prayer. Your four walls are mottled, the ancient stories have turned into reliefs, in the flickering light and shadow your magnificent and inevitabilities of history.”\n\nVery often, there are interactions of “I” and “you” in Yesi's works, but the latter is sometimes an object or a place.\n\nThere is a sort of double voicing in Yesi's poems, multiple layers of meaning. In the poem \"Bittermelon\": he says:\n\nYou're not worn-out or beaten-down,\nyou're just resting.\nThe loudest song's not necessarily passionate;\nthe bitterest pain stays in the heart.\nIs it because you've seen lots of false sunlight,\ntoo much thunder and lightning, hurt and hurting...\n\nThe narrator not only converses with objects and places but also to the reader. He asks “[i]s it because you've seen lots of false sunlight…too many indifferent and temperamental days” that you have stopped talking about your sufferings? The questions give us a feeling that the narrator sympathizes with us, the readers, and gently inquires as to our situations. Instead of readers reading the poem, the poem seems to read us as well.\nYour silence is much to be admired;\nyou keep the bitter taste to yourself.\nin the wind, our bittermelon, steadily facing\nworlds of confused worlds of confused bees and butterflies and a garden gone wild\n\nThe narrator seems to be talking to himself and also to the author. Yesi's narrators often try to position and view themselves in a way different from the mainstream. Above “our bittermelon” is described as “steadily facing worlds of confused bees and butterflies and a garden gone wild”. This seems to describe the narrator, or perhaps Yesi himself, trying to walk in “[his] own pace” (\"Images of Hong Kong\") without being distracted by the world, or by mainstream values. Some of Yesi's first and second person narrators do interchange with each other. In \"Paper Cut-outs\", when the narrator refers to his friend Yáo (瑤), he always uses second person narrative “you”. The book's narrative sometimes changes, and the narrator refers to readers, characters, and himself with the plural pronoun “we”. Similarly, in the above poem, in the end the bittermelon becomes “ours” at last.\n\nYesi “was the first to bring in Latin American literary icons such as Gabriel Garcìa Márquez, Pablo Neruda, Jorge Luis Borges and Mario Vargas Llosa before they were widely known”. His works are also heavily influenced by magical realism. Many critics have noted how Yesi used magical elements to interpret reality in his novels. For example, a critic analyzed magic realism in Yesi's novel “Shih-man the Dragon-keeper” (《養龍人師門》).\n\nAnother example: the description of Qiáo's room in \"Paper Cut-outs\" demonstrates features of magic realism. The narrator visits Qiáo, who is a psychotic. In her room, “many red birds are drawn on the white walls, approximately thirty” (白色牆壁上畫滿紅色鳥兒，一共有好幾十隻。). She “walks close to the walls, between the red birds” (她走近牆邊，走入那些紅色的鳥兒中間。) The “birds listen to and obey her!” (鳥兒是聽話的！). “Each of her birds have names. Good Bò Bò. Fā Fā was naughty yesterday, and Wá Wá hasn’t eaten for a few days” (她的鳥兒都有名字。柏柏乖，發發昨天淘氣，娃娃幾天不吃東西了。). The birds fly in the room. “She touches the wings of one of the birds” (喬撫著一頭鳥的翅膀), and a bird “stops on [the narrator’s] fingertip” (停在我的指尖). Although the birds are painted on the walls, Qiáo regarded them as alive. Imagination becomes reality in this passage.\n\nModernism seeks to write novels in a way that reflects a human being's inner thoughts, which are often fragmented. Yesi's novels also write about different moments in life that are perhaps not consistent. In the novel \"Paper Cut-outs\", linkage between the two seemingly separate story lines is imagined and drawn by readers. There is no clear message imposed by the author. Paper cut-outs are like fragmented moments, words, and phrases, which are all broken into parts. The connections between the fragments are vague; ambiguity is an important feature of modernism.\n\nChinese literature also heavily influences Yesi's work. Elements of Chinese culture, like folk and opera, can be seen in his works. Elements of Cantonese opera can be seen in his work \"Paper Cut-outs\". Also, he inherited some of the traditional Chinese forms of writing. For example, his \"Bittermelon\" poem praises this plant, which symbolizes virtues stressed in Chinese culture – patience and endurance. The narrator credits bittermelon for its “silence”, saying it \"keep[s] the bitter taste to [itself]”. This means being willing and able to endure suffering and not making others feel pity. The poem echoes the Chinese literary tradition of praising an object that symbolizes virtue and good people.\n\nYesi was not satisfied with just language. Other art media were also sources of inspiration; for example performance art, photography, and film. He “entered into countless dialogues with artists of different media”, and even collaborated with them to write literary works. For example, dancer Mui Cheuk Yin performed the dance “Kikikoko”, and Yesi wrote a poem inspired by her performance – \"Ladder Street\". Yesi's work is also influenced by his interest in film. He often writes as if he is shooting a scene with his camera. For example, the narrator keeps looking for an angle in \"Images of Hong Kong\" and in another poem, \"City of Films\" is introspective in evaluating the best way to capture Hong Kong like a movie shooting: ...then in the second half, find you're your enemy's sonlife goes on without knowing what’s happenedif reality's too hard, there’s always soft focusthe world's still out there, the PR guy’s at the doorwith new schemes for artful promotionand for the film a new title\n\nYesi was recognized as both a writer and a scholar, received various literary awards, and was invited as visiting scholar to universities across the globe. The German professor Wolfgang Kubin commented that Yesi was “a rare Hong Kong writer with a global vision”.\n\nSome examples of recognition are provided as follows:\n\n\n\nBooks (in Chinese) \n\nProse\n\nPoetry\n\nFiction\n\nSelected Works\n\n (in English)\n\nBooks (in French)\n\nBooks (in German)\n\nBooks (in Japanese)\n\nBooks (in Portuguese)\n\nStories, poems and essays (in various foreign languages)\n\nBooks (in Chinese)\n\nBooks a1n9d8 5C iti《《書與城市》(\"Books and Cities\").

{"id": "18212880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18212880", "title": "MIKE 21C", "text": "MIKE 21C\n\nMIKE 21C is a computer program that simulates the development in the river bed and channel plan form in two dimensions. MIKE 21C was developed by DHI. MIKE 21C uses curvilinear finite difference grids.\n\nSimulated processes with MIKE 21C include bank erosion, scouring and shoaling brought about by activities such as construction and dredging, seasonal fluctuations in flow, etc.\n\nMIKE 21C can be used for designing protection schemes against bank erosion, evaluating measures to reduce or manage shoaling, analyzing alignments and dimensions of navigation channels for minimizing capital and maintenance dredging, predicting the impact of bridge, tunnel and pipeline crossings on river channel hydraulics and morphology, optimizing restoration plans for habitat environment in channel floodplain systems, designing monitoring networks based on morphological forecasting.\n\nDue to its accurate descriptions of the physical processes, MIKE 21C can simulate a braided river developing from a plane bed, which was illustrated by Enggrob & Tjerry (1998).\n\nAs most other models made by DHI, MIKE 21C applies an add-on concept in which the overall time-loop can contain processes to be simulated, selected by the user. In its basic form the model is a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model that can simulate dynamic as well as quasi-steady or steady-state hydrodynamic solutions. The hydrodynamic model solves the Saint-Venant equations in two dimensions with the water depth defined in cell centers and a staggered velocity field (internally the code solves the flux field, i.e. the water depth multiplied by the velocity vector) defined with direction as the local grid base vector.\n\nThe model is computationally a parallel code (written in Fortran) with parallelizations in all modules, which allows for simulations of morphological developments on fine grids over long periods of time. The model is typically applied with as much 25,000 computational points over periods of several years or even decades.\n\nThe most important secondary flow in rivers is the so-called helical flow, with its name derived from Helios (the Sun in Greek). The name helical is used because the flow arises as the water in the lower portions of the water column flowing towards the local center of curvature, and away from the local center of curvature along the water surface. This has only a minor impact on the hydrodynamics, usually only pronounced on a laboratory scale, but it has profound impacts on the sediment transport and morphology because the helical flow influences the otherwise zero transverse sediment component. MIKE 21C applies standard theory for the helical flow, which can be found in e.g. Rozowsky (1957). Standard helical flow theory provides a secondary flow velocity profile that is fully characterised by friction and the deviation angle between the main flow direction and the direction of the shear stress at the river bed.\n\nMIKE 21C uses the traditional division of sediment transport into bedload and suspended load, and the model can simulate both non-cohesive and cohesive sediment in a mixture.\n\nThe bed-load model accounts for the impacts of secondary flow (bed shear stress direction) and local bed slope (gravity). Suspended load is calculated with an advection-dispersion equation for each fraction, which includes adaptation in time and space as well as the 2-dimensional depth-integrated effects of the 3-dimensional flow pattern through profile functions (Galappatti & Vreugdenhil, 1985).\n"}
{"id": "19904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19904", "title": "Meteorology", "text": "Meteorology\n\nMeteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics, with a major focus on weather forecasting. The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data. It was not until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and, more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved.\n\nMeteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology. Meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of Earth's atmosphere: temperature, air pressure, water vapour, mass flow, and the variations and interactions of those variables, and how they change over time. Different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local, regional, and global levels.\nMeteorology, climatology, atmospheric physics, and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences. Meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology. The interactions between Earth's atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military, energy production, transport, agriculture, and construction.\n\nThe word \"meteorology\" is from the Ancient Greek μετέωρος \"metéōros\" (\"meteor\") and -λογία \"-logia\" (\"-(o)logy\"), meaning \"the study of things high in the air\".\n\nThe ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests. Cuneiform inscriptions on Babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain. The Chaldeans differentiated the 22° and 46° halos.\n\nAncient Indian Upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons. The Samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed. Varāhamihira's classical work \"Brihatsamhita\", written about 500 AD, provides evidence of weather observation.\n\nIn 350 BC, Aristotle wrote \"Meteorology\". Aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology. One of the most impressive achievements described in the \"Meteorology\" is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle.\n\nThe book De Mundo (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC) noted\n\nThe Greek scientist Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the \"Book of Signs\". The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years. In 25 AD, Pomponius Mela, a geographer for the Roman Empire, formalized the climatic zone system. According to Toufic Fahd, around the 9th century, Al-Dinawari wrote the \"Kitab al-Nabat\" (\"Book of Plants\"), in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Muslim Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the \"anwa\" (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.\n\nEarly attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophesy and divining and sometimes based on astrological ideas. Admiral FitzRoy tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones.\n\nPtolemy wrote on the atmospheric refraction of light in the context of astronomical observations. In 1021, Alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight; he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees below the horizon, and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the Earth's atmosphere as 52,000 \"passim\" (about 49 miles, or 79 km).\n\nSt. Albert the Great was the first to propose that each drop of falling rain had the form of a small sphere, and that this form meant that the rainbow was produced by light interacting with each raindrop. Roger Bacon was the first to calculate the angular size of the rainbow. He stated that a rainbow summit can not appear higher than 42 degrees above the horizon. In the late 13th century and early 14th century, Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī and Theodoric of Freiberg were the first to give the correct explanations for the primary rainbow phenomenon. Theoderic went further and also explained the secondary rainbow. In 1716, Edmund Halley suggested that aurorae are caused by \"magnetic effluvia\" moving along the Earth's magnetic field lines.\n\nIn 1441, King Sejong's son, Prince Munjong of Korea, invented the first standardized rain gauge. These were sent throughout the Joseon Dynasty of Korea as an official tool to assess land taxes based upon a farmer's potential harvest. In 1450, Leone Battista Alberti developed a swinging-plate anemometer, and was known as the first \"anemometer\". In 1607, Galileo Galilei constructed a thermoscope. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote the first scientific treatise on snow crystals: \"Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow)\". In 1643, Evangelista Torricelli invented the mercury barometer. In 1662, Sir Christopher Wren invented the mechanical, self-emptying, tipping bucket rain gauge. In 1714, Gabriel Fahrenheit created a reliable scale for measuring temperature with a mercury-type thermometer. In 1742, Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer, proposed the \"centigrade\" temperature scale, the predecessor of the current Celsius scale. In 1783, the first hair hygrometer was demonstrated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. In 1802–1803, Luke Howard wrote \"On the Modification of Clouds\", in which he assigns cloud types Latin names. In 1806, Francis Beaufort introduced his system for classifying wind speeds. Near the end of the 19th century the first cloud atlases were published, including the \"International Cloud Atlas\", which has remained in print ever since. The April 1960 launch of the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, marked the beginning of the age where weather information became available globally.\n\nIn 1648, Blaise Pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height, and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published \"Hydrodynamics\", initiating the Kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases. In 1761, Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black's student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, which he called \"phlogisticated air\", and together they developed the phlogiston theory. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion. In 1783, in Lavoisier's essay \"Reflexions sur le phlogistique\", he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory. In 1804, Sir John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of black body radiation. In 1808, John Dalton defended caloric theory in \"A New System of Chemistry\" and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight. In 1824, Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn 1494, Christopher Columbus experienced a tropical cyclone, which led to the first written European account of a hurricane. In 1686, Edmund Halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. In 1735, an \"ideal\" explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by George Hadley. In 1743, when Benjamin Franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane, he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery. Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts, such as waterwheels. In 1856, William Ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes, and the air within deflected by the Coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds. Late in the 19th century, the motion of air masses along isobars was understood to be the result of the large-scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force. By 1912, this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect. Just after World War I, a group of meteorologists in Norway led by Vilhelm Bjerknes developed the Norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of mid-latitude cyclones, and introduced the idea of fronts, that is, sharply defined boundaries between air masses. The group included Carl-Gustaf Rossby (who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics), Tor Bergeron (who first determined how rain forms) and Jacob Bjerknes.\n\nIn the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century a range of meteorological instruments was invented – the thermometer, barometer, hydrometer, as well as wind and rain gauges. In the 1650s natural philosophers started using these instruments to systematically record weather observations. Scientific academies established weather diaries and organised observational networks. In 1654, Ferdinando II de Medici established the first \"weather observing\" network, that consisted of meteorological stations in Florence, Cutigliano, Vallombrosa, Bologna, Parma, Milan, Innsbruck, Osnabrück, Paris and Warsaw. The collected data were sent to Florence at regular time intervals. In the 1660s Robert Hooke of the Royal Society of London sponsored networks of weather observers. Hippocrates' treatise \"Airs, Waters, and Places\" had linked weather to disease. Thus early meteorologists attempted to correlate weather patterns with epidemic outbreaks, and the climate with public health. \n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment meteorology tried to rationalise traditional weather lore, including astrological meteorology. But there were also attempts to establish a theoretical understanding of weather phenomena. Edmond Halley and George Hadley tried to explain trade winds. They reasoned that the rising mass of heated equator air is replaced by an inflow of cooler air from high latitudes. A flow of warm air at high altitude from equator to poles in turn established an early picture of circulation. Frustration with the lack of discipline among weather observers, and the poor quality of the instruments, led the early modern nation states to organise large observation networks. Thus by the end of the 18th century meteorologists had access to large quantities of reliable weather date. In 1832, an electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling. The arrival of the electrical telegraph in 1837 afforded, for the first time, a practical method for quickly gathering surface weather observations from a wide area.\n\nThis data could be used to produce maps of the state of the atmosphere for a region near the Earth's surface and to study how these states evolved through time. To make frequent weather forecasts based on these data required a reliable network of observations, but it was not until 1849 that the Smithsonian Institution began to establish an observation network across the United States under the leadership of Joseph Henry. Similar observation networks were established in Europe at this time. The Reverend William Clement Ley was key in understanding of cirrus clouds and early understandings of Jet Streams. Charles Kenneth Mackinnon Douglas, known as 'CKM' Douglas read Ley's papers after his death and carried on the early study of weather systems.\nNineteenth century researchers in meteorology were drawn from military or medical backgrounds, rather than trained as dedicated scientists. In 1854, the United Kingdom government appointed Robert FitzRoy to the new office of \"Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade\" with the task of gathering weather observations at sea. FitzRoy's office became the United Kingdom Meteorological Office in 1854, the second oldest national meteorological service in the world (the Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) in Austria was founded in 1851 and is the oldest weather service in the world). The first daily weather forecasts made by FitzRoy's Office were published in \"The Times\" newspaper in 1860. The following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at principal ports when a gale was expected.\n\nOver the next 50 years many countries established national meteorological services. The India Meteorological Department (1875) was established to follow tropical cyclone and monsoon. The Finnish Meteorological Central Office (1881) was formed from part of Magnetic Observatory of Helsinki University. Japan's Tokyo Meteorological Observatory, the forerunner of the Japan Meteorological Agency, began constructing surface weather maps in 1883. The United States Weather Bureau (1890) was established under the United States Department of Agriculture. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (1906) was established by a Meteorology Act to unify existing state meteorological services.\n\nIn 1904, Norwegian scientist Vilhelm Bjerknes first argued in his paper \"Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics\" that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural laws.\n\nIt was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson published \"Weather Prediction By Numerical Process\", after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions. Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers, and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results. Though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, numerical forecasts with computers became feasible. The first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic (single-vertical-level) models, and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude Rossby waves, that is, the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs. In 1959, the UK Meteorological Office received its first computer, a Ferranti Mercury.\n\nIn the 1960s, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz, founding the field of chaos theory. These advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth (climate models), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term climate shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases.\n\nMeteorologists are scientists who study meteorology. The American Meteorological Society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic \"Meteorology Glossary\". Meteorologists work in government agencies, private consulting and research services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and television stations, and in education. In the United States, meteorologists held about 9,400 jobs in 2009.\n\nMeteorologists are best known by the public for weather forecasting. Some radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists, while others are reporters (weather specialist, weatherman, etc.) with no formal meteorological training. The American Meteorological Society and National Weather Association issue \"Seals of Approval\" to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements.\n\nEach science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment. In the atmosphere, there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.\n\nSets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists. They give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), ceilometer (cloud ceiling), falling precipitation sensor, flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, scintillation counter (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nRemote sensing, as used in meteorology, is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are Radar, Lidar, and satellites (or photogrammetry). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar and Lidar are not passive because both use EM radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere. Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to El Niño.\n\nThe study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales. At one extreme of this scale is climatology. In the timescales of hours to days, meteorology separates into micro-, meso-, and synoptic scale meteorology. Respectively, the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale.\n\nOther subclassifications are used to describe the unique, local, or broad effects within those subclasses.\nMicroscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about or less. Individual thunderstorms, clouds, and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles (such as individual hills) are modeled on this scale.\n\nMesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1 km to 1000 km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, tropopause, and the lower section of the stratosphere. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks. The events typically of interest are thunderstorms, squall lines, fronts, precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes.\n\nSynoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000 km and 10 sec (28 days), in time and space. At the synoptic scale, the Coriolis acceleration acting on moving air masses (outside of the tropics) plays a dominant role in predictions. The phenomena typically described by synoptic meteorology include events such as extratropical cyclones, baroclinic troughs and ridges, frontal zones, and to some extent jet streams. All of these are typically given on weather maps for a specific time. The minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between surface observation stations.\n\nGlobal scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale. These oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months, such as the Madden–Julian oscillation, or years, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation. Global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology. The traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations, their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions.\n\nNumerical Weather Prediction is a main focus in understanding air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, atmospheric predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes. The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global atmospheric model called Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military. Many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies.\n\nBoundary layer meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above Earth's surface, known as the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The effects of the surface – heating, cooling, and friction – cause turbulent mixing within the air layer. Significant movement of heat, matter, or momentum on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions. Boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surface–atmosphere boundary, including ocean, lake, urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology.\n\nDynamic meteorology generally focuses on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere. The idea of air parcel is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere, while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere. An air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere. The fundamental laws of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and motion are used to study the atmosphere. The physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature, density, pressure, etc. These variables have unique values in the continuum.\n\nWeather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location. Humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.\n\nOnce an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the \"range\" of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.\n\nThere are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow, and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.\n\nAviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management. It is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft, as noted by the Aeronautical Information Manual:\n\"The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases. The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.\"\n\nMeteorologists, soil scientists, agricultural hydrologists, and agronomists are people concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution, crop yield, water-use efficiency, phenology of plant and animal development, and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems. Conversely, they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.\n\nHydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle, the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of storms. A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding. Typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.\n\nThe multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats. There are some initiatives - such as the DRIHM project - that are trying to address this issue.\n\nNuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere.\n\nMaritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea. Organizations such as the Ocean Prediction Center, Honolulu National Weather Service forecast office, United Kingdom Met Office, and JMA prepare high seas forecasts for the world's oceans.\n\nMilitary meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for military purposes. In the United States, the United States Navy's Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command oversees meteorological efforts for the Navy and Marine Corps while the United States Air Force's Air Force Weather Agency is responsible for the Air Force and Army.\n\nEnvironmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and various weather conditions.\n\nMeteorology applications in renewable energy includes basic research, \"exploration\", and potential mapping of wind power and solar radiation for wind and solar energy.\n\n\n\n\"Please see weather forecasting for weather forecast sites.\"\n"}

For a few kilometers it forms the border between the two countries. The upper course of the Mira is called the Chota River and is notable for its Afro-Ecuadorian inhabitants, its bomba music, and the large number of internationally-prominent soccer players it has produced. \n\nHigh Andes. The most distant source of the Mira River may be Puruanta Lake, located at an elevation of in the Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve of northern Ecuador. The cities of Ibarra and Otavalo are in the upper drainage basin of the river which includes most of Imbabura and Carchi provinces. The borders of the two provinces run roughly along the course of the Mira. \n\nChota River and Chota Valley. Several tributaries unite to form the Chota River north of the town of Pimampiro at an elevation of . The Chota valley, deep, but wide and fertile in places, extends along the river for about to the village of Concepcion at an elevation of Below the junction of the Chota and Piguchuela rivers, the river is called the Mira. The climate is semi-arid with precipitation on the valley floor as low as per year. Irrigation is necessary for agriculture. The relatively low elevation (for the Andes) of the Chota Valley has resulted since prehistoric times in the valley being used to grow warm-climate and semi-tropical crops: coca, cotton, chile peppers, maize, and fruits. A class of traders called \"mindaeles\", exchanged the semi-tropical crops of the valley with the people of the Pais Caraqui chiefdoms of the surrounding higher and cooler elevations. Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish introduced additional crops, especially sugar cane, olives. and grapes.\n\nTransition. A few miles north of Concepcion, the Mira begins its flow through a narrow, sparsely-populated canyon bordered by forested uplands which persist to near the Colombian border, dropping in elevation over the course of from near Conception to . THe Mira in this section and upstream in the Chota Valley is popular for rafting and kayaking as there are many Class III and IV rapids.\n\nCoastal. The Mira River is navigable for the it flows through Nariño Department of Colombia to the Pacific The Mira is joined by the San Juan river, a major tributary. This is a rainforest region with only a small population devoted mostly to the cultivation of bananas and African oil Palm.\n\nAfrican slaves were brought to Ecuador beginning in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th century Jesuit missionaries owned most of the land in the Chota valley and imported Africans to work as slaves on their sugar cane plantations. By 1767, when the Jesuits were expelled from Latin America, the Jesuits owned 10 plantations and 1,769 slaves in the Chota valley. However, most of the Afro-Ecuadorians experienced little change with the departure of the Jesuits, continuing to be enslaved by the new owners of the plantations.\n\nSlavery was abolished in Ecuador in 1852 and most of the Afro-Ecuadorian residents of the Chota Valley became landless sharecroppers, a condition which continued until the late 20th century. The population of the Chota Valley in 1987 was almost entirely Afro-Ecuadorian concentrated in 10 to 15 villages and totaling less than 15,000. The surrounding highlands had a mestizo and Indigenous population.\n\nA few of the Afro-Ecuadorians obtained land after Land Reform legislation in 1964, but in the early 21st century, the majority of Afro-Ecuadorians in the Chota valley were still impoverished and landless or nearly landless.\n\nThe Chota valley is known for its bomba music which features African drums mixed with indigenous and Spanish influences. It has also become known as the origin of many of Ecuador's finest soccer players. The 2002 Ecuadorian team, which qualified for the FIFA World Cup, had seven Afro-Ecuadorians from the Chota valley on its 23-man roster. This despite the absence of grass soccer fields and training facilities for young players in the Chota valley.\n\n"}

{"id": "43717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43717", "title": "Prisoner's dilemma", "text": "Prisoner's dilemma\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it \"prisoner's dilemma\", presenting it as follows:\n\nIt is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other. The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a systemic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of \"rational\" self-interested action.\n\nAn extended \"iterated\" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by backward induction) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many real world situations involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label \"prisoner's dilemma\" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.\n\nTwo prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.\nThe normal game is shown below:\n\nIt is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other (\"defecting\"). The reasoning involves an argument by dilemma: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.\n\nBecause defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a dominant strategy. Mutual defection is the only strong Nash equilibrium in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.\n\nThe structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either \"Cooperate\" or \"Defect\".\n\nIf both players cooperate, they both receive the reward \"R\" for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff \"P\". If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff \"T\", while Red receives the \"sucker's\" payoff, \"S\". Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff \"S\", while Red receives the temptation payoff \"T\".\n\nThis can be expressed in normal form:\n\nand to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:\n\nThe payoff relationship \"R\" > \"P\" implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships \"T\" > \"R\" and \"P\" > \"S\" imply that defection is the dominant strategy for both agents.\n\nThe \"donation game\" is a form of prisoner's dilemma in which cooperation corresponds to offering the other player a benefit \"b\" at a personal cost \"c\" with \"b\" > \"c\". Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus\n\nNote that (i.e. ) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).\n\nThe donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The marginal utility of an apple to the orange-grower X is \"b\", which is higher than the marginal utility (\"c\") of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is \"b\" while the marginal utility of an apple is \"c\". If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of \"b\"-\"c\". If one \"defects\" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of \"b\", while the cooperator will lose \"c\". If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.\n\nIf two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.\n\nIn addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2\"R\" > \"T\" + \"S,\" to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.\n\nThe iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the \"Peace-War game\".\n\nIf the game is played exactly \"N\" times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible Nash equilibrium is to always defect. The proof is inductive: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on. The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.\n\nUnlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer. The superrational strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed \"N\" is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large \"N\", experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.\n\nFor cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds \"N\" must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by Robert Aumann in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.\n\nInterest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by Robert Axelrod in his book \"The Evolution of Cooperation\" (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the \"N\" step prisoner's dilemma (with \"N\" fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.\n\nAxelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more altruistic strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by natural selection.\n\nThe winning deterministic strategy was tit for tat, which Anatol Rapoport developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of BASIC, and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be \"tit for tat with forgiveness\". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.\n\nBy analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.\n\n\nThe optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.\n\nIn the strategy called Pavlov, win-stay, lose-switch, faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn. In certain circumstances, Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.\n\nDeriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:\n\nAlthough tit for tat is considered to be the most robust basic strategy, a team from Southampton University in England (led by Professor Nicholas Jennings and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start. Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result, this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.\n\nThis strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of minmaxing). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, Richard Dawkins in his book \"The Selfish Gene\" pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening \"ten move dance\" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.\n\nIn a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of \"cooperation probabilities\". In an encounter between player \"X\" and player \"Y\", \"X\" 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities \"P\" of cooperating with \"Y\". \"P\" is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If \"P\" is a function of only their most recent \"n\" encounters, it is called a \"memory-n\" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities: formula_1, where formula_2 is the probability that \"X\" will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which \"X\" cooperated and \"Y\" defected, then formula_3 is the probability that \"X\" will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the \"tit for tat\" strategy written as \"P\"={1,0,1,0}, in which \"X\" responds as \"Y\" did in the previous encounter. Another is the win–stay, lose–switch strategy written as \"P\"={1,0,0,1}, in which \"X\" responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a \"win\" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.\n\nIf we define \"P\" as the above 4-element strategy vector of \"X\" and formula_4 as the 4-element strategy vector of \"Y\", a transition matrix \"M\" may be defined for \"X\" whose \"ij\" th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between \"X\" and \"Y\" will be \"j\" given that the previous encounter was \"i\", where \"i\" and \"j\" are one of the four outcome indices: \"cc\", \"cd\", \"dc\", or \"dd\". For example, from \"X\" 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is \"cd\" given that the previous encounter was \"cd\" is equal to formula_5. (Note that the indices for \"Q\" are from \"Y\" 's point of view: a \"cd\" outcome for \"X\" is a \"dc\" outcome for \"Y\".) Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a stochastic process and \"M\" is a stochastic matrix, allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.\n\nOne result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector \"v\" for the matrix \"M\" such that formula_6. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that \"v\" is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The \"ij\" th entry in formula_7 will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between \"X\" and \"Y\" will be \"j\" given that the encounter \"n\" steps previous is \"i\". In the limit as \"n\" approaches infinity, \"M\" will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing \"j\" which will be independent of \"i\". In other words, the rows of formula_8 will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that \"v\" is a stationary vector for formula_7 and particularly formula_8, so that each row of formula_8 will be equal to \"v\". Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for \"X\". Defining formula_12 and formula_13 as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From \"X\" 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for \"X\" and \"Y\" can now be specified as formula_14 and formula_15, allowing the two strategies \"P\" and \"Q\" to be compared for their long term payoffs.\n\nIn 2012, William H. Press and Freeman Dyson published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called \"zero-determinant\" (ZD) strategies. The long term payoffs for encounters between \"X\" and \"Y\" can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: formula_16 and formula_17, which do not involve the stationary vector \"v\". Since the determinant function formula_18 is linear in \"f\", it follows that formula_19 (where \"U\"={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which formula_20 is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation formula_21.\n\nTit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is \"fair\" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of ultimatum game. Specifically, \"X\" is able to choose a strategy for which formula_22, unilaterally setting formula_23 to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of \"Y\" 's strategy, offering an opportunity for \"X\" to \"extort\" player \"Y\" (and vice versa). (It turns out that if \"X\" tries to set formula_24 to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.)\n\nAn extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not evolutionarily stable. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).\n\nTheory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and win–stay, lose–switch agents.\n\nWhile extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called \"generous\" strategies \"is\" both stable and robust. In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013. Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called \"good\" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013) to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.\n\nMost work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from assorting with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.\n\nPlayers cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection. In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies. Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy – that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.\n\nThe only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.\n\nThe prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the social sciences such as economics, politics, and sociology, as well as to the biological sciences such as ethology and evolutionary biology. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.\n\nIn environmental studies, the PD is evident in crises such as global climate-change. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.\n\nAn important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.\n\nOsang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the\nlines of Michael Porter's hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.\n\nCooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, guppies inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.\n\nVampire bats are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:\n\nIn addiction research / behavioral economics, George Ainslie points out that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict. In this case, \"defecting\" means \"relapsing\", and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome – in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been \"wasted\" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult). Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly \"better\" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining \"tomorrow\" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction. The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting \"today\", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.\n\nJohn Gottman in his research described in \"the science of trust\" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.\n\nAdvertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma. When cigarette advertising was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising. The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B. Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A. If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising. Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising. However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations. For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry. This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.\n\nWithout enforceable agreements, members of a cartel are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma. 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. Anti-trust authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for consumers.\n\nDoping in sport has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.\n\nTwo competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.\n\nIn international political theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of strategic realism, which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given international anarchy. A classic example is an arms race like the Cold War and similar conflicts. During the Cold War the opposing alliances of NATO and the Warsaw Pact both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.\n\nAlthough the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a war of attrition for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost. The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.\n\nMany real-life dilemmas involve multiple players. Although metaphorical, Hardin's tragedy of the commons may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the \"commons\"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house. By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.\n\nThe commons are not always exploited: William Poundstone, in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to take a paper without paying (\"defecting\") but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by Elinor Ostrom, winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the tragedy of the commons is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was \"closed bag exchange\":\nIn this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.\n\n\"Friend or Foe?\" is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the Game Show Network in the US. It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the \"both defect\" and the \"cooperate while the opponent defects\" cases are identical. This makes the \"both defect\" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote \"Foe\", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, \"Friend or Foe\" has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the game of Chicken.\n\nThe rewards matrix is\nThis payoff matrix has also been used on the British television programmes \"Trust Me\", \"Shafted\", \"The Bank Job\" and \"Golden Balls\", and on the American shows \"Bachelor Pad\" and \"Take It All\". Game data from the \"Golden Balls\" series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was \"surprisingly high\" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.\n\nResearchers from the University of Lausanne and the University of Edinburgh have suggested that the \"Iterated Snowdrift Game\" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a chicken game, it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a snowdrift, each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.\n\nThis may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. \"But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project.\"\n\nSeveral software packages have been created to run prisoner's dilemma simulations and tournaments, some of which have available source code.\n\nHannu Rajaniemi set the opening scene of his \"The Quantum Thief\" trilogy in a \"dilemma prison\". The main theme of the series has been described as the \"inadequacy of a binary universe\" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector. Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in mathematical physics – the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a \"post-singularity\" future. The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, \"The Fractal Prince\" and \"The Causal Angel\", published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nA game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game \"\" and a minor part in its 2016 sequel \"\".\n\nIn \"The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma\" by Trenton Lee Stewart, the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the \"prison\" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "361361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361361", "title": "Regional airline", "text": "Regional airline\n\nRegional airlines are airlines that operate regional aircraft to provide passenger air service to communities without sufficient demand to attract mainline service. There are two main ways for a regional airline to do business:\n\nSmall regional airlines operating in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s were also known as commuter airlines and were classified as such in the Official Airline Guide (OAG).\n\nRegional airlines began by operating propeller-driven aircraft over short routes, sometimes on flights of less than 100 miles. In the early days of commercial aviation few aircraft had ranges greater than this, and airlines were often formed to serve the area in which they formed. That is, there was no strong distinction between a regional airline and any other airline. This changed with the introduction of long-range aircraft, which led to the development of the flag carrier airlines, such as British Overseas Airways Corporation and Trans-Canada Airlines. As the flag carriers grew in importance with increasing long-range passenger traffic, the smaller airlines found a niche flying passengers over short routes to the flag carrier's airport. This arrangement was eventually formalized, forming the regional airlines.\n\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s, war surplus designs, notably the DC-3, were replaced by much more capable turboprop or jet-powered designs like the Fokker F27 Friendship or BAC One-Eleven. This extended the range of the regionals dramatically, causing a wave of consolidations between the now overlapping airlines.\n\nIn the United States, regional airlines were an important building block of today's passenger air system. The U.S. Government encouraged the forming of regional airlines to provide services from smaller communities to larger towns, where air passengers could connect to a larger network.\n\nSome of the original regional airlines (then known as \"Local Service Airlines\") sanctioned by the Civil Aeronautics Board in the 1940s and 1950s include:\nNone of these airlines survive today; some airlines use these names today but are not the direct successors to the original airlines. A history and study of regional airlines was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1994 under the title \"Commuter Airlines of the United States\", by R.E.G. Davies and I. E. Quastler.\n\nOne of the first independently owned and managed airlines in the world that rebranded its aircraft to match a larger airline's brand was Air Alpes of France. During 1974, Air Alpes painted its newly delivered short range regional jets in the livery of Air France.\nThe success of the \"rebranding\" or \"pseudo branding\" of a much smaller airline into the name recognition of a much larger one soon became clear as passenger numbers soared at Air Alpes, and it was soon decided to paint other aircraft such as the Fokker F-27 into full Air France colours as well.\n\nSince the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the US federal government has continued support of the regional airline sector to ensure many of the smaller and more isolated rural communities remain connected to air services. This is encouraged with the Essential Air Service program that subsidizes airline service to smaller U.S. communities and suburban centers, aiming to maintain year-round service.\n\nAlthough regional airlines in the United States are often viewed as small, not particularly lucrative \"no name\" subsidiaries of the mainline airlines, in terms of revenue, many would be designated major airline carrier status based on the only actual definition of \"major airline,\" in the United States, the definition from the U.S. Department of Transportation. This definition is based solely on annual revenue and not on any other criterion such as average aircraft seating capacity, pilot pay, or number of aircraft in the fleet. It is common in the U.S. to incorrectly associate aircraft size with the Department of Transportation's designation of major, national, and regional airline. The only corollary is the Regional Airline Association, an industry trade group, defines \"regional airlines\" generally as \"...operat(ing) short and medium haul scheduled airline service connecting smaller communities with larger cities and connecting hubs. The airlines' fleet primarily consists of 19 to 68 seat turboprops and 30 to 100 seat regional jets.\" To be clear there is no distinction in the Department of Transportation definition of major, national and regional airlines by aircraft size. The definition is based on revenue. The clash of definitions has led to confusion in the media and the public.\n\nBeginning around 1985, a number of trends have become apparent. Regional aircraft are getting larger, faster, and are flying longer ranges. Additionally, the vast majority of regionals within the United States with more than ten aircraft within their fleet, have lost their individual identities and now serve only as feeders, to Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, or United Airlines major hubs. Regional aircraft in the US have been getting slightly more comfortable with the addition of better ergonomically designed aircraft cabins, and the addition of varying travel classes aboard these aircraft. From small, less than 50-seat \"single-class cabin\" turboprop, to turbofan regional jet equipment, present day regional airlines provide aircraft such as the higher capacity CRJ700, CRJ900, CRJ1000 series of aircraft and the somewhat larger fuselage Embraer E-Jets. Some of these newer aircraft are capable of flying longer distances with comfort levels that rival and surpass the regional airline equipment of the past.\n\nIn the early 1990s, much more advanced turboprop-powered, fuel efficient, and passenger friendly DC-3 type replacement projects such as the 19 passenger Embraer/FMA CBA 123 Vector and the 34 seat Dornier 328 were undertaken, but met little financial success, partly due to economic downturn in the airline industry resulting from the outbreak of hostilities when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Many of the regional airlines operating turboprop equipment such as Delta's regional sister Comair airlines in the United States set the course for bypassing entirely the regional turboprops as they became the first to transition to an all-jet regional jet fleet. To a lesser extent in Europe and the United Kingdom this transition, to notably the Embraer or Canadair designs, was well advanced by the late 1990s. This evolution towards jet equipment, brought the independent regional airlines into direct competition with the major airlines, forcing additional consolidation.\n\nTo improve on their market penetration, larger airline holding companies rely on operators of smaller aircraft to provide service or added frequency service to some airports. Such airlines, often operating in code-share arrangements with mainline airlines, often completely repaint their aircraft fleet in the mainline airline's sub-brand livery. For example, United Express regional airline partner CommutAir branded its entire fleet as United Express. On the other hand, regional airline Gulfstream International Airlines does not brand their aircraft. When Colgan Air was still operating, they branded a handful of aircraft as Colgan Air, but most were branded as Continental Connection, US Airways Express or United Express, with whom it had contractual agreements.\n\nMany airline passengers find sub-branding very confusing, while many other airline passengers are content to think they are on a mainline or flagship airline's aircraft, while in actuality they are far from it. Sub-branding is pretty consistent throughout the airline industry of the United States, with all the regional airlines, mainline airlines, and the regional airline holding companies, as well as the mainline airlines holding companies participating.\n\nPost airline deregulation, airlines sought added market share and to do this they sought partnerships with regional and small airlines to feed traffic into the airline hub.\n\nInitially these tie ups tended to use small 15 -19 seat aircraft, which did not have a reputation of passenger comfort, or safe reliable operations, by small often under capitalized tiny airline operators.\n\nTo create a common tie and what appeared to be seamless to the air traveler, major carriers marketed in advertising and soon had much smaller airlines paint their small and what was often described as puddle-jumper aircraft, in the image and branding colors of the much larger mainline partner. This was to give the appearance of reliability. Over time these regional aircraft grew in size as airline hubs expanded and competition dwindled among the major carriers.\n\nBelow is a list of many of the regional brands that evolved when regional airlines were advertised to look like the major airlines.\n\nThe following is a list of former regional marketing brands operated by lesser known airlines, serving airline hub regional routes on behalf of mainline, legacy, major, or large discount carriers in the United States:\n\nThe following is a list of former marketing brands operated by smaller airlines, but using larger traditionally non-regional-type equipment such as the Boeing 727, Douglas DC9, Fokker F28, Embraer 190 E-jets, or BAE 146, serving airline hub regional routes on behalf of mainline, legacy, major, or large discount carriers, in the United States:\n\nIn North America many of the largest regional airlines have joined the lobbying group Regional Airline Association. This association lobbies purely for the financial interest of the corporate bodies it constitutes, not the employees of those airlines.\n\nMany large airlines, especially in North America, have established operational relationships with one or more regional airline companies. Their aircraft often use the aircraft livery for the company they are operating flights for. These airlines can be subsidiaries of the major airline or fly under a code sharing agreement or operating through capacity purchase agreements, with the mainline parent company financing the aircraft for the regional airline, and then placing the aircraft with the regional for very little cost. An example would be Envoy Air, which is fully owned by American Airlines Group and does business as American Eagle.\n\nFor all practical purposes, regional airlines in the United States today, are nothing more than co-branded feeder airlines to U.S. airline alliance largest airports and major jet airlines chief focus cities / airline hubs; possessing very few independent routes truly operated independently and apart from those described.\n\nIn Canada, there are a number of regional airlines. Some of them focus on Canadian Arctic and First Nations communities, while others operate regional flights on behalf of a larger carrier, similar to their American counterparts. Some of these airlines and brands include:\n\nThe trend of branding smaller and mostly regional (in terms of geographical scope) airlines to match the mainline airlines, has led to only three main sub-brands in the United States. These three, American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express are the post-deregulation survivors resultant of the multiple bankruptcies and mergers of the major, legacy, mainline airlines, as well as some discount or low-cost carriers which adopted similar strategic marketing ideas.\n\nMany small regional airlines have grown substantially, usually through virtual mergers by use of the regional airline holding company, as pioneered by AMR Corporation in 1982. AMR created the AMR Eagle Holding Corporation which unified its wholly owned American Eagle Airlines and Executive Airlines under one division, but still maintained the regional airlines' operating certificates and personnel separate from each other and American Airlines.\n\nIn the United States, the most significant airline holding companies, and their subsidiary regional airlines, are:\n\nAs of August 2018, the various holding companies support the dwindling number of regional brands:\n\nThese virtual airlines, as they have been called, tend to use largely outsourced labor at most stations, to reduce costs. In 2011, 61% of all advertised flights for American, Delta, United and US Airways were operated by their regional brands. This figure was only 40% in 2000.\n\nThe evolution and chronological history of the commuter side of the regional airline industry can be defined by a number of dates prior to the end of the era of airline regulation by the Civil Aeronautics Board of the United States. Among these significant dates are:\n\nList of Commuter Airlines in 1977 Prior to Airline Deregulation:\n\nSome of the lesser known smaller brands used by the regional airlines and their parent companies were:\n\n\nEuropean regional airlines serve the intra-continental sector in Europe. They connect cities to major airports and to other cities, avoiding the need for passengers to make transfers.\n\nFor example, BA CityFlyer a regional subsidiary of British Airways uses the basic \"Chatham Dockyard Union Flag\" livery of its parent company and flies between domestic and European cities. In a slightly different category ExpressJet Airlines another regional carrier, but one which is independently owned and managed, although its 205 aircraft fleet operates in the marketing brand of Continental Airlines, Inc., Continental Express. In these roles, all of the preceding airlines are operated primarily to bring passengers to the major hubs, where they will connect for longer distance flights on the national airlines also known as flagship carriers's, larger aircraft. The smallest regional carriers have become known as feeder airlines. The separate corporate structure allows the company to operate under different pay schedules, typically paying much less than their mainline owners.\n\nSome of Europe's regional airlines are subsidiaries of national air carriers, though there remains a strong entrepreneurial sector of independents. They are based on business models ranging from the traditional full service airline to low cost carriers. Innovations include one where the passenger is required to join a membership club before being allowed to fly.\n\nSome examples of European regional airlines include:\n\n\nIndia has many regional carriers operating currently. Some of these operate under the government's UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme).\n\nSilkAir is the regional wing of Singapore Airlines and operates scheduled passenger services from Singapore to 37 cities in the region of Southeast Asia, South Asia and China. This airline differs from airlines in North America and Middle America in that it uses \"mainline sized equipment\" that is aircraft with a seating capacity greater than 99 passengers, but uniquely receives the designation of a \"regional airline\" subsidiary by its aforementioned airline parent company.\n\nRegional Express Airlines is the largest regional airline outside of the Qantas group in Australia, servicing routes in several states and territories. The regional arms of Qantas is known as QantasLink.\n\nIn the film, \"\", director and film producer Michael Moore profiled how little most regional pilots are paid in the first few years of their careers. Hourly wages for regional pilots start at $12.50. In comparison, a cabbie in New York averages $17 an hour, according to the city's Taxi & Limousine Commission. On Feb 12th, 2010, a year after the crash of Colgan flight 3407, \"Frontline\" premiered its WGA Award-winning exposé on the industry entitled \"Flying Cheap\". In the program, reporter Miles O'Brien questioned how the impact of low salaries are having on pilot psyches and how safe this could be for the flying public. When asked to respond to the question, Roger Cohen, president of the Regional Airline Association, told \"Frontline\" that, \"...there are many other people who earn less money than that and work more days in these communities that can afford it and do it and do it responsibly.\"\n\nAn alternative to some regional airline service may be the new Small Aircraft Transportation System initiative in conjunction with general aviation and VLJs (very light jets). With the introduction of air taxi VLJs, city pair links to smaller communities lacking regional connections could become more common.\n\nIn many regions, regional airlines increasingly face competition from high-speed rail with airlines sometimes replacing feeder services through air rail alliances.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "491975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491975", "title": "Robert Balling", "text": "Robert Balling\n\nRobert C. Balling, Jr. is a professor of geography at Arizona State University, and the former director of its Office of Climatology. His research interests include climatology, global climate change, and geographic information systems. Balling has declared himself one of the scientists who oppose the consensus on global warming, arguing in a 2009 book that anthropogenic global warming \"is indeed real, but relatively modest\", and maintaining that there is a publication bias in the scientific literature.\n\nBalling was born and raised in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and moved to Springfield, Ohio in 1970 to attend Wittenberg University. While there, he decided to join Phi Gamma Delta after hearing good things about it and because many of his friends were pledging it. Balling gained bachelor's and master's degrees in geography in 1974 (Wittenberg University, BA) and 1975 (Bowling Green State University, MA), before gaining his Ph.D. in geography from the University of Oklahoma in 1979. He was assistant professor at the University of Nebraska (1979–1984), before joining the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University. He gained tenure there in 1987, and served as the director of the Office of Climatology until 2004.\n\nBalling has published much research pertaining to various factors that influence the Earth's climate. In 1988, Balling published a study which found that the construction of golf courses around Palm Springs, CA may have cooled the city over the preceding 15 years, in contrast to the warming effect usually associated with urban areas (also known as the urban heat island effect). Seven years later, Balling and Randall S. Cerveny, one of his ASU colleagues, published a study which found that the moon, when it is full, can cause Earth's troposphere to warm by more than 0.03 °F. However, it remained unclear why the moon might be able to do this. When interviewed by the New York Times, Balling suggested the main reason might be that infrared radiation from the Sun is reflected towards Earth by the full moon. In 1998, Balling and Cerveny published a letter to \"Nature\" which found that man-made air pollutants, especially ozone and carbon monoxide, were influencing weather patterns on the East Coast of the United States. Their study also concluded that this effect was the strongest on Saturdays, and that this was so because \"...the end of the week brings worse air pollution than the beginning.\"\n\nBalling was mentioned as a fossil fuel industry – funded scientist in Ross Gelbspan's 1997 book \"The Heat is On\". This led the Minnesota \"Star Tribune\" to run an editorial speaking of a \"disinformation campaign\" by some climatologists. Balling and his colleague Patrick Michaels took a complaint against the Star Tribune to the Minnesota News Council. By a 9–4 decision the council \"voted to sustain the complaint that the Star Tribune editorial unfairly characterized the scientific reputations of Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling.\" At the 1998 hearing, Balling \"acknowledged that he had received $408,000 in research funding from the fossil fuel industry over the last decade (of which his University takes 50% for overhead).\"\n\nBetween December 1998 and September 2001 Balling was listed as a \"Scientific Adviser\" to the Greening Earth Society, a group that was funded and controlled by the Western Fuels Association (WFA), an association of coal-burning utility companies. WFA founded the group in 1997, according to an archived version of its website, \"as a vehicle for advocacy on climate change, the environmental impact of CO2, and fossil fuel use.\" In 2001, while it was directed by Balling, ASU's office of climatology received $49,000 from ExxonMobil.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2002, Balling received more than $679,000 from fossil-fuel-industry organizations; as of 2007, he also had received more than $7 million in research funding from the National Science Foundation and the EPA. He has also come under scrutiny because he was listed as a tentative author of the Heartland Institute's NIPCC report; however, ASU's vice president of public affairs, Virgil Renzulli, pointed out that this did not imply that Balling had been receiving money from Heartland. Balling himself added that his prior involvement with the Heartland Institute's activities amounted only to appearing at a luncheon they held in 2008.\n\nOn February 24, 2015, Arizona State Representative Raúl Grijalva wrote letters to seven universities where climate skeptic scientists (including Balling) worked, citing concerns about these scientists' conflicts of interest and non-disclosure of corporate funding. In these letters, Grijalva requested records on the funding and testimony prepared before a government body.\n\n\nBalling believes that humans are increasing the level of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, and that the Earth should warm as a result. Balling also considers the mainstream description of climate change to be \"a vastly overrated threat whose proposed solutions are worse than the problem.\" In particular, he has dismissed the idea that use of renewable energy could be an effective strategy for combating global warming as \"absurd.\" In the book \"Climate of Extremes\", Balling, along with his co-author Patrick Michaels, contend that certain phenomena usually attributed to anthropogenic global warming have actually been occurring for more than a century. The phenomena named include the loss of ice on Mount Kilimanjaro. Balling has made similar statements about current sea level rise; namely, that it has been occurring for 8,000 years and it is therefore \"quite a stretch\" to blame it on global warming.\n\nIn the December 1995 issue of Harper's Magazine, Ross Gelbspan described Balling and other global warming skeptics as \"extraordinarily adept at draining the [global warming] issue of all sense of crisis.\" \"Climate of Extremes\" was reviewed in Foreign Affairs by Richard N. Cooper, who concluded that \"Even if the authors have cherry-picked their scientific papers, this book is a useful antidote to the heavy dose of hype to which the public is regularly subjected.\" By contrast, \"The Satanic Gases\", another Balling-Michaels collaboration which was published in 2000, received a scathing review from \"American Scientist\". Reviewer John Firor argued that the book \"does not fulfill\" its claim (on the dust jacket) that global warming predictions are \"simply wrong\", that Michaels and Balling criticized the Kyoto Protocol without having read it, and that they quoted a well-known scientist out of context. After Balling wrote an article for TCS Daily harshly criticizing An Inconvenient Truth as scientifically inaccurate, his article was itself criticized as inaccurate by Judd Legum, who said that the article used \"misleading scientific arguments.\" Legum's critique was endorsed by geochemist Eric Steig, a contributor to RealClimate, who said that \"All those points are accurate,\" and that \"Some of them could probably have been stronger; that is, Balling is even more wrong that Legum indicates.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for claiming to have reached the geographic North Pole with his expedition on April 6, 1909.\n\nPeary was born in Cresson, Pennsylvania, but was raised in Portland, Maine, following his father's death at a young age. He attended Bowdoin College, then joined the National Geodetic Survey as a draftsman. Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881, as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the Nicaragua Canal (which was never built). Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross Greenland by dogsled. He returned in 1891 much better prepared, and by reaching Independence Fjord (in what is now known as Peary Land) conclusively proved that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study Inuit survival techniques.\n\nOn his 1898–1902 expedition, Peary set a new \"Farthest North\" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, Cape Morris Jesup. He also reached the northernmost point of the Western Hemisphere, at the top of Canada's Ellesmere Island. Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905–06 and in 1908–09. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received a number of awards from geographical societies during his lifetime, and in 1911 received the Thanks of Congress and was promoted to rear admiral. He served two terms as president of The Explorers Club, and retired to Eagle Island.\n\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in contemporary newspapers (along with a competing claim made by Frederick Cook), but eventually won widespread acceptance. However, in a 1989 book British explorer Wally Herbert concluded that Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as . His conclusions have been widely accepted, although disputed by some authorities.\n\nRobert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in Cresson, Pennsylvania, to Charles N. and Mary P. Peary. After his father died in 1859, Peary's mother took the boy with her and settled in Portland, Maine. After growing up in Portland, Peary attended Bowdoin College, some to the north. He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Phi Beta Kappa fraternities while at college. He graduated in 1877 with a civil engineering degree.\n\nPeary lived in Fryeburg, Maine, from 1878 to 1879. During that time he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg's Jockey Cap Rock. The 360 degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. His boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. The survey was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder, and erected to his memory by the Peary Family in 1938. A hike of less than a mile leads visitors to the summit and the monument.\n\nAfter college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings in Washington, D.C., at the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey office. He joined the United States Navy and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned as a civil engineer, with the relative rank of lieutenant. From 1884 to 1885 he was assistant engineer on the surveys for the Nicaragua Canal, and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the North Pole.\n\nIn April 1886 he wrote a paper for the National Academy of Sciences proposing two methods for crossing Greenland's ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about to the east coast. The second, more difficult path was to start from Whale Sound at the top of the known portion of Baffin Bay and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic (1,300 miles). Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.\n\nPeary made his first expedition to the Arctic in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by dog sled, taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a whaler to Greenland, arriving in Godhavn on June 6, 1886. Peary wanted to make a solo trek but a young Danish official named Christian Maigaard convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland's ice sheet at that date. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.\nBack in Washington attending with the US Navy, Peary was ordered in November 1887 to survey likely routes for a proposed Nicaragua Canal. To complete his tropical outfit he needed a sun hat, so he went to a men's clothing store. There he met 21-year-old Matthew Henson, a black man working as a sales clerk. Learning that Henson had six years of seagoing experience as a cabin boy, Peary immediately hired him as a personal valet.\n\nOn assignment in the jungles of Nicaragua, Peary told Henson of his dream of Arctic exploration. Henson accompanied Peary on every one of his subsequent Arctic expeditions, becoming his field assistant and \"first man,\" a critical member of his team.\n\nIn 1891 Peary returned to Greenland, taking the second, more difficult route that he had laid out in 1886: traveling farther north to find out whether Greenland was a much larger landmass extending to the North Pole. He was financed by several groups, including the American Geographic Society, the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. Members of this expedition included Peary's aide Henson, Dr. Frederick A. Cook, who served as the group's surgeon; and the expedition's ethnologist, Norwegian skier Eivind Astrup; bird expert and marksman Langdon Gibson, and John M. Verhoeff, who was a weatherman and mineralogist. Peary also took his wife along as dietitian, though she had no formal training. Newspaper reports criticized Peary for bringing his wife.\nOn June 6, 1891, the party left Brooklyn, New York, in the seal hunting ship SS \"Kite\". In July, as \"Kite\" was ramming through sheets of surface ice, the ship's iron tiller suddenly spun around and broke Peary's lower leg; both bones snapped between the knee and ankle. Peary was unloaded with the rest of the supplies at a camp they called Red Cliff, and a dwelling was built for his recuperation during the next six months. Josephine stayed with Peary. Gibson, Cook, Verhoeff and Astrup hunted game by boat, and became familiar with the area and with the Inuit people.\n\nUnlike most previous explorers, Peary had studied Inuit survival techniques; he built igloos during the expedition and dressed in practical furs in the native fashion. He adopted these practices both for heat preservation (furs) and to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march by building igloos instead. Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system (which he called the \"Peary system\") of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by the Inuit people's smell (they did not bathe), by their flea infestations and by their food. However, she studied the people and kept a journal of her experiences. In September 1891, Peary's men took dog sled teams and pushed inland onto the ice sheet, to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than from Red Cliff.\n\nPeary's leg mended in February 1892. By April, he made some short trips with Josephine and an Inuit dog sled driver to native villages to purchase supplies. On May 3, 1892, Peary finally set out on the intended trek with Henson, Gibson, Cook and Astrup. At about the mark, Peary continued on with Astrup. The two found the high view from Navy Cliff to be revealing: they saw Independence Fjord and concluded that Greenland was an island. The men trekked back to Red Cliff and got there on August 6, having traveled a total of .\n\nIn 1896, he received his degrees in Kane Lodge No. 454, New York City, and presented the Lodge the Masonic Flag that was raised on May 20-25, 1895, at Independence Bay, Greenland He was a Master Mason.\n\nAs a result of Peary's 1898–1902 expedition, he claimed an 1899 visual discovery of \"Jesup Land\" west of Ellesmere. He claimed that this sighting of Axel Heiberg Island was prior to its discovery by Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup's expedition. This contention has been universally rejected by exploration societies and historians. However, the American Geographical Society and Royal Geographical Society of London honored Peary for tenacity, mapping of previously uncharted areas, and his discovery in 1900 of Cape Jesup at the north tip of Greenland. Peary also achieved a \"farthest north\" for the western hemisphere in 1902 north of Canada's Ellesmere Island.\n\nPeary's next expedition was supported by a $50,000 gift by George Crocker, who was the youngest son of the banker Charles Crocker. Peary used the money for a new ship. The navigated through the ice between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, establishing an American hemisphere \"farthest north by ship.\" The 1906 \"Peary System\" dogsled drive for the pole across the rough sea ice of the Arctic Ocean started from the north tip of Ellesmere at 83° north latitude. The parties made well under a day until they became separated by a storm.\nPeary was inadvertently without a companion sufficiently trained in navigation to verify his account from that point northward. With insufficient food, and with uncertainty about whether he could negotiate the ice between him and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life off the melting ice. On April 20, he was no further north than 86°30' latitude. He claimed the next day to have achieved a Farthest North world record at 87°06' and returned to 86°30' without camping, an implied trip of at least between sleeping, even assuming direct travel with no detours.\n\nAfter returning to \"Roosevelt\" in May, Peary in June began weeks of difficult travel by heading west along the shore of Ellesmere. He discovered Cape Colgate, from the summit of which he claimed in his 1907 book that he had seen a previously undiscovered far-north \"Crocker Land\" to the northwest on June 24, 1906. A later review of his diary for this time and place found that he had written, \"No land visible.\" On December 15, 1906, the National Geographic Society of the United States, which was primarily known for publishing a popular magazine, certified Peary's 1905-6 expedition and \"Farthest\" with its highest honor, the Hubbard Gold Medal. No major professional geographical society followed suit. In 1914 Donald MacMillan and Fitzhugh Green's expedition found that Crocker Land did not exist.\n\nFor his final assault on the Pole, Peary and 23 men, including Ross Gilmore Marvin, set off from New York City on July 6, 1908 aboard the SS \"Roosevelt\" under the command of Captain Robert Bartlett. They wintered near Cape Sheridan on Ellesmere Island, and from Ellesmere departed for the pole on February 28 – March 1, 1909. The last support party was turned back from \"Bartlett Camp\" on April 1, 1909, in latitude no greater than 87°45' north. (The figure commonly given, 87°47', is based upon Bartlett's slight miscomputation of the distance of a single Sumner line from the pole.) On the final stage of the journey toward the North Pole, Peary told Bartlett to stay behind. He continued with five assistants, none capable of making navigation observations: American Matthew Henson, and Inuit \"Ootah\", \"Egigingwah\", \"Seegloo\" and \"Ooqueah\". On April 6, 1909, he established \"Camp Jesup\" allegedly within of the pole.\n\nPeary was unable to fully enjoy the fruits of his labors. Upon returning to civilization, he learned that Dr. Frederick A. Cook, who had been a surgeon on the 1891–1892 Peary expedition, claimed to have reached the pole in 1908. After some court trials, Peary was declared right and Cook wrong.\n\nPeary was promoted to the rank of captain in the Navy on October 20, 1910. By his lobbying, Peary headed off a move among some US Congressmen to have his claim to the pole evaluated by other explorers. Eventually recognized by Congress to have \"attained\" the pole, Peary was given the Thanks of Congress by a special act of March 3, 1911. By a special act of Congress on March 30, 1911, Peary was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps retroactive to April 6, 1909, and retired the same day.\n\nLater in the same year, he retired to Eagle Island on the coast of Maine, in the town of Harpswell. (His home there has been designated a Maine State Historic Site.) Following his retirement, Peary received many honors from numerous scientific societies of Europe and America for his Arctic explorations and discoveries.\n\nHe served twice as president of The Explorers Club from 1909 to 1911 and 1913 to 1916.\n\nIn early 1916, Peary became chairman of the National Aerial Coast Patrol Commission, a private organization created by the Aero Club of America. It advocated the use of aircraft in detecting warships and submarines off the U.S. coast. Peary used his celebrity to promote the use of military and naval aviation, which led directly to the formation of Naval Reserve aerial coastal patrol units during the First World War.\n\nAt the close of the First World War, Peary proposed a system of eight air mail routes, which became the genesis of the U.S. Postal Service's air mail system.\n\nPeary died in Washington, D.C. on February 20, 1920. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. More than 60 years later, Matthew Henson was honored by being re-interred nearby in Arlington Cemetery on April 6, 1988.\n\nOn August 11, 1888, Peary married Josephine Diebitsch, a business school valedictorian who thought the modern woman should be more than just a mother. Diebitsch had started working at the Smithsonian Institution when she was 19–20 years old, replacing her father after he became ill and filling his position as linguist. She resigned from the Smithsonian in 1886 upon becoming engaged to Peary.\n\nThe newlyweds honeymooned in Atlantic City, New Jersey, then moved to Philadelphia because Peary was assigned there. Peary's mother accompanied them on their honeymoon and she moved into their Philadelphia apartment, but not without friction between the two women. Josephine told Peary that his mother should return to live in Maine. \n\nThey had two children together, Marie Ahnighito and Robert Peary, Jr. His daughter wrote several books, including a children's book about the Arctic adventures. Due to his life as an explorer, Peary was frequently gone for years at a time. In their first twenty-three years of his marriage, he spent only three with his wife and family. He missed the birth of his son and his early death.\n\nWhile in the Arctic years later, Peary had a long-term relationship with an Inuit woman, Aleqasina (who is estimated to have been 14 when they began). She bore him at least two children, including a son Kali, identified in the late 1980s when he was an octogenarian.\n\nPeary and his aide Henson both had relationships with Inuit women outside of marriage and fathered children with them. Peary appears to have started his relationship with his Inuit wife Aleqasina (\"Alakahsingwah\") when she was about 14 years old. Wally Herbert noted the relationship and children in his book on Peary's 1909 expedition, published in 1989.\n\nS. Allen Counter, a Harvard neuroscience professor, was interested in learning more about Henson's role in the Arctic expeditions. In 1986 he went to Greenland to do research and found Peary's son Kali and Henson's son Anaukaq, then octogenarians, and some of their descendants. He arranged to bring the men and their families to the United States to meet their American relatives and see their fathers' gravesites. Counter wrote about Peary's and Henson's Inuit children, and their meeting with their American half-siblings and other relatives in his book, \"North Pole Legacy: Black, White and Eskimo\" (1991). He also gained national recognition of Henson's role in the expeditions. A subsequent documentary by the same name was also released.\n\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole has long been subject to doubt. Some polar historians believe that Peary honestly thought he had reached the pole. Others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments. Peary's account has been newly criticized by Pierre Berton (2001) and Bruce Henderson (2005).\n\nPeary did not submit his evidence for review to neutral national or international parties or to other explorers. Peary's claim was certified by the National Geographic Society (NGS) in 1909 after a cursory examination of Peary's records, as NGS was a major sponsor of his expedition. This was a few weeks before Cook's Pole claim was rejected by a Danish panel of explorers and navigational experts.\n\nThe National Geographic Society limited access to Peary's records. At the time, his proofs were not made available to scrutiny by other professionals, as had been done by the Danish panel. Gilbert Grosvenor persuaded the National Academy of Sciences not to get involved. The Royal Geographical Society (RGS) of London gave Peary its gold medal in 1910, despite internal council splits which only became known in the 1970s. The RGS based their decision on the belief that the NGS had performed a serious scrutiny of the \"proofs\", which was not the case. Neither the American Geographical Society nor any of the geographical societies of semi-Arctic Scandinavia has recognized Peary's North Pole claim.\n\nThe party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey included no one else who was trained in navigation and could independently confirm (or contradict) Peary's own navigational work, a point exacerbated by Peary's omission to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction (\"variation\") of the compass, for his longitudinal position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either latitudinally or transversely beyond Bartlett Camp.\n\nThe last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than marching north. But once the last support party turned back at \"Camp Bartlett\" from where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least from the pole, Peary's claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup, and then quadrupled during the 2½ day return to Camp Bartlett—at which point his speed slowed drastically compared to that pace. Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back — which would have assisted his claim of such speed — is contradicted by companion Henson's account of tortured detours to avoid \"pressure ridges\" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and \"leads\" (of open water between those floes).\n\nThe conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which (like Robert Scott's a month later in 1912) was supported by the sextant, theodolite, and compass observations of several other navigators. See Polheim.\n\nIn sum, Peary claimed to travel (in his official report) a total of 304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909 (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), 133 NMs to the pole, 133 NMs back and 38 nautical miles in the vicinity of the pole. These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance travelled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed.\nPeary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of 304 NMs more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).\n\nThe diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian Larry Schweikart examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), that there were consistent pemmican and other stains on all pages, and that all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart had compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer Naomi Uemura, who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent. However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days 6 and 7 April 1909, and his famous words \"The Pole at Last!\", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.\n\nIn 1984 the National Geographic Society (a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions) commissioned the Arctic explorer Wally Herbert to write an assessment of Peary’s original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary must have falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the Pole. His book, \"The Noose of Laurels\", caused a furor when it was published in 1989. His conclusion has been widely accepted. Herbert, who reached the Pole in 1969, is recognized as the first man leading a team to reach the Pole.\n\nIn 1989 the NGS also conducted two-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of the shadows in photographs and a review of ocean depth measures taken by Peary; its staff concluded that he was no more than away from the pole. Peary's original camera (a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak) has not survived. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens—and hence the shadow analysis based on it—must be considered uncertain at best. The NGS has never released Peary's photos for independent analysis. Specialists questioned the Society's conclusions.\n\nThe NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue. Reporting on its conclusion that Peary had reached the Pole, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NGS, said, “I consider this the end of a historic controversy and the confirmation of due justice to a great explorer.” The Navigation Foundation published its full report on December 11, 1989.\n\nSupporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed. Only the first few of the Peary party's soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water. Peary stated (in 1909 Congressional hearings about the expedition) that he made no longitudinal observations during his trip, only latitude observations, yet he maintained he stayed on the \"Columbia meridian\" all along, and that his soundings were made on this meridian. The pack ice was moving all the time, so he had no way of knowing where he was without longitudinal observations.\n\nBritish explorer Tom Avery and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey in 2005, using replica wooden sleds and Canadian Eskimo Dog teams. They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours – nearly five hours faster than Peary. Avery writes on his web site that \"The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole.\"After reaching the Pole, Avery and his team were airlifted off the ice rather than returning by dogsled.\n\nAnalysis of the speeds made by Avery do more to cast doubt on Peary's claim than to confirm it. While Peary claimed made good in his last five marches, horrific ice conditions meant that Avery managed only 71 in his last five marches. Avery never exceeded in any five-day stretch, and was losing over a day at this time to the southerly drift of the ice. Avery matched Peary's overall 37-day total in part because Peary was held up by open water for five days at the Big Lead. But Peary had a team consisting of 133 dogs and 25 men, meaning he was able to keep his \"polar party\" fresh for the sprint to the Pole. Peary's team was more experienced than Avery's at dog sledding.\n\n\nThe explorer Major General Adolphus Greely noted that no Arctic expert questions that Peary courageously risked his life traveling hundreds of miles from land, and that he reached regions adjacent to the pole. (After initial acceptance of Peary's claim, he later came to doubt Peary's having reached 90°.) In his book \"Ninety Degrees North: The Quest for the North Pole\" (2001), polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as \"undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration.\"\n\nPeary's exploits and life were portrayed in the 1998 TV movie \"Glory & Honor\". Henry Czerny played Robert Peary. His associate Matthew Henson was played by Delroy Lindo. The film won a Primetime Emmy and Lindo won a Golden Satellite Award for his performance.\n\nE.L. Doctorow's novel \"Ragtime\" (1974) has as a major character Father, a member of Peary's 1908 polar expedition. The expedition is described from the point of view of one not chosen for the final polar attempt.\n\nPierre Berton Canadian author and historian, wrote extensively about Peary and his Arctic expeditions in his book: (1988 Anchor Canada .

Two bridges named Lidingöbron extend from Ropsten over to the island of Lidingö. Ropsten area is located between Hjorthagen and the Stockholm city main port Värtahamnen. Ropsten is the terminal station for the eastern part of Stockholm Metro system and is also the terminal station for Lidingöbanan, the railway for public transportation, covering the area of Lidingö.\n\nRopsten has been the communication center for the traffic between Stockholm and Lidingö since the 13th or 14th century, when the first inhabitants settled on Lidingö and began farming, 200–300 years after the end of the Viking Age.\n\nThe name \"Ropsten\" stems from the fact that in old times, going back to the 13th or 14th century, people used to shout out loud from this area to Lidingö, a distance of about 750 meters, to call for a boat transport over to Lidingö, before the first regular rowboat ferry line was introduced and before the first bridge was built. In the old times, the part of the Ropsten area close to the waterfront was named \"Ropudden\" (corresponding to \"cape shout\"). The large rock or islet in the water close to this cape gave the place its name, \"the rock at cape shout\", \"Ropsten\". The rock itself, however, was probably not used as a place to shout from, as it was surrounded by water (during average sea level conditions) according to old maps from the end of the 17th century, in particular a map from 1696. When there was an extreme low sea level it was probably possible to reach the rock by foot, as indicated on the painting by Piere Joseph Trere from 1795.\n\nThe entire area, named Ropsten, dramatically changed appearance in just a few years when the first bridge between Ropsten and Lidingö and the main port for Stockholm was built in this area from around 1884. Today nothing remains of the old Ropsten as it appears on the painting from 1795.\n"}

The north-western summit is the highest point of Poland and belongs to Crown of Polish Mountains; the other two summits are on the Slovak side of the border. \n\nExperts assume that the Polish and Slovak name \"Rysy\", meaning \"scratches\" or \"crevices\", refers to a series of gullies, either those on the western slopes of Żabie Ridge or the very prominent high gully and numerous smaller ones on the northern side. A folk explanation on the Slovak side says that the name comes from the plural word \"rysy\" meaning \"lynxes\", although the habitat of the lynx does not extend above the timberline.\n\nThe Hungarian name \"Tengerszem-csúcs\" and the German name \"Meeraugspitze\" mean \"eye-of-the-sea peak\", from the glacial lake at the northern foot of the mountain, called \"eye of the sea\" (\"Morskie Oko\" in Polish).\n\nThe first known ascent was made in 1840, by Anika Altman and her guide Ján Ruman-Driečny, Sr. The first winter ascent was completed in 1884, by Theodor Wundt and Jakob Horvay. In the 20th century, the communist authorities claimed Vladimir Lenin climbed the mountain sometime in the early 1910s.

He heads the district's government alongside the distrital secretaries and the chiefs of the administrative departments.\n\nThe mayor is not the highest political authority of Bogota, distinction that belongs to District's City Council which is charged with creating municipal ordinances and overseeing the mayor's duties. The mayor is elected every four years by popular vote and is usually considered by general opinion to be the second most important political post in Colombia second only to the President of the Republic. The Superior Mayor of Bogota's Office oversees twenty local municipalities \"(localidades)\" which each have their own local Mayors.\n\nThe current mayor is Enrique Peñalosa.\n\nThe Superior Mayor of Bogota is primarily tasked with executing the norms stipulated by the constitution, the law, and city ordinances approved by the City Council.\n\nAs the highest police authority of The District he is tasked with maintaining public order, being subordinated on this matter only to the President. In this way the District's Mayor Office is different from other municipalities in Colombia where the Mayor's are subordinated on this matter to the governors of the respective departments. The Superior Mayor of Bogota has the same police authorities as all other Colombian mayors \"and\" governors within their respective jurisdictions such as elaborating police directives, commanding all police members assigned to the district, soliciting the help of the army during an emergency, ordering the demolition of buildings that pose a threat to public safety, regulating local commerce and the sell and distribution of liquor, amongst others.\n\nAs the supreme administrative authority and head of the local executive government he is charged with directing all public works, as well supervising the continuous provision of all essential public services.As the judicial representative of the city, he and his delegates are competent to carry out contracts or agreements which are legally binding for the City itself.\n\nThe Mayor also has normative prerogatives. He might create those regulations, resolutions or orders he considers necessary to carry out City Ordinances, mirroring the normative faculties the President has when it comes to implementing laws passed by Congress.\n\nAs for his administrative duties he can freely appoint and remove the Secretaries of the various secretariats that make up the Superior Mayor's Office and the managers of the decentralized entities vinculated to his office . He may also do the same with all the functionaries of the central sector of the dependencies overseen by his office who are appointed to their post. He is tasked with overseeing the conduct of all the public servants under his authority and is competent to impose disciplinary sanctions after dues process to any of them.\n\nIn those dependencies that belong to the Central Sector and are ascribed to his Office, he may freely create or eliminate posts, attribute said posts their functions, and decide the remuneration of those employees directly under his authority in accordance with the City's budget and in compliance with the law.\n\nEvery year he is tasked with presenting an inform of his administration to the City Council.\n\nThe distrital administration of Bogota is headed by the Superior Mayor and is made up of various entities belonging to the central sector, the decentralized sector, and the local municipalities. Though the Bogotá City Council forms part of the executive branch of the Colombian government, and is in charge of the administration of the city, it is not technically part of the Distrital Administration since it has no executive functions related to the administration of the city. Also the sub national oversight bodies that operate in Bogota such as the office of the Comptroller of Bogota and the ombudsman office of Bogota are not part of the Distrital Government and are completely independent from the mayor's office.\n\nThe Superior Mayor of Bogota, as the highest official within the Distrital Administration has various and ample prerogatives when it comes to the entities that make up the Central and decentralized sectors and the local municipalities. His influence is greater in those entities that make up the central sector, lesser in the decentralized entities, and limited in the local municipalities.\n\nThe entities that make up the Distrital Administration are created by law or by city ordinances. It is through this entities that the Mayor can execute his functions. Centralized entities don't have legal personality and are all under the direct responsibility of the Superior Mayor's Office. Decentralized entities on the other hand are administratively autonomous and have judicial personality, nevertheless the managers in charge of the decentralized entities as well as the majority of their respective boards are appointed by the Mayor.\n\nThe Centralized entities that make up the central sector are:\n\nDecentralized entities, as stated above are somewhat autonomous. Nevertheless, its top officials are appointed by the Superior Mayor's Office and thus tend to follow the same political lines as the city's administration. They have judicial personality which allows them to file lawsuits and be sued on their own responsibility. They have an independent budget which may not be modified by the Mayor once approved by the Council. Some of this centralized entities operate as part of the public sector, while others, called vinculated decentralized entities, operate as private enterprises own or partly owned by the city's government. Each decentralized entity is ascribed(if it belongs to the public sector) or vinculated (if it operates as a private enterprise) to a centralized dependency. For instance the Lottery of Bogota (a private enterprise wholly owned by the City's Government) is vinculated to the Distrital Secretariat of the Treasury.\n\n\n\nLocal mayors are elected by the Local Administrative Councils out of a three candidate shortlist elaborated by the Superior Mayor.\n\n"}

The numbering plan was last updated in 2015. The International Telecommunication Union has assigned the country calling code \"91\" to India.\n\nSubscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) codes are assigned to each city/town/village, with the larger Metro cities having shorter area codes (STD codes), which are from 2 to 8 digits long. For example,\nTier-2 Cities in India have STD code with 3 digits. For example,\n\nKanpur and Lucknow were the two cities between which the first STD call of the country was made.\n\nThe total length of all phone numbers (STD code and the phone number) in India is constant at 10 digits, for example 7513200000 signifies a STD code i.e. 751 Gwalior & the phone number 3200000. \n\nLand line numbers are at most 8 digits long (usually in major metros). \n\nDue to the availability of multiple operators offering fixed line services (either over wire or wireless), there is an operator-code for each telephone number, which is the first digit in the phone number. These are:\n\n\nThus, a number formatted as 020-30303030 means a fixed-line Reliance number in Pune, while 011-20000198 is an MTNL fixed line in Delhi and 033-45229320 is a fixed-line Airtel number in Kolkata, and 07582-221434 is a BSNL number from Sagar, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nNo prefix is required to call from one landline to another in the same STD area. A prefix of \"0+STD code\" is required to dial from a landline phone in one STD code area to another. A prefix of \"0+STD code\" is required to dial from a mobile phone in India to any landline number, irrespective of STD area.\n\nFor example, to dial a landline number in Indore, one would have to dial\n\nBefore 10 March 2009, as per Department of Telecommunications memorandum dated 9 February 2009. there were some exceptions to this general rule for STD areas falling close to each other (within a radius of 200 kilometre), where \"0\" can be replaced with \"95\" e.g. to dial Delhi from Gurgaon, one dials 9511+landline number.\n\nA typical mobile number in India is \"+91-XXXX-NNNNNN\". Where the first four digits indicate a operator's code, while the remaining six digits are unique to the subscribers. However, with portability in place, the first four digits may not indicate a particular operator.\n\nThere are many companies in the Indian market who rent keywords, on a monthly basis, whose characters, on a typical mobile phone keypad, represent short codes. Short codes are five digits in length and have to start with the digit '5' like 58888 as of 2007. Previously, they were four-digit in number and could be of any combination, like 8888 or 7827. The current five digits can be extended by three digits further representing 3 additional characters. Messages sent to these Short Codes are commonly referred to as Premium Rate SMS Messages and cost from per message depending on the operator as well as the service and the company.\n\nTelemarketers have been issued 10-digit telephone numbers starting with 140 (140XXXXXXX) by the Department of Telecommunications on TRAI's request.\n\n"}

In time, the canal was cut off from the Danube and effectivelly turned into a lake, with an area of 0.24 km² and became the major natural bird and fish spawning area on the island, with 196 bird and 90 fish species living in it. However, during the droughty years the lake drained out completely causing damage to the closed eco-system centred on it. In August 2007 the digging began of a 300 m-long canal which would reconnect Veliki Galijaš with the Danube and prevent the seasonal drying of the lake. After it was completed, fish from the Sava began swimming into the Veliki Galijaš. Fishing in the lake is forbidden as in the river zone up to 50m from the island's coastline.\n\nCelebrating June 29, the international Day of the Danube, an eco-camp made of pile dwellings for the students of the Belgrade University was opened near the lake in 2007.

It was formed in November 2000 with the aim of fighting evictions, water cut-offs and poor health services, obtaining free electricity, securing decent housing, and opposing police brutality.\n\nThe movement is the oldest of the first generation of so-called 'new social movements' to spring up after the end of apartheid and is known for its direct action style militancy, its refusal of all forms of vanguardism, including NGO (Non-Governmental Organisations) authoritarianism. The movement has sought to retain its autonomy from NGOs and publicly refused to work with some local NGOs and insists that the middle class left respect the autonomy of grassroots movements.\n\nThe AEC is a founding member of the Poor People's Alliance and, along with the other members of the alliance, refuses all electoral politics and encourages the development of popular power rather than voting for political parties.\n\nThe AEC mobilised against the 2008 xenophobic attacks in the areas where it was strong.\n\nThe AEC opposed evictions related to the FIFA 2010 World Cup.\n\nThe AEC is currently an umbrella body for over 10 community organisations, crisis committees, and concerned residents movements who have come together to organise and demand their rights to basic services. The organisations that make up the AEC include but are not limited to:\n\n\nAffiliated movements and committees in the Western Cape:\n\nThe Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign is an umbrella structure with an executive committee of a chairperson, a vice chairperson, a secretary, a vice secretary, a treasurer, and five regional coordinators. \nThe AEC opposes evictions and water and electricity cut-offs on many different levels. Activities range from legal actions that challenge the constitutionality of evictions, to mass mobilisation and popular education initiatives, to organisation and capacity building programs. The movement has also confronted local gangs and in July 2012 one of its leading activists, Soraya Nordien, was murdered following threats from gang members.\n\nSince its inception, the Anti-Eviction Campaign (AEC) has called for an end to all evictions and cut-offs of basic services in the Western Cape. In 2001, the AEC achieved a 6-month moratorium on all evictions in the Cape Town Unicity. Even though the DA had declared the moratorium, illegal evictions continued.\n\nThe movement strongly supported the struggle for the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers to resist forced removal to the notorious Blikkiesdorp transit camp and to demand access to decent housing.\n\nNo Land! No House! No Vote! is the name of a campaign by autonomous grassroots movements to boycott elections and reject party politics and vote banking in South Africa. In 2009, the Poor People's Alliance voted to boycott the national elections under the No Land! No House! No Vote! Banner.\n\nThe 2010 FIFA World Cup was connected to a large number of evictions in South Africa which many claimed were meant to 'beautify the city'. The WC-AEC campaigned against all evictions caused by the event. The campaign's hotspots included the anti-gentrification issues in Gympie Street and other parts of Woodstock, the national N2 Gateway housing project and its evictions in Joe Slovo and Delft, Sea Point evictions, and evictions in Q-Town next to Athlone Stadium.\n\nThe movement is committed to opposing xenophobia and has been particularly active in this regard in Gugulethu where it has set up a forum for these issues to be discussed. According to both the media and the local police the forum has had considerable success in reducing xenophobic hostility. However the movement's anti-xenophobic work has cost it some popular support and resulted in an arson attack on one of the movement's leaders.\n\nThe movement produces its own media.\n\nIn September 2008 the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, together with Abahlali baseMjondolo, the Landless People's Movement and the Rural Network (Abahlali baseplasini) formed the Poor People's Alliance. The poor people's alliance refuses electoral politics under the banner 'No Land! No House! No Vote!'. It has been reported that \"Nearly 75% of South Africans aged 20-29 did not vote in the 2011 [local government] elections\" and that \"South Africans in that age group were more likely to have taken part in (sic) violent street protests against the local ANC than to have voted for the ruling party\".\n\nTake Back the Land in Miami and the Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign have both stated that their work is inspired by that of the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign. The Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign has used the slogan 'No House No Vote'.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Norwegian Telegraph Director, Carsten Tank Nielsen (1818–92) and Alvilde Olsen (1821–1890). Nielsen descended on both father's and mother's side from the established civil and commercial bourgeoisie. His grandfather, Jacob Nielsen, had been one of Christiania's largest lumber dealers and director of the National Bank.\n\nNielsen studied philology and took a linguistic-historical degree in 1865. After three years as a teacher at Nissens Latin School (interrupted by several rounds of archival studies in Sweden and Denmark), he was employed in the National Archival Services of Norway (\"Arkivverket\") from 1869 to 1978 and at the same time served as librarian at the Deichman Library. He was appointed manager of the University's Ethnographic Museum in 1877, and the following year he became research fellow in history and geography. In 1880, he completed his philosophical doctorate thesis on the council Riksrådet.\n\nNielsen was an important advisor in Norway to King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway. He had close connections to the Royal Family, and was the tutor of the Swedish princes Oscar and Eugen during their stay at the University of Christiania in the 1880s.\n\nNielsen was chairman of the Norwegian Historical Association, and edited the journal \"Historisk Tidsskrift\" from 1903 to 1912. Together with Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae he co-edited the journal \"Vidar\" 1887–89. Nielsen was a board member of the Norwegian Trekking Association from 1879 and Chairman 1890–1908. In 1879 he released the travel guide \"Reisehaandbog over Norge\", popularly called \"Yngvar\", which appeared in 12 editions until 1915 and came to play an important role in the spread of tourism. His guide books were published in English and German.\n\nProbably Nielsen's most important work as an historian was \"Lensgreve Johan Caspar Herman Wedel Jarlsberg\" (three volumes, 1901–1902), his biography of Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg (1779–1840). Wedel-Jarlsberg played an active role in the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814 and was the first native Norwegian to hold the post of Governor of Norway during the union with Sweden.\n\nIn October 1870, he married Karen Anne Juliane Hedvig Wedel-Jarlsberg (1847–1927), the daughter of Peder Anker Count Wedel-Jarlsberg (1909–1893). Nielsen was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1875 and the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1897. He received Reward Medal from King Oscar II in 1882, was appointed Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1894 and received the Commander Cross 1911. He was appointed Knight of the Nordstjärneorden and appointed to several other foreign orders.\n\n"}
