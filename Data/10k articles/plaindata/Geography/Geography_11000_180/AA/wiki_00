He obtained a Masters of Science degree at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów in 1937. In the same year he took part in the First Polish West Greenland Expedition, organized by Aleksander Kosiba, which provided him with enough material for his PhD dissertation. Completed in 1939, it had the title \"Investigations on the structure and temperature of soils in West Greenland\".\n\nJahn survived the Nazi occupation of Poland by working as a feeder of lice at Rudolf Weigl's typhus research institute in Lwów. After the war he first worked in Lublin, at the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, and then in the reconstituted Wrocław University (which included a large number of the faculty from Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów who survived the war). In the 1950s he resumed his polar studies, participating in expeditions to Spitsbergen and the Polish Polar Station in Hornsund. He also conducted research in Siberia, Alaska and other parts of Scandinavia which made him one of the foremost polar geomorphologists in the world. He was made president (rector) of Wrocław University in 1962. In 1953 and 1980 Alfred Jahn published various works on the Polish part of the Sudetes Mountains emphasizing the role of climate in shaping the mountains.\n\nIn 1968, as a rector of Wrocław University, he made the decision to support the student strikes against Communist censorship. As a result, he lost his job. Likewise, during the martial law in Poland in 1982, he spoke out against the policies of the Jaruzelski government and was consequently removed by the authorities from his position as chair of the Committee on Polar Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1972 he founded the Polar Club of the Geographical Society of Poland and served as its first president until 1982. Jahn retired in the 1990s but remained scholarly active until his death on April 1, 1999 in Wrocław.\n\nAlfred Jahn was a member of the Polish Academy of Science, of Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and the German Akademie Leopoldina. He published his memoirs, \"Z Kleparowa w świat szeroki\" (\"From Kleparow into the big wide world\"), in 1991.\n"}
{"id": "734496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=734496", "title": "Alternative universe (fan fiction)", "text": "Alternative universe (fan fiction)\n\nAn alternative universe (also known as AU, alternative timeline, alternate timeline, alternative reality, or alternate reality) is the occurrence of canonical facts about the setting or characterization of a particular fictional universe being explored in a non-canonical way. These universes are often made unofficially, though elements of fan fiction are sometimes used in official, though usually non-canonical, storylines.\n\nStories that fall into this definition are usually \"what-ifs\", where possibilities arising from circumstances that do not occur in the original fictional universe are explored. For example, the premise of an alternative universe story may go something like this: \"What would happen if character X was killed before event Y could happen?\" Unlike regular fan fiction, which generally remains within the boundaries of the canon set out by the author, alternative universe fiction writers like to explore the possibilities of pivotal changes made to characters' history, motivations, or environment, often combining material from multiple sources for inspiration.\n\nAuthors and readers of AU fanfiction enjoy it for many different reasons, but there are several shared story types that exist within many fandoms: alternative timelines, contextual reassignment, \"reality\" swaps, crossovers, and predictive fiction.\n\nStories with alternative timelines follow the established canon before veering away at a crucial moment—similar in concept to many entries in Marvel Comics' \"What If\" series and DC Comics' \"Elseworlds\" series. The Pokémon TV and video game series too has had its fair share of alternative universe fanfictions. One example notable for its popularity is \"Blue Tears\", a story in which the pokémon trainer Blue gets revenge on his rival Red after Red's actions on the \"S.S. Anne\" led to the death of Blue's Raticate.\n\nSome alternative timeline stories are called \"fix-it fics\" because they rewrite the story so that the consequences of events are undone, although beginning events are the same. An example from the Harry Potter universe is \"Extenuating Circumstances\" by SarahtheBardess, in which Harry's godfather Sirius Black still dies at the hands of his cousin Bellatrix LeStrange but is returned to life. Others are called \"denial-fics\" because they ignore certain pivotal events in a given canon. An example of this type, also from the Harry Potter universe, is \"You Don't Belong Here\" by Hieirulesall. The author notes that they want Sirius Black to live but do not want to resort to bringing him back from the dead.\n\nIn the \"Babylon 5\" fanfic \"A Dark, Distorted Mirror\" by Gareth Williams, the alien ambassador Delenn chooses a different pilot—not Jeffrey Sinclair, a crucial contributor to both the battle and fictional universe as a whole—to bring aboard a Minbari warship during the final battle in the war between the Minbari and Earth. As a result, the Minbari do not find out about an important connection between themselves and humans, do not surrender, and successfully destroy the planet Earth and continue the war. However, despite the dark and desperate struggle that ensues as a result, the eventual outcome offers hope for a better future.\n\nAnother example of a subgenre of the alternative timeline story is called a \"do-over fic\", similar to \"fix-it fics\" in which consequences of an event are undone, but in do-over fics particularly the entire story is reset to the beginning, and the author creates an alternate timeline that diverges from the original canon of the work. \"What is Right: Year One\" by Emma Lipardi is a do-over fic surrounding the idea of a Hogwarts student having the ability to \"Re-do\" their life from the start.\n\nPlot switch stories take the characters from a series and place them in another time, place, or situation. An example is \"Welcome to Hogwarts\" by AD Miller, a Glee story that transfers Glee characters to Hogwarts in the Harry Potter universe.\n\nA subset of this type called familiar plot switch takes the characters from a series and places them in a setting more familiar to the author. This type of context shift is one of the main sources of \"high school fic\" in which all the characters are written going to high school. An example of this is the \"Charmed\" fanfiction \"Charmingly High School\" by AlwayWrittinSomethin, in which characters who never met until adulthood attend high school together.\n\nIn a reality swap alternative universe (AU)—often in movies or television shows—the actors may find themselves in the fictional universe, the fictional characters may find themselves in the \"real\" universe, or the story may feature swaps both ways. This type of AU has appeared in mainstream publications as well. In \"Star Trek\" short stories written in the early 1970s, the actors from the Desilu set were swapped with the \"real life\" Starfleet officers via the transporter (\"Visit To A Weird Planet\"; \"Visit To A Weird Planet, Revisited\"). These fan fiction stories were eventually published in official \"Star Trek\" books. \n\nThis concept was used also in an in-canon episode of \"Supernatural\", \"The French Mistake\" (Season 6, Episode 15). In the episode, two characters named Sam and Dean are transported to an alternative universe where they are actors named Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively, on a television show called \"Supernatural\".\n\nThis type of alternative universe places two fictional universes in a situation where they interact, similar to reality swaps (which mix a fictional universe with the real world). Such stories sometimes involve comparisons or conflict between the combat prowess of the two universes, often involving the various strengths and weaknesses of the technology/magic of each world. An example is \"A Thin Veneer\" by AlbertG, in which \"\" characters meet \"Babylon 5\" characters, setting off a galaxy-wide war. This genre of fanfiction is distinct from plot switch in the fact that it usually involves characters from at least two separate series interacting with one another.\n\nSometimes these stories involve the substitution of characters from one universe for those of another, as in \"Return of the Aurors\" by Anne Walsh. That fan fiction recasts \"Return of the Jedi\" with \"Harry Potter\" characters, like 'Ron Solo' (Ron Weasley as Han Solo) and 'N-3LO' (Neville Longbottom as C-3PO). The story is played out in a Harry Potter-themed universe, visiting, for example, Dursley the Hutt's home on the desert planet of Quidditchine.\n\nA third example of crossover fiction would be when a team-up of heroes from multiple universes must defeat a team-up of villains from those same stories, as in the \"Phineas and Ferb\" television special \"\". In this TV episode, several villains from the Marvel Universe team up with the show's usual villain, and a group of Marvel superheroes must team up with the show's protagonists to stop their plan to take over the world.\n\nAlternative universes can arise inadvertently in fanfiction when the source material is released in a serial form (such as a multi-season television series or a book trilogy) so that fan works are written before further canonical information arrives. For instance, much \"Harry Potter\" fan fiction written in the nearly three years between the publication of \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" and \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" was written as \"continuation\" fan fiction, but became AU as soon as the new canonical material appeared. An example is Arabella and Zsenya's \"After the End\", made AU by \"Order of the Phoenix\" the day after the story's completion. In \"After the End\", Harry's fifth year ended with his mentor Albus Dumbledore's death, which did not happen in \"Order of the Phoenix\", but, coincidentally, did happen in the following novel.\n\nIn alternative universe stories, characters' known motivations may vary considerably from their decisions in the canonical universe. The author of an alternative universe story thus can use the same characters, but send them down different paths to achieve a completely different plot.\n\nOn occasions, a fanfiction writer creates a character which does not exist in the actual story that inspired it. Gertrude 'Danger' Granger in Anne Walsh's \"Harry Potter\" AU series, the \"Dangerverse,\" is an example of this, who is invented to serve as the wife of Remus Lupin, one of Harry's friends and teachers. Changing canon can also mean taking a romantic relationship that was hinted but didn't actually happen, and expanding on it.\n\nAlternative universes are also used in original fiction works themselves as an integral part of the storyline. The webcomic \"Sluggy Freelance\" had an alternative universe storyline which, while not integral, was revisited for another storyline.Many examples given above, in particular the What If and Elseworld universes, have elements of AU fiction built into their canon.\n\nIn the many \"Gundam\" anime series, there are often six major timelines that are independent of one another, and some fan circles (especially in North America) refer to the timelines created after the original Universal Century as \"alternative universes\". However, this does not truly fit the standard definition of AU, as the timelines share neither characters nor locations (aside from the solar system itself). Some universes, especially when presented in two different formats (such as an anime television show and concurrent manga comic series), have two timelines which are similar but not identical, usually as a result of the difficulty of portraying certain scenes in both formats. Theoretically, both timelines are canon, but the differences sometimes escalate to the point where the two formats become essentially different stories.\n\nThe \"\" comic book series explores alternative universe fiction in a \"what-if\" style, diverging from the story of the original Star Wars trilogy movies at crucial moments, with a major impact on the evolving story. Exploring these questions from a different angle, the \"Stargate\" franchise has included episodes in which characters interact with alternative versions of themselves. In a similar fashion, several Star Trek episodes feature a \"Mirror Universe\" containing a very different history of events.\n\nIn the Lego \"Bionicle\" storyline, there are many alternative universes created whenever a character makes a decision or an event happens. For example, a universe was created when the character Toa Tuyet betrayed the city of Metru Nui and was defeated; in the alternative universe, Tuyet is aided by her comrade, Toa Nidhiki, and takes over Metru Nui. These alternative dimensions can be visited using a special mask called the Kanohi Olmak (Mask of Dimensional Gates). The anime, manga, and video game series \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" (as well as its spin-offs) focuses on AU arcs and alternative settings to reveal the secrets of the village named Hinamizawa. Likewise, book series \"Heroes in Real Harsh World\" and \"Trendy Baba Series\" by Mohit Trendster explore multiple story angles of different Indian comic book superheroes with experimental backdrops and contrasting elements. Big Finish \"Doctor Who\" has alternative universe stories called \"Unbound\", which explore alternative Doctors.\n\n"}

{"id": "18969536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18969536", "title": "Forestry in Bhutan", "text": "Forestry in Bhutan\n\nOne of Bhutan's significant natural resources in the late twentieth century was its rich forests and natural vegetation. Bhutan's location in the eastern Himalayas, with its subtropical plains and alpine terrain, gives it more rainfall than its neighbors to the west, a factor greatly facilitating forest growth. The forests contain numerous deciduous and evergreen species, ranging from tropical hardwoods to predominantly oak and pine forests.\n\nThe small population and the general absence of overdevelopment in Bhutan contributed to forest preservation. Because of the terrain, the more accessible forests had been overcut whereas remote forests remained largely in their natural state. A progressive government-sponsored forestry conservation policy strove to balance revenue needs with ecological considerations, water management, and soil preservation. Success in managing its forest resources had long been critical to the local environment and economy and also affected downstream floodplains in India and Bangladesh.\n\nThe Department of Forests and Park Services was established in 1952 as the Department of Forestry to oversee conservation and exploitation of the country's significant forestry resources. After an initial decade of development, forestry resource exploitation increased with the start of the First Development Plan in 1961. Uncontrolled felling of trees in the 1970s by private companies in logging areas and by rural populations along roads and in main valleys stripped hillsides and caused serious erosion. Tsheri cultivation, forest fires, and overgrazing also contributed to the degradation of the forestry resource.\n\nIn 1971 the Forestry School was established at Kalikhola in southern Bhutan. It was moved to Taba in the northern Thimphu Valley in 1977. The school provided basic instruction in forestry and forest management and trained foresters and Forest Guards.\n\nIn 1981 some 33,000 km², or between 70 and 74 percent of the land, were forested, but in 1991 foreign estimates indicated a shrinking forest of only 60 to 64 percent of the land. Even more conservative estimates indicated that closer to 50 percent of Bhutan's territory still was forested in the late 1980s, and about 15 percent of GDP was produced through the nation's important forest industry.\n\nAccording to UN statistics, in the decade between 1978 and 1987 Bhutan harvested an average of nearly 3.2 million cubic meters of roundwood and produced 5,000 cubic meters of sawn wood per year. Of this total, nearly 80 percent was for commercial use (paper pulp, veneers, plywood, particle board, and firewood), and the remainder was for housing construction and public works.\n\nBefore hydroelectric power and other modern energy sources were available, wood was the almost exclusive source of fuel for heating, cooking, and lighting. The provision of electricity, as well as better regulation of fuelwood collectors and more aggressive reforestation projects, was seen in the 1980s as a key factor in forest conservation. Because affordable electricity was not available throughout the country, the government established fuelwood plantations near villages to accommodate daily needs and to promote forest conservation.\n\nRecognizing the potential value of its forestry resource, Bhutan became increasingly conscientious about forestry management in the 1970s. Starting in 1977, the World Wildlife Fund began supporting Bhutan's forest management through organizing forest ranger training programs, supplying funds for forest boundary demarcation, building guard posts, and constructing a patrol road for what was later to be designated the Royal Manas National Park. Bhutan rejected World Bank aid to build a major dam on the Manas Chhu in 1986 that would have flooded this major conservation area on the southern Bhutan-India border. By 1989 Bhutan had developed nine other forest and wildlife preserves, also mostly along the southern border with India.\n\nIn the face of increasing denuded hillsides, private logging was banned, and strict standards for public-sector logging operations were established in 1979. Farmers were warned against burning off forests to clear land for tsheri cultivation, and Forest Guards were trained in increasing numbers to help preserve the valuable resources. Surveying, demarcation, conservation, and management plans for harvesting forest products were part of the Fifth Development Plan's focus on forestry preservation. Wildlife sanctuaries also were developed.\n\nOne of the immediate results of forestry sector regulation was a sharp decrease in revenues since the late 1970s. In 1991 the government, with assistance from UNDP and the World Wildlife Fund, established a trust fund for environmental conservation. Initially in the amount of US$20 million, the UNDP-administered fund was aimed at producing up to US$1 million per year for training in forestry and ecology, surveying forests, reviewing and implementing management plans for protected areas, and supporting government environmental offices, public awareness programs, and integrated conservation and development programs.\n\n"}

Dury\n\nGeorge Harry Dury (11 September 1916 – 4 October 1996) was an English geographer and hydrologist who devised a model showing the relationship between river discharge and other stream variables.\n\nDury was born at Hellidon, near Daventry, Northamptonshire, the son of Harry Dury (1879–1961), an agricultural labourer then serving in the Royal West Surrey Regiment, and his wife, Harriett Emma, née Colledge (1882–1959). He attended the grammar school in Daventry, and then took a BA degree (1937) and a teacher's diploma (1939) as an external student of the University of London. In 1937 he married Ina Gertrude Newton (1916–2005), daughter of George Lionel Newton, army pensioner, of Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. They had a daughter, Helen.\n\nWhile teaching at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, in 1939, Dury and his family were evacuated before the German occupation. He was commissioned in the Royal Air Force in 1941 and assigned to photographic mapping. His mapping of Guernsey served also for his London University MA degree. His first post-war job was as a lecturer in geology and geography at Enfield Technical College in 1946–48. He then became a geography lecturer at Birkbeck College, University of London (1949–62). Having retired to Risby near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, he died at the West Suffolk Hospital there in 1996.\n\nDury's model is an extension of the Bradshaw model which shows how river characteristics will change from the upper course to the lower course of a river. Dury used a line graph and a logarithmic scale, plotting the discharge along the x-axis and the other stream variables along the y-axis. Other 'stream variables' included depth, width, velocity, slope (gradient) and friction (Manning formula).\n\nDury's work on quantitative fluvial geomorphology led to a temporary period with the United States Geological Survey in 1960–61 and to co-authorship of the influential study \"Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology\" (with Luna B. Leopold, M. Gordon Wolman, and John Miller, 1964). Dury's most widely read book was \"The Face of the Earth\" (1959), published by Penguin Books.\n\n"}
{"id": "57637304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57637304", "title": "Geology of Mozambique", "text": "Geology of Mozambique\n\nThe geology of Mozambique is primarily extremely old Precambrian metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement rock, formed in the Archean and Proterozoic, in some cases more than two billion years ago. Mozambique contains greenstone belts and spans the Zimbabwe Craton, a section of ancient stable crust. The region was impacted by major tectonic events, such as the mountain building Irumide orogeny, Pan-African orogeny and the Snowball Earth glaciation. Large basins that formed in the last half-billion years have filled with extensive continental and marine sedimentary rocks, including rocks of the extensive Karoo Supergroup which exist across southern Africa. In some cases these units are capped by volcanic rocks. As a result of its complex and ancient geology, Mozambique has deposits of iron, coal, gold, mineral sands, bauxite, copper and other natural resources. \n\nThe oldest rocks in Mozambique are part of the Irumide Belt, outcropping near the border with Zimbabwe. Over two billion years old, these rocks date to the Archean and Paleoproterozoic and are an extension of greenstone belts and granite-gneisses, within the Zimbabwe Craton.\n\nThe schist of the greenstone belt is divided between the Manica Group, Gairezi Group and Umkondo Group, which together are the oldest individual rock units in the country. The formation of these schists and the Irumide Belt is tied to the Irumide orogeny about 1.35 billion years ago. \n\nDuring the Neoproterozoic, the Pan-African orogeny emplaced granites and pegmatites throughout what is now Mozambique. This 250 million year tectonic event (which continued into the Phanerozoic Eon) overprinted many of the Precambrian rocks in Mozambique. The Snowball Earth global glaciation event 600 million years ago, at the same time as the orogeny began, left glacial sedimentary rocks in the Katangula Group in northwestern Mozambique, which is the same unit as the Katanga Supergroup in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia. \n\nAs the Pan-African orogeny continued, in parallel with the proliferation of multi-cellular life, a large rift formed across the south of the supercontinent Gondwana across what is now South Africa and southern South America. The Karoo Supergroup, the most widely dispersed stratigraphic unit in southern Africa formed from the Carboniferous through the Early Jurassic in the Mesozoic. The Alto Zambezi Basin, Rio Lunho Basin and Rio Lugenda Basin, large intracratonal basins in Mozambique filled with sedimentary rocks. For the most part, the basins contain sequences of fluvial and glacial sediments, with layers of red mudstone with fossils and some coal layers. The Alto Zambezi Basin is capped by volcanic basalt and rhyolite in the south. \nSedimentary rock formation continued in Mozambique along the coasts in the Jurassic, Cretaceous and into the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic, with some sedimentary units formed in the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. Sedimentation shifted to different basins, including the Mozambique Basin, Limpopo Basin, Baixa Zambezi Basin and Rovuma Basin. \n\nSouth of the Save River, unconsolidated sediments are an important source of groundwater, overlying the Mozambique Basin. A 30 kilometer wide belt of dune sands occupies the southern coast of the country, atop Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks and form a moderately productive unconfined aquifer. Thick alluvium in the Limpopo River and Incomati River valleys forms a major aquifer in high porosity sands north of Maputo. \n\nMarine and continental sandstones dominate deeper Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary aquifers and some also contain layers of limestone. These underlying rocks in the Mozambique Basin form the largest aquifer, beneath 21% of the country. Cut by large river valleys, arkosic sandstones give way to limestone closer to the coast. North of the Save River, the basin is moderately productive, but to the south it has high salinity nearly unusable groundwater for much of its extent. The Rovuma Basin is poorly studied, but impermeable marl and high incidences of brackish groundwater suggest it would not be a major potential source. \nAs much as 57% of Mozambique is directly underlain by Precambrian basement rock, which forms some small and locally productive aquifers in weathered rock near the surface. Mountain areas tend to have thicker weathered mantle, with most productive locations near fault zones. In northern Mozambique, average weathered rock cover is less than 20 meters thick, rising to as much as 50 meters in valleys. \nFractured volcanic rocks form locally productive aquifers, producing high quality water, often in 10 to 20 meter thick weathered rock near the surface. However, weathered basalt often ends up with high clay concentrations, limiting productivity. \n\nMozambique has extensive natural resources, although most remain undeveloped. The Manica Belt is a continuation of the Mutare-Manica Gold Belt from Zimbabwe and contains iron, copper, asbestos, gold, lead and nickel hosted in an Archean and Paleoproterozoic greenstone belt. Small mines in the region have targeted placer gold in sediments in the area and there is also a small, high-grade bauxite deposit. The metasediments of Gairezi Group and Umkondo Group both host limestone, copper and iron near the border with Zimbabwe. \nMozambique has four asbestos deposits. One has chrysotile asbestos crystals, separated by serpentinite in the Zimbabwe Craton, near Manica. Others are in the Mozambique Belt, or associated with serpentinization south of Manica. Seven out of the nation's 10 provinces have graphite in Proterozoic rock associated with schist and gneiss. Semi-precious stones, feldspar, beryl (including aquamarine and morganite), mica and radioactive minerals are found with pegmatites in the Proterozoic rocks in Zambezia Province and Nampula Province. Elsewhere, in the northeast, pegmatite hosts lithium, bismuth, quartz, beryl, columbium, antimony and tantalum. \n\nThe Eocene Cheringoma Formation and the Miocene Jofane Formation contain limestone, halite and gypsum. Mozambique is also notable for beach sands between Quelimane and Angoche, laden with zircon, rutile, monazite and ilmenite. \nThe country has 120 to 380 million tons of coal reserves in the bottom units of the Karoo Supergroup in the Rio Lunho Basin. The Cretaceous Grudja Formation in shows the most promise for potential hydrocarbons and Mesozoic sedimentary sequences in the north and south both have the possibility of future discoveries. \n"}

Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other ecosystem services that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services. By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.\n\nLand system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.

{"id": "39869209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39869209", "title": "Leaflet (software)", "text": "Leaflet (software)\n\nLeaflet is a widely used open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. First released in 2011, it supports most mobile and desktop platforms, supporting HTML5 and CSS3. Along with OpenLayers, and the Google Maps API, it is one of the most popular JavaScript mapping libraries and is used by major web sites such as FourSquare, Pinterest and Flickr.\n\nLeaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display tiled web maps hosted on a public server, with optional tiled overlays. It can load feature data from GeoJSON files, style it and create interactive layers, such as markers with popups when clicked.\n\nIt is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin, who joined Mapbox in 2013.\n\nA typical use of Leaflet involves binding a Leaflet \"map\" element to an HTML element such as a div. Layers and markers are then added to the map element.\n\nThe Leaflet library itself is accessible through the variable codice_1.\n\nLeaflet supports Web Map Service (WMS) layers, GeoJSON layers, Vector layers and Tile layers natively. Many other types of layers are supported via plugins.\n\nLike other web map libraries, the basic display model implemented by Leaflet is one basemap, plus zero or more translucent overlays, with zero or more vector objects displayed on top.\n\nThe major Leaflet object types are:\nThere is also a variety of utility classes such as interfaces for managing projections, transformations and interacting with the DOM.\n\nLeaflet has core support for few GIS standard formats, with others supported in plugins.\n\nLeaflet 0.7 supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari 5+, Opera 12+ and IE 7-11.\n\nLeaflet is directly comparable with OpenLayers, as both are open source, client-side only JavaScript libraries. The library as a whole is much smaller, around 7,000 lines of code compared to OpenLayers' 230,000 (as of 2015). It has a smaller code footprint than OpenLayers (around 123 KB vs 423 KB) due partly to its modular structure. The code base is newer, and takes advantage of recent features of JavaScript, plus HTML5 and CSS3. However, Leaflet lacks features OpenLayers supports, such as Web Feature Service (WFS) and native support for projections other than Google Web Mercator (EPSG 3857).\n\nIt is also comparable to the proprietary, closed source Google Maps API (debuting in 2005) and Bing Maps API, both of which incorporate a significant server-side component to provide services such as geocoding, routing, search and integration with features such as Google Earth. Google Maps API provides speed and simplicity, but is not flexible, and can only be used to access Google Maps services. The new DataLayer part of Google's API does allow external data sources to be displayed, however.\n\nLeaflet began life in 2010 as \"Web Maps API\", a JavaScript library for the CloudMade mapping provider, where Agafonkin worked at the time. In May 2011, CloudMade announced the first release of Leaflet, built from scratch but using parts of the old API code.\n\nThis release introduced Retina support and many usability and user experience improvements.\n\nThis release expanded the API's range of methods and events, improved usability, and added GeoJSON saving. It was completed in a 2-day code sprint supported by Mapbox.\n\nThis release focused on bug fixing, announcing that refactoring and potential backward incompatibilities would come soon.\n\n\nThis release contained over 400 changes compared to v0.7.7.\n\n\nThis release adds video overlays and makes a transition to ECMAScript 6 modules.\n\n"}
{"id": "7946782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7946782", "title": "Lee shore", "text": "Lee shore\n\nLee shore, sometimes also called leeward and ward shore, is a nautical term used to describe a stretch of shoreline that is to the lee side of a vessel — meaning the wind is blowing towards it. A weather shore has the wind blowing from inland over it out to sea. For example, a person standing on a shore when the wind is blowing out to sea (or any large body of water) is standing on a weather shore. If the wind is blowing into shore from the sea, the person is on a lee shore.\n\nBy definition, \"windward\" is the side of an island where the predominant wind travels from the sea onto the island. \"Leeward\" is the side of an island where the predominant wind travels from the interior of the island to the sea.\n\nThe definition of \"leeward\" is based on its usage: \nAdjective: on the side away from the wind; \"on the leeward side of the island\".\nAdverb: toward [in the direction of] the wind; \"they were sailing leeward\".\nNoun: the side of something that is sheltered from the wind, or the direction in which the wind is blowing; \"to the leeward\".\n\"The traditional nautical pronunciations are the elided forms /ˈljuːərd/[1] and /ˈwɪnərd/, pronounced \"loowerd\" where the first syllable is spoken very briefly, almost as \"l'ward\". The literal pronunciations, /ˈliːwərd/ and /ˈwɪndwərd/, are now more common, and \"lee\" by itself is always pronounced as it is spelled. The pronunciation for the Leeward and Windward Islands and the Leeward Antilles is normally the latter form, with the long \"e\".\"\n\nThe windward shore is a lee shore for vessels traveling offshore, and that shore is \"to leeward\" of the vessel, but that does not make it the leeward shore of the island. Although the terms are often confused, \"the lee shore\" is different from \"a leeward shore\" based on the reference point from which the shore is viewed. Notice the different articles \"the\" and \"a\" — \"the\" windward or leeward shore versus \"a\" lee shore. The shore that is a lee shore changes based on the reference point, which is the vessel from which the island or lake shore is viewed, and of which the island or lake shore is in the lee. The leeward shore does not change based on the position of the vessel. This means that the \"leeward side\" of the vessel and the \"lee shore\" of the land face opposite directions.\n\nTo someone on a vessel, the shore to lee of the vessel is the lee shore, and since that is the shore the wind reaches first, to someone on the shore it is the windward shore. \"Lee\" historically means \"shelter\". Standing on the leeward side of the vessel, a sailor observes being blown towards an exposed shoreline by the wind. Here again the reference point from which a shore is viewed determines whether it is the lee shore or a leeward shore. On a lake, the reference point is a body of water, so the windward shore is upwind of the center of the lake. On an island, the reference point is a landmass, so the windward shore is the shore upwind (most to windward) of the center of the island. On a vessel, however, the windward rail is the one the wind is hitting first, or the one most upwind. The same is true regarding an island: the side of the island most to windward is the windward shore. \n\nA weather shore is potentially treacherous for kitesurfers and windsurfers, who can be blown out to sea if the wind is blowing from the land. For them, a lee shore is safer. For ocean-going vessels during a storm, a lee shore is treacherous because the wind slowly forces the vessel toward the shore, where it will beach or break up. For this reason Bernard Moitessier, the great ocean sailor, called the coastline \"the great whore\"; it attracts sailors during a storm but is in fact highly dangerous. In shallow coastal water, maneuvering is impaired, waves may become steeper, and objects may be obscured. Navigating during a storm, either by chart or by dead reckoning, becomes extremely difficult. A storm surge may make the entrance to a protected body of water prohibitively treacherous or impossible to locate. Heavy weather tactics more often dictate heading out to sea, where deeper water and more room for maneuver allow a sailboat to heave to or adopt other defensive measures. In landsmen's parlance, this is called \"riding out the storm.\"\n\nLee shores are dangerous to watercraft because, if left to drift, they will be pushed into shore by the wind, possibly running aground. Sailboats are particularly susceptible to this, as even under sail they are limited to the angle they can travel into the wind; Square rigged craft, for instance, can point only slightly to windward. It is possible for a sailing vessel to become trapped along a lee shore, with the only recourse being to use an engine, or use anchors to kedge out. The beach of a lee shore in a storm is also at a significantly higher risk due to the undiminished effects of the wind and waves. Because of this, it is always preferable to travel along a windward shore, especially in inclement weather. A windward shore will have significantly lower waves and slower winds, because they will have been slowed by passage over the land, but a windward shore does have its dangers, being subject to storm surge. Numerous shipwrecks have been caused by vessels driven onto a lee shore.\n\nIn Herman Melville's Moby Dick, the lee shore is figured into one of American literature's transcendent passages:\n\n\"Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\n\n\"Know ye, now, Bulkington? Glimpses do you seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?\n\n\"But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God — so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing — straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\" (Chapter 23, \"The Lee Shore\")\n\nDavid Crosby wrote a song \"The Lee Shore\". This was recorded with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash at Stills' house, in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles on December 28, 1969, but originally released in a live version on the album \"Four Way Street\", on April 17, 1971.\n"}

Globally most fault zones are located on divergent plate boundaries on oceanic crust. This means that they are located around mid-ocean ridges and trend perpendicular to them. The term fracture zone is used almost exclusively for features on oceanic crust; similar structures on continental crust are instead termed transform or strike slip faults, a denomination active fracture zones also can have. Some fracture zones have been created by mid-ocean ridge segments that have been subducted and may not longer exist.\n\nMost fracture zones in the Pacific Ocean originate from large mid-ocean ridges (also called \"rises\") such as the East Pacific Rise, Chile Rise and Juan de Fuca Ridge. The plates that host the fractures are Nazca, Pacific, Antarctic, Juan de Fuca and Cocos among others. Fracture zones being subducted under Southern and Central America are generally southwest-northeast oriented reflecting the relative motion of Cocos, Nazca and the Antarctic Plates.\n\nThe fracture zones of the Chile Rise trend in a west to east fashion with the most southern ones taking a slightly more southwest to northeast orientation. This non-perpendicular relation to Chile’s coast reflects the oblique subduction of Nazca Plate under southern Chile. West of Chile rise the fracture zones are hosted in the Antarctic Plate. Some fracture zones such as Chile and Valdivia make up large sections of the Nazca-Antarctic Plate boundary.\n\n\nMolokai and Murray fracture zones shown in the list were created by ridge segments that no longer exist.\n\n\nIn the Atlantic Ocean most fracture zones originate from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs from north to south, and are therefore west to east oriented in general.

The marker was initially placed in 1891; from 1901 to 1989, it was the reference location relative to which all locations in the United States were measured, and from 1913 to 1989, it was the reference location for all surveys in the continent.\n\nIn 1973, the site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as Geodetic Center of the United States.\n\nIn surveying, a geodetic datum is a point or set of points used to establish a coordinate system. By designating the location of one point, and the direction from that point to a second point, one can establish a system relative to which other points can be located and mapped. As one surveys a larger area over which the curvature of the Earth becomes significant, it also becomes necessary to define an ellipsoid: a curved surface that approximates the shape of the Earth in the area of interest.\n\nThe first nationwide datum in the United States was established in 1879. At that time, a region of contiguous triangulation existed from Maine to Georgia. The New England Datum was chosen with a benchmark in Maryland, near the middle of this region, as the horizontal datum, and a second Maryland mark used to define the azimuth (horizontal) direction. To account for the Earth's curvature, the datum used a model called the Clarke spheroid, developed in 1866.\n\nThe U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey established a triangulation station, officially known as the Meades Ranch Triangulation Station, in 1891. The location lay near the intersection of two transcontinental arcs of triangulation: one running from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, roughly following the 39th parallel; the other running from Mexico to Canada, along the 98th meridian.\n\nIn 1901, the Meades Ranch station was chosen as the United States standard horizontal datum: the point relative to which all land measurements in the nation were made. The choice was based on the station's location near the geographic center of the U.S. and near the intersection of the two arcs of triangulation, and because it minimized the number of changes in previously published positions. Its position was officially set as 39°13'26.686\" N and 98°32'30.506\" W; the azimuth direction to a triangulation station near Waldo, southwest of Meades Ranch, was officially set as 75°28'14.52\" west of south.\n\nIn 1913, the chief astronomer of the Dominion of Canada Astronomical Observatory and the director of the Comisión Geodésica Mexicana announced that their organizations would use the Meades Ranch location as their standard datum. In light of this, its name was changed to the \"North American Datum\".\n\nAs more new surveys and previously isolated survey networks were incorporated into the system, it became increasingly difficult to make the necessary corrections. By the mid-1920s, it was realized that the coordinate system needed to be adjusted. From 1927 to 1932, the approximately 25,000 existing control locations were recalculated and a new coordinate system developed, known as NAD27. The new system continued to use the 1901 coordinates of Meades Ranch as its horizontal datum, and the Clarke spheroid as its model for the Earth's surface. However, it now defined horizontal directions in terms of 175 Laplace azimuths, which use astronomical azimuths corrected for the difference between the astronomic and geodetic meridians. Under NAD27, the azimuth to the Waldo station changed by about 5\".\n\nIn 1973, the Meades Ranch site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, under the name \"Geodetic Center of the United States\".\n\nFollowing the establishment of NAD27, it was noted that it produced a discrepancy of about in latitudes in the northern part of the northern U.S. state of Michigan, necessitating a regional adjustment for the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. As the survey network was extended further north into Canada, similar discrepancies appeared. The problem proved to be systemic: It had been assumed that the differences between the Clarke spheroid and the actual geoid were negligible, whereas these differences actually introduced significant errors. The relatively small number and large separation of the points used to develop NAD27, the limited computational power available to its designers, and the movement of tectonic plates also led to inconsistencies in NAD27 coordinates.\n\nTo address these, a new datum was developed, designated NAD83. It replaced the Clarke spheroid with a new ellipsoid, the Geographic Reference System 1980, centered at the Earth's center of mass as determined by the Bureau International de l'Heure. The new datum was based on adjustment of 250,000 points, including 600 satellite Doppler stations. NAD83 was officially adopted by the U.S. government in 1989, and by the Canadian government in 1990. Under the new system, Meades Ranch lost its special standing, and became one of thousands of stations.\n\nAs of 2012, the location of the Meades Ranch station was . It lies about north of Lucas and about southwest of Tipton.\n\nThe station is on a low grassy ridge in a pasture. It is marked by a bronze disc, inscribed \"Meades Ranch 1891\", embedded in the top of a dome-shaped concrete marker in diameter, rising about above ground level. Two reference marks and an azimuth mark are located nearby.\n\nThe Meades Ranch station is on private land, with no public access. A replica of the station marker, with a Kansas historical marker explaining its significance, is located at , in a roadside rest area beside U.S. Highway 281 at the northern edge of Osborne, Kansas, northwest of the Meades Ranch site.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7374488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7374488", "title": "Origin theories of Christopher Columbus", "text": "Origin theories of Christopher Columbus\n\nThe exact ethnic or national origin of Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) has been a source of speculation since the 19th century. The general consensus among historians is that Columbus' family was from the coastal region of Liguria, that he spent his boyhood and early youth in the Republic of Genoa, in Genoa, in Vico Diritto, and that he subsequently lived in Savona, where his father Domenico moved in 1470. Much of this evidence derives from data concerning Columbus' immediate family connections in Genoa and opinions voiced by contemporaries concerning his Genoese origins, which few dispute.\n\nIn a 1498 deed of primogeniture, Columbus writes:\n\nMany historians, including a distinguished Spanish scholar, Altolaguirre, affirm the document's authenticity; others believe it apocryphal. Some believe that the fact that it was produced in court, during a lawsuit among the heirs of Columbus, in 1578, does not strengthen the case for its being genuine.\n\nA letter from Columbus, dated 2 April 1502, to the Bank of Saint George, the oldest and most reputable of Genoa's financial institutions, begins with the words:\n\nAlthough a few people consider this letter suspect, the vast majority of scholars believe it genuine. The most scrupulous examination by graphologists testifies in favour of authenticity. The letter is one of a group of documents entrusted by Columbus to a Genoese friend, after the bitter experiences of his third voyage, before setting out on his fourth.\n\nIn the spring of 1502, Columbus collected notarized copies of all the writings concerned with his rights to the discovery of new lands. He sent these documents to Nicolò Oderico, ambassador of the Republic of Genoa. To this same Oderico he handed over the letter to the Bank of Saint George, in which he announced that he was leaving the bank one-tenth of his income, with a recommendation for his son Diego. Oderico returned to Genoa and delivered the letter to the bank, which replied, on 8 December 1502 lauding the gesture of their \"renowned fellow-citizen\" towards his \"native land\". The reply, unfortunately, never reached its destination; Columbus, back in Castile after his fourth voyage, complained about this in another letter to Ambassador Oderico, dated 27 December 1504, and promptly annulled the bequest.\n\nThe first letter was preserved in the archives of the Bank of Saint George until it was taken over by the municipality of Genoa; the other three remained in the Oderico family archives until 1670, when they were donated to the Republic of Genoa. After the fall of the Republic, they passed to the library of one of its last senators, Michele Cambiaso, and were finally acquired by the city of Genoa. There are also public and notarial acts (more than a hundred) — copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona — regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\n\nAnother doubt remains to be settled: can we be sure that all of the documents cited concern the Christopher Columbus who was later to become \"Cristóbal Colón\", admiral of the Ocean Sea in Spanish territory? The list of contemporary ambassadors and historians unanimous in the belief that Columbus was Genoese could suffice as proof, but there is something more: a document dated 22 September 1470 in which the criminal judge convicts Domenico Colombo. The conviction is tied to the debt of Domenico — together with his son Christopher (explicitly stated in the document) — toward a certain Girolamo del Porto. In the will dictated by Admiral Christopher Columbus in Valladolid before he died, the authentic and indisputable document which we have today, the dying navigator remembers this old debt, which had evidently not been paid. There is, in addition, the act drawn in Genoa on 25 August 1479 by a notary, Girolamo Ventimiglia. This act is known as the \"Assereto document\", after the scholar who found it in the State Archives in Genoa in 1904. It involves a lawsuit over a sugar transaction on the Atlantic island Madeira. In it, young Christopher swore that he was a 27-year-old Genoese citizen resident in Portugal and had been hired to represent the Genoese merchants in that transaction. Here was proof that he had relocated to Portugal. It is important to bear in mind that at the time when Assereto traced the document, it would have been impossible to make an acceptable facsimile. Nowadays, with modern chemical processes, a document can be \"manufactured\", made to look centuries old if need be, with such skill that it may be difficult to prove it is a fake. In 1960, this was still impossible.\n\nIn addition to the two documents cited, there are others that confirm the identification of the Genoese Christopher Columbus, son of Domenico, with the admiral of Spain. An act dated 11 October 1496 says:\n\nIn a fourth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 8 April 1500, Sebastiano Cuneo, heir by half to his father Corrado, requested that Christopher and Giacomo (called Diego), the sons and heirs of Domenico Colombo, be summoned to court and sentenced to pay the price for two lands located in Legine. This document confirms Christoforo and Diego's absence from the Republic of Genoa with these exact words: \"dicti conventi sunt absentes ultra Pisas et Niciam.\"\nA fifth notarial act, drawn in Savona on 26 January 1501, is more explicit. A group of Genoese citizens, under oath, said and say, together and separately and in every more valid manner and guise, that Christopher, Bartholomew and Giacomo Columbus, sons and heirs of the aforementioned Domenico, their father, have for a long time been absent from the city and the jurisdiction of Savona, as well as Pisa and Nice in Provence, and that they reside in the area of Spain, as was and is well known.\nFinally, there is a very important sixth document from the notary of Bartolomeo Oddino, drawn in Savona on 30 March 1515. With this notarial act, Leon Pancaldo, the well-known Savonese who would become one of the pilots for Magellan's voyage, sends his own father-in-law in his place as procurator for Diego Columbus, son of Admiral Christopher Columbus. The document demonstrates how the ties, in part economic, of the discoverer's family with Savona survived even his death.\n\nA biography written by Columbus's son Ferdinand (in Spanish and translated to Italian), \"Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo; nelle quali s'ha particolare, et vera relatione della vita, et de' fatti dell'Ammiraglio D. Christoforo Colombo, suo padre; Et dello scoprimento, ch'egli fece delle Indie Occidentali, dette Nuovo Mondo\" (\"The life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand\"), exists. \nIn it, Ferdinand claimed that his father was of Italian aristocracy. He describes Columbus to be a descendant of a Count Columbo of the Castle Cuccaro (Montferrat). Columbo was in turn said to be descended from a legendary Roman General Colonius. It is now widely believed that Christopher Columbus used this persona to ingratiate himself with the aristocracy, an elaborate illusion to mask a humble merchant background. Ferdinand dismissed the fanciful story that the Admiral descended from the Colonus mentioned by Tacitus. However, he refers to \"those two illustrious Coloni, his relatives.\" According to Note 1, on page 287, these two \"were corsairs not related to each other or to Christopher Columbus, one being Guillame de Casenove, nicknamed Colombo, Admiral of France in the reign of Louis XI\". At the top of page 4, Ferdinand listed Nervi, Cogoleto, Bogliasco, Savona, Genoa and Piacenza (all inside the former Republic of Genoa) as possible places of origin. He also stated:\n\nIn chapter ii, Ferdinand accuses Agostino Giustiniani of telling lies about the discoverer:\n\nIn chapter v, he writes:\n\nFerdinand also says (chapter xi) that before he was declared admiral, his father used to sign himself \"Columbus de Terra rubra,\" that is to say, Columbus of Terrarossa, a village or hamlet near Genoa. In another passage, Ferdinand says that his father went to Lisbon and taught his brother Bartholomew to construct sea charts, globes and nautical instruments; and sent this brother to England to make proposals to Henry VII of his desired voyage. Finally, Ferdinand says incidentally (chapter lxxii) that Christopher's brother, Bartholomew Columbus named the new settlement Santo Domingo in memory of their father, Domenico.\n\nThe publication of \"Historie\" has been used by historians as providing indirect evidence about the Genoese origin of Columbus.\n\nIt is significant that no one protested at the court of Spain when in April 1501, in the feverish atmosphere of the great discovery, Nicolò Oderico, ambassador of the Genoese Republic, after praising the Catholic Sovereigns, went on to say that they \"discovered with great expenditure hidden and inaccessible places under the command of Columbus, our fellow-citizen, and having tamed wild barbarians and unknown peoples, they educated them in religion, manners and laws\". Furthermore, two diplomats from Venice — no great friend of Genoa, indeed, a jealous rival — added the appellation \"Genoese\" to Columbus's name: the first, Angelo Trevisan, in 1501, the second, Gasparo Contarini, in 1525. In 1498, Pedro de Ayala, Spanish ambassador to the English court, mentioned John Cabot, \"the discoverer, another Genoese, like Columbus\". All these references were published, along with reproductions of some of the original documents, in the City of Genoa volume of 1931.\n\nThe historian Bartolomé de las Casas, whose father traveled with Columbus on his second journey and who personally knew Columbus' sons, writes in chapter 2 of his \"Historia de las Indias\":\n\nThe historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, writes that Domenico Colombo was the Admiral's father; and in chapter 2, book 3 of his \"Historia general y natural de las Indias\":\n\nMany contemporary writers agree that the discoverer was Genoese:\n\n\nColumbus's Genoese birth is also confirmed by the works of the English Hakluyt (1601), of the Spaniard Antonio de Herrera (1612), the great Spanish dramatist Lope de Vega (1614), a paper manuscript dated 1626, conserved in Madrid's National Library, the works of the German Filioop Cluwer (1677), the German Giovanni Enrico Alsted (1649), the French Dionisio Petau (1724), and the Spaniard Luigi de Marmol (1667). This list represents the early writings of non-Italians. There were sixty-two Italian testimonies between 1502 and 1600. Of these fourteen are from Ligurian writers. It may be obvious, but not useless, to underline that the Venetians' (e.g. Trevisan's and Ramusio's) recognition of Columbus's Genoese birth constitutes a testimony as impartial as that of the Spaniards, French, and Portuguese.\n\nConformable to the testament in Seville (3 July 1539) is the evidence of Ferdinand Columbus, who states that his father was \"conterraneo\" (of the same country) with Mons. Agostino Giustiniani, who was, beyond all doubt, born at Genoa:\n\nOther testimony of contemporary or succeeding authors include:\n\n\nScholars from all over the world agree that Columbus was Genoese.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison, in his book \"Christopher Columbus: Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", notes that many existing legal documents demonstrate the Genoese origin of Columbus, his father Domenico, and his brothers Bartolomeo and Giacomo (Diego). These documents, written in Latin by notaries, were legally valid in Genoese courts. The documents, uncovered in the 19th century when Italian historians examined the Genoese archives, form part of the \"Raccolta Colombiana\". On page 14, Morison writes:Besides these documents from which we may glean facts about Christopher's early life, there are others which identify the Discoverer as the son of Domenico the wool weaver, beyond the possibility of doubt. For instance, Domenico had a brother Antonio, like him a respectable member of the lower middle class in Genoa. Antonio had three sons: Matteo, Amigeto and Giovanni, who was generally known as Giannetto (the Genoese equivalent of \"Johnny\"). Giannetto, like Christopher, gave up a humdrum occupation to follow the sea. In 1496 the three brothers met in a notary's office at Genoa and agreed that Johnny should go to Spain and seek out his first cousin \"Don Cristoforo de Colombo, Admiral of the King of Spain,\" each contributing one third of the traveling expenses. This quest for a job was highly successful. The Admiral gave Johnny command of a caravel on the Third Voyage to America, and entrusted him with confidential matters as well.On the topic of Columbus' being born somewhere besides Genoa, Morison states \"Every contemporary Spaniard or Portuguese who wrote about Columbus and his discoveries calls him Genoese. Four contemporary Genoese chroniclers claim him as a compatriot. Every early map on which his nationality is recorded describes him as Genoese or \"Ligur\", a citizen of the Ligurian Republic. Nobody in the Admiral's lifetime, or for three centuries after, had any doubt about his birthplace\" and that \"There is no more reason to doubt that Christopher Columbus was a Genoese-born Catholic Christian, steadfast in his faith and proud of his native city, than to doubt that George Washington was a Virginia-born Anglican of English race, proud of being an American.\"\n\nThe position of Morison, is adopted by the British historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto, who writes in his book:The Catalan, French, Galician, Greek, Ibizan, Jewish, Majorcan, Polish, Scottish, and other increasingly silly Columbuses concocted by historical fantasists are agenda-driven creations, usually inspired by a desire to arrogate a supposed or confected hero to the cause of a particular nation or historic community - or, more often than not, to some immigrant group striving to establish a special place of esteem in the United States. The evidence of Columbus's origins in Genoa is overwhelming: almost no other figure of his class or designation has left so clear a paper trail in the archives.Paolo Emilio Taviani, in his book \"Cristoforo Colombo: Genius of the Sea\" discusses \"the public and notarial acts - original copies of which are conserved in the archives of Genoa and Savona - regarding Columbus's father, Columbus himself, his grandfather, and his relatives.\" In \"Columbus the Great Adventure\" he further claims that Columbus named the small island of Saona \"to honor Michele da Cuneo, his friend from Savona.\"\n\nThis is fully accepted by Consuelo Varela Bueno, \"Spain's leading authority on the texts, documents, and handwriting of Columbus.\" She devotes several pages to the question of Columbus native land, and concludes that \"all chroniclers of that period wrote that he was from Liguria in northern Italy.\" The evidence supporting the Genoese origin of Columbus is also discussed by Miles H. Davidson. In his book \"Columbus Then and Now: A Life Reexamined\", he writes:Diego Méndez, one of his captains, in testimony given in the <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Pleitos<nowiki>\"</nowiki>, he said that Columbus was \"Genoese, a native of Savona which is a town near Genoa.\" Those who reject this and the more than ample other contemporary evidence, given by both Italian and Spanish sources as well as by witnesses at these court hearings, are simply flying in the face of overwhelming evidence. [...] What is the reason behind so much futile speculation? It can be mostly attributed to parochialism. Each of the nations and cities mentioned wants to claim him for its own. Since no effort was made to locate the supporting data until the early nineteenth century, and since at that time not all of the archives had been adequately researched, there was, initially, justification for those early efforts to establish who he was and where he came from. To do so today is to fulfill Montaigne's maxim, \"No one is exempt from talking non-sense; the misfortune is to do it solemnly.\"\n\nThe spoken language of Genova and the Ligurian coast would primarily have been the Ligurian language. The Italian language was originally based on the fourteenth century vernacular of Florence in the adjacent region of Tuscany, and would not have been the main spoken language of Genova in the fifteenth century.\n\nAlthough Columbus wrote almost exclusively in Spanish, there is a small handwritten Genoese gloss in a 1498 Italian (from Venice) edition of \"Pliny's Natural History\" that he read after his second voyage to America: this shows Columbus was able to write in Genoese and read Italian. There is also a note in Italian in his own \"Book of Prophecies\" exhibiting, according to historian August Kling, \"characteristics of northern Italian humanism in its calligraphy, syntax, and spelling\". Phillips and Phillips point out that 500 years ago, the Romance languages had not distanced themselves to the degree they have today. Bartolomé de las Casas in his \"Historia de las Indias\" claimed that Columbus did not know Spanish well and that he was not born in Castile.\n\nValiant scholars have dedicated themselves to the subject of Christopher Columbus's language. They have conducted in-depth research both on the ship's log and on other writings of his that have come down to the modern day. They have analyzed the words, the terms, and the vocabulary, as well as rather frequent variations often bizarre in style, handwriting, grammar, and syntax. Christopher Columbus's language is Castilian punctuated by noteworthy and frequent Lusitanian, Italian, and Genoese influences and elements.\n\nSince the early 20th century, researchers have attempted to connect Columbus to the Catalan-speaking areas of Spain, usually based on linguistic evidence. The first to propose a birthplace under the Crown of Aragon was Peruvian historian Luis Ulloa in a book originally published in 1927 in French. Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, University of Madrid historian of America, said that Ulloa's \"fiery imagination\" had placed abstruse interpretations on court documents to support his thesis, had found no positive proof, and had dismissed as false any evidence supporting a Genoese origin.\n\nThroughout Columbus's life, he referred to himself as \"Christobal Colom\"; his contemporaries and family also referred to him as such. It is possible that Colom is the shortened form of Columbus used for the Italian surname Colombo (which means \"dove\"). Colom can also be a Portuguese, French, or Catalan name, and in the latter means \"dove\". There was a wealthy mercenary and merchant noble named Joan Colom i Bertran living in Barcelona in the 15th century, who has been proposed as the real Christopher Columbus.\n\nSome more recent studies also state Columbus had Catalan origins, based on his handwriting, though these have been disputed. Charles J. Merrill, a specialist in medieval Catalan literature at Mount St. Mary's University, claims Columbus's handwriting is typical of a native Catalan, and his mistakes in Castilian are \"most likely\" transfer errors from Catalan, with examples such as \"a todo arreo\" (a tot arreu), \"todo de un golpe\" (tot d'un cop), \"setcentas\" (set-centes), \"nombre\" (instead of número), \"al sol puesto\" (el sol post). Merrill states that the Genoese Cristoforo Colombo was a modest wool carder and cheese merchant with no maritime training and whose age does not match the one of Columbus. Merrill's book \"Colom of Catalonia\" was published in 2008.\n\nHowever, Samuel Eliot Morison has cast no doubts regarding Columbus's marriage to the Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Perestrello.\n\nSome researchers have postulated that Columbus was of Iberian Jewish origins. The linguist Estelle Irizarry, in addition to arguing that Columbus was Catalan, also claims that Columbus tried to conceal a Jewish heritage. In \"Three Sources of Textual Evidence of Columbus, Crypto Jew,\" Irizarry notes that Columbus always wrote in Spanish, occasionally included Hebrew in his writing, and referenced the Jewish High Holidays in his journal during the first voyage.\n\nIn a 1973 book, Simon Wiesenthal (1908–2005) postulated that Columbus was a Sephardi (Spanish Jew), careful to conceal his Judaism yet also eager to locate a place of refuge for his persecuted fellow countrymen. Wiesenthal argued that Columbus' concept of sailing west to reach the Indies was less the result of geographical theories than of his faith in certain Biblical texts—specifically the Book of Isaiah. He repeatedly cited two verses from that book: \"Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them,\" (60:9); and \"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth\" (65:17). Wiesenthal claimed that Columbus felt that his voyages had confirmed these prophecies.\n\nJane Francis Amler argued that Columbus was a \"converso\" (a Sephardi Jew who publicly converted to Christianity). In Spain, even some converted Jews were forced to leave Spain after much persecution; it is known that many \"conversos\" were still practicing Judaism in secret.\n\nIn a footnote to his translation of George Sand's \"Un hiver à Majorque\", Robert Graves remarks: \"There is strong historical evidence for supposing that Cristobal Colom (Christopher Columbus) was a Majorcan Jew; his surname is still common in the island.\" \n\nThe theory that Columbus was a Byzantine Greek nobleman was first proposed in scholarly fashion in 1943 by Seraphim G. Canoutas, a Greek-American lawyer and independent scholar. The hypothesis rested mainly on statements attributed to Columbus by his son Ferdinand that Columbus had sailed for many years with Colombo the Younger, a famous seaman \"of his name and family.\" Canoutas pointed out that other scholars (including Harrisse, Salvagnini, Vignaud, and Gonzales de la Rosa) had convincingly identified Colombo the Younger as Georges Paléologue de Bissipat (also known as Georges le Grec), an exiled Byzantine nobleman who was living in France by 1460 and rendering valuable service to the French king. However, these scholars rejected Columbus’s claim of kinship with de Bissipat.\n\nAccepting the kinship claim as true, Canoutas established (through references to works by Du Cange and Renet) that Georges de Bissipat was in fact Georgios Palaiologos Dishypatos, scion of an ancient Byzantine noble family, who fled to France sometime after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and, until his death in 1496, rendered important service to French kings Louis XI (1423–1483) and Charles VIII (1470–1498), including as vice-admiral. According to Canoutas, accepting that Dishypatos and Columbus were noble kinsmen and longtime sailing companions helped explain many anomalies that had to be ignored, or attributed to error or imposture in order to reconcile the accepted account of Columbus's early life as a wool-worker's son with his later life as a nobleman and Admiral.\n\nCanoutas did not identify Columbus’s parents or place of birth, nor did he analyze Columbus’s claimed kinship bond with Dishypatos. However, Canoutas observed that the Byzantine imperial house of Palaiologos, to which Dishypatos was related on his mother’s side, was closely connected by blood or marriage to the ruling families of Italy, including those of Genoa and Montferrat, such as the Doria, Spinola, Centurione, and Gattelusio families. For example, the Palaiologos family were the rulers of Montferrat for more than 200 years. This connection, he argued, might explain why Columbus’s contemporaries and others considered him to be Genoese or Ligurian.\n\nAnother book written on his Greek origins is called \"Christopher Columbus Was a Greek Prince and His real Name Was Nikolaos Ypsilantis from the Greek Island of Chios\" by Spyros Cateras, New Hampshire, 1937. There is also a section in \"The Secret Destiny of America\" by Manly P. Hall, New York, 1944. pp 62–63.\n\nThe first author who claimed Portuguese nationality for Christopher Columbus was Patrocínio Ribeiro in 1916. The same text with some additions was again published in 1927, after his death, with a complementary study by the medical doctor Barbosa Soeiro relating Columbus' signature with the Kabbalah.\n\nIn 1988 José Mascarenhas Barreto published a book which claims that Columbus was a Portuguese national and spy who hatched up an elaborate diversion to keep the Spanish from the lucrative trade routes that were opening up around Africa to the Indies. Barreto, through his interpretation of the Kabbalah and other research, suggested Columbus was born in Cuba, Portugal, the son of a nobleman and related to other Portuguese navigators. According to this claim, his real name was concealed, Christopher Columbus being a pseudonym, meaning Bearer of Christ and the Holy Spirit. His real name was supposedly Salvador Fernandes Zarco and he was the son of Dom Fernando, Duke of Beja, Alentejo and maternal grandson of João Gonçalves Zarco, discoverer of Madeira. Mascarenhas Barreto, however, has been discredited by Portuguese genealogist Luís Paulo Manuel de Meneses de Melo Vaz de São Paio in his works \"Carta Aberta a um Agente Secreto, Primeira Carta Aberta a Mascarenhas Barreto\" and \"Carta Aberta a um \"Curioso\" da Genealogia\". \n\nProponents of the Portuguese hypothesis also point to a court document which stated that Columbus' nationality was \"Portuguese\" and in another Columbus uses the words \"my homeland\" in relation to Portugal. \n\nThis theory was popularized among the Portuguese public by the 2005 novel \"Codex 632\", a best-seller written by José Rodrigues dos Santos.\n\nWriting in \"The Polish Review\", Krystyna Lukasiewicz commented on rumours that King Władysław III of Poland did not die in 1444 but hid on the island of Madeira:Beginning in all probability around the time of Henrique [Alemão]'s death, such rumors were for the first time recorded in the early eighteenth century. Further popularized by Leopold Kielanowski in the twentieth century, they became the starting point for a bizarre hypothesis that Christopher Columbus was actually the son of King Wladyslaw III Jagiellon hiding on Madeira under the name of Henrique Alemão.Lukasiewicz cites Manuel da Silva Rosa's \"Colón la Historia Nunca Contad\" (2009) as supporting this hypothesis. Rosa is an information technology analyst and amateur historian. In his book Rosa claims that Columbus was the son of a Portuguese noblewoman and the king of Poland Władysław III who allegedly survived the battle of Varna in 1444 and later lived in Madeira. Rosa believes Columbus would not have been able to marry Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, a Portuguese noblewoman, if he were not of noble birth. Rosa also suggests Columbus was a Portuguese secret agent working covertly in Spain and claims similarities exist between Columbus' coat of arms and that of the Polish king.\n\nThe Spanish historian Marisa Azuara has hypothesized that Columbus could be a Sardinian noble from the town of Sanluri, called \"Christòval Colòn\": she claimed that he was son of Salvatore of Siena and Alagon and Isabella Alagon of Arborea, related to Pope Pius II. At the time of his birth, the island of Sardinia was partially under Genoese economic and political rule, until it was conquered at the end of 15th century by the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nChristòval Colòn would be born in 1436 and he spent his youth studying nautical science, and he spoke both Italian and Spanish.\n\nIn Calvi, a town on the north coast of Corsica, France, which used to be part of the Genoese Empire, one can see the ruins of a house that locals believe to be Columbus' birthplace.\n\nNorwegians Svein Grodys and writer Tor Borch Sannes have investigated the anecdote that Columbus was born in Nordfjord, Norway. In his 1991 book \"Christopher Columbus – en europeer fra Norge\", Borch Sannes highlights Ferdinand Columbus' claim that the name \"Colonus\" (farmer) was a translation of a foreign name. Sannes points out that if Columbus were of Scandinavian descent, \"Colonus\" would be derived from \"Bonde\", as in the House of Bonde. He points out that the coat of arms of both Columbus and the royal Bonde lineage of Sweden were similar and at the time used a bend. More specifically, Borch Sannes claims that Iohannes Colon, the grandfather of Christopher Columbus, was one Johannes Bonde, the grandson of Tord Bonde and thus a first cousin of King Charles VIII of Sweden/Charles I of Norway (whose name was Karl Knudsson Bonde), and a second cousin of Erik Johansson Vasa. Borch Sannes further points out that two of Columbus' father's neighbours had the name \"Bondi\". Columbus also had close acquaintances called \"Galli\", almost the name of another important Norwegian noble family at the time, \"Galle\", as well as \"Scotto\", a name Sannes speculates could be Scottish-Norwegian (in the original form \"Schytte\", meaning \"Scot\"). According to Borch Sannes, the Bonde lineage originally had its seat in Hyen, Nordfjord, but disappeared from Nordfjord with the Black Death. Based on what he admits is circumstantial evidence, Borch Sannes nevertheless outlines a scenario in which Columbus could have been born in Nordfjord. Sannes' book also claims that Columbus may have visited Devon Island in 1477, based on Columbus' description of the 73rd parallel north. Other writers have highlighted Columbus' links to the Justiniani family of Genova, pointing out that the Genovese Paulus Justiniani was the bishop of Bergen from 1457-60. A monument to Columbus has been raised in Hyen.\n\nOn 10 March 2009, British newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that Spanish engineer and amateur historian Alfonso Ensenat de Villalonga claimed that Christopher Columbus was \"\"the son of shopkeepers not weavers and he was baptised Pedro not Christopher\" and \"his family name was Scotto, and was not Italian but of Scottish origin\"\".\n"}

His contribution to development has been in four areas: \n\nBlaikie was born in wartime Scotland, in Helensburgh. He was educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read the Geography Tripos (1964) and completed a PhD (1971). He lectured in geography at the University of Reading from 1968 to 1972, before spending 33 years at the University of East Anglia, in the School of Development Studies, where he eventually became Professor. He retired in 2003 but has remained professionally active.\n\nOf all his work his best known is the small volume published in 1985 \"Political Economy of Soil Erosion in Developing Countries\". In this book, and elsewhere, he argues that soil erosion should not only, or even mainly, be thought of as being the result of mismanagement, overpopulation or for environmental reasons but can often be due to the effects of political economy on poor farmers. His earliest work was based on the case of Nepal, where the marginalisation of peasant farmers onto steep slopes has resulted in erosion. Blaikie writes \"A principal conclusion of this book is that soil erosion in lesser developed countries will not be substantially reduced unless it seriously threatens the accumulation possibilities of the dominant classes\" (p147).\n\nBlaikie's legacy from this book was the beginnings of regional political ecology, a particular approach to understanding the economic and political drivers of resource degradation and particularly the lack of access to natural resources suffered by poor or marginalised people. In \"Land Degradation and Society\" (1987) the approach received further development. Blaikie regards an environmental problem as rooted in processes operating at different nested scales, moving from the local to the international political economy. The job of the political ecologist is to work out how these scaled factors interrelate. In \"AIDS in Africa\" Blaikie and UEA colleague Tony Barnett applied the approach to understanding the contemporary AIDS crisis in Africa, based on substantial fieldwork in East Africa.\n\nThe first edition of \"At Risk\" (1994) applied the approach once again to a range of so-called 'natural' disasters, which were found to be significantly magnified by inequality and capitalist greed, leaving affected people in a 'reproduction squeeze'. This they called the 'pressure-release model', where root causes – power, structures, resources, political systems, economic systems lie behind disaster pressures – e.g. lack of local institutions, rapid urbanisation. These lead to unsafe conditions – physical environment, local economy, vulnerability, public actions. On the physical side of the equation is a natural hazard. Risk=hazard+vulnerability.\n\nBy this stage in the 1990s, political ecology had 'arrived' as a framework in the social sciences, and critiques began to be heard concerning the rigidities of some aspects of the framework. \"At Risk\" was rewritten and reissued in 2004, responding to these criticisms\n\n\n"}

Sedimentologists apply their understanding of modern processes to interpret geologic history through observations of sedimentary rocks and sedimentary structures.\n\nSedimentary rocks cover up to 75% of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and harbor the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, the study of the physical and temporal relationships between rock layers or strata.\n\nThe premise that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is the basis for determining how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.\n\nThere are four primary types of sedimentary rocks: clastics, carbonates, evaporites, and chemical.\n\nSedimentary rocks provide a multitude of products which modern and ancient society has come to utilise.\n\nThe aim of sedimentology, studying sediments, is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit, and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins, and thus, the Earth's geological history as a whole.\n\nThe scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism, which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the Earth's surface today.\n\nSedimentological conditions are recorded within the sediments as they are laid down; the form of the sediments at present reflects the events of the past and all events which affect the sediments, from the source of the sedimentary material to the stresses enacted upon them after diagenesis are available for study.\n\nThe principle of superposition is critical to the interpretation of sedimentary sequences, and in older metamorphic terrains or fold and thrust belts where sediments are often intensely folded or deformed, recognising younging indicators or graded bedding is critical to interpretation of the sedimentary section and often the deformation and metamorphic structure of the region.\n\nFolding in sediments is analysed with the principle of original horizontality, which states that sediments are deposited at their angle of repose which, for most types of sediment, is essentially horizontal. Thus, when the younging direction is known, the rocks can be \"unfolded\" and interpreted according to the contained sedimentary information.\n\nThe principle of lateral continuity states that layers of sediment initially extend laterally in all directions unless obstructed by a physical object or topography.\n\nThe principle of cross-cutting relationships states that whatever cuts across or intrudes into the layers of strata is younger than the layers of strata.\n\nThe methods employed by sedimentologists to gather data and evidence on the nature and depositional conditions of sedimentary rocks include;\n\nThe longstanding understanding of how some mudstones form has been challenged by geologists at Indiana University (Bloomington) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The research, which appears in the December 14th, 2007, edition of \"Science\", counters the prevailing view of geologists that mud only settles when water is slow-moving or still, instead showing that \"muds will accumulate even when currents move swiftly.\" The research shows that some mudstones may have formed in fast-moving waters: \"Mudstones can be deposited under more energetic conditions than widely assumed, requiring a reappraisal of many geologic records.\"\n\nMacquaker and Bohacs, in reviewing the research of Schieber et al., state that \"these results call for critical reappraisal of all mudstones previously interpreted as having been continuously deposited under still waters. Such rocks are widely used to infer past climates, ocean conditions, and orbital variations.\"\n\nConsiderable recent research into mudstones has been driven by the recent effort to commercially produce hydrocarbons from them, in both the Shale gas and Tight Oil (or Light Tight Oil) plays.\n\n"}

It measures, depending on the definition, between and . The name is most often applied to the area within the circle made by the villages of Tubber, Corofin, Kilfenora, Lisdoonvarna, and Ballyvaughan, and Kinvara in extreme south-western Galway, including the adjacent coastline. \n\nA part of the Burren forms the Burren National Park, the smallest of the six National Parks in Ireland, while the full Burren and adjacent territory including the Cliffs of Moher are included in the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark.\n\nWhile the name is generally applied to the limestone uplands of northwestern Clare, and adjacent lowlands, and generally excludes the area of \"Clare shales\" to the southwest, the exact extent of the area is not clearly defined, and geologically it does extend into County Galway to both the north and northeast (see \"Geology\" below). The southeastern pocket of Co. Galway around Kinvara is usually included, and is the base for many Burren organisations. \nThe Burren is certainly bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and by Galway Bay, with the Aran Islands representing a geological extension of the limestone hills that make up most of The Burren.\n\nAccording to one definition, the Burren extends south to a line from the coastal resort of Lahinch to Corofin and is delimited in the east by a line roughly from Kinvara to Kilmacduagh monastery, near Gort. Note that taken literally, this would includes places like the town of Ennistymon and the Cliffs of Moher, which would more commonly be considered as neighbouring the Burren. In another definition, the \"Burren Programme\" defines the region as extending well into the Gort plain, encompassing inter alia Coole Park and the turloughs around it, while to the south it would extend to Ruan and Crusheen, and in the southwest to the edge of Doolin, as well as the routine Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and Corofin.\n\nThus the stated size of the Burren varies between around (the core area of exposed limestone), through (taking in all limestone landscapes) and 560 square kilometers (including the about of downland), depending on the approach taken. Roughly 60% of the uplands show exposed limestone pavement.\n\nThe Burren has an unusually temperate climate for western Ireland. Average air temperatures range from 15 °C in July to 4-6 °C in January, while the soil temperature does not usually drop below 6 °C (as an exception, in late 2010, there was a prolonged period of snow). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above 6 °C, this means that The Burren (like the neighbouring Aran Islands) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland or Britain, and supports diverse and rich plant growth.\n\nThe area has around of annual rainfall (more than twice the amount observed in eastern Ireland), with an average level of over monthly from October to January\n\nLate May is the sunniest time, and also a good time to view flowers, with the gentians and avens peaking (but orchid species blooming later).\n\nDuring counter-guerrilla operations in The Burren in 1651-52, Edmund Ludlow stated, \"(Burren) is a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him... and yet their cattle are very fat; for the grass growing in turfs of earth, of two or three foot square, that lie between the rocks, which are of limestone, is very sweet and nourishing.\"\n\nThe area is formed from a thick succession of sedimentary rocks, largely limestones but also including sandstones, mudstones and siltstones. All of the solid rocks exposed at the surface are of Carboniferous age though they are underlain at depth by Old Red Sandstone of Devonian age which in turn overlies rocks of Lower Palaeozoic age. None of the pre-Carboniferous rocks is seen at the surface in the area. The limestones, which date from the Visean stage of the early Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 325 million years ago. The strata contain fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins and ammonites. This bed of limestone is up to 800 metres thick. In the north and west it lies on a shelf of Galway granite which supported the upper layers, preventing shifts like those that created the \"twisted\" hills Knockanes and Mullaghmore. The limestone also extends below Galway Bay out to the Aran Islands and to the east into the Gort plain.\n\nLater in the Carboniferous (c. 318 million years ago), the limestone was covered by darker sand and mud that later turned into shale (the lower \"Clare Shales\") and sandstone (the upper \"Millstone Grit\"). These layers reached a thickness of up to in north Clare. These top layers protected the underlying limestone from erosion for millions of years before being largely stripped away by glaciers, except in the south west, where they still extend from Doolin to Slieve Elva, Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and to the western shore of Lake Inchiquin. One \"island\" of shale is the hill Poulacapple, southwest of Ballyvaughan, where an upland moor has formed on top of the impermeable shale layers.\n\nThe local geological succession comprises the following formations some of which are subdivided into various members. The youngest rocks are at the start of the list, the oldest at the bottom. The first three listed are of Namurian age and are a mix of mudstones, sandstones and siltstones, the remainder are Visean age limestones.\n\n\nGlaciation during the late Quaternary period (beginning c. one million years ago) facilitated greater denudation. Glaciers expanded and retreated over the region several times. Of the last two periods the first was the more pronounced, covering the whole of the Burren. The last advance of the ice cover was more limited, affecting only the eastern Burren.\n\nThe result is that The Burren is one of the finest examples of glacio-karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with The Burren overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any surface karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and The Burren karst is thus very recent in geological terms. \n\nSolutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage. This has formed numerous cave systems of which more than 50 kilometers have been mapped. The most accessible of these is Aillwee Cave.\n\nDue to the processes mentioned, there are very few permanent surface rivers in the region. The Caher, flowing into the sea at Fanore, is one of the most stable. Some of the large valleys, mostly running south to north, that are still visible today are in fact the remains of pre-glacial river valleys. The rivers disappeared from the surface when the upper layers of stone had been stripped away. \n\nAnother characteristic features of The Burren are closed roughly circular depressions with no surface outlets for water (called polje). Around 100 of these exist, mostly present in the eastern Burren. The most notable are the valleys of Kilcorney, Poulawilan, Caherconnel and Carran, generally stretching from northeast to southwest. The largest is the Carran depression, more than two miles long, up to a mile wide and over 200 feet deep. This is where the pre-glacial rivers of the area first eroded away the upper layers and started to dissolve the exposed limestone. Some of the smaller ones were created when caves underneath collapsed (one example of this is the Glen of Clab).\n\nGlaciers also deposited numerous granite and limestone erratics on the pavements. The former were carried south across Galway Bay by the second-to-last glaciation. Granite boulders can be found mostly in the north of the Burren. The final ice cover came from the northeast and mostly deposited limestone erratics. On Slieve Elva these are visible today at elevations of up to mabove sea level. The characteristic terracing of the hills occurred when vertical joints weathered and large blocks of limestone fell off and were further eroded away.\n\nTowards the very end of the Ice Age the glaciers ended for a time at Fanore. At that time, Slieve Elva and Knockauns hill alone rose above the surrounding ice fields. The valleys facing Galway Bay had been widened considerably by glacial action, first when the ice moved south from Connemara and then when meltwater sought a runoff. When the ice finally retreated it also left moraines in valley bottoms and the characteristic drumlins (most of them on top of the shale and sandstone to the south). The Caher Valley was almost choked up by deposited sand and rocks and these also piled up against the western slopes of Slieve Elva. It was this protective layer of sediment that has made surface streams locally possible once more. \n\nToday, the uplands' highest point is on the hill Slieve Elva, whose shale cover rises up to above sea level.\n\nIn addition to the limestone pavement, major landscape types, providing the habitats for the flora and fauna, include limestone heath, dry calcareous grasslands, calcareous (calcifying or petrifying) springs, the intermittent water bodies called turloughs, bogs, cladium fens, lakes, wet grasslands, scrub and light woodland, and neutral, and farm-improved, grasslands.\n\nThe Burren is renowned for its remarkable assemblage of plants and animals, and over 70% of Ireland's species of flowers are found there. The region supports arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment.\n\nThe region supports many rare Irish species, some of which are only found in this area. Others occur in similar karst areas in western Ireland. Notable plants include \"Festuca indigesta\" seen in 1949 and \"Arenaria norvegica\" identified only once, in 1961. Two of the 24 types of \"Taraxacum\" found here are \"practically unique to the Burren\". 23 of the 28 types of orchids found in Ireland grow in the Burren, including unique forms such as \"Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. okellyi\".\n\nThe grikes (crevices in the limestone) provide moist shelter, supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the limestone pavement is shattered into gravel many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found, while when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil patches of grass are seen, interspersed with herbaceous plants. Among the flowers recorded from the Burren is the spring gentian, an alpine plant with bright blue flowers that are used as a symbol for the area by the national tourist board, Failte Ireland. The Irish orchid (\"Neotinea intacta\") and bloody cranesbill (\"Geranium sanguineum\") also occur there. The area sports 22 species of orchids and numerous other flowers such as \"Anacamptis pyramidalis\", \"Platanthera chlorantha\", \"Neotinea maculata\" and \"Dryas octopetala\". Another prominent presence in limestone grikes are around 24 types of fern, such as the Mediterranean \"Adiantum capillus-veneris\". \n\nThe area is notable for the unusually close vicinity of both plants that hate lime and those that do well on it. Acid-loving plants such as \"Calluna\" grow well on patches of acidic peat that effectively isolates them from the underlying basic limestone.\n\nOf the more than 30 species of butterflies and moths found in Ireland only two are not present in the Burren. Notable insects present in the Burren include the butterflies the pearl-bordered fritillary (\"Boloria euphrosyne\"), brown hairstreak (\"Thecla betulae\"), marsh fritillary (\"Euphydryas aurinia\") and wood white (\"Leptidea sinapis\"); the moths, the Burren green (\"Calamia tridens\", which is only present in Ireland in this area), Irish annulet (\"Gnophos dumetata\") and transparent burnet (\"Zygaena purpuralis\"); the hoverfly \"Doros profuges\" and the water-beetle \"Ochthebius nilssoni\". This last species is known from just five sites in the world, its type locality in northern Sweden and four marl lakes in The Burren.\n\nThe Burren is one of the main breeding areas in Ireland of the European pine marten. Also present are badgers, foxes and stoats. The hillsides of the Burren also host herds of feral goats.\n\nAll seven species of bats present in Ireland can be found in The Burren. \n\nOtters live along the coast, as do grey seals. Porpoises, dolphins and basking sharks can be spotted off Black Head and various sections of the Cliffs of Moher.\n\nA wide range of bird species are also found in the Burren, including crows and ravens, peregrine falcons, kestrels, various gulls, guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes, fulmars, puffins and shags.\n\nPollen analysis indicates that in the Mesolithic period of 8000 to 7000 BC The Burren looked completely different from today, with most of the uplands covered in a mixture of deciduous, pine and yew trees. No clear evidence of Mesolithic settlements or camp sites in the area has yet been discovered. At the limits of the region, near Lake Inchiquin and at the so-called \"Doolin Axe Factory\", stone artifacts have been discovered that may be Mesolithic in origin. However, by the Neolithic, c. 4000 BC, settlers had clearly arrived and began changing the landscape through deforestation, likely by overgrazing and burning, and the building of stone walls. These people also constructed Megalithic sites like the portal tomb known as Poulnabrone dolmen and the court tombs at Teergonean (near Doolin) and Ballyganner (near Noughaval). Overall, there are around 70 megalithic tombs in the Burren area, more than half of all of these structures found in Clare.\n\nThe most numerous type of prehistoric structure (apart from stone walls) in The Burren is the late-Neolithic/early-Bronze Age wedge tomb, mostly dated to the period 2500 to 2000 BC. It accounts for around 90% of the region's megalithic tombs. Many examples of these are found on Roughan Hill near Kilnaboy, including those at Parknabinnia and Creevagh. Others are located at Gleninsheen and Berneens (Rathborney) and Poulaphuca (Carran). Large stone cairns on many hills, such as the Poulawack Cairn, also date from this period.\n\nThe economy at that time was likely based on pastoral farming in fairly small groups. As is still done today, the cattle were moved in a reverse of the usual seasonal pattern: cattle are moved to the uplands in the winter, allowing year round grazing.\n\nEvidence of Beaker pottery was found on Roughan Hill, but in general few signs of the actual settlements of the Neolithic people have been found. This may be due to the fact that their structures were lightly built (from wood or other non-permanent materials). \n\nDuring the Bronze Age, locals also built many \"Fulachtai fiadh\", remains of more than 300 survive in the region. Their exact function is still debated, but they probably served as places where water was heated by fire, either for cooking, brewing or bathing purposes.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the quantity of archaeological evidence found, the population of The Burren likely declined noticeably between the late Neolithic and the end of the Bronze Age. This was likely largely due to a shift in the climate, possibly related to the volcanic eruption known as \"Hekla 4\". Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC temperatures dropped and the climate became wetter. Heavy rainfall combined with previous clearing activity to cause serious soil erosion in the uplands. Evidence suggests that much of the soil cover over the limestone karst was in fact removed during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. This reduction in the area of fertile land put pressure on population numbers and probably increased conflicts over scarce resources. Building of new stone walls largely came to an end – there is a gap in documented building between the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age and early Christian periods. By the end of the Bronze Age, the uplands were largely depopulated.\n\nNevertheless, like the Mooghaun North Hoard found near Newmarket-on-Fergus, the discovery of a golden Bronze Age gorget in Gleninsheen townland indicates the (at least temporary) local presence of a late Bronze Age society that was rich, mobile and well-connected via trade networks with other regions. \n\nLike in many places of Ireland, datable Iron Age sites are rare in The Burren. This may be due to the use of dwellings that did not leave durable traces (wooden buildings or even tents). Some of the extant ráths, cashels or cahers may actually have Iron Age origins. However, few have been excavated and those that have been the subject of research, like Cahercommaun, Caherconnel, Cahermore or Ballyallaban, are thought to be early Medieval or later in origin. The large enigmatic enclosure of Turlough Hill (see Oughtmama) may be Iron Age or earlier. Definite regional findings from this era are limited to a few bronze horse bridles discovered near Corofin and at Ballyalla (Kilshanny).\n\nIn the Iron Age and early Medieval times, the region was controlled by a family or tribe known as the \"Corco Modhruadh\", meaning \"seed\" or \"people of Modhruadh\". They were one of dozens of minor tribes in Ireland at that time, which occupied a discrete area (\"tuath\") and were joined by a common bloodline or origin myths. By the time Christianity arrived locally, their territory had shrunk somewhat, encompassing what later became the Baronies of Burren and Corcomroe as well as some parts of Inchiquin barony (see below).\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the region appears to have been ruled from the Aran Islands by the \"Eóganacht Árann\", a minor branch of the Eóganacht dynasty of Munster.\n\nThe history of these years is uncertain, but after the decline of the \"Eóganacht Árann\" the local \"Corco Modhruadh\" likely fell under the control of the \"Uí Fiachrach Aidhne\", a tribe from what is now southern Galway, who prospered in the 7th century. The local tribes were then probably subjects of the \"Eóganacht Locha Léin\" until their influence declined in the early 9th century. Whether the \"Corco Modhruadh\" still existed as a distinct group at that point is uncertain, as they and their neighbours \"Corcu Baiscind\" may have been assimilated into or conquered by the \"Déisi Tuisceart\" of eastern Clare, who won a major battle against the \"Corco Modhruadh\" in 744. By the 9th century, the \"Corco Modhruadh\" had been driven into the Burren uplands. \n\nThe Burren area is notable for the presence of several potential or likely \"early\" (i.e. pre-12th-century) ecclesiastical or monastic sites. These include Kilfenora, Kilnaboy, Temple Cronan and the churches of Oughtmama. A broader definition of The Burren would also include Dysert O'Dea Monastery near Corofin and Kilmacduagh. The large number of extant cashels, almost 500 of which have been identified in The Burren (out of around 45,000 in Ireland), also indicates the presence of a sizeable (early) medieval population that supported and used these churches.\n\nAt the end of the first millennium, the \"Dál gCais\" expanded into the region, against the resistance of the incumbent Uí Lochlainn and O'Conor families. The later regionally dominant O'Brien dynasty traced its origins to them. Evidence of Viking activity in the region is scant. They settled at Limerick, but in the Burren only a few artifacts of Scandinavian design have been found, centred mostly on Cahercommaun, which apparently was a major producer of wool at the time. A Viking arrowhead was found at the ringfort and a Viking hollow-bead necklace (likely dating from 820 to 850 AD) was discovered in nearby Glencurran Cave.\n\nEither at the end of the 12th or early in the 13th century, Cistercian monks came to the area and established \"Sancta Maria de Petra Fertili\", now known as Corcomroe Abbey.\n\nIn the 12th century, the \"Corco Modhruadh\"/Corcomroe territory was made into the newly created Diocese of Kilfenora, of 13 parishes, and the church at Kilfenora became a cathedral. \n\nAt some point around the 12th century, the territory of \"Corcomroe\" was divided in two for admistrative purposes: \"Corco Modhruadh Iartharach\" (\"Western Corcomroe\") and \"Corco Modhruadh Oirthearach\" (\"Eastern Corcomroe\"), also known as \"Boireann\" which in the late 16th century became the English administrative Baronies of Corcomroe and Burren, respectively.\n\nThe end of the Medieval period was a difficult era for people in the area. Like much of Europe, the region suffered from the Great Famine (1315-7) and the Black Death. In addition, infighting between the Gaelic lords contributed to a socio-economic decline of the region. This was also reflected in a regional hiatus in large construction projects during the 13th and most of the 14th century.\n\nFor a long-time the Anglo-Norman incursions into Ireland had little direct impact on the region. As late as at the Battle of Dysert O'Dea in 1318 some of the local clans allied to defeat a Norman army led by Richard de Clare. The people and their rulers thus continued to live in fortified houses, often inside the cashels, mostly retaining their Gaelic culture. One example of this are the Brehon law schools of the O'Davorans at Cahermacnaghten or the MacClancys at Doolin.\n\nOnly in the 15th and 16th centuries did the tower houses as exemplified today by places like Newtown Castle, Shanmuckinish Castle, Doonagore Castle or Ballinalacken Castle become widespread. Norman-type castles, such as the one built at Quin, were absent in the Burren. T.J. Westropp counted the remains of around 70 tower houses in the Baronies of Inchiquin, Corcomroe and Burren, with 21 of them located in the latter. Only around half of those 21 survive to any height in the 21st century. The distribution of the tower houses indicates that they were built close to the barony borders, which also represented the boundaries of the territories controlled by clans or families (see below). 11 of the 21 tower houses in the Barony of Burren lie within 1 km of its borders.\n\nThe O'Loughlin (Ó Lochlainn) clan ruled \"Boireann\" down to the mid-17th century from their chief residence at Gregans Castle (the tower house, not the house of the same name). The chief of the family was known in later times as the 'Prince of Burren' and clan members were buried in the family tomb near the altar of Corcomroe Abbey. Their kinsmen, the O'Conor (Ó Conchubhair), clan ruled \"Corco Modhruadh Iartharach\" from Dough Castle near Liscannor. The villages and towns found within the medieval territory of Boireann include Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, New Quay (Newquay) / Burrin (Burren), Noughaval, Bealaclugga (Bellharbour), Carron and Fanore / Craggagh.\n\nBoth clans were eventually subjects of the O'Briens, the rulers of Thomond. Especially in the southwest, the O'Briens sometimes extended their direct influence, taking over houses and territories for themselves. They controlled the castles at Dromoland and Leamaneh and later became the Barons Inchiquin.\n\nThe Burren has a long history of traditional Irish music. It is particularly known for the \"West Clare Style\" of concertina playing, and music festivals in Doolin and Corofin. The area also has a long history as a source of artistic inspiration, and has hosted a number of art galleries.\n\nThe Burren has inspired many non-fiction books, often accompanied by extensive illustration of the landscape. A series of detective fiction novels, written by Cora Harrison, features the Burren's brehon judge (fictional) in the early 1500s, when the area still existed as a distinct Gaelic administration.\n\nThe leading economic activities in the Burren are agriculture and tourism.\n\nThe Burren has a reputation beyond Ireland, and, most notably with the Cliffs of Moher, but also with the major show caves, dolmens such as at Poulnabrone and other prehistoric sites, and centres of cultural activity, attracts tourists from a wide range of countries. There are a range of hotels, hostels, bed and breakfast facilities, and other accommodation providers.\n\nTourism presents some challenges in such an environmentally sensitive area, as it creates mostly seasonal employment, results in a large share of local houses being used only in the summer, and puts additional strain on environmental resources, thus exacerbating the effect of a significant increase in the number of houses in some areas during the 1990s and 2000s. This has been a thread in the development and preservation activities previously discussed, and has driven the growth of local ecotourism, and the \"Leave No Trace\" local campaigns. Concerns have also arisen about the level of day-tourism, especially by coaches, as opposed to overnight-staying tourists, who generate significantly more revenue.\n\nEcotourism is an important factor in The Burren, with many organisations involved, including the Burren Ecotourism Network. A key goal is to deal with the challenge of protecting the vulnerable landscape, while at the same time having it provide a fair income for the local inhabitants and allowing it to cope with increased visitor numbers. Sustainable ecotourism and independent \"'Ecotourism Certification\" for companies are intended to deal with those conflicting demands.\n\nA Burren Food Trail was launched in 2013, and has more than 20 members offering hospitality, and / or food and drink products. The trail won the Irish prize in the European Destination of Excellence - Tourism and Local Gastronomy competition in 2015. In association with the food trail events such as a Slow Food festival and a Food Fayre are organised. The Food Fayre, part of the Burrenbeo-coordinated Winterage Festival around the October public holiday weekend, and run by the Burren Ecotourism Network and the Burren Food Trail team, reached its sixth year in 2017.\n\nDue to climate and landscape, and techniques evolved over thousands of years, the Burren has a history as a productive agricultural landscape. Arable farming is limited, and the main animals kept are cattle and goats.\n\nAs summarized by local landscape organisation, the Burrenbeo Trust, the traditional local system of cattle husbandry \"involves exploiting the unusual attributes afforded by the region's limestone geology. Up until quite recently, hardy native breeds of beef cattle were used to graze upland grasslands between the months of October and April, requiring scarcely any dietary supplement prior to their removal to finishing grass elsewhere.\" Thus the agricultural methods used but also protected the landscape.\n\nSince the 20th century the spread of intensive farming techniques (including sometimes heavy use of nitrate fertilisers) along with the possibilities offered by heavy equipment to transform limestone pavement into pasture has posed new challenges for the ecosystem and its diversity. Research conducted in the 1990s suggests that by the end of that decade the area of limestone pavement had halved since pre-Famine times, c. 1840, while from the 1970s to the 1990s alone, about 4% of pavements were converted into pasture or covered by roads. \n\nDespite the intensification of agriculture on the uplands, population numbers fell from around 4,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to roughly 2,500 by the time of the 1991 Census, before rising once more. The number of farmers fell by 8% in the 1990s and average farm size increased to by 2001. \n\nA particular issue arose from the increasing spread of brush, notably hazel, but also blackthorn and hawthorn. These colonised more of the limestone area as a result of reduced grazing by cattle and goats. The increasing industrialization of agriculture and the introduction of different breeds of cattle led to shifts in cattle-raising practices – away from winter grazing, which kept down new growth, and towards supplementary feeding. In addition, in the past saplings were often pulled from fields by hand to maintain grazing areas. Trees also used to be harvested for firewood, hazel rods were used for thatching as well as for fence- and basket-making. As these practices ceased, the brush advanced. This notably reduces biodiversity in the affected areas.\n\nIn response to under-grazing, loss of husbandry and land management traditions, and abandonment and consolidation of farms, the BurrenLIFE program, coordinated by the geopark, launched a new sustainable farming initiative. This began with twenty farms, representative of the diversity of local agriculture, for each of which a specific plan of costed actions was devised. After refinement, the initiative was extended to 320 farmers over two phases, and another 130 are expected to join a final phase. Typical recommendations enacted included scrub clearance, restoration of drystone walls, reduction in silage usage and a return to winter grazing.\n\nFor the past decades, the government and private groups have attempted to square the demands of local farmers, tourists and the environment. In particular, sometimes outdated or leaky septic tanks used by rural houses have contributed to the damage done to groundwater by agricultural practices. In a limestone environment, the use of percolation and septic tanks may in fact not be a viable alternative to sewage treatment. However, this is still lacking in much of the area. The sewage of the village of Ballyvaughan, for example, is still pumped untreated into the sea.\n\nCommunity and local authority programs have been launched over decades, notably a County Council initiative of the mid-2000s, which became \"Burren Connect\" in 2006, and led, in 2011, to the geopark, which in turn secured funding for the Geopark LIFE program. The Burrenbeo Trust, Burren Ecotourism Network and Burren Way Committee are other examples.\n\nMost of the Burren is today designated as a Special Area of Conservation, including almost all upland, and much of the lowland and northern shore areas. There are also designated Areas of Scientific Interest and Natural Heritage Areas.\n\nThe Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, formed in 2011 on the basis of earlier community and local authority work, is part of the Global Geoparks Network (GGN) and recognised by UNESCO since that year. Encompassing an expansively defined Burren, including the Cliffs of Moher, it is managed by the Clare County Council and supported by Failte Ireland and the Geological Survey of Ireland. The boundary of the Geopark extends from the vicinity of New Quay on Galway Bay, southeast to the Tubber area, then southwest to Corrofin then roughly west towards Doolin and includes the coastal strip containing the Cliffs of Moher. The geopark supports education and community engagement and sustainable tourism and other development, and employs a full-time geologist, Dr. Eamon N. Doyle.\n\nThe Burren National Park is one of six National Parks in the country. Taking in a modest sampling of the southeastern Burren, about , it is made up of land purchased by the Irish government to be set aside for conservation purposes. After a prolonged controversy (see Mullaghmore and the Burren Action Group), the planned construction of a visitor centre was shelved. The National Park currently has an information point at Corofin. It is also associated with the preservation area at nearby Dromore Wood.\n\nThe Burren's many limestone cliffs, particularly the sea-cliffs at Ailladie, are popular with rock-climbers. For cavers, there are a number of charted caves in the area, notably Pollnagollum. Doolin is a popular \"base camp\" for cavers, and is home to one of the two main cave-rescue stores of the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation.\n\nThe Burren is popular with walkers and trails include the Burren Way, often taken over a five day period, and the Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk of .\n\nThe Burren also has a range of local Gaelic Athletic Association clubs, soccer clubs and other sporting groups. While the landscape is challenging for maintenance of golf clubs, there are facilities near Gort and Lahinch.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Forster of two visits to India in 1912-1913 and 1921, during which he worked as the private secretary to Tukojirao III, the Maharaja of the state of Dewas Senior. The book was first published in 1953 and is dedicated to Forster's friend, the Indian Civil Service administrator Malcolm Lyall Darling with whom he had been a contemporary at King's College, Cambridge as a student.\n\nForster derived inspiration for the book from the famous hill-top temple of the Hindu Mother Goddess \"Devi\".

{"id": "23772780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23772780", "title": "The Truth About Crime", "text": "The Truth About Crime\n\nThe Truth About Crime is a British television documentary series inspired and presented by Nick Ross in association with the film-maker Roger Graef, executive producer Sam Collyns and series producer Alice Perman. It was first broadcast on BBC One in July and August 2009.\n\nThe show focused on a single city, Oxford, which has demographics and crime rates broadly representative of urban Britain, and used a multitude of techniques to measure the real extent of crime and victimisation. In a two-week crime audit, camera teams followed police, fire services and paramedics and an on-line questionnaire, based closely on the national British Crime Survey, invited residents and businesspeople to describe their personal experiences of victimisation. A survey of 14- and 15-year-olds in Oxford schools was one of the biggest of its kind ever undertaken to discover how under-16s are affected by, and involved in, crime. Random children from some of the schools were then chosen to take part in the series being quizzed on crime by Ross on such topics as theft, drugs, alcohol and many other things.\n\nThe first programme (BBC One 9pm Tuesday 21 July 2009) looked at violent crime and revealed that almost all woundings involved victims who had been drinking or who had been assaulted by someone who was drunk, and took place close to a licensed premise.\n\nMost of the seriously injured, as measured by those treated in hospital, did not report what had happened to the police. One senior physician told Nick Ross that police figures on crime are virtually \"meaningless\". The physician interviewed was Jonathan Shepherd, a Professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Cardiff University Dental School. Domestic violence was shown to be a major problem, though mostly resulting only in minor injuries, and with women as perpetrators as well as men. Women were interviewed in a Women's shelter.\n\nHelmet cameras were shown and Spencer Chainey of the Jill Dando Institute at University College London described crime mapping, which uses geographic information systems.\n\nA licensing officer from Thames Valley Police, a Hook Norton Brewery executive and David Poley, the Chief Executive of the Portman Group, were interviewed. Ross went on to describe several interventions which had cut alcohol-related violence in the UK and elsewhere and urged a more pro-active approach to tackling alcohol-related violence. For most of the incidents, there were few arrests featured.\n\nThe second in the series (Tuesday 28 July) explored the nature of acquisitive crime and proposed solutions to burglary, car theft and fraud. Ross implied that society needs to accept human nature for what it is and focus less on how to penalise criminals and more on taking sensible precautions with tempting valuables. Temptation and opportunity drives crime far more than \"badness\". 90% of burglaries are to fuel a drug habit. A 19-year-old single mother, Kelly, burgled some students, who were meanwhile happily enjoying themselves in a pub, to fund her heroin habit. A policeman said that this type of crime is committed by people who find themselves in social and emotional situations from which they find it difficult to get out of.\n\nThere are around fifty persistent burglars in Oxford. Some of them would commit up to twenty burglaries a week. A shoplifter who was caught by CCTV in a shop, stealing a £10 set of headphones, turned out to be a 19-year-old Polish immigrant who possessed no ID. Nick Ross even confessed to shoplifting occasionally when a teenager, as did school pupils interviewed. During a normal weekday, shoplifting peaks at 3.30pm when school ends.\n\nDistraction burglary is different to more common random burglary, and is rarer but often more upsetting because it involves more dedicated and skilful felons. The ruthless individuals perpetrating this crime usually target properties around the edge of Oxford near the ring road, and tend to come from outside the area. Household scams, of a ruthless and targeted similar nature, usually involved elderly people who they would be cajoled into paying astronomical prices for unnecessary repair work done on their property. The rogue traders involved were difficult to trace by county council Trading Standards officers. An elderly couple were conned into paying for minor repairs with their entire life savings. Online scams were more prevalent than perhaps realised, with up to £20bn of online fraud committed a year. It was investigated by the e-commerce unit of SOCA. Richard Cox of The Spamhaus Project was interviewed about internet crime.\n\nThe police thought that prison was the best place for persistent burglars. It kept the burglars off the streets. Prison was not viewed as a deterrent because the persistent offenders live such types of lives that they would be better looked after in prison than on the streets, with regular meals and companionship. Once they left prison they would quickly reoffend. Rehabilitation centres for repeat offenders and drug addicts were not successful because the offenders were not of a capable mental state to be sufficiently receptive or adaptive to the treatments given\n\nSome of the crimes, especially rare ones targeting the elderly, are committed by lifestyle criminals, but most offenders are un-glamorously ordinary and few are \"ogres\" even in the eyes of the police. Most solutions lie in better design and sensible precautions. Since crime peaked in the 1990s homeowners have halved burglary rates by locking their doors and windows, retailers and tackled shoplifting by guarding their open shelves with security devices, and vehicle manufacturers have made cars so difficult to steal that auto-crime is now largely confined to old bangers.\n\nThe third and final show (Tuesday 4 August) exposed widespread anti-social behaviour and the lack of a concerted response. Much of anti-social crime is not added to the official crime statistics. Much of it is fuelled by drugs and gang culture of under-educated and employed young males under the acronym NEET. The Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police, Sara Thornton, was interviewed. It was found that improved styles of architecture for estate housing and lit thoroughfares can reduce anti-social crime significantly.\n\nRoss's general thesis is that recorded crime rates are unreliable, that theft and violence have actually declined sharply but that the downward trend may not be continuing, and that there are hundreds of quite simple solutions to crime, mostly by reducing temptations and opportunities for bad behaviour rather than trying to remould people's predispositions.\n\nThe series has been well received, with \"The Times\" \"fascinated [by the] sane, insightful and compellingly argued documentary series\" - and achieved good ratings despite being scheduled against ITV1's fast-moving, similarly themed \"Car Crime UK\", a six-part police car-chasing documentary series narrated by Trevor McDonald.\n\n"}

{"id": "2568296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2568296", "title": "Ukrainization", "text": "Ukrainization\n\nUkrainization (also spelled Ukrainisation or Ukrainianization) is a policy or practice of increasing the usage and facilitating the development of the Ukrainian language and promoting other elements of Ukrainian culture, in various spheres of public life such as education, publishing, government and religion. The term is also used to describe a process by which non-Ukrainians or Russified Ukrainians come to accept Ukrainian culture and language as their own.\n\nA major early case of Ukrainization relates to the Soviet indigenization policy of the 1920s (\"korenizatsiya\", literally \"putting down roots\"), which aimed at strengthening Soviet power in the territory of Soviet Ukraine and in southern regions of the Russian SFSR. In various forms Ukrainization policies also played out in several different periods of the twentieth-century history of Ukraine, although with somewhat different goals and in different historical contexts.\n\nUkrainization is often cited as a response to and as the means to address the consequences of previous assimilationist policies aimed at suppressing or even eradicating the Ukrainian language and culture from most spheres of public life, most notably the policy of Russification (in the times of the Russian Empire (see also Ems Ukaz) and in the USSR), but also Polonization and Rumanization in some Western Ukrainian regions.\n\nAfter Ukraine declared its independence in 1991, the government of Ukraine began following a policy of Ukrainization, to increase the use of Ukrainian while discouraging Russian, which has been gradually phased out from the country's education system, government, and national TV, radio programmes and films. Until 2017 The \"Law on Education\" granted Ukrainian families (parents and their children) a right to choose their native language for schools and studies. But this law was updated in 2017 to make the Ukrainian language the primary language of education in all schools.\n\nIn western historiography, the term \"Ukrainization\" refers also to a policy and resulting process of forcing ethnic minorities living on Ukrainian territories to abandon their ethnic identity by means of the enforced assimilation of Ukrainian culture and identity. During the aftermath of World War II, in the Ukrainian SSR this process had been preceded by the expulsion of some ethnic minorities and appropriation of their cultural heritage.\n\"Ukrainization\" is also used in the context of these acts.\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Russian Empire had dissolved, and the Ukrainians intensified their struggle for an independent Ukrainian state. In the chaos of World War I and revolutionary changes, a nascent Ukrainian state emerged but, initially, the state's very survival was not ensured. As the Central Rada, the governing body, was trying to assert the control over Ukraine amid the foreign powers and internal struggle, only a limited cultural development could take place. However, for the first time in the modern history, Ukraine had a government of its own and the Ukrainian language gained usage in state affairs.\n\nAs the Rada was eventually overthrown in a German-backed coup (April 29, 1918), the rule of a Hetmanate led by Pavlo Skoropadsky was established. While the stability of the government was only relative and Skoropadsky himself, as a former officer of the tsarist army, spoke Russian rather than Ukrainian, the Hetmanate managed to start an impressive Ukrainian cultural and education program, printed millions of Ukrainian-language textbooks, and established many Ukrainian schools, two universities, and a Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The latter established a Committee on Orthography and Terminology, which initiated a scholarly and methodological research program into Ukrainian terminology.\n\nThe Hetmanate's rule ended with the German evacuation and was replaced by the Directorate government of Symon Petlura. However, Ukraine submerged into a new wave of chaos facing two invasions at the same time, from the East by the Bolshevik forces and from the West by the Polish troops, as well as being ravaged by armed bands that often were not backed by any political ideology. \n\nAs Bolshevik rule took hold in Ukraine, the early Soviet government had its own reasons to encourage the national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire. The reversal of the assimilationist policies of the Russian Empire was potentially done to help to improve the image of the Soviet government and boost its popularity among the common people.\n\nUntil the early-1930s, Ukrainian culture enjoyed a widespread revival due to Bolshevik policies known as the policy of Korenization (\"indigenization\"). In these years a Ukrainization program was implemented throughout the republic. In such conditions, the Ukrainian national idea initially continued to develop and even spread to a large territory with traditionally mixed population in the east and south that became part of the Ukrainian Soviet republic.\n\nThe All-Ukrainian Sovnarkom's decree \"On implementation of the Ukrainization of the educational and cultural institutions\" (July 27, 1923) is considered to be the onset of the Ukrainization program. The (August 1) decree that followed shortly \"On implementation of the equal rights of the languages and facilitation of the Ukrainian language\" mandated the implementation of Ukrainian language to all levels of state institutions. Initially, the program was met with resistance by some Ukrainian Communists, largely because non-Ukrainians prevailed numerically in the party at the time. The resistance was finally overcome in 1925 through changes in the party leadership under the pressure of Ukrainian representatives in the party. In April 1925 the party Central Committee adopted the resolution on Ukrainization proclaiming its aim as \"solidifying the union of the peasantry with the working class\" and boosting the overall support of the Soviet system among Ukrainians. A joint resolution aimed at \"complete Ukrainization of the Soviet apparatus\" as well as the party and trade unions was adopted on April 30, 1925. The Ukrainian Commissariat of Education (Narkomis) was charged with overseeing the implementation of the Ukrainization policies. The two figures, therefore, most identified with the policy are Oleksander Shumskyi, the Commissar for Education between 1923 and 1927, and Mykola Skrypnyk, who replaced Shumskyi in 1927.\n\nThe Ukrainian-language based education system dramatically raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone rural population. By 1929 over 97% of high school students in the republic were obtaining their education in Ukrainian and illiteracy dropped from 47% (1926) to 8% in 1934.\n\nSimultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized — in both population and education. Between 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of Kharkov, at the time the capital of Soviet Ukraine, increased from 38% to 50%. Similar increases occurred in other cities, from 27.1% to 42.1% in Kiev, from 16% to 48% in Dnipropetrovsk, from 16% to 48% in Odessa, and from 7% to 31% in Luhansk.\n\nSimilarly expansive was an increase in Ukrainian language publishing and the overall flourishing of Ukrainian cultural life. As of 1931 out of 88 theatres in Ukraine, 66 were Ukrainian, 12 were Jewish (Yiddish) and 9 were Russian. The number of Ukrainian newspapers, which almost did not exist in 1922, had reached 373 out of 426, while only 3 all-republican large newspapers remained Russian. Of 118 magazines, 89 were Ukrainian. Ukrainization of book-publishing reached 83%.\n\nUkrainization was thoroughly implemented through the government apparatus, Communist Party of Ukraine membership and, gradually, the party leadership as well, as the recruitment of indigenous cadre was implemented as part of the korenization policies. At the same time, the usage of Ukrainian was continuously encouraged in the workplace and in government affairs. While initially, the party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking, by the end of the 1920s ethnic Ukrainians composed over one half of the membership in the Ukrainian communist party, the number strengthened by accession of Borotbists, a formerly indigenously Ukrainian \"independentist\" and non-Bolshevik communist party.\n\nIn the all-Ukrainian Ispolkom, central executive committee, as well as in the oblast level governments, the proportion of Ukrainians reached 50.3% by 1934 while in raion ispolkoms the number reached 68.8%. On the city and village levels, the representation of Ukrainians in the local government bodies reached 56.1% and 86.1%, respectively. As for other governmental agencies, the Ukrainization policies increased the Ukrainian representation as follows: officers of all-republican People's Commissariat (ministries) - 70-90%, oblast executive brunches - 50%, raion - 64%, Judiciary - 62%, Militsiya (law enforcement) - 58%.\n\nThe attempted Ukrainization of the armed forces, Red Army formations serving in Ukraine and abroad, was less successful although moderate progress was attained. The Schools of Red Commanders (\"Shkola Chervonyh Starshyn\") was organized in Kharkov to promote the careers of the Ukrainian national cadre in the army (see picture). The Ukrainian newspaper of the Ukrainian Military District \"Chervona Armiya\" was published until the mid-1930s. The efforts were made to introduce and expand Ukrainian terminology and communication in the Ukrainian Red Army units. The policies even reached the army units in which Ukrainians served in other Soviet regions. For instance the Soviet Pacific Fleet included a Ukrainian department overseen by Semyon Rudniev.\n\nAt the same time, despite the ongoing Soviet-wide anti-religious campaign, the Ukrainian national Orthodox Church was created, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (See History of Christianity in Ukraine). The Bolshevik government initially saw the national churches as a tool in their goal to suppress the Russian Orthodox Church, always viewed with great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of the defunct Russian Empire and the initially strong opposition it took towards the regime change. Therefore, the government tolerated the new Ukrainian national church for some time and the UAOC gained a wide following among the Ukrainian peasantry.\n\nUkrainization even reached those regions of southern Russian SFSR, particularly the areas by the Don and Kuban rivers, where mixed population showed strong Ukrainian influences in the local dialect. Ukrainian language teachers, just graduated from expanded institutions of higher education in Soviet Ukraine, were dispatched to these regions to staff newly opened Ukrainian schools or to teach Ukrainian as a second language in Russian schools. A string of local Ukrainian-language publications was started and departments of Ukrainian studies were opened in colleges. Overall, these policies were implemented in thirty-five administrative districts in southern Russia.\n\nStarting from the early 1930s, the Ukrainization policies were abruptly and bloodily reversed. \"Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism\" was declared to be the primary problem in Ukraine. Many Ukrainian newspapers, publications, and schools were switched to Russian. The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine were purged, as were the \"Ukrainianized\" and \"Ukrainianizing\" portions of the Communist party.\n\nMajor repression started in 1929–30, when a large group of Ukrainian intelligentsia was arrested and most were executed. In Ukrainian history, this group is often referred to as \"Executed Renaissance\" (Ukrainian: розстріляне відродження). The terror peaked in 1933, four to five years before the Soviet-wide \"Great Purge\", which, for Ukraine, was a second blow. The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine were liquidated, as were the \"Ukrainianized\" and \"Ukrainianizing\" portions of the Communist party.\n\nAt the 12th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Moscow-appointed leader Pavel Postyshev declared that \"1933 was the year of the defeat of Ukrainian nationalist counter-revolution.\" This \"defeat\" encompassed not just the physical extermination of a significant portion of the Ukrainian peasantry, but also the virtual elimination of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church clergy and the mass imprisonment or execution of Ukrainian intellectuals, writers and artists.\n\nUkrainian music ensembles had their repertoires severely restricted and censored. Foreign tours by Ukrainian artists were canceled without explanation. Many artists were arrested and detained often for months at a time without cause. After not receiving any pay for many months, many choirs and artistic ensembles such as the Kiev and Poltava Bandurist Capellas ceased to exist. Blind traditional folk musicians known as kobzars were summoned from all of Ukraine to an ethnographic conference and disappeared (See Persecuted bandurists).\n\nIn the regions of southern Russian SFSR (North Caucasus and eastern part of Sloboda Ukraine included into RSFSR) Ukrainization was effectively outlawed in 1932. Specifically, the December 14, 1932 decree \"On Grain Collection in Ukraine, North Caucasus and the Western Oblasts\" by the VKP(b) Central Committee and USSR Sovnarkom stated that Ukrainization in certain areas was carried out formally, in a \"non-Bolshevik\" way, which provided the \"bourgeois-nationalist elements\" with a legal cover for organizing their anti-Soviet resistance. In order to stop this, the decree ordered in these areas, among other things, to switch to Russian all newspapers and magazines, and all Soviet and cooperative paperwork. By the autumn of 1932 (beginning of a school year), all schools were ordered to switch to Russian. In addition the decree ordered a massive population swap: all \"disloyal\" population from a major Cossack settlement, \"stanitsa\" Poltavskaya was banished to Northern Russia, with their property given to loyal kolkhozniks moved from poorer areas of Russia. This forced end to Ukrainization in southern RSFSR had led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the 1937 Soviet Census compared to the 1926 First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Communist Party of Ukraine, under the guidance of state officials like Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior, and Pavel Postyshev, boasted in early 1934 of the elimination of \"counter-revolutionaries, nationalists, spies and class enemies\". Whole academic organizations, such as the Bahaliy Institute of History and Culture, were shut down following the arrests.\n\nIn 1935-36, 83% of all school children in the Ukrainian SSR were taught in Ukrainian even though Ukrainians made up about 80% of the population. In 1936 from 1830 newspapers 1402 were in Ukrainian, as were 177 magazines, in 1936 69 104 thousand Ukrainian books were printed.\n\nIn the following fifty years the Soviet policies towards the Ukrainian language mostly varied between quiet discouragement and suppression to persecution and cultural purges, with the notable exception for the decade of Petro Shelest's Communist Party leadership in the Soviet Ukraine (1963–1972). The mid-1960s were characterized by moderate Ukrainization efforts in governmental affairs as well as the resurgence of the usage of Ukrainian in education, publishing and culture. \n\nEventually, all effects of Ukrainization were undone yet again and Ukraine gradually became russified to a significant degree. These policies softened somewhat only in the mid-to-late 1980s and were completely reversed again in newly independent Ukraine in the 1990s.\n\nOn 28 October 1989, the Supreme Soviet of Ukrainian SSR changed the Constitution and adopted the \"Law of Languages\". The Ukrainian language was declared the only official language, while the other languages spoken in Ukraine were guaranteed constitutional protection. The government was obliged to create the conditions required for the development and use of Ukrainian language as well as languages of other ethnic groups, including Russian. Usage of other languages, along with Ukrainian, was allowed in local institutions located in places of residence of the majority of citizens of the corresponding ethnicities. Citizens were guaranteed the right to use their native or any other languages and were entitled to address various institutions and organisations in Ukrainian, in Russian, or in another language of their work, or in a language acceptable to the parties. After the Ukrainian accession of independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union the law, with some minor amendments, remained in force in the independent Ukrainian state.\n\nAdopted in 1996, the new Constitution of Ukraine confirmed the official state status of the Ukrainian language, and guaranteed the free development, use, and protection of Russian and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine.\n\nLanguage issues are still used by politics to generate controversy. On May 20, 2008, Donetsk city council passed a resolution limiting the expansion of Ukrainian-language education in the city. The following day the city prosecutor declared the decision illegal and the mayor suspended it, and the council reversed itself two days later.\n\nAccording to March 2010 survey, forced Ukrainization and Russian language suppression are among the least troubling problems for Ukrainian citizens, concerning only 4.8% of population.\n\nThe government of independent Ukraine implemented policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian and mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce. The most significant was the government's concerted effort to implement Ukrainian, as the only official state language in the country, into the state educational system. Despite the Constitution, the \"Law on Education\" (grants Ukrainian families (parents and their children) a right to choose their native language for schools and studies) as well as the Law of Languages (a guarantee for the protection of all languages in Ukraine) the education system gradually reshaped from a system that was only partly Ukrainian to the one that is overwhelmingly so. The Russian language is still studied as a required course in all secondary schools, including those with Ukrainian as the primary language of instructions. The number of secondary school students who received their primary education in Ukrainian has grown from 47.9% in 1990-1991. (the last school year before the Ukrainian independence) to 67.4% in 1999 and to 75.1% by 2003-2004 (see table). The Ukrainization has achieved even greater gains in the higher education institutions where as of 1990-1991 only 7% of students were being taught primarily in Ukrainian. By 2003-2004 the percentage of the college and technicum students studying in Ukrainian reached 87.7% and for the students of the University-level institutions this number reached 80.1% (see table).\n\nThe extent of educational institutions' Ukrainization varies in the different regions of Ukraine. In the 16 western oblasts (provinces) of Ukraine there are 26 Russian language schools out of 12,907 and in Kiev 6 out of 452 schools use Russian as their primary language of instruction, (according to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kievans, as 52% use Russian and 24% switch between both). In the Donets Basin region the percentage of students receiving education in Russian roughly corresponds to the percentage of population who considers Russian as their native language and in Crimea the overwhelming majority of secondary schools students are taught in Russian. The distribution is similar in the institutes of the higher education while the latter are somewhat more Ukrainianized.\n\nThe increase of the share of secondary school students obtaining education in Ukrainian (from 47.9% to 67%) over the first decade of the Ukrainian independence roughly corresponded to the share of native Ukrainian speakers - 67.5%. Schools continue to be transferred to the Ukrainian language up to this day. At the end of the 1990s, about 50% of professional school students, 62% of college students and 67% of university students (cf. 7% in 1991) studied in Ukrainian and in the following five years the number increased even further (see table).\n\nIn some cases, the changing of the language of instruction in institutions, led to the charges of assimilation, raised mostly by the Russian-speaking population. Despite this, the transition was gradual and lacked many controversies that surrounded the de-Russification in several of the other former Soviet Republics, its perception within Ukraine remained mixed, especially in the regions where Ukrainian was not traditionally spoken.\n\nOn September 25, 2017, a new law on education was signed by President (draft approved by Rada on September 5, 2017) which says that Ukrainian language is the language of education at all levels except for one or more subjects that are allowed to be taught in two or more languages, namely English or one of the other official languages of the European Union. The law stipulates a 3-year transitional period to come in full effect. In February 2018 this period was extended until 2023. The law was condemned by PACE that called it \"a major impediment to the teaching of national minorities\". The law also faced criticism from officials in Hungary, Romania and Russia. (Hungarian and Romanian are official languages of the European Union, Russian is not.) Ukrainian officials stressed that the new law complies fully with European norms on minority rights. The law does state that \"Persons belonging to indigenous peoples of Ukraine are guaranteed the right to study in public facilities of preschool and primary education in the language of instruction of the respective indigenous people, along with the state language of instruction\" in separate classes or groups. PACE describes this as a significant curtailing of the rights of indigenous peoples carried out without consultations with their representatives. On 27 June 2018 Ukrainian foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin stated that following the recommendation of the Venice Commission the language provision of the (September 2017) law on education will not apply to private schools and that every public school for national minorities \"will have broad powers to independently determine which classes will be taught in Ukrainian or their native language.\"\n\nSince 2004 the Ukrainian government has enacted restrictions on Russian-language television and radio programmes.\nRussian-language programmes are required to include a Ukrainian translation or subtitles, and local radio and television stations have the right to broadcast in Russian only if they can prove they have a Russian audience. There was some opposition against this ban. Today the ban is in full effect, but Russian movies are mostly subtitled in cinemas and on Ukrainian television. Non-Russian and non-Ukrainian movies which used to be dubbed in Russian may now only be dubbed, post-synchronized or subtitled in Ukrainian. Ukrainian authorities have defended the ban, stating that it aims to develop a home-grown Ukrainian distribution industry and to give Ukrainian distributors \"muscle\" in negotiating their own deals to buy foreign films. Russian distributors control around 90% of foreign films screened in Ukraine and tend to supply Russian-language dubbed or subtitled copies that are part of wider packages distributed throughout Russia and the former Soviet territories. Andriy Khalpakhchi, director the Ukrainian Cinema Foundation, claims \"Some European sellers at Berlin's film market are reporting that Russian buyers are already threatening not to buy films if they sell directly to Ukraine without using Russian distribution channels.\" Despite earlier fears that there would be problems due to the introduction of compulsory Ukrainian dubbing of films, the number of visitors to Ukrainian cinemas soared by 40% in Q1 of the year 2009 compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nSeveral Russian TV channels have not been allowed to broadcast in Ukraine since November 1, 2008, according to Ukraine's National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting mainly because of the advertising aired by the channels. The Ukrainian distributors of television channels were ordered to bring the broadcasts in line with Ukrainian laws. Channel One and Ren TV have since been granted temporary permission to broadcast, while a separate version of RTR Planeta was started specially for Ukrainian TV viewers in October 2009.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that in Ukraine \"the discriminatory, motivated, ideology-tinged and anti-Russian decisions that were being made when Yuschenko was President have been lifted\".\n\nOn 23 May 2017 Ukrainian parliament approved the law proposed in November 2016 that demands national, regional, satellite, and multi-channel TV and radio networks to broadcast at least 75% of their content (summarized on weekly basis separately in time intervals 7am6pm and 6pm10pm) in Ukrainian starting from 13 October 2017. 50% is required from local networks, and 75% of news programs is required in Ukrainian for all networks. Films and broadcasts which are not products of these networks and produced after 1991 must be broadcast exclusively in Ukrainian. Reasonable exceptions are provided for inclusion of non-Ukrainian language into otherwise Ukrainian-language broadcasts. The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine may permit exceptions to this law for broadcasts which serve elimination of threats to national security. At the time the only two national Ukrainian TV channels who did not already broadcast 75% of their content in Ukrainian were \"Inter\" and \"Ukraine\". Also because of this May 2017 approved law, since 8 November 2018 Ukrainian radio stations must broadcast no less than 35% of songs in Ukrainian or if it plays 60% of its songs in the official languages of the European Union then 25%.\n\nIn two presidential elections, in 1994 and 2004, the role of languages in Ukraine was an important election issue. In 1994 the main opposition candidate, Leonid Kuchma, in an attempt to widen his political appeal, expressed his support for the idea of Russian becoming the second state language, as well as promising to improve his knowledge of the Ukrainian language. In addition to the stagnating economy, the language issue likely contributed to Kuchma's victory in the election; but while his knowledge of Ukrainian noticeably improved, Kuchma did not follow through on his pledge to make Russian a state language during the 10 years of his presidency.\n\nIn 2004 an election promise by Viktor Yanukovych (leader of the Party of Regions) to adopt Russian as the second official language might also have increased the turnout of his base, but it was rebutted during the campaign by his opponent (Viktor Yushchenko), who pointed out that Yanukovych could have already taken steps towards this change while he was a Prime Minister of Ukraine if this had really been his priority. During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities. Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.\n\nIn the 2006 parliamentary election the status of the Russian language in Ukraine was brought up again by the opposition parties. The leading opposition party, Party of Regions, promised to introduce two official languages, Russian and Ukrainian, on the national and regional levels. On the national level such changes require modifying Article 10 of the Constitution of Ukraine, which the party hopes to achieve. Before the election in Kharkiv, and following the election in the other south-eastern regions such as Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and the Crimea, the newly elected local councils, won by the Party of Regions (and minor supporting parties), declared Russian as a regional language, citing the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ratified by Ukraine in 2003. The central government has questioned such actions of local councils, claiming they overstepped their authority. In Dnipropetrovsk, the court has found the order of the city council on introducing Russian as a regional language unlawful, but the legal battle on the local status of the Russian language remains to be resolved.\n\nIn the wake of the 2006 Parliamentary crisis in Ukraine that fractured the governing coalition and returned Yanukovych to the Prime Ministership, the \"Universal of National Unity\" signed by President Yushchenko as well as the leaders of several of the most influential political parties declared that Ukrainian would remain the official state language in Ukraine. However, within a week after signing the Universal, Yanukovych, then approved as Prime Minister of Ukraine, stated at a press conference in Sochi (Russia) that the implementation of Russian as a second state language remains the goal of his party even though he does not see it achieved in the immediate future because such a change, which would require amending the Constitution, would not collect the required majority (⅔) in the Parliament of Ukraine given the current political situation.\n\nDuring the electoral campaign for the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election Yanukovych at first stated that if he would be elected President he then will do everything in order to make Russian the second state language in Ukraine, but in an interview with Kommersant later during the campaign he stated that the status of Russian in Ukraine \"is too politicized\" and said that if elected President in 2010 he would \"have a real opportunity to adopt a law on languages, which implements the requirements of the European Charter of regional languages\". He implied this law would need 226 votes in the Ukrainian parliament (50% of the votes instead of the 75% of the votes needed to change the constitution of Ukraine). After his early 2010 election as President Yanukovych stated (on March 9, 2010) \"Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language\".\n\nAccording to the laws on civil and administrative procedure enacted in Ukraine in 2005, all legal and court proceedings in Ukraine are to be conducted in Ukrainian. This does not restrict, however, the usage of other languages, as the law guarantees interpretation services for any language desired by a citizen, defendant or witness.\n\nSince 2014 President Petro Poroshenko is claiming to be carrying out the \"Ukrainianization of the historical and political calendar - the replacement of the Soviet-Russian imposed upon us.\" This has led to the moving of military holidays to new dates and the creation of the Defender of Ukraine Day.\n\nThe 2017 abolisment of May 2 as public holiday (as it was in the Soviet era) and instead (since 2017) making Western Christianity's Christmas celibrated 25 December a new Ukrainian public holiday was also described as moving away from \"Moscow's calendar and Russian imperial standards\" (by Oleksandr Turchynov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine in 2017). (May 1's International Workers' Day remained a Ukrainian public holiday, although it was renamed (also in 2017) from \"Day of International Solidarity of Workers\" to \"Labor Day\".)\n\n\n"}

It is located about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Valencia south of the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway and roughly 32 km from the capital city Port of Spain.\n\nThe American rights to the airfield were obtained via the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940 when the United States transferred fifty destroyers to Great Britain in exchange for Army and Navy base rights on British possessions in the Americas.\n\nIn 1941, Trinidad was alarmed by a large number of Nazi U-Boats prowling off its coastline, intent on disrupting British shipping in the Caribbean Sea, and using the Vichy French controlled island of Martinique as a possible supply facility. Although the first United States Army personnel arrived on Trinidad on 24 April 1941, it was only after the United States' entry into the war, that Allied planners, in early 1942, decided to counter the Nazi threat by establishing major air and naval facilities on Trinidad.\n\nWaller Army Airfield was activated on 1 September 1941 with the assignment of the 92d Service Group. The unit's mission was to establish a flying facility within the United States Army Fort Read post. The unit consisted of the group's Headquarters, and the 92d Air Base and 309th Material Squadrons. The group was assigned to the Caribbean Air Force.\n\nWaller was built to be the premier US combat airbase in Trinidad, but events overtook the plan. The South Atlantic Air Route to Europe quickly developed and became the most often used method of getting aircraft to the African and European theaters of war. Air Transport Command flew aircraft to Waller from South Florida airfields, then from Waller, aircraft were flown to Belem Airfield, Brazil, then across the South Atlantic Ocean to Freetown Airport, Sierra Leone and then to North Africa or England. Airfield congestion at Waller became so acute that the combat aircraft, the bombers actually confronting the U-Boats, had to be moved out to Edinburgh (Carlsen) Airfield when it was completed.\n\nWith the establishment of United States bases on Trinidad and other Caribbean islands, the Nazi menace was eliminated by the action of numerous air and naval patrols. In 1943, President Roosevelt visited Waller Field on his way to the Casablanca Conference in North Africa.\n\n\nIn addition to the combat and transport flying units, Waller Field was also used as an aircraft maintenance and supply facility by the 24th Air Depot (Air Technical Service Command) which was deployed from Kelly Field, Texas on 20 January 1942. It was also used as a long-range reconnaissance base by several photo-recon squadrons.\n\nWith the end of World War II Waller Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was redesignated Waller Air Force Base on 26 March 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10.\n\nIts primary use was by Military Air Transport Service (MATS) as a transit facility under the 24th Composite Wing based at Borinquen AFB, Puerto Rico and by the MATS 6th Weather Squadron (Regional), which provided meteorological reports for aviation in the South Caribbean as well as tropical storm and hurricane reporting. President Harry S. Truman stopped at Waller Field on 31 August 1947 on his way to Brazil during a South American visit.\n\nWaller AFB was closed on 28 May 1949 due to budgetary cutbacks and MATS operations were shifted to bases in the Panama Canal Zone.\n\nAfter the base's closure, it became the informal home of various types of racing (using former airstrips) for over 40 years. Today construction progresses on the former airfield site of the Tamana InTech Park, a science and technology park which will include amenities including real estate lots for industries as well as the new multimillion-dollar University of Trinidad and Tobago campus complex, several housing developments and other projects.\n\n"}
