He was educated at Rishworth School, West Yorkshire, and, after a time working as a railway booking clerk, he went to Leeds University where he was awarded 1st Class BA in English in 1924 and a PhD in 1926. His PhD thesis was on the place-names of the North Riding and the study of place-names remained of continuing interest to him, resulting in several publications. He was Vaughan Fellow at Leeds University from 1924 to 1926, and was then lecturer in English at Saltley College, Birmingham from 1926 to 1928. In 1928 he went to Sweden and was English lecturer at Uppsala University, returning to England in 1930 to University College London (UCL) as a lecturer and reader. In 1937 he was awarded a DLit degree at London University. During World War II, he enlisted in the RAF as an intelligence officer and in 1941 joined the Scientific Intelligence Unit of the Air Ministry under R V Jones, ending with the rank of Wing Commander. He was awarded the OBE for his war-time work in 1947. In 1949 he succeeded Raymond Wilson Chambers as Quain Professor of English at University College London.

{"id": "203104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203104", "title": "Alpine tundra", "text": "Alpine tundra\n\nAlpine tundra is a type of natural region or biome that does not contain trees because it is at high elevation. As the latitude of a location approaches the poles, the threshold elevation for alpine tundra gets lower until it reaches sea level, and alpine tundra merges with polar tundra.\n\nThe high elevation causes an adverse climate, which is too cold and windy to support tree growth. Alpine tundra transitions to sub-alpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone are known as \"Krummholz\". With increasing elevation it ends at the snow line where snow and ice persist through summer.\n\nAlpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide. The flora of the alpine tundra is characterized by dwarf shrubs close to the ground. The cold climate of the alpine tundra is caused by adiabatic cooling of air, and is similar to polar climate.\n\nAlpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the Himalayas in Asia, American Cordillera in North and South America, the Scottish Highlands, the Alps, the Scandinavian mountains, Pyrenees and Carpathian Mountains of Europe, the Caucasus Mountains, the Rift Mountains of Africa, and a large portion of the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nAlpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.\n\nAveraging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between .\n\nAlpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.\n\nTypical high-elevation growing seasons range from 45 to 90 days, with average summer temperatures near . Growing season temperatures frequently fall below freezing, and frost occurs throughout the growing season in many areas. Precipitation occurs mainly as winter snow, but soil water availability is highly variable with season, location, and topography. For example, snowfields commonly accumulate on the lee sides of ridges while ridgelines may remain nearly snow free due to redistribution by wind. Some alpine habitats may be up to 70% snow free in winter. High winds are common in alpine ecosystems, and can cause significant soil erosion and be physically and physiologically detrimental to plants. Also, wind coupled with high solar radiation can promote extremely high rates of evaporation and transpiration.\n\nThere have been several attempts at quantifying what constitutes an alpine climate.\n\nClimatologist Wladimir Köppen demonstrated a relationship between the Arctic and Antarctic tree lines and the 10 °C summer isotherm; i.e., places where the average temperature in the warmest calendar month of the year is below 10 °C cannot support forests. See Köppen climate classification for more information.\n\nOtto Nordenskiöld theorized that winter conditions also play a role: His formula is \"W\" = 9 − 0.1 \"C\", where \"W\" is the average temperature in the warmest month and \"C\" the average of the coldest month, both in degrees Celsius (this would mean, for example, that if a particular location had an average temperature of in its coldest month, the warmest month would need to average or higher for trees to be able to survive there).\n\nIn 1947, Holdridge improved on these schemes, by defining biotemperature: the mean annual temperature, where all temperatures below 0 °C are treated as 0 °C (because it makes no difference to plant life, being dormant). If the mean biotemperature is between , Holdridge quantifies the climate as alpine.\n\nBecause the habitat of alpine vegetation is subject to intense radiation, wind, cold, snow, and ice, it grows close to the ground and consists mainly of perennial grasses, sedges, and forbs. Perennial herbs (including grasses, sedges, and low woody or semi-woody shrubs) dominate the alpine landscape; they have much more root and rhizome biomass than that of shoots, leaves, and flowers. The roots and rhizomes not only function in water and nutrient absorption but also play a very important role in over-winter carbohydrate storage. Annual plants are rare in this ecosystem and usually are only a few inches tall, with weak root systems. Other common plant life-forms include prostrate shrubs, graminoids forming tussocks, cushion plants, and cryptogams, such as bryophytes and lichens.\n\nRelative to lower elevation areas in the same region, alpine regions have a high rate of endemism and a high diversity of plant species. This taxonomic diversity can be attributed to geographical isolation, climate changes, glaciation, microhabitat differentiation, and different histories of migration or evolution or both. These phenomena contribute to plant diversity by introducing new flora and favoring adaptations, both of new species and the dispersal of pre-existing species.\nPlants have adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Cushion plants, looking like ground-hugging clumps of moss, escape the strong winds blowing a few inches above them. Many flowering plants of the alpine tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or red-colored pigments capable of converting the sun's light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer.\n\nAlpine areas are unique because of the severity and complexity of their environmental conditions. Very small changes in topography – as small as 1 foot (0.3 m) or less – may mean the difference between a windswept area or an area of snow accumulation, changing the potential productivity and plant community drastically. Between these extremes of drought versus saturation, several intermediate environments may exist all within a few yards of each other, depending on topography, substrate, and climate. Alpine vegetation generally occurs in a mosaic of small patches with widely differing environmental conditions. Vegetation types vary from cushion and rosette plants on the ridges and in the rock crannies; to herbaceous and grassy vegetation along the slopes; dwarf shrubs with grasses and forbs below the melting snowdrifts; and sedges, grasses, low shrubs, and mosses in the bogs and along the brooks.\nAlpine meadows form where sediments from the weathering of rocks has produced soils well-developed enough to support grasses and sedges. Non-flowering lichens cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed algal cells can photosynthesize at any temperature above , and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. The adaptations for survival of drying winds and cold may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects the tundra is very fragile. Repeated footsteps often destroy tundra plants, allowing exposed soil to blow away; recovery may take hundreds of years.\n\nBecause alpine tundra is located in various widely separated regions of the Earth, there is no animal species common to all areas of alpine tundra. Some animals of alpine tundra environments include the kea, marmot, mountain goat, Bighorn sheep, chinchilla, Himalayan tahr, yak and pika.\n\n"}

Summer annuals germinate during spring or early summer and mature by autumn of the same year. Winter annuals germinate during the autumn and mature during the spring or summer of the following calendar year.\n\nOne seed-to-seed life cycle for an annual can occur in as little as a month in some species, though most last several months. Oilseed rapa can go from seed-to-seed in about five weeks under a bank of fluorescent lamps. This style of growing is often used in classrooms for education. Many desert annuals are therophytes, because their seed-to-seed life cycle is only weeks and they spend most of the year as seeds to survive dry conditions.\nIn cultivation, many food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including virtually all domesticated grains. Some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered cold hardy for the local climate. Carrot, celery and parsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. Tomato, sweet potato and bell pepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals. Ornamental perennials commonly grown as annuals are impatiens, mirabilis, wax begonia, snapdragon, \"pelargonium\", coleus and petunia. Examples of true annuals include corn, wheat, rice, lettuce, peas, watermelon, beans, zinnia and marigold.\n\nSummer annuals sprout, flower, produce seed, and die, during the warmer months of the year.\n\nThe lawn weed crabgrass is a summer annual.\n\nWinter annuals germinate in autumn or winter, live through the winter, then bloom in winter or spring.\n\nThe plants grow and bloom during the cool season when most other plants are dormant or other annuals are in seed form waiting for warmer weather to germinate. Winter annuals die after flowering and setting seed. The seeds germinate in the autumn or winter when the soil temperature is cool.\n\nWinter annuals typically grow low to the ground, where they are usually sheltered from the coldest nights by snow cover, and make use of warm periods in winter for growth when the snow melts. Some common winter annuals include henbit, deadnettle, chickweed, and winter cress.\n\nWinter annuals are important ecologically, as they provide vegetative cover that prevents soil erosion during winter and early spring when no other cover exists and they provide fresh vegetation for animals and birds that feed on them. Although they are often considered to be weeds in gardens, this viewpoint is not always necessary, as most of them die when the soil temperature warms up again in early to late spring when other plants are still dormant and have not yet leafed out.\n\nEven though they do not compete directly with cultivated plants, sometimes winter annuals are considered a pest in commercial agriculture, because they can be hosts for insect pests or fungal diseases (ovary smut – Microbotryum sp) which attack crops being cultivated. The property that they prevent the soil from drying out can also be problematic for commercial agriculture.\n\nIn 2008, it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to the conversion into a perennial plant. Researchers deactivated the SOC1 and FUL genes in \"Arabidopsis thaliana\", which control flowering time. This switch established phenotypes common in perennial plants, such as wood formation.\n\n"}

A cadastral community records property ownership in a cadastre, which is a register describing property ownership by boundary lines of the real estate.\n\nThe common etymology in the Central European successor states of the Habsburg Monarchy comes from (KG), plural: \"Katastralgemeinden\", translated as \n\nIn 1764, at the behest of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, a complete survey of the Habsburg lands was begun, initiated by the general staff of the Imperial and Royal Army under Field Marshal Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, who had become aware of the lack of reliable maps in the Seven Years' War. Maria Theresa's son Emperor Joseph II ordered the implication of a complete urbarium for property tax purposes in 1785. The present-day cadastre was completed after the Napoleonic Wars from 1817 onwards under Emperor Francis I of Austria (\"Franziszeischer Kataster\"). Since then, the Austrian (i.e. Cisleithanian) crown lands were subdivided in \"Katastralgemeinden\"; surveying in the Hungarian (Transleithanian) lands started in 1850. Municipalities as administrative subdivisions with certain rights of self-governance were not established until after the 1848 revolutions.\n\nMost of the nowadays \"Katastralgemeinden\" once had been independent communes and were incorporated on the occasion of a municipal territory reforms. They can be further divided into smaller villages and localities (\"Ortschaften\"). there are 7,847 Katastralgemeinden in Austria. For land registration, the unit identifier used in a \"Katastralgemeinde\" is \"KG-Nr\" (KG-Nummer, or number).\n\nThe Dutch system of \"kadastrale gemeenten\" was set up around 1830. When municipalities are merged, often the cadastral communes remain as they were, so one civil municipality can consist of more than one cadastral commune; but again, a cadastral commune can never be part of more than one civil municipality.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "191256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191256", "title": "Caroline Islands", "text": "Caroline Islands\n\nThe Caroline Islands (or the Carolines) are a widely scattered archipelago of tiny islands in the western Pacific Ocean, to the north of New Guinea. Politically they are divided between the Federated States of Micronesia in the eastern part of the group, and Palau at the extreme western end. Historically, this area was also called Nuevas Filipinas or New Philippines as they were part of the Spanish East Indies and governed from Manila in the Philippines. \n\nThe Carolines span a distance of approximately 3540 kilometers (2200 miles), from Tobi, Palau at the westernmost point to Kosrae at the easternmost.\n\nThe group consists of about 500 small coral islands, east of the Philippines, in the Pacific Ocean; the distance from Manila to Yap, one of the larger islands of the group, is .\n\nMost of the islands comprise low, flat coral atolls, but some rise high above sea level.\n\nThe native inhabitants speak a variety of Micronesian languages including Pohnpeian, Chuukese, Carolinian, and Kosraean, as well as the Western Malayo-Polynesian languages Palauan and Chamorro, and the unclassified language Yapese (possibly one of the Admiralty Islands languages). Other significant populations include Filipinos and Japanese.\n\nThe natives live mainly on horticulture and fishing, also supplementing their diet with many different varieties of bananas and taro, either of the \"swamp\" or \"purple\" varieties. On some islands housing continues to be built with local materials including coconut thatch. The language spoken in commerce is English, but there are several indigenous languages. They traditionally believe in a Supreme Being (Yalafar) and in a bad spirit (Can), yet they have hardly any religious rites. Due to extensive missionary work, Christianity is the primary religion practiced in this region of Micronesia.\n\nMicronesian Navigator Mau Piailug was from the Carolinian island of Satawal. He learned the traditional navigation techniques of the Weriyeng school. These techniques had been preserved while similar techniques had been forgotten elsewhere partly due to the remoteness of the Carolinian Islands. In the 1970s Mau shared his knowledge with the Polynesian Voyaging Society which led to a revival of traditional Polynesian navigation and a new anthropological understanding of the history of Polynesian and Micronesian peoples.\n\nIn 1985 a study was made on the origin of the sidereal compass used in the Caroline Islands.\n\nDifferent islands and island groups in the Carolines passed down unique and variant oral legends recounting the origins and early histories of their peoples. On Pohnpei, for example, pre-colonial history is divided into three eras: \"Mwehin Kawa\" or \"Mwehin Aramas\" (Period of Building, or Period of Peopling, before c. 1100); \"Mwehin Sau Deleur\" (Period of the Lord of Deleur, c. 1100 to c. 1628); and \"Mwehin Nahnmwarki\" (Period of the Nahnmwarki, c. 1628 to c. 1885). Pohnpeian legend recounts that the Saudeleur rulers, the first to bring government to Pohnpei, were of foreign origin. The Saudeleur centralized form of absolute rule is characterized in Pohnpeian legend as becoming increasingly oppressive over several generations. Arbitrary and onerous demands, as well as a reputation for offending Pohnpeian deities, sowed resentment among Pohnpeians. The Saudeleur Dynasty ended with the invasion of Isokelekel, another semi-mythical foreigner, who replaced the Saudeleur rule with the more decentralized \"nahnmwarki\" system in existence today.\n\nIn mid-1525 a storm carried the Portuguese navigators Diogo da Rocha and Gomes de Sequeira eastward from the Moluccas (via Celebes); they reached several islands of the Carolines and stayed there until January 20, 1526. The Spanish explorers Toribio Alonso de Salazar and Diego de Saavedra arrived on August 22, 1526, sighting the Island of San Bartolomé or Taongui. On 1 January 1528 the discoverer Álvaro de Saavedra took possession of the Uluti Islands on behalf of the King of Spain. Spanish explorers visited the archipelago in 1542 (Matelotes Islands), 1543, and 1545. In 1565 Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governor-General of the Philippines (in office 1565–1572), passed through.\n\nThe islands, known to contemporary Spaniards as \"Islas de las Hermanas\", \"Hombres Pintados\" and \"Los Jardines\", dropped out of European consciousness until 1686, when Francisco de Lezcano came to Yap and called the islands \"Las Carolinas\", in honor of King Carlos II of Spain (reigned 1665–1700). The name was extended to include the Palau Islands and the archipelagos which were named the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands by British explorers who visited them a century later, between 1788 and 1799.\n\nThe colonization of the Caroline Islands had, as in most of the Spanish colonies, a marked religious character. A royal decree of October 19, 1707 granted authorization for the sending of missionaries in several expeditions to the islands. One such expedition (1731) was made by Father Juan Antonio Cantova, who was killed. As a result, Spain ceased relations with the Caroline Islands until 1787. Relations resumed later, but with a distinctly commercial character.\n\nIn 1852 the Spanish colonel Coello suggested to the Spanish government that the effective occupation of the Caroline Islands provided trade advantages between the Philippines and Australia, New Guinea and the Americas, but Spain ignored his suggestions until 1885. In that year, the Spanish representative Butron and the kings of Koror and Artingal signed an act which recognized the sovereignty of the king of Spain on the Carolines. Having secured the territory, Spain attempted to establish custom duties in the region in 1875, but Germany and the United Kingdom protested because Spain's previous abandonment of the islands had allowed the arrival of German and British missions there. A conflict arose, leading to the submission of these facts for arbitration by Pope Leo XIII, who recognized Spanish rights on the islands west of the 164th meridian east; he assigned to Germany the Marshall Islands and the right to maintain a naval station in one of the Caroline Islands, a right that Germany never exercised.\n\nAfter the Spanish–American War of 1898, Spain sold the Carolines and the Northern Marianas to Germany in the German–Spanish Treaty (1899) for 25 million pesetas or 17 million goldmark (nearly 1,000,000 pounds sterling), while reserving to itself the right to establish a coal mine in the area. Germany governed the archipelago as the \"Karolinen\", administratively associated with German New Guinea.\n\nJapan invaded and occupied the islands in 1914, during World War I. This occupation was carried out by two naval squadrons: the Western Carolines under the squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Matsumura Tatsuo (1868–1932), and the Eastern Carolines under Vice-Admiral Yamaya Tanin (1866–1940). In 1920, after the conclusion of World War I, Japan received a League of Nations mandate over the Caroline and Marshall Islands. During World War II, Japan had a large base set up at Truk Lagoon which was used for expansion into the southeastern Pacific. In the latter years of the war, during the Japanese withdrawal to the Japanese home islands, the Allies effectively neutralized Truk in Operation Hailstone. After the war, the islands (together with the Marshall Islands) became trust territories of the United States, with the Federated States of Micronesia gaining independence in 1986, followed by Palau in 1994.\n\nDistrict officers (from 1889, styled Bezirksamtmann):\n\nIn the \"western Caroline islands\" (Yap and Palau [and from 1907 Saipan])\n\nIn the \"Eastern Caroline islands\" (Ponape, and including the Marshall Islands from 1911)\n\nTwo Jesuits, Juan Antonio Cantova (also known as John Anthony Cantova) and Victor Walter, attempted missionary work there in 1731; the former was soon murdered and the latter obliged to flee. Two other Jesuits were killed later. In 1767 the Jesuits were suppressed in the Spanish dominions, and during the next 120 years there has been no trace of a missionary.\n\nThe controversy between Germany and Spain concerning the possession of the Carolines having been settled by Pope Leo XIII in favour of Spain, the king directed Spanish Capuchins to the islands, 15 March 1886, and the \"Propaganda Fide\" officially established that mission, 15 May 1886, dividing it into two sections, named West and East Carolines respectively. Until then the islands had belonged ecclesiastically to the Vicariate Apostolic of Micronesia. The Spanish Capuchins had a catechism and prayer book printed in the Ponape dialect, and Father Anthony of Valentia wrote a small grammar and dictionary of the Yap dialect in 1890.\n\nWhen the Spanish Fathers had laid the foundations of the mission, these islands passed by purchase into the hands of Germany in 1899. Spain had contributed more than $5000 a year towards the mission; Germany granted no support. Spain had compelled the aborigines to send their children to school; Germany gave full liberty in this regard, and the people consequently began to neglect school as well as church. The mission thereby suffered greatly, and the \"Propaganda Fide\" finally deemed it advisable to replace the Spanish Capuchins with others of German nationality (7 November 1904) and to erect one Apostolic prefecture instead of the two separate missions (18 December 1905). The Very Reverend Father Venantius of Prechtal, Germany was appointed first prefect Apostolic.\n\nIn 1906 twelve fathers and twelve brothers were working in thirteen stations, and several Sisters of St. Francis left Luxembourg to take charge of the ten schools, in which were 262 children. Ninety adult converts were the \"harvest\" of that year, and the Catholic population is given as 1900 among 11,600 unconverted natives and a few Protestants. The United States Government sent, 1 July 1905, a Jesuit from the Manila Observatory to erect a meteorological station on the island of Yap, of which station the Capuchin Father Callistus was appointed director. The origin of the East-Asiatic typhoons had been traced to these regions, and twice a day observations are made, and notice is frequently given to Manila by cable.\n\nDuring the period of German control, Germany issued postage stamps for the islands; see postage stamps and postal history of the Caroline Islands for more details.\n\n\n"}

Later that year and over the course of 1885 he surveyed the Rocky Mountains region, after which he continued his work in the gold district of Madoc, Ontario (1886), the phosphate district of Ottawa (1887–1890) and then the Kingston and Pembroke districts of Ontario (1891–1893).\n\nAfter spending 1894 as the geological survey's geographer and chief draughtsman, White was appointed chief geographer of the department of the interior in 1899. He served on the Alaska boundary commission in 1903 and undertook an investigation into trans-Atlantic passenger steamships in 1906.\n\nWhite was interested in the concept of Canadian sovereignty, particularly as it affected claims to the Alaska boundary region. In 1904 he proposed that the Geographic Board of Canada counteract American naming of territory by referring to the area as Ellesmere Land.\n\nJames White was appointed secretary of the Commission of Conservation in 1909. Canada was supplying countries such as Australia and America with wood, but by 1920, many Commonwealth countries were becoming concerned over a shortage in supply of wood and associated paper products. In his position with the Commission of Conservation, White emphasized that the Canadian forest resources were limited but also noted that the Commission had no administrative powers and was not aligned with any particular political ideology.\n\nWhite pointed out that Canada had \"55 years' supply...at 1918 rates of consumption, and the rate...is increasing\" and added that recent fires had destroyed twenty times as many trees as had been cut down for timber. He advocated a system of conservation designed to protect business as well as the environment, saying:\n\n\"The only proper way to conserve any resource is to develop it to the point of highest productivity and with the maximum of efficiency, and to use every means to maintain its productivity. To withhold any natural resource from use under proper conditions...is waste in the grossest form.\"\n\n\n\nWhite is buried at Beechwood Cemetery, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n"}

The name, Lataband, means 'Mountain of Rags' as there was an old belief that people who hung bits of clothing on the bushes along the way, had their wishes granted.\n\nThe Lataband Pass is a difficult and dangerous pass which was on the only road suitable for carriages or motor vehicles between Kabul and Jalalabad until the longer, but less precipitous route via the Khord Kabul was used by the Moghuls in the 16th century. An integral part of the ancient Silk Road, it was still in use until 1960, when the route via Tangi Gharu route was finally completed and paved. This new road reduced travel time between Kabul and the Pakistan border from two days to only a few hours. It was for many centuries an important link on the trade route between Central Asia and South Asia, and a strategic military location.\n\nThe village of Ak Bolak is located at the east end of the pass.\n\n\"A military post was established at this point by the British during the Second Afghan War (1878-80), which was held by Colonel Hudson while Afghan forces held the nearby post of Sherpur. Hudson’s forces were surrounded but could communicate by heliograph in clear weather (an apparatus which used a movable mirror to reflect sunlight to signal to distant points). Colonel Hudson’s force at Lataband, together with troops stationed at the garrison at Jagdalak near the pass, fought against the Tezin Ghilzais who occupied the surrounding hills and eventually drove them off.\" \n\n\n"}

A trail winds its way up the forested hillside to the top, culminating atop the \"lion's head\". The trail can be followed across the profile of the lion, eventually linking up with the MacLehose Trail. The rock provides a view of the city and Hong Kong Island in the distance. The entire mountain is located within Lion Rock Country Park in Hung Mui Kuk, Tai Wai and is made passable by vehicles by Lion Rock Tunnel, which connects Kowloon Tong and Tai Wai.\n\nLion Rock is near another famous rock structure, the Amah Rock. A road in Kowloon City is named Lion Rock Road (獅子石道).\n\nAfter World War II and communists' victory in the China Civil War, many people who fled to Hong Kong from Mainland China lived in squatters in Kowloon, where the Lion Rock is clearly visible. The lives of the era, during which Hong Kong was rebuilt from poverty, was depicted by the RTHK TV series \"Below the Lion Rock\"; the first episode was broadcast in 1974). The series featured some of the early work of now famous film directors such as Ann Hui. Its theme song \"Beneath the Lion Rock\", sung by Roman Tam, is considered to indicate the spirit of the Hong Kong people. The name of the series and its eponymous theme song has since been connected to the \"Lion Rock Spirit\" (), used to refer to Hong Kong as a whole.\n\nThe second version of the government-sponsored Brand Hong Kong contains a siloutte of the Lion Rock. According to the brand, the Lion Rock represents \"the Hong Kong people's 'can-do' spirit\".\n\nA banner writing “我要真普選” (I want real universal suffrage) was hung up near the head of the 'Lion' on 23 October 2014 to show supports towards 2014 Hong Kong protests.

From 13th century lands of modern Belarus were a major part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania which later became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 19th century Belarus together with Lithuania formed the Northwestern Krai of Russian Empire. At the beginning of the 20th century there was a short-lived Belarusian National Republic, and in 1922 Belarus became part of the USSR as Belarusian SSR except West Belarus, which was under Polish rule, which was briefly interrupted due to Soviet occupation during Polish-Soviet War. In 1991, Belarus regained its independence.\n\n\nIn 978, with the marriage of Rogneda, daughter of Ragvalod, with Vladimir I of Kiev, the Principality of Polotsk became property of the Rurik Dynasty. It was ruled by Rurikid members until the second half of the 14th century, when it was taken by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\nBetween 978 and 1101, the Principality of Polotsk's domain was uncontested in the majority of the Belarusian territory. Polotsk possibly reached the peak of its influence with the access of Vseslav the Seer to the Kievan throne, but at the death of the latter Polotsk was split in three smaller principalities: a smaller Polotsk, the Principality of Minsk and the Principality of Vitebsk.\n\nThe Rurikids were descendants of Rurik (\"Hrørekr\"), a Varangian pagan konung or chieftain, who supposedly was of haplogroup N1c1, which is common among Finno-Ugric peoples and not so rare in Baltic region.\n\nOn the death of Vseslav the Seer, the Principality was divided between his sons and descendants, in three major principalities:\n\n\nTitle: Grand Duke (\"Вялікі князь\" in Belarusian, \"Wielki książę\" in Polish, \"Kunigaikštis\" or \"Didysis Kunigaikštis\" in Lithuanian)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In this sense, \"country\" refers to the name of the \"land\"...the \"ground\"...the \"territory\" of a nation, rather than the name of the nation (\"tribe\") itself. This article is only about the name for the \"land\" of a nation.\n\nFor example, the traditional territory (country/land) of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Nation is called \"Waaziija\", meaning \"the Grand Pinery\". In English, the land of an indigenous nation was historically, and sometimes still is, referred to as a \"country\", such as \"(the) Winnebago country\". Some Latinate forms exist in English such as \"Iroquoia\", \"Huronia\", and \"Apacheria\".\n\nThe distinction between nation and land is like the French people versus the land of \"France\", the Māori people versus \"Aotearoa\", or the Saami people versus \"Sápmi\" (Saamiland).\n\nFor the purpose of this list, \"nation\" refers to the historic, whole national identities, rather than to the fragmented \"reservation nations\" or \"bands\". The whole nations are what John Beaucage, Grand Council Chief of the Anishinabek Nation, refers to as \"true nations\" in contrast with the fragmented \"First Nations\":\n\nOr what the Government of Quebec calls \"the 11 aboriginal nations of Québec\" in contrast with their component \"55 aboriginal communities\".\nAnd so the criteria for inclusion is not the same as what are named \"Indian tribes\" by the U.S. Federal Register and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), or what are called \"First Nations\" by the Canadian government and Assembly of First Nations (AFN). It would be interesting to compile the names for the \"band territories\" of the 633 fragmented First Nations of the AFN, or the names of the \"reservation territories\" of the 632 fragmented Indian Nations of the NCAI, but that is beyond the scope of this article, except as side notes in the \"further information\" column.\n\nSo this list does not include the names for reservations or reserves, but only of the entire national homeland (or the homeland of a confederated identity such as the Haudenosaunee Confederacy or Colville tribes). For example, this list wouldn't give the Cherokee name for the Qualla Boundary reservation, but only the name for \"the Cherokee country\" as a whole. Ideally a single name could conceivably encompass not only the Contact-era ancestral territory, but also any area which at some time or another was conceived to be part of the national domain, such as post-Removal lands.\n\nThe names do not have to be from olden days. The names could be recently coined and still be included in this list.\n\nCompiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as it requires some discernment as to what are the \"whole nations\" — the \"true nations\" in Beaucage's words.\n"}

The system was supposedly built, or at least started, during the time of Joseph Stalin and was codenamed D-6 (Д-6) by the KGB. It is supposedly still operated by the Main Directorate of Special Programmes and Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe length of Metro-2 is rumored to exceed that of the public Metro. It is said to have four lines, and to lay 50–200 meters (165-660 ft) deep. It is said to connect the Kremlin with the Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters, the government airport at Vnukovo-2, and an underground town at Ramenki, in addition to other locations of national importance.\n\nIn 1994, the leader of an urban exploration group, the Diggers of the Underground Planet, claimed to have found an entrance to this underground system.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, the literary and journalistic magazine \"Yunost\" ('Юность') published a novel by the author and screenwriter Vladimir Gonik entitled \"Preispodniaia\" ('Преисподняя') (English: \"Abyss\"), set in an underground bunker in Moscow. Earlier, in the spring of that year, excerpts from the novel had been published in the weekly newspaper \"Sovershenno sekretno\" . In an interview with both the newspaper's editor and Gonik in 1993, the author stated that the term \"Metro-2\" had been introduced to them, and that the novel had been written based on information collected over the previous 20 years by the two of them on things such as secret bunkers and the underground railways connecting them. Gonik admitted that he had worked on the book between 1973 and 1986, and that some of the more sensitive information had been purposefully misrepresented.\n\nIn later years, Gonik has argued that the bunkers, and therefore the so-called \"Metro-2\", had been for use by the leadership of the Politburo and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), along with their families, in case of war. According to him, in the early 1970s the General Secretary of the CPSU, Leonid Brezhnev, personally visited the main bunker, and, in 1974, awarded the Chairman of the KGB at the time, Yuri Andropov, the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of Socialist Labour. Apparently, each member of the Central Committee had a apartment, with a study, lounge, kitchen and bathroom. Gonik claims to have gathered this information working as a doctor in the polyclinic of the Ministry of Defence.\n\nAfter the publication of the novel in 1992, the subject of a second, secret, underground railway has been raised many times, especially in the Russian media. In particular, the magazine \"Ogoniok\" has referred to a \"Metro-2\" several times.\n\nRussian journalists have reported that the existence of Metro-2 is neither confirmed nor denied by the FSB or the Moscow Metro administration. However, listed below is evidence for the Metro-2's existence.\n\nIn 1991, the United States Department of Defense published a report entitled \"Military forces in transition\", which devoted several pages to a secret government underground in Moscow. It also included a diagram of the system superimposed on a map of the city.\n\"The Soviets have constructed deep-underground both in urban Moscow and outside the city. These facilities are interconnected by a network of deep interconnected subway lines that provide a quick and secure means of evacuation for the leadership. The leadership can move from their peacetime offices through concealed entryways in protective quarters beneath the city. There are important deep-underground command posts in the Moscow area, one located at the Kremlin. Soviet press has noted the presence of an enormous underground leadership bunker adjacent to Moscow State University. These facilities are intended for the national command authority in wartime. They are estimated to be between and deep, and can accommodate an estimated 10,000 people. A special subway line runs from some points in Moscow and possibly to the VIP terminal at Vnukovo Airfield(...)\"\n\n—Military forces in transition, 1991, p. 40\n\nIn 1992, in an interview with \"Time\", Deputy Director Broadcaster Igor Malashenko spoke about the existence of Sofrino-2, about to the north-east of Moscow's television broadcasting centers, built at great depths in case of nuclear war. According to Malashenko, the equipment was unusable due to age. He went on to say that the same fate befell many of the underground bomb shelters, and in particular a system of underground bunkers beneath the building of Moscow State University, which he said were flooded and had deteriorated.\n\nIn 2004, former advisor of Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Boris Yeltsin and then president Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Shevchenko confirmed the existence of a secret in the Moscow Metro.\n\"Reports on the number of underground communications are greatly exaggerated. In the days of Stalin, who was very afraid of assassination attempts, there was in fact a single-track underground railway line running from the Kremlin to his so-called \"Nearby Dacha\" in Volynskoye. Today, neither the Dacha nor the subway line are in use. In addition, there were underground transport links between the General Staff and several other government facilities. In 1991 \na pneumatic mail tube was constructed between the CPSU Central Committee building in Moscow's Old Square and the Kremlin.\"\n\nIn 2008, Shevchenko once again touched upon the Metro-2.\n\"Currently, the Kremlin subway cannot be called a transportation artery, and, as far as I know, for its continued operation it required major repairs: for among other things there are a lot of underground utilities which will eventually decay.\"\n\nIn 2008, Mikhail Poltoranin , a minister under Boris Yeltsin in the early 1990s, explained\n\"This is an extensive network of tunnels and an emergency command center in case of war, where you can command the nuclear forces of the country. It can hide a lot of people - its maintenance was necessary. I know that the \"Metro-2\" has branches that go to the suburbs so that the command could move away from the epicenter of a nuclear attack.\"\n\nWhen ex-chief of the Moscow Metro Dmitry Gayev was questioned on the existence of the Metro-2, he responded:\n\"I would be surprised if it did not exist.\"\nIn the same year, in an interview with \"Izvestia\", he said:\n\"There is a lot of talk about the existence of secret transport tunnels. I will not deny anything. I would be surprised if they did not exist. You ask: Can we use them to transport passengers? It is not for me to decide, but for those organizations who own the railways. I do not exclude such a possibility.\"\n\nIn 2008, in an interview in \"Argumenty i Fakty\", the head of the Moscow Metro independent trade union, Svetlana Razina, admitted:\n\"Several years ago, among the drivers of the Izmailovo depot there was a recruiting for a service on secret routes, and although there were many willing, they were to select only one. Entering the midst of these tunnels is only for people with special clearance. Most often, these branches used very short trains, consisting of battery-electric locomotive and one passenger car.\"\n\nAs stated in a report of ITAR-TASS in 2007:\n\"Line of the Metro-2 has long been in the KGB office, and subsequently came under the wing of the FSB.\"\n\nFormer head of Moscow's central administrative district and onetime information minister Alexander Muzykantskiy stated:\n\"Its underground transport communications connecting the Kremlin with the command posts, which are designed to ensure the stable operation of the senior military and political leadership in times of armed conflict, including a nuclear conflict. This is a gigantic system. It was built for 40 years. It cost a huge amount of money. For 91 years, the very existence of this system was the highest state secret.\"\n\nOleg Gordievsky, a former colonel of the KGB who worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) for 11 years and defected in 1985, in an interview with \"Argumenty i Fakty\" called \"The supreme secret of the KGB, which has not been disclosed until now\" stated\n\"You still do not know the main KGB secret yet: a huge underground city, a whole communications network of such facilities. But they will not show you; they will never, of course.\"\n\nIn 2006, the Museum of the Cold War was opened to the public, located in the old Tagansky Protected Command Point at a depth of . Initially it was a defence bunker (GO-42 or RFQ \"Tagan\"), yet its depth is significantly higher than that purported of the Metro-2 lines, and so it could not have been part of the Metro-2 system.\n\nIn south-west Moscow, near the Ramenki District, there is a vacant lot to the south-west of the main building of Moscow State University. A complex of buildings of the research base of Association \"Science\" (NEBO \"Nauka\"), built to a depth of between and 200 m, is the largest underground bunker in Moscow. According to the same source, it is connected with other secret underground facilities, and appears to be able to house up to 15,000 people. A complex of surface buildings was built by architect Eugene Rozanov in 1975 by orders of Glavspetsstroy.\n\nOne of the first times the facility was mentioned was in \"Time\" in 1992. Its article refers to a journalist named \"KGB officer\", who claims he took part in the construction of a large underground facility in Ramenki. It was claimed construction began in the mid-1960s and was complete by mid-1970. The facility was named by the journalist as the \"Underground City\", which was supposedly intended to give refuge to 15,000 people for 30 years in the event of a nuclear attack on Moscow.\n\nIn the media, the \"Underground City\" is often referred to as \"Ramenki-43\", due to that being the address of one of the supposed entrances to the facility. Ostensibly, the address is home to Militarized Rescue Squad 21 and the 1st Paramilitary Rescue Squad.\n\nThe video game \"Metro 2033\" features the underground city and secret metro.\n\n\n"}

The way to split the numbers is \ndefined in the National Numbering Plan 2003 as XXXX-NNNNNN. Here, \"XXXX\" identifies the network operator and the telecom circle while \"NNNNNN\" identifies the subscriber.\n\nThe Department of Telecommunications has divided India into various telecom circles such that within each circle, the call is treated as a local call, while across zones, it becomes a long-distance call. As of July 2018 there are 22 telecom circles or service areas. They are classified into four categories: Metro, A, B, C. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata fall under Metro category. Chennai service area doesn't come under Metro category, as it has been a part of the Tamil Nadu service circle since 2007.\n\nA telecom circle is normally the entire state, with a few exceptions like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata (which are different zones than their respective states), Goa (which is a part of the Maharashtra zone), Chhattisgarh (which is part of Madhya Pradesh), Sikkim (which is part of West Bengal) Jharkhand (which is a part of the Bihar zone) or Uttar Pradesh (divided into east and west zones). Delhi is a unique circle because it includes towns from Haryana (Gurgaon and Faridabad) and Uttar Pradesh (Noida and Ghaziabad) as well. Recent formation of the new state of Telangana has been separated from Andhra Pradesh state which will still remain in the same circle.\n\nFrom May 20, 2005, calls between Mumbai Metro and Maharashtra Telecom Circle, between Chennai Metro and Tamil Nadu Telecom Circle, and between Uttar Pradesh (East) and Uttar Pradesh (West) Telecom Circle service areas are merged in Inter service area connectate in the above-mentioned four states would be treated as intra-service area call for the purposes of routing as well as Access Deficit Charges (ADC). The dialing procedure for calls within a state for these states would also be simplified, i.e. dialing of mobile-to mobile subscribers and fixed-to-mobile subscribers would be without prefixing '0'.\n\nIn December 2017, Reliance Jio started with the newest of all, \"the six-series-mobile numbers\", keeping in mind the growing number of users in India.

The highest segment is a low mountain landform called Moqattam Mountain.\nIn the past the low mountain range was an important ancient Egyptian quarry site for limestone, used in the construction of temples and pyramids.\n\nThe hills are in the region of ancient Fustat, the new capital founded by 'Amr ibn al-'As after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 CE.

The mountain is the catchment area for the several rivers such as the Suam River, which becomes the Turkwel downstream and drains into Lake Turkana, and the Nzoia River and the Lwakhakha River, which flow to Lake Victoria. The town of Kitale is in the foothills of the mountain. The area around the mountain is protected by two Mount Elgon National Parks, one on each side of the international border.\n\nSome rare plants are found on the mountain, including \"Ardisiandra wettsteinii\", \"Carduus afromontanus\", \"Echinops hoehnelii\", \"Ranunculus keniensis\", and \"Romulea keniensis\".\n\nMount Elgon and its tributaries are home to four tribes, the Bagisu, the Sapiinjak, the Sabaot, also known as the Elgon Masai and the Ogiek, better known in the region under the derogatory umbrella term Ndorobo.\n\n\n"}

It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the National Marine Electronics Association. It replaces the earlier NMEA 0180 and NMEA 0182 standards. In marine applications, it is slowly being phased out in favor of the newer NMEA 2000 standard.\n\nThe electrical standard that is used is EIA-422, although most hardware with NMEA-0183 outputs are also able to drive a single EIA-232 port. Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.\n\nThe NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple ASCII, serial communications protocol that defines how data are transmitted in a \"sentence\" from one \"talker\" to multiple \"listeners\" at a time. Through the use of intermediate expanders, a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners, and using multiplexers, multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port.\n\nAt the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages accurately.\n\nThere is a variation of the standard called NMEA-0183HS that specifies a baud rate of 38,400. This is in general use by AIS devices.\n\n\n\nAs an example, a waypoint arrival alarm has the form:\n\nAnother example for AIS messages is:\n\nThe new standard, NMEA 2000, accommodates several \"talkers\" at a higher baud rate, without using a central hub, or round-robin packet buffering.\n\nThe NMEA standard is proprietary and sells for at least US$250 (except for members of the NMEA) as of November 2017. However, much of it has been reverse-engineered from public sources.\n\nMost GPS manufacturers include special messages in addition to the standard NMEA set in their products for maintenance and diagnostics purposes. Extended messages begin with \"$P\". These extended messages are not standardized.\n\nNMEA 0183 is supported by various navigation and mapping software. Notable applications include:\n\nA sample file produced by a Tripmate 850 GPS logger. This file was produced in Leixlip, County Kildare, Ireland. The record lasts two seconds.\nNote some blank fields, for example:\n\nThe checksum at the end of each sentence is the XOR of all of the bytes in the sentence, excluding the initial dollar sign. The following C code generates a checksum for the string entered as \"mystring\" and prints it to the output stream. In the example, a sentence from the sample file is used.\n\nNMEA 0183 continued to be maintained separately: V4.10 was published in early May 2012, and an erratum noted on 12 May 2012. It is not clear whether there is any active development. The latest NMEA announcement on the subject is older than the V4.10 standard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23550210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23550210", "title": "North Vietnam", "text": "North Vietnam\n\nNorth Vietnam, officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) (), was a country in Southeast Asia from 1954 to 1975. \n\nVietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh declared independence from French Indochina on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh, led by President Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh (\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\") was a coalition of nationalist groups, mostly led by communists. In February 1951, the communists announced the creation of the Lao Động Party (Labor Party), gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Việt Minh.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1954, the Việt Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam. In 1954, after the French were defeated, the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Việt Minh and granted Vietnam independence. The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones, and stipulated general elections in July 1956 to \"bring about the unification of Viet-Nam\". The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam, and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam.\n\nSupervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India, Canada, and Poland. The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords, which stated that the United States \"shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly\". In July 1955, the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm, announced that South Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country. He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was not bound by it.\n\nAfter the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War (1955–75). North Vietnam and the Việt Cộng insurgents supported by their communist allies, including the Soviet Union and China, fought against the military of South Vietnam, the United States and other anti-communist military forces, including South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and smaller players. North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments. The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Việt Cộng defeated South Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The expanded Democratic Republic retained North Vietnam's political culture under Soviet influence and continued its existing memberships in international organisations such as Comecon.\n\nAfter about 300 years of partition by feudal dynasties, Vietnam was again under one single authority in 1802 when Gia Long founded the Nguyễn dynasty, but the country became a French protectorate after 1883 and under Japanese occupation after 1940 during World War II. Soon after Japan surrendered on 2 September 1945, the Việt Minh in the August Revolution entered Hanoi, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 2 September 1945: a government for the entire country, replacing the Nguyễn dynasty. Hồ Chí Minh became leader of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt had spoken against French rule in Indochina, and the U.S. was supportive of the Viet Minh at this time.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh claimed dominion over all of Vietnam, but during this time South Vietnam was in profound political disorder. The successive collapse of French, then Japanese power, followed by the dissension among the political factions in Saigon had been accompanied by widespread violence in the countryside. On 16 August 1945, Hồ Chí Minh organized the National Congress in Tân Trào. The Congress adopted 10 major policies of the Việt Minh, passed the General Uprising Order,decided the National Flag, in the middle with 5-pointed gold star, selected the national anthem and selected the National Committee for the Liberation of Vietnam, later becoming the Provisional Revolutionary Government, led by Hồ Chí Minh. On 12 September 1945, the first British troops arrived in Saigon. On 23 September 28 days after the people of Saigon seized political power, French troops occupied the police stations, the post office, and other public buildings. The salient political fact of life in Northern Vietnam was Chinese Nationalist army of occupation, and the Chinese presence had forced Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh to accommodate Chinese-backed Viet Nationalists. In June 1946, Chinese Nationalist troops evacuated Hanoi, and on the 15 June, the last detachments embarked at Haiphong. After the departure of the British in 1946, the French controlled a part of Cochinchina, South Central Coast, Central Highlands since the end Southern Resistance War. In January 1946, the Viet Minh held an election to establish a National Assembly. Public enthusiasm for this event suggests that the Viet Minh enjoyed a great deal of popularity at this time, although there were few competitive races and the party makeup of the Assembly was determined in advance of the vote.\n\nOn 18 and 19 September 1945, the Việt Minh held secret meetings with Việt Cách (18 September 1945) and Việt Quốc (19 September 1945). In these two meetings, Nguyễn Hải Thần represented Việt Cách and Nguyễn Tường Tam represent Việt Quốc. Hồ Chí Minh agree to unite the Việt Minh with Việt Cách and Việt Quốc. Thus, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by the Việt Minh will receive the financial and political support of the Republic of China. For this proposal, within the Việt Minh there are many different opinions. Võ Nguyên Giáp disagrees with the suggestion that the proposals are not valid and not honest, as if replacing French colonialism with Chinese domination, but Hoàng Minh Giám thought that the unification of Vietnam With the Nationalist parties will reduce the opposition and strengthen the power of the Việt Minh, as the Chinese are relieved and the French have to worry. Eventually the Việt Minh under Hồ Chí Minh refused to merge with the Pro-Chinese Việt Cách and the Việt Quốc League.\n\nOn 6 January 1946, President Hồ Chí Minh held the nationwide General Election which voted for the first time and passed the Constitution. Many parties did not have the right to participate in General Elections seeking to undermine . These parties claimed to be the only Việt Minh communist, the government in the hands of the Việt Minh want anyone to win it. The two opposition parties in the government are the Vietnam’s Nationalist Party (Việt Quốc) and the Vietnam Cách mệnh Đồng minh (Việt Cách) did not participate in the election although Hồ Chí Minh previously sent a letter to Nguyễn Hải Thần leader of Việt Cách and Vũ Hồng Khanh leader of Việt Quốc. Hồ Chí Minh invites Việt Quốc and Việt Cách to attend the General Election and urges the two sides not to attack each other with words or actions until the Congress opens. Former Prime Minister Trần Trọng Kim said there were places where people were forced to vote for the Việt Minh. According to the Việt Minh, the election was fair. Despite being campaigned by many parties to campaign for the people to boycott the election and block the election in some places, where there are self-nominated candidates, publicly run, free elections are taking place everywhere. After the election results are announced, the truth is not the same as the propaganda parties. Many prestigious delegates of classes, classes, religions and ethnic groups were elected in the First National Assembly, most of them not party members.\n\nThe presence of Chiang Kai-shek's army up to that time ensured the survival of Vietnam’s Nationalist Party and Việt Cách. These two parties did not have a cohesive program to enlist the people like the Việt Minh The leaders of the Vietnam’s Nationalist Party and the Việt Cách Revolutionary Party are far from having comparable qualities with Hồ Chí Minh, Võ Nguyên Giáp, and other responsible Việt Minh members. When the Chinese nationalist army withdrawal from Vietnam on 15 June 1946, in one way or another, Võ Nguyễn Giáp, decided that the Việt Minh had to completely control the government. Võ Nguyễn Giáp is in immediate action with the goal of spreading Việt Minh leadership: the Allied Powers are supported by the Vietnam’s Nationalist Party (according to Cecil B. Currey, this organization borrows the revolutionary name of Vietnam’s Nationalist Party of 1930 was founded by Nguyễn Thái Học and, according to David G. Marr, the Vietnamese Communist Party under Hồ Chí Minh tried to banned the Pro-Chinese Nationalist Party in Vietnam betraying the revolutionary cause of Nguyễn Thái Học in 1930. By the end of 1945, many people still did not believe in it.) The pro-Japan nationalist group, the Trotskyists, the anti-French nationalists, the Catholic group called \"Catholic soldiers.\" Võ Nguyễn Giáp has gradually sought to phase out these parties. On 19 June 1946, the Việt Minh Journal reportedly vehemently criticized \"reactionaries sabotage the Franco-Vietnamese preliminary agreement on 6 March\". Shortly thereafter, Võ Nguyễn Giáp began a campaign to pursue opposition parties by police and military forces controlled by the Việt Minh with the help of the French authorities. He also used soldiers, Japanese officers volunteered to stay in Vietnam and some of the supplies provided by France (in Hòn Gai French troops provided the Việt Minh with cannons to kill some of the positions commanded by the Great Occupation) in this campaign.\n\nWhen France declared Cochinchina, the southern third of Vietnam, a separate state as the \"Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina\" in June 1946, Vietnamese nationalists reacted with fury. In November, the National Assembly adopted the first Constitution of the Republic.\n\nThe French reoccupied Hanoi and the First Indochina War (1946–54) followed. Following the Chinese Communist Revolution (1946−50), Chinese communist forces arrived on the border in 1949. Chinese aid revived the fortunes of the Viet Minh and transformed it from a guerrilla militia into a standing army. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 transformed what had been an anti-colonial struggle into a Cold War battleground, with the U.S. providing financial support to the French.\n\nFollowing the partition of Vietnam in 1954 at the end of the First Indochina War, more than one million North Vietnamese migrated to South Vietnam, under the U.S.-led evacuation campaign named Operation Passage to Freedom, with an estimated 60% of the north's one million Catholics fleeing south. The Catholic migration is attributed to an expectation of persecution of Catholics by the North Vietnamese government, as well as publicity employed by the Saigon government of the President Ngo Dinh Diem. The CIA ran a propaganda campaign to get Catholics to come to the south. However Colonel Edward Lansdale, the man credited with the campaign, rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment. The Viet Minh sought to detain or otherwise prevent would-be refugees from leaving, such as through intimidation through military presence, shutting down ferry services and water traffic, or prohibiting mass gatherings. Concurrently, between 14,000 and 45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction.\n\nLand reform was an integral part of the Viet Minh and communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam. A Viet Minh Land Reform Law of 4 December 1953 called for (1) confiscation of land belonging to landlords who were enemies of the regime; (2) requisition of land from landlords not judged to be enemies; and (3) purchase with payment in bonds. The land reform was carried out from 1953 to 1956. Some farming areas did not undergo land reform but only rent reduction and the highland areas occupied by minority peoples were not substantially impacted. Some land was retained by the government but most was distributed without payment with priority given to Viet Minh fighters and their families. The total number of rural people impacted by the land reform program was more than 4 million. The rent reduction program impacted nearly 8 million people.\n\nThe land reform program was a success in terms of distributing much land to poor and landless peasants and reducing or eliminating the land holdings of landlords and rich peasants. However it was carried out with violence and repression primarily directed against large landowners identified, sometimes incorrectly, as landlords. On 18 August 1956, North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform program. Too many farmers, he said, had been incorrectly classified as \"landlords\" and executed or imprisoned and too many mistakes had been made in redistributing land. Severe rioting protesting the excesses of the land reform program broke out in November 1956 in one largely Catholic rural district. About 1,000 people were killed or injured and several thousand imprisoned. Democratic Republic of Vietnam initiated a \"correction campaign\" which by 1958 had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform. As part of the correction campaign as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957.\n\nExecutions and imprisonment of persons classified as \"landlords\" or enemies of the state were contemplated from the beginning of the land reform program. A Politburo document dated 4 May 1953 said that executions were \"fixed in principle at the ratio of one per one thousand people of the total population.\" . The number of persons actually executed by communist cadre carrying out the land reform program has been variously estimated. Some estimates of those killed range up to 200,000. Other scholarship has concluded that the higher estimates were based on political propaganda emanating from South Vietnam and that the actual total of those executed was probably much lower. Scholar Edwin E. Moise estimated the total number of executions at between 3,000 and 15,000 and later came up with a more precise figure of 13,500. Moise's conclusions were supported by documents of Hungarian diplomats living in Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the time of the land reform. Author Michael Lind in a 2013 book gives a similar estimate of \"at least ten or fifteen thousand\" executed.\n\nThe ultimate objective of the land reform program of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government was not to achieve equitable distribution of farmland but rather the organization of all farmers into co-operatives in which land and other factors of agricultural production would be owned and used collectively.\nThe first steps after the 1953-1956 land reform were the encouragement by the government of labor exchanges in which farmers would unite to exchange labor; secondly in 1958 and 1959 was the formation of \"low level cooperatives\" in which farmers cooperated in production. By 1961, 86 percent of farmers were members of low-level cooperatives. The third step beginning in 1961 was to organize \"high level cooperatives\", true collective farming in which land and resources were utilized collectively without individual ownership of land. By 1971, the great majority of farmers in North Vietnam were organized into high-level cooperatives. Collective farms were abandoned gradually in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAfter the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, or Vietcong, alongside the North Vietnamese Army, governed South Vietnam during the period before reunification. However it was seen as a vassal government of North Vietnam. North and South Vietnam were officially reunited under one state on 2 July 1976, forming the Socialist Republic of Vietnam which continues to administer the country today.\n\nFrom 1960, the North Vietnamese government went to war with Republic of Vietnam via its proxy the Viet Cong, in an attempt to annex South Vietnam and reunify Vietnam under a communist party. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces and supplies were sent along the Ho Chi Minh trail. In 1964 the United States sent combat troops to South Vietnam to support the South Vietnamese government, but the U.S. had advisors there since 1950. Other nations, including Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and New Zealand also contributed troops and military aid to South Vietnam's war effort. China and the Soviet Union provided aid to and troops in support of North Vietnamese military activities. This was known as the Vietnam War, or the \"American War\" in Vietnam itself (1955–75). In addition to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, other communist insurgencies also operated within neighboring Kingdom of Laos and Khmer Republic, both formerly part of the French colonial territory of Indochina. These were the Pathet Lao and the Khmer Rouge, respectively. These insurgencies were aided by the North Vietnamese government, which sent troops to fight alongside them.\n\nDemocratic Republic of Vietnam was diplomatically isolated by many Western states, and many other anti-communist states worldwide throughout most of the North's history, as these states only extended recognition to the anti-communist government of South Vietnam. North Vietnam however, was recognized by almost all Communist countries, such as the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, China, North Korea, and Cuba, and received aid from these nations. North Vietnam refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1957, perhaps reflecting Hanoi's deference to the Soviet line on the Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito, and North Vietnamese officials continued to be critical of Tito after relations were established. Several non-aligned countries also recognized North Vietnam, mostly, similar to India, according North Vietnam \"de facto\" rather than \"de jure\" (formal) recognition.\n\nIn 1969, Sweden became the first Western country to extend full diplomatic recognition to North Vietnam. Many other Western countries followed suit in the 1970s, such as the government of Australia under Gough Whitlam.\n\n"}

Founded in 2006, Panthera focuses its efforts on conservation of the world's largest, most imperiled cats: tigers, lions, jaguars and snow leopards, and also developing conservation programs for cheetahs, leopards and cougars. The organization has offices in New York City and London.\n\nPanthera works in partnership with local and international NGOs, scientific institutions, and government agencies to develop and implement range-wide species conservation strategies. It has funded the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University, with a diploma program in international wildlife practice. The organization also awards a number of grants to support promising field conservationists. These grant programs include the Kaplan Graduate Awards, the Research and Conservation Grants, the Small Cat Action Fund, and the Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Jaguar Small Grants.\n\nPanthera was founded by American entrepreneur Thomas S. Kaplan; he serves as its executive chairman. Alan Rabinowitz is the CEO. He started the world's first jaguar preserve in 1986, in Belize. and was the main driving force behind the Jaguar Corridor that connects Mexico and Argentina.\n\nMichael Cline serves as a director and chairman of Tigers Forever program. Luke Hunter, formerly director of the Great Cats Program at WCS, acts as president. George Schaller is both Panthera's vice president and chairman of its Cat Advisory Council. Howard Quigley joined the organization in 2009 and is currently the director of its Jaguar Program, and head of Teton Cougar Project in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Tom McCarthy is director of the Snow Leopard Programs.\n\nIn South America, Panthera is developing a transnational corridor to help protect the jaguar. Jaguar survival and health depends on a network of corridors that span the continent, while past efforts focused on developing distinct sanctuaries. It is the jaguar's ability to travel long distances that prevents inbreeding and consequent extinction. In early 2010, Panthera signed a deal with the Colombian government to protect and develop the corridors there—essential because the Central and South American jaguar corridors converge in Colombia.\n\nIn August, 2010, in Belize, it worked with the government to create the Labouring Creek Jaguar Corridor Wildlife Sanctuary, with more than of land . The project is part of the Panthera Jaguar Corridor Initiative.\n\nIn Costa Rica, it is researching the routes that jaguars travel, and encouraging politicians and developers to respect those routes. They are also sponsoring community outreach programs to alleviate \"jaguar conflict issues.\"\n\nPanthera has bought large cattle ranches in Brazil, as part of their Pantanal Jaguar Project to protect jaguars and their habitat. They are working with local ranchers to find benign ways to protect their cattle, rather than the typical approach of shooting the jaguars. The organization is working with the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine to provide education and healthcare to those living in the jaguar corridors.\n\nIn Asia, Panthera's Tigers Forever project is planning a long corridor from Bhutan to Burma for wild tiger populations. The corridor would also include land in northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia, and possibly Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.\n\nIn August, 2010, the government of Burma announced the expansion, by , of the Hukawng Valley Tiger Reserve, the world's largest tiger preserve. Panthera CEO Alan Rabinowitz helped bring together representatives from the Kachin Independence Army and the Burma government to make the expansion possible.\n\nIn Johor State, Malaysia, Panthera is working with the state government and the Wildlife Conservation Society to increase tiger numbers by 50% over a ten-year period. As part of that project, in early 2010 Panthera cameras captured an image of a rare spotted leopard in Taman Negara Endau-Rompin National Park, where only black leopards were believed to exist.\n\nPanthera's Snow Leopard Program is studying the species in Mongolia, and surveying new regions where the animals are likely to live, but haven't yet been discovered. They work with local animal herders to train them in new approaches that will reduce livestock lost to the leopards.

It is used by scientists to explore the deep sea around the underwater banks in the main Hawaiian Islands, as well as the underwater features and seamounts in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, specifically around Loihi Seamount.\n\nIn 1973, \"Pisces V\" took part in the rescue of Roger Mallinson and Roger Chapman, who were trapped on the seabed in \"Pisces V\"s sister submersible \"Pisces III\". In August 2002, \"Pisces V\" and her sister \"Pisces IV\" discovered a World War II Japanese midget submarine outside of Pearl Harbor which had been sunk by the destroyer in the first American shots fired in World War II. In 2011, marine scientists from HURL celebrated the 1,000 dives of \"Pisces V\" and \"Pisces IV\".\n\nThe advantage of having two is that it allows preparation for an emergency. While one of the submersibles is conducting its dive, the other remains at readiness should there be an emergency, needing to be boarded on ship and hurried to the site of the problem. Such an emergency could include the submersible becoming tangled in fishing nets or entrapped in rocks or debris on the ocean floor. In such cases, the second heads to the rescue. There are also research experiments where it is advantageous to use the two vessels together.\n\nIn August 2002, \"Pisces V\" and her sister vessel \"Pisces IV\" discovered a Japanese midget submarine; sunk on December 7, 1941 by the destroyer in the first American shots fired in World War II, the submarine was hit by a 4\"/50 caliber gun shot and depth charged shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The submarine was found in of water about off the mouth of Pearl Harbor. This was the culmination of a 61-year search for the vessel and has been called \"the most significant modern marine archeological find ever in the Pacific, second only to the finding of \"Titanic\" in the Atlantic\". In 2003, \"Pisces V\" visited the Japanese midget submarine it had found in Pearl Harbor the year before. The U.S. State Department worked in conjunction with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to determine Japanese wishes regarding the fate of the midget submarine. The submersibles are used by HURL as teaching devices. In 2008, two members of the Tampa Bay Chapter of SCUBAnauts were invited to team with HURL and to visit the historic wreck of the Japanese submarine. One SCUBAnaut said as he stepped on \"Pisces V\" that \"it looked and felt as if I were in a space shuttle preparing for lift-off\".\nA mock-up of the control panel of \"Pisces V\" can be visited by the public at the Mokupāpapa Discovery Center in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nOn March 5, 2009, scientists discovered seven new species of bamboo coral, six of which may be of a new genus, an extraordinary finding in a genus so broad. They were able to find these specimens through the use of \"Pisces V\" which allowed them to reach depths beyond those attained by scuba divers. They also discovered a giant sponge approximately three feet tall and three feet wide that scientists named the \"cauldron sponge\".\n\n\n"}

When distances of at least three locations are known, a fourth position can be determined using trilateration.\n\nOptical trackers, such as laser ranging trackers suffer from line of sight problems and their performance is adversely affected by ambient light and infrared radiation. On the other hand, they do not suffer from distortion effects in the presence of metals and can have high update rates because of the speed of light.\n\nUltrasonic trackers have a more limited range because of the loss of energy with the distance traveled. Also they are sensitive to ultrasonic ambient noise and have a low update rate. But the main advantage is that they do not need line of sight.\n\nSystems using radio waves such as the Global navigation satellite system do not suffer ambient light, but still need line of sight.\n\nA spatial scan system uses (optical) beacons and sensors. Two categories can be distinguished:\nBy aiming the sensor at the beacon the angle between them can be measured. With triangulation the position of the object can be determined.\n\nThe main advantage of an inertial sensing is that it does not require an external reference. Instead it measures rotation with a gyroscope or position with an accelerometer with respect to a known starting position and orientation. Because these systems measure relative positions instead of absolute positions they can suffer from accumulated errors and therefore are subject to drift. A periodic re-calibration of the system will provide more accuracy.\n\nThis type of tracking system uses mechanical linkages between the reference and the target. Two types of linkages have been used. One is an assembly of mechanical parts that can each rotate, providing the user with multiple rotation capabilities. The orientation of the linkages is computed from the various linkage angles measured with incremental encoders or potentiometers. Other types of mechanical linkages are wires that are rolled in coils. A spring system ensures that the wires are tensed in order to measure the distance accurately. The degrees of freedom sensed by mechanical linkage trackers are dependent upon the constitution of the tracker's mechanical structure. While six degrees of freedom are most often provided, typically only a limited range of motions is possible because of the kinematics of the joints and the length of each link. Also, the weight and the deformation of the structure increase with the distance of the target from the reference and impose a limit on the working volume.\n\nPhase difference systems measure the shift in phase of an incoming signal from an emitter on a moving target compared to the phase of an incoming signal from a reference emitter. With this the relative motion of the emitter with respect to the receiver can be calculated\nLike inertial sensing systems, phase-difference systems can suffer from accumulated errors end therefore are subject to drift, but because the phase can be measured continuously they are able to generate high data rates.\n\nDirect field sensing systems use a known field to derive orientation or position: A simple compass uses the Earth's magnetic field to know its orientation in two directions. An inclinometer uses the earth gravitational field to know its orientation in the remaining third direction. The field used for positioning does not need to originate from nature, however. A system of three electromagnets placed perpendicular to each other can define a spatial reference. On the receiver, three sensors measure the components of the field’s flux received as a consequence of magnetic coupling. Based on these measures, the system determines the position and orientation of the receiver with respect to the emitters' reference.\n\nBecause every technology has its pros and cons, most systems use more than one technology. A system based on relative position changes like the inertial system needs periodic calibration against a system with absolute position measurement. Systems combining two or more technologies are called hybrid positioning systems.\n\n"}

The Promised Land was described in terms of the territory from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates river (). A smaller area of former Canaanite land and land east of the Jordan River was conquered and occupied by their descendants, the Israelites, after Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt (), and this occupation was interpreted as God's fulfilment of the promise (). Moses anticipated that God might subsequently give the Israelites land reflecting the boundaries of God's original promise, if they were obedient to the covenant ().\n\nThe concept of the Promised Land is the central tenet of Zionism, whose discourse suggests that modern Jews descend from the Israelites and Maccabees through whom they inherit the right to re-establish their \"national homeland\". Palestinians also claim partial descent from the Israelites and Maccabees, as well as all the other peoples who have lived in the region.\n\nThe imagery of the \"Promised Land\" was invoked in African-American spirituals as heaven or paradise and as an escape from slavery, which can often only be reached by death. The imagery and term have also been used in popular culture (see Promised Land (disambiguation)), sermons and in speeches, such as the \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" (1968) speech by Martin Luther King Jr.:\n\nThe promise that is the basis of the term is contained in several verses of Genesis in the Torah. In it is said:\n\nand in :\n\nCommentators have noted several problems with this promise and related ones: \n\nIn the boundary of the Promised Land is clarified in terms of the territory of various ancient peoples, as follows:\n\nThe verse is said to describe what are known as \"borders of the Land\" (\"Gevulot Ha-aretz\"). In Jewish tradition, these borders define the maximum extent of the land promised to the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob.\n\nThe promise was confirmed to Jacob at , though the borders are still vague and is in terms of \"the land on which you are lying\".\nOther geographical borders are given in which describes borders as marked by the Red Sea, the \"Sea of the Philistines\" i.e. the Mediterranean, and the \"River,\" (the Euphrates).\n\nThe promise is fulfilled at the end of the Exodus from Egypt. says:\n\nIt took a long time before the Israelites could subdue the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. The furthest extent of the Land of Israel was achieved during the time of the united Kingdom of Israel under David. The actual land controlled by the Israelites has fluctuated considerably over time, and at times the land has been under the control of various empires. However, under Jewish tradition, even when it is not in Jewish occupation, the land has not lost its status as the Promised Land.\n\nTraditional Jewish interpretation, and that of most Christian commentators, define Abraham's descendants as Abraham's seed only through his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, to the exclusion of Ishmael and Esau.\n\nMainstream Jewish tradition regards the promise made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as having been given to all Jews, including proselytes and in turn their descendants, with the traditional view being that a convert becomes a child of Abraham, as in the term \"ben Avraham\".\n\nIn the New Testament, the descent and promise is reinterpreted along religious lines. In the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul the Apostle draws attention to the formulation of the promise, avoiding the term \"seeds\" in plural (meaning many people), choosing instead \"seed,\" meaning one person, who, he understands to be Jesus (and those united with him). For example, in he notes: \n\nIn Paul goes further, noting that the expansion of the promise from singular to the plural is not based on genetic/physical association, but a spiritual/religious one: \n\nIn it is written: \n\n"}

Besides the Balkan Mountains, Southern Bulgaria borders Serbia to the west, the Republic of Macedonia to the southwest, Greece to the south, Turkey to the southeast and the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast to the east.\n\nGeographically, the terrain in Southern Bulgaria is much more varied than that of the north, with the Upper Thracian Plain stretching in the east, while the south and west are dominated by some of Bulgaria's highest mountains such as Rila, Pirin and the Rhodopes, as well as smaller and/or lower mountains and valleys in the west, such as Vitosha, Belasitsa, Osogovo, the Sofia Valley, the Sub-Balkan valleys and the Kraishte region. Southern Bulgaria covers an area of 62,414 square kilometres and has a population of 5,085,872 (63% of Bulgaria's entire population), with a population density of 81.5 people per km². The three largest cities are the national capital Sofia, the largest city in Thrace, Plovdiv, and the major Black Sea port of Burgas.\n\nAdministratively, Southern Bulgaria includes the following 14 Bulgarian provinces:\n\n\nHistorically, Southern Bulgaria covers the historical regions of Thrace and Macedonia (Pirin Macedonia). The Bulgarian South also has a number of often unclearly defined or overlapping sub-regions, particularly in the west and southwest, such as Chech, Shop region, Kraishte, Burel, Visok, Zabardie, Znepole, Graovo, Osogoviya, Piyanets, Podgorie, Razlog, Rupchos, Tamrash, etc. Southern Bulgaria is also conventionally divided into Southwestern, Central Southern and Southeastern Bulgaria, with slightly varying borders. \n\nIn Antiquity, the Jireček Line divided Latin (in the north) and Ancient Greek (in the south) language influence in the Balkans, with Northern Bulgaria to the north of it and Southern Bulgaria to the south. Much later, after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all of Northern Bulgaria and the region of Sofia became the Principality of Bulgaria while most of the rest of Southern Bulgaria was part of Eastern Rumelia until the Bulgarian unification in 1885. Pirin Macedonia became part of Bulgaria after the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913, and the only Bulgarian gains by the otherwise catastrophic post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine of 1919 were two small strips of land in southern Sakar.\n\n"}

The sculptures range in height from , and are between in diameter. In 2009, there were 74 \"Whispering Giants\", with at least one in each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as in Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, and one in Hungary. One in Oregon was removed in 2017 after irreparable windstorm damage, reducing the total to 73. In 1988, Toth completed his goal of placing at least one statue in each of the 50 states, by carving one in Hawaii, and in 2008, he created his first \"Whispering Giant\" in Europe, Stephen I of Hungary in Délegyháza, Hungary along the Danube River.\n\nIn 2009, eight more \"Whispering Giants\" were planned.\n\n(Update February 2, 2015) \"The Trail of the Whispering Giants\" is an ongoing project and much of the material here especially the chart below is out of date and too extensive to edit fully this article. A traveler, David Schumaker, went on a quest to identify all the \"Whispering Giant\" statues and has documented 57 existing statues and identified 12 that are now missing or destroyed since Peter Wolf Toth began this project in 1972. Schumaker has documented his information on the WEB site Peter Wolf Toth which has the most current information on the \"Whispering Giants\" and messages from the artist himself.\n\nThe 74 \"Whispering Giants\" range from in height, and all resemble natives of the region in which they are located. Toth always donates the \"Whispering Giant\" he creates to the town he carved it in, and never charges a fee for his time. He does require that the raw materials (a large log between in diameter) be provided, as well as lodging and living expenses. The carvings have been appraised at a quarter of a million dollars each.\n\nToth uses a hammer and a chisel as the basic tools to create the \"Whispering Giants\", but on occasion will use a mallet and an axe, or rarely power tools. Before starting work on a \"Whispering Giant\", Toth confers with local Native American tribes and local lawmakers. The sculpture that is created is a composite of all the physical characteristics, especially facial features, of the local tribe or tribes, as well as their stories and histories.\n\nCurrently Peter Toth resides in Edgewater, Florida, where he has a small studio where he carves small wooden statues to raise money to create more \"Whispering Giants\". He travels around America to repair \"Whispering Giants\" he carved in the past that have not been kept up, as well as to carve new ones. The latest \"Whispering Giant\" carved was in Vincennes, Indiana, in 2009 out of Black Oak, but there are still eight more statues planned to be built.\n\n"}

Partly because of that, their entries are a subject of human interest stories during the Games. No tropical nation has ever won a Winter Olympic medal. \n\nThe first warm-weather, but not tropical, nation participating in the Winter Olympics was Mexico. Much of Mexico is at a latitude north of the Tropic of Cancer, and most of the country has a subtropical highland or semi-arid climate, so it is not exclusively a tropical nation. Nonetheless, Mexico made its Winter Olympic debut at the 1928 Winter Olympics with a five-man bobsleigh team that finished eleventh of twenty-three entrants. Mexico did not return again to the Winter Games until the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe first truly tropical nation to compete in the Winter Olympic Games is the Philippines, who sent two alpine skiers to the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Ben Nanasca placed 42nd in giant slalom skiing (out of 73 entrants), and Juan Cipriano did not finish. In slalom skiing, neither skier was able to finish. Costa Rica became the second tropical nation to participate at the Winter Games, in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, where Arturo Kinch also competed in alpine skiing events. Kinch would continue to compete for Costa Rica at three more Winter Games, including the 2006 Winter Olympics at age 49. There he finished 96th in the 15 km cross-country skiing event, ahead of only Prawat Nagvajara of Thailand, another tropical nation.\n\nThe 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada attracted a large number of tropical nations, including Costa Rica, Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Netherlands Antilles, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Jamaican Bobsled Team became a fan favorite at these Games and were later the inspiration of the 1993 motion picture \"Cool Runnings\". In the 1994 Winter Olympics six years later, the Jamaican four-man sled placed a creditable fourteenth, ahead of the United States and Russia, while a Jamaican bobsledder Lascelles Brown won silver for Canada in 2006.\n\nThe 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy marked the Winter Games debut of Ethiopia and Madagascar. The 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada saw the debut of the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Peru, and Ghana. The 2014 Winter Olympics saw the debut of Dominica, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe. The 2018 Winter Olympics saw the debut of Ecuador, Eritrea, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Singapore.\n\nThis list of nations includes those that lie entirely or predominantly within the tropical latitudes and also have a mostly tropical climate according to the Köppen climate classification system. Years of Winter Olympic Games participation are shown.\n\nOther warm-weather nations (located in the subtropics, for example) that have competed in the Winter Games include Australia (which has a tropical far north, and became the first Southern Hemisphere nation to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in 2002), Bermuda, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India (which contains a section of the Himalayas), Mexico, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay and several North African nations including Algeria, Egypt and Morocco.\n\nTonga sought to make its Winter Olympic debut at the 2010 Winter Olympics by entering a single competitor in luge, attracting some media attention, but he crashed in the final round of qualifying. Two years later, he attracted media attention again when it was discovered he had altered his name to that of one of his sponsors, a lingerie firm, as a marketing stunt. He was, at that time, in training to attempt to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nAs of 2014, only two tropical nations have been represented at the Winter Paralympic Games. Tofiri Kibuuka of Uganda competed in cross-country skiing at the inaugural edition of the Winter Paralympics in 1976 and again at the 1980 Games. After Kibuuka obtained Norwegian nationality, he began to compete for Norway at the Paralympics starting in 1984, winning several medals in athletics at the Summer Paralympics. Brazil sent two athletes as part of its debut at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.\n\nFive tropical nations were represented at the First Winter Youth Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.\n"}
