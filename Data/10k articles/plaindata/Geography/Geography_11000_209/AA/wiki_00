{"id": "3444247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3444247", "title": "Bing Maps", "text": "Bing Maps\n\nBing Maps (previously \"Live Search Maps\", \"Windows Live Maps\", \"Windows Live Local\", and \"MSN Virtual Earth\") is a web mapping service provided as a part of Microsoft's Bing suite of search engines and powered by the Bing Maps for Enterprise framework.\n\nUsers can browse and search topographically-shaded street maps for many cities worldwide. Maps include certain points of interest built in, such as metro stations, stadiums, hospitals, and other facilities. It is also possible to browse public user-created points of interest. Searches can cover public collections, businesses or types of business, locations, or people. Five street map views are available: Road View, Aerial View, Bird’s Eye View, Street Side View, and 3D View.\n\nUsers can get directions between two or more locations. In September 2010, Bing Maps added public transit directions (bus, subway, and local rail) to its available direction options. Currently transit directions are only available in 11 cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark Metro Area, New York Metro Area, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver BC, and Washington DC.\nIt is also available in other countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, Brazil, Mexico and some others.\n\nBing Map Apps is a collection of 1st and 3rd party applications that add additional functionality and content to Bing Maps. Examples of map apps include a parking finder, a taxi fare calculator, an app that maps out Facebook friends, and an app which lets users explore the day's newspaper front pages from around the world. These apps are only accessible through Bing Maps Silverlight. A source code is available on Microsoft Developer Network to explain integration of Maps in Web Applications. A sample ongoing project on locating Blood Donors on Maps is available here.\n\nBing Maps shows users current traffic information for major highways and roads. The feature uses 4 color codes (black, red, yellow, green) to indicate traffic volume, from heaviest traffic to lightest traffic.\nMicrosoft announced in March 2008 that it will release its latest software technology called \"ClearFlow\". It is a Web-based service for traffic-based driving directions available on Bing.com in 72 cities across the U.S. The tool took five years for Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence team to develop. ClearFlow provides real-time traffic data to help drivers avoid traffic congestion. ClearFlow gives information for alternative routes and supplies traffic conditions on city streets adjacent to highways. Clearflow anticipates traffic patterns, while taking into account sporting/arena events, time of day and weather conditions, and then reflects the back ups and their consequential spill over onto city streets. Often, ClearFlow found it may be faster to stay on the highway instead of seeking alternative side street routes, which involve traffic lights and congestion as well.\n\nBing Maps allows users to share maps and embed maps into their websites. By clicking the e-mail icon in the bottom-left corner of Bing Maps, a window will open that displays a shareable URL so others can access the map currently being viewed. This window also provides HTML code to embed a small version of the map onto any web page.\n\nIn August 2010, Bing Maps launched an overhauled design for its default view. The new colors create a more visually appealing backdrop for information delivery that helps content ‘pop’ on the map. The backdrop provides clear differentiation for pushpins, labels and red, yellow and green traffic overlays. These design principles also works well in black and white and creates differentiation for those with the most common forms of color blindness.\nAlso, larger fonts correspond to larger roads to help customers more easily identify main roads in cities. More readable labels eliminate the need for bolding and less-attractive glows. The inclusion of neighborhood labels allows users to quickly find or convey locations in a commonly used and highly relevant format.\n\nThe search box at the top of Bing Maps can be used to locate places, businesses and landmarks, and people. Search results appear both on a left-side rail and as pushpins on the map (linked together by numbers). Search results often include addresses, contact information, and reviews for businesses and landmarks. For relevant searches, the user will also see a description of the landmark or place (powered by Wikipedia) if a Wikipedia article exists.\nThe search process can also be guided using local directories for numerous categories (restaurants, hotels, tourist attractions, retail stores, etc.).\n\nBing Maps users can also view and add \"user contributed\" entries to the map. These user-contributions must be toggled on by users. Such items can include businesses, landmarks, buildings, and locations. Users can browse user-contributions by tags and subscribe to RSS feeds to receive updates of new user-contributions to a specific area.\n\nIn August 2010, Bing Maps added dynamic labels to its Silverlight experience (bing.com/maps/explore). Turn on the dynamic labels beta from the map style selector on bing.com/maps/explore and the labels become clickable. This allows users to quickly zoom down to a region or location anywhere on the map with just a few clicks. Zooming back out in a single click is also possible by using the ‘breadcrumb’ trail at the top left of the map.\n\nBing Maps has two separate versions for users: an AJAX version (located at Bing.com/Maps) and an opt-in Silverlight version (located at Bing.com/Maps/Explore—not available anymore) that requires Microsoft Silverlight to be installed. The Silverlight version is positioned to offer richer, more dynamic features and a smoother experience. In November 2010, the AJAX and Silverlight versions were combined into a semi-hybrid site where Silverlight features such as Map Apps and Streetside could be enabled through the Bing.com/Maps site - these features still required Silverlight to be installed, but does not require use of a separate Bing Maps site.\n\nThe AJAX and Silverlight site share the following features: Road View, Aerial View, Bird’s-Eye View, Sharing Maps, People/Business/Location Search, Building Footprints, Driving Directions, Walking Directions.\n\nSilverlight users exclusively can use Map Apps, StreetSide View, Photosynths, and Dynamic Labels.\n\nBing Map Apps are accessed either through the \"Map Apps\" button in the Bing Maps Explore Bar or through direct perma-links. The Map Apps button is only viewable if the user is in the Bing Maps Silverlight experience or in Windows 8.\n\nThere are a number of map apps that are developed/published by Bing, as indicated by the publisher above the map app’s name in the app gallery. The following are a list of 1st party apps:\nBing Map Apps also allows third parties to create and submit map apps. The following are a list of 3rd party map apps:\n\nIn July 2010, Microsoft and DigitalGlobe, a leading global content provider of high-resolution earth imagery solutions, announced the collection of the first imagery from the company's Advanced Ortho Aerial Program. Through a special agreement with Microsoft, the Advanced Ortho Aerial Program will provide wall-to-wall 30 cm aerial coverage of the contiguous United States and Western Europe that DigitalGlobe has the exclusive rights to distribute beyond Bing Maps. The program's first orthophoto mosaics are of Augusta, GA, San Diego, CA and Tampa, FL, and can be viewed on DigitalGlobe's website.\n\nBing Maps was based on existing Microsoft technologies such as Microsoft MapPoint, and TerraServer. The original version lacked many of its distinguishing features, including birds' eye view and 3D maps, and the Collections functionality was limited to a single \"Scratchpad\" of points of interest. Upon its release in December 2005, Windows Live Local became the public face of the Virtual Earth platform. On November 6, 2006, Microsoft added the ability to view the maps in 3D using a .NET managed control and managed interfaces to Direct3D. Microsoft subsequently referred to this product officially as \"Live Search Maps\", integrating it as part of its Live Search services. On June 3, 2009, Microsoft officially rebranded Live Search Maps as \"Bing Maps\", and the Virtual Earth platform as \"Bing Maps for Enterprise\".\n\nCurrently, Bing Maps uses HERE (formerly Navteq) for part of its mapping system\n\n\nBing maps frequently update and expand the geographic areas covered by their imagery, with new updates being released on roughly a monthly basis. Each imagery release typically contains more than 10TB of imagery.\n\nHowever, the necessary time-lapse before images are updated means that aerial and Bird's-Eye images for a particular location can sometimes be several years out-of-date. This is particularly noticeable in locations that have undergone rapid recent development or experienced other dramatic changes since the imagery was taken, such as areas affected by natural disasters.\n\nMicrosoft states that Bing Maps needs the following environment:\n\n\nCompatible browsers include Windows Internet Explorer 6 or later, Mozilla Firefox 3.0 or later, or Safari 3.1 or later. Opera is stated to be usable \"with some functionality limitations\". Users of browsers that are not considered compatible, as well as users of versions of compatible browsers that are not supported, will be directed away from viewing the map without an error message.\n\nThe 3D Maps viewer plug-in requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 6/7/8 or Firefox 1.5/2.0/3.0.\n\n\n"}

These routes must also match some fundamental values promoted by the Council of Europe such as democracy, human rights and intercultural exchanges in the framework of cultural tourism.\n\nA Cultural Route of the Council of Europe is not necessarily a physical path to be walked through and can be made up of cultural stakeholders such as museums, municipalities or local governments clustered into one umbrella association. Being awarded the title Cultural Route of the Council of Europe opens the way to a larger visibility, network of cultural stakeholders or even funding. It should also be noted that the programme was launched by the Council of Europe and not the European Union, even though it contributes to it. As a result, the programme goes beyond the borders of the EU, and even Europe in general as some Routes go as far as North Africa or the Middle East.\n\nThe programme was launched in 1987 and is managed by the European Institute of Cultural Routes (EICR) based in Luxembourg since 1989. Since 2010, the evaluation and certification-awarding process is made possible by the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Cultural Routes (EPA).\n\nIn early 2017, 32 Cultural Routes were certified as listed below. There also are some other non-certified Routes in project that are recorded by the EICR, which is in charge of conducting the application process.\n\nThe Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe are tools of the European cultural cooperation implemented by the Council of Europe with the \"European cultural convention\" in 1954.\n\nOn 23 October 1987, the Santiago de Compostela Declaration established the Santiago De Compostela Pilgrim Routes, the first European Cultural Route. From this point on, the Council of Europe gradually implemented a certification of routes with a cultural, social or historical interest with a view to bringing European cultures and peoples closer. The certification criteria have been revised throughout the existence of the programme, the last time was in December 2013.\n\nThe European Institute of Cultural Routes (EICR) was set up in 1998 following a political agreement between the Council of Europe and the Government of Luxembourg. The EICR have been in charge of managing the Cultural Route programme since then, ensuring connexions between the Routes’ associations, its university network, the Council of Europe and since 2010 the EPA statutory bodies. As a result, the institute organises several annual meetings between the programme's stakeholders, helps with the certification of new Cultural Routes, evaluates every three years the certified Routes or promotes the Cultural Routes.\n\nIn December 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution establishing the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Cultural Routes (EPA). This agreement aimed to making the programme's funding and organisation easier. The EPA is based in the EICR and periodically gathers representatives of some of the states that are the more interested in the programme who are empowered to certify new Cultural Routes as well as evaluating already-certified Routes.\n\n\n\n"}

Each department has a Governor (\"gobernador\") and a Department Assembly (\"Asamblea Departamental\"), elected by popular vote for a four-year period. The governor cannot be re-elected in consecutive periods. Departments are country subdivisions and are granted a certain degree of autonomy.\n\nDepartments are formed by a grouping of municipalities (\"municipios\", sing. \"municipio\"). Municipal government is headed by mayor (\"alcalde\") and administered by a Municipal Council (\"concejo municipal\"), both of which are elected for four-year periods.\n\nEach one of the departments of Colombia in the map below links to a corresponding article. Current governors serving four-year terms from 2015 to 2019 are also shown, along with their respective political party or coalition.\n\n\nThe indigenous territories are at the third level of administrative division in Colombia, as are the municipalities. Indigenous territories are created by agreement between the government and indigenous communities. In cases where indigenous territories covering more than one department or municipality, local governments jointly administer them with the indigenous councils, as set out in Articles 329 and 330 of the Colombian Constitution of 1991. Also indigenous territories may achieve local autonomy if they meet the requirements of the law.\n\nArticle 329 of the 1991 constitution recognizes the collective indigenous ownership of indigenous territories and repeats that are inalienable. Law 160 of 1994 created the National System of Agrarian Reform and Rural Development Campesino, and replaced Law 135 of 1961 on Agrarian Social Reform; it establishes and sets out the functions of INCORA, one of the most important being to declare which territories will acquire the status of indigenous protection and what extension of existing ones will be allowed. Decree 2164 of 1995 interprets Law 160 of 1994, providing, among other things, a legal definition of indigenous territories.\n\nIndigenous territories in Colombia are mostly in the departments of Amazonas, Cauca, La Guajira, Guaviare and Vaupés.\n\nWhen it was first established in 1819, República de la Gran Colombia had three departments. Venezuela, Cundinamarca (now Colombia) and Quito (now Ecuador). In 1824 the Distrito del Centro (which became Colombia) was divided into five departments, and further divided into seventeen provinces. One department, Istmo Department, consisting of two provinces later became Panama.\n\nWith the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1826 by the Revolution of the Morrocoyes (\"La Cosiata\"), New Granada kept its 17 provinces. In 1832 the provinces of Vélez and Barbacoas were created, and in 1835 those of Buenaventura and Pasto were added. In 1843 those of Cauca, Mompós and Túquerres were created. At this time the cantons (\"cantones\") and parish districts were created, which provided the basis for the present-day municipalities.\n\nBy 1853 the number of provinces had increased to thirty-six, namely:Antioquia, Azuero, Barbacoas, Bogotá, Buenaventura, Cartagena, Casanare, Cauca, Chiriquí, Chocó, Córdova, Cundinamarca, García Rovira, Mariquita, Medellín, Mompós, Neiva, Ocaña, Pamplona, Panamá, Pasto, Popayán, Riohacha, Sabanilla, Santa Marta, Santander, Socorro, Soto, Tequendama, Tunja, Tundama, Túquerres, Valle de Upar, Veraguas, Vélez and Zipaquirá. However, the new constitution of 1853 introduced federalism, which lead to the consolidation of provinces into states. By 1858 this process was complete, with a resulting eight federal states: Panamá was formed in 1855, Antioquia in 1856, Santander in May 1857, and Bolívar, Boyacá, Cauca, Cundinamarca and Magdalena were formed in June 1858. 1861 saw the creation of the final federal state of Tolima.\n\nThe Colombian Constitution of 1886 converted the states of Colombia into departments, with the state presidents renamed as governors. The states formed the following original departments:\n\n\n\n"}

The movement spread and it now has 350.000 members, 45 member organisations and runs some 700 houses mainly in Europe. The houses vary in size and facilities. The \"International Friends of Nature\" (IFN), based in Vienna, is the umbrella organisation of the national Friends of Nature federations.\n\nPublications of the various sections include a handbook detailing all the houses and magazines published by various sections (such as Naturefriends - Great Britain - Bulletin, Les Amis de La Nature, La Migranto – in Esperanto by \"Esperantistoj Naturamikoj\" etc.).\n\nThe Friends of Nature organisation was founded in Vienna in 1895.The group was founded by three activists, Karl Renner, a law student and future President of Austria, Georg Schmiedl, a schoolteacher, and Alois Rohrauer, a blacksmith.\n\nThe organisation was banned by the Nazis in 1933, but revived in 1945.\n\nThe work of the Friends of Nature rests on the conviction that people's opportunities of personal development are inextricably linked with the protection of nature and the conservation of natural resources. Hence, the Friends of Nature have, since their inception, taken a stand for the conservation of an environment worth living in, for peace and international understanding, for the social and democratic rights of all people, and for a meaningful organisation of leisure time. Building on their century-old tradition, the Friends of Nature are nowadays committed to the implementation of sustainable development, in particular to transboundary environmental solutions and to an environmentally and socially sound tourism.\n\nThe biennial proclamation of a \"Landscape of the Year\" exemplifies how sustainable regional development can be put into practice. International environmental campaigns, such as \"100,000 Trees for Europe\" or \"Blue Rivers for Europe\" are intended to enhance environmental awareness in Europe and to offer members opportunities to take action in the interest of the environment. In 1995, the Friends of Nature set up the \"Institute for Integrative Tourism\" (IITF) with the intent to input the concept of sustainability into research and training in this field. The \"Manifesto for a New Europe\" (1993) and the \"Manifesto for a Social, Ecological and Peaceful Future\" (1996), proposals submitted to the Inter-governmental Conference of the European Union, and the\"Green Paper - The Alps\" are examples of international lobbying by the Friends of Nature.\n\nWith 350.000 members organised in approximately 45 member organisations, the Friends of Nature are among the biggest non-profit and non-governmental organisations worldwide. Apart from seminars and information material they provide environmentally sound leisure-time and travel programmes for their members and run over 700 Nature Friends Houses in Europe and overseas. \n\nIn the 1970s a group of young members of four Naturefriends' organisations (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands) created a youth umbrella to network and support youth work in the movement. Through the course of the time the organisation got formalised and extended to current 26 member and partner organisations.\n\nThe International Young Naturefriends (IYNF) cooperated and were supported by the Council of Europe's Directorate Youth and Sport. In the European Youth Forum Young Naturefriends belonged to the socialist family or the family of non-formal education organisations. Currently the Secretariat of IYNF is located in Prague, Czech Republic, the seat of the organisation is however a common with NFI, in Vienna.\n\nInternational Young Naturefriends provides trainings and international activities to the members of its network on different topics every year. They are also active in international networks such as European Youth Forum and UNFCCC, actively lobbying for the interests of the young people of both Europe and world, concerned with environmental issues and the climatic change.\n\n"}

{"id": "9358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9358", "title": "Geography of El Salvador", "text": "Geography of El Salvador\n\nEl Salvador borders the North Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, with Guatemala to the north-northwest and Honduras to the north-northeast. In the southeast, the Golfo de Fonseca separates it from Nicaragua. El Salvador is the smallest Central American country and is the only one without a coastline on the Caribbean sea.\n\nEl Salvador, along with the rest of Central America, is one of the most seismologically active regions on earth, situated atop three of the large tectonic plates that constitute the Earth's surface. The motion of these plates causes the area's earthquake and volcanic activity.\n\nMost of Central America and the Caribbean Basin rests on the relatively motionless Caribbean Plate. The Pacific Ocean floor, however, is being carried northeast by the underlying motion of the Cocos Plate. Ocean floor material is largely composed of basalt, which is relatively dense; when it collides with the lighter granite rocks of Central America, the ocean floor is forced down under the land mass, creating the deep Middle America Trench that lies off the coast of El Salvador.\n\nThe subduction of the Cocos Plate accounts for the frequency of earthquakes near the coast. As the rocks constituting the ocean floor are forced down, they melt, and the molten material pours up through weaknesses in the surface rock, producing volcanoes and geysers.\n\nNorth of El Salvador, Mexico and most of Guatemala are riding on the westward-moving North American Plate that butts against the northern edge of the stationary Caribbean Plate in southern Guatemala. The grinding action of these two plates creates a fault (similar to the San Andreas fault in California) that runs the length of the valley of the Rio Motagua in Guatemala. Motion along this fault is the source of earthquakes in northernmost El Salvador.\n\nEl Salvador has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. The country has over twenty volcanoes, although only two, San Miguel and Izalco, have been active in recent years. From the early nineteenth century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name \"Lighthouse of the Pacific.\" Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.\n\nTwo parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85 percent of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.\n\nThe northern range of mountains, the Sierra Madre, form a continuous chain along the border with Honduras. Elevations in this region range from 1,600 to 2,700 meters. The area was once heavily forested, but overexploitation led to extensive erosion, and it has become semibarren. As a result, it is the country's most sparsely populated zone, with little farming or other development.\n\nThe southern range of mountains is actually a discontinuous chain of more than twenty volcanoes, clustered into five groups. The westernmost group, near the Guatemalan border, contains Izalco and Santa Ana, which at 2,365 meters is the highest volcano in El Salvador. Between the cones lie alluvial basins and rolling hills eroded from ash deposits. The volcanic soil is rich, and much of El Salvador's coffee is planted on these slopes.\n\nThe central plateau constitutes only 25 percent of the land area but contains the heaviest concentration of population and the country's largest cities. This plain is about 50 kilometers wide and has an average elevation of 600 meters. Terrain here is rolling, with occasional escarpments, lava fields, and geysers.\n\nA narrow plain extends from the coastal volcanic range to the Pacific Ocean. This region has a width ranging from one to thirty-two kilometers with the widest section in the east, adjacent to the Golfo de Fonseca. Near La Libertad, however, the mass of the mountains push the lowlands out; the slopes of adjacent volcanoes come down directly to the ocean. Surfaces in the Pacific lowlands are generally flat or gently rolling and result from the alluvial deposits of nearby slopes.\n\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and finally cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river, it and its tributaries drain about half the country. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific.\n\nNumerous lakes of volcanic origin are found in the interior highlands; many of these lakes are surrounded by mountains and have high, steep banks. The largest lake, the Lago de Ilopango, lies just to the east of the capital. Other large lakes include the Lago de Coatepeque in the west and the Lago de Güija on the Guatemalan border. The Cerron Grande Dam on the Rio Lempa has created a large reservoir, the Embalse Cerron Grande, in northern El Salvador.\n\nIzalco has erupted at least 51 times since 1770. It earned the nickname \"Lighthouse of the Pacific\" because it was the most active volcano in Central America.\n\nEl Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot and humid; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate.\n\nThe rainy season, known locally as \"invierno\", or winter, extends from May to October. Almost all the annual rainfall and the highest humidity occurs during this time, and yearly rain totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as . Protected areas and the central plateau receive lesser, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Although hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific, they seldom affect El Salvador, with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (which actually formed over the Atlantic Basin) and Hurricane Emily in 1973.\n\nFrom November through April, the northeast trade winds control weather patterns. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy. This season is known locally as \"verano\", or summer.\n\nTemperatures vary little with season; elevation is the primary determinant. The Pacific lowlands are the hottest region, with annual averages ranging from . San Salvador is representative of the central plateau, with an annual average temperature of and absolute high and low readings of , respectively. Mountain areas are the coolest, with annual averages from and minimum temperatures sometimes approaching freezing.\n\nEl Salvador's physical shape form, evokes a similar resemblance to a rugged and miniature version of the U.S State of California. During the 1980s, the country's coastal roads were compared to California's coastal roads by American surfers and El Salvador became known as the wild west of Central America, characterized by roughness and lawlessness.\n\nThe total land area of El Salvador is 23,041 km², with 20,721 km² of land and 320 km² of water. This is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Massachusetts. El Salvador has 590 km of borders, including 391 km of borders with Honduras and 199 km with Guatemala.

These towns are Santa Maria Nebaj, San Juan Cotzal, and San Gaspar Chajul. The area's population is predominantly of Ixil descent. When viewed on a map, the three Ixil towns appear to form a triangle, because of this, is also named Ixil Triangle.\n\nDue to its location in the Cuchumatanes mountains, the Ixil Community has remained isolated from the rest of the world. Its people have therefore maintained their traditional culture — free from influences of the outside world. Although the introduction modern western media is rapidly eroding the culture as young men and women look North for economic prosperity and abandonment of the culture and language are present problems .Most men are farmers, and most women are weavers.\n\nTheir diet primarily consists of maze based products. Small round tortillas or corn dumplings known as tamalitos are a staple at almost every meal. This love of corn is ingrined in the culture, so much so that many of the Ixil refer to themselves as \"men of corn\". Stating that the first humans were rolled from masa or ground up maze.\n\nOther foods commonly eaten are boxbol, which are small corn dumplings steamed in squash leaves covered in chili sauce.\n\nMalanga, \"guiscil\", beans, squash, and eggs make up the rest of their typical diet.\n\nThe people of the Ixil Community primarily speak the Ixil language. Some villagers speak Spanish as a secondary language.\n\nDuring the Guatemalan Civil War, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) used the surrounding mountains as a base of operations. The Guatemalan Army pursued a scorched-earth policy to destroy villages. The villagers of the Ixil Community were caught in the crossfire, and thousands of civilians were killed, tortured, or missing.\n\nThe army's campaign against civilians in this region may have been motivated partially by a desire \"to weaken and eventually eradicate Maya culture.\" Villagers slowly learned not to wear their traditional Maya clothing, because its distinctive appearance made them easy targets for soldiers.\n"}

According to various sources the number of people who perished in Kurapaty is estimated in at least 30,000 people (according to attorney general of BSSR Tarnaŭski), up to 100,000 people (according to “Belarus” reference book), from 102,000 to 250,000 people (according to the article by Zianon Pazniak in “Litaratura i mastactva” newspaper), 250,000 people (according to Polish historian and professor of University of Wrocław Zdzisław Julian Winnicki), and more (according to the British historian Norman Davies).\n\nIn 2004 Kurapaty were included in the register of the Cultural Properties of Belarus as a first-category cultural heritage.\n\nThe discovery by historian Zyanon Paznyak and exhumation of the remains in 1988 gave an added momentum to the pro-democracy and pro-independence movement in Belarus in the last years of the Soviet Union before it dissolved. There have been investigations by both the Soviet, and Belarusian governments, which have been conclusive as to the perpetrators who are the Soviet NKVD. This is based on former NKVD members confession and the eyewitness testimonies of 55 villagers, from villages such as Cna, Cna-Yodkava, Drazdova, Padbaloccie and others, that gave evidence that NKVD brought people in trucks and executed them during 1937 – 1941.\n\nPresident of the United States Bill Clinton visited Kurapaty forest in 1994, when he came to Belarus with a \"thank you\" visit after Belarus agreed to transfer their post-Soviet nuclear weapons to Russia. Clinton presented a small granite monument \"To Belarusians from the American people\", perhaps the first post-Soviet cultural artefact from the U.S. on the Belarusian soil. The monument was damaged three times by unidentified vandals, but subsequently restored.\n\nIn 2001, when the Kurapaty site was threatened by a planned widening of the Minsk Ring Road, youth from the Belarusian Popular Front, Zubr and smaller organizations occupied the site and sat out a bitter winter in tents, trying to halt the road construction, with no success.\n\nOn October 29, 2004, the Jewish community of Belarus installed a monument in memory of the Jews and other nationals who were murdered in Kurapaty forest. The brown granite stone has two inscriptions in Yiddish and in Belarusian: \"To our fellow-believers—Jews, Christians and the Muslims—the victims of Stalinism from the Belarusian Jews.\"\n\nEach year in November, on Dziady (the All Saints or the day when Belarusians commemorate their deceased forefathers), hundreds of people visit this site of crimes of Soviet political repression. The first such demonstration in 1988, in which there were tens of thousands of participants, was brutally dispersed by the police. Officials from the Belarussian administration do not recognize the Kurapaty case as a certain Soviet crime against humanity and never mention Kurapaty in public.\n\n\n\n"}

Of the approximately 6,000 stars visible to the naked eye under optimal conditions, the selected stars are among the brightest and span 38 constellations of the celestial sphere from the declination of −70° to +89°. Many of the selected stars were named in antiquity by the Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, and Arabs.\n\nThe star Polaris, often called the \"North Star\", is treated specially due to its proximity to the north celestial pole. When navigating in the Northern Hemisphere, special techniques can be used with Polaris to determine latitude or gyrocompass error. The other 57 selected stars have daily positions given in nautical almanacs, aiding the navigator in efficiently performing observations on them. A second group of 115 \"tabulated stars\" can also be used for celestial navigation, but are often less familiar to the navigator and require extra calculations.\n\nFor purposes of identification, the positions of navigational stars — expressed as declination and sidereal hour angle — are often rounded to the nearest degree. In addition to tables, star charts provide an aid to the navigator in identifying the navigational stars, showing constellations, relative positions, and brightness.\n\nUnder optimal conditions, approximately 6,000 stars are visible to the naked eye of an observer on Earth. Of these, 58 stars are known in the field of navigational astronomy as \"selected stars\", including 19 stars of the first magnitude, 38 stars of the second magnitude, and Polaris. The selection of the stars is made by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office and the US Naval Observatory, in the production of the yearly \"Nautical Almanac\" which the two organizations have published jointly since 1958. Criteria in the choice of stars includes their distribution across the celestial sphere, brightness, and ease of identification. Information for another 115 stars, known as \"tabulated stars\", is also available to the navigator. This list provides information on the name, approximate position in the celestial sphere, and apparent magnitude of the 58 selected stars in tabular form and by star charts.\n\nThese stars are typically used in two ways by the navigator. The first is to obtain a line of position by use of a sextant observation and the techniques of celestial navigation. Multiple lines of position can be intersected to obtain a position known as a celestial fix. The second typical use of the navigational stars is to determine gyrocompass error by computing the azimuth of a star and comparing it to an azimuth measured using the ship's gyrocompass. Numerous other applications also exist.\n\nNavigators typically refer to stars using one of two naming systems for stars: common names and Bayer's designations. All of the selected stars have had a common name since 1953, and many were named in antiquity by the Arabs, Greeks, Romans, and Babylonians. Bayer's naming convention has been in use since 1603, and consists of a Greek letter combined with the possessive form of the star's constellation. Both names are shown for each star in the tables and charts below.\n\nEach star's approximate position on the celestial sphere is given using the equatorial coordinate system. The celestial sphere is an imaginary globe of infinite size with the Earth at its center. Positions on the celestial sphere are often expressed using two coordinates: declination and sidereal hour angle, which are similar to latitude and longitude on the surface of the Earth. To define declination, the Earth's equator is projected out to the celestial sphere to construct the celestial equator, and declination is measured in degrees north or south of this celestial equator. Sidereal hour angle is a measurement between 0° and 360°, indicating how far west a body is from an arbitrarily chosen point on the celestial sphere called the \"First Point of Aries\". Note that right ascension, as used by astronomers, is 360° minus the sidereal hour angle.\n\nThe final characteristic provided in the tables and star charts is the star's brightness, expressed in terms of apparent magnitude. Magnitude is a logarithmic scale of brightness, designed so that a body of one magnitude is approximately 2.512 times brighter than a body of the next magnitude. Thus, a body of magnitude 1 is 2.512, or 100 times brighter than a body of magnitude 6. The dimmest stars that can be seen through a 200 inch terrestrial telescope are of the 20th magnitude, and very bright objects like the Sun and a full Moon have magnitudes of −26.7 and −12.6 respectively.\n\nThe table of navigational stars provides several types of information. In the first column is the identifying index number, followed by the common name, the Bayer designation, and the etymology of the common name. Then the star's approximate position, suitable for identification purposes, is given in terms of declination and sidereal hour angle, followed by the star's magnitude. The final column presents citations to the sources of the data, \"The American Practical Navigator\" and the star's entry at the SIMBAD database, a project of the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center or CDS.\n\nNavigators often use star charts to identify a star by its position relative to other stars. References like the \"Nautical Almanac\" and \"The American Practical Navigator\" provide four star charts, covering different portions of the celestial sphere. Two of these charts are azimuthal equidistant projections of the north and south poles. The other two cover the equatorial region of the celestial sphere, from the declination of 30° south to 30° north. The two equatorial charts are mercator projections, one for the eastern hemisphere of the celestial sphere and one for the western hemisphere. Note that unlike familiar maps, east is shown to the left and west is shown to the right. With this orientation, the navigator can hold the star chart overhead, and the arrangement of the stars on the chart will resemble the stars in the sky.\nIn the star charts, constellations are labelled with capital letters and indicated by dotted lines collecting their stars. The 58 selected stars for navigation are shown in blue and labelled with their common name, star number, and a Greek letter to indicate their Bayer designation. The additional 115 tabulated stars that can also be used for navigation are shown in red and labelled with a Greek letter to indicate their Bayer designation. Some additional stars not suitable for navigation are also included on the charts to indicate constellations, they are presented as unlabelled small red dots.\n\nThe equatorial region of the celestial sphere's eastern hemisphere includes 16 navigational stars from Alpheratz in the constellation Andromeda to Denebola in Leo. It also includes stars from the constellations Cetus, Aries, Taurus, Orion, Canis Major and Minor, Gemini, and Hydra. Of particular note among these stars are \"the dog star\" Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, and four stars of the easily identified constellation Orion. \n \nThe equatorial region of the celestial sphere's western hemisphere includes 13 navigational stars from Gienah in the constellation Corvus to Markab in Pegasus. It also includes stars from the constellations Virgo, Bootes, Libra, Corona Borealis, Scorpio, Ophiuchus, Sagittarius, and Aquila. The variable star Arcturus is the brightest star in this group. \n\nThe 11 northern stars are those with a declination between 30° north and 90° north. They are listed in order of decreasing sidereal hour angle, or from the vernal equinox westward across the sky. Starting with Schedar in the constellation Cassiopeia, the list includes stars from the constellations Auriga, the Great and Little Bears, Draco, Lyra and Cygnus. The two brightest northern stars are Vega and Capella.\n\nIn the star chart to the right, declination is shown by the radial coordinate, starting at 90° north in the center and decreasing to 30° north at the outer edge. Sidereal hour angle is shown as the angular coordinate, starting at 0° at the left of the chart, and increasing counter-clockwise.\n\nThe 18 southern stars are those with a declination between 30° south and 90° south.

His paternal grandfather was a physician. His father, Basilio Oreja Echaniz, settled in the Biscay Ibarrangelu and since the late 1870s also practiced as a doctor, in the early 20th century briefly serving also as a mayor. Marcelino's mother, Cecilia Elósegui Ayala, came from a distinguished and much branched Gipuzkoan family. His older brothers were active in the Vascongadas branch of Carlism during the late Restoration period already. Basilio died early. made his name as a physician and one of urology pioneers in Gipuzkoa. Ricardo became one of the Gipuzkoan party leaders; he was elected to the Cortes in 1920 and 1923, during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship serving as gobernador civil of the Santander province. Both were members of the Francoist Cortes in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nMarcelino Oreja was born to his parents rather late, much junior than his older brothers, and was brought up in a militantly Catholic ambience. He studied civil engineering and graduated as ingeniero de caminos, canales y puertos, in 1925 nominated “ingeniero en practicas”. He married Purificación Aguirre Isasi, descendant to a well-to-do Gipuzkoan family. Her father, Toribio Aguirre Ibarzabal, served as a Traditionalist officer during the Third Carlist War. He became a member of new Basque industrial elites as co-founder, one of major shareholders and directing manager of the metalworking company Union Cerrajera. The posthumous son of Marcelino and Purificación, Marcelino Oreja Aguirre, was a Francoist diplomat and later Christian-Democrat politician; in 2010 Juan Carlos de Borbon made him .\n\nProfoundly religious though falling short of exalted religiosity, Oreja commenced his public activity during the academic period in the very last years of the Restoration era. In early 1920 he entered , the lay Catholics organization founded back in 1909. Seconded by ACNdP, later that year he commenced work on launching a conservative academic union, Asociación Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos Españoles, set up and confederated with Confederación Internacional de Estudiantes Católicos. Based in Madrid, Oreja emerged as number two in the organization, becoming its secretary general; he is credited for “inflammatory harangues, opposing secularism in education and advocating Catholic integrity as an academic foundation. Some time afterwards, still acting on ACNdP initiative, he went on to build another Christian youth organization, Juventud Católica Española, somewhat broader in scope than CEC and more tied up with the parochial network. In 1924 Oreja entered its first Comisión Ejecutiva and became member of the propaganda section, travelling extensively across Spain, organizing JCE structures and taking part in various congresses, described as “vibrant and effusive” speaker.\n\nIn 1925 Oreja joined the ACNdP executive, nominated consejero nacional of the organization and rising to one of its key figures, on friendly terms with Angel Herrera Oria. In the mid-1920s Herrera dispatched him to the United States, the key purpose having been management training. Oreja enrolled at Columbia University, studying administration and journalism; he was also gaining hands-on familiarity with top American newspapers, collaborating with \"Boston Globe\" and \"New York Times\". He remained in the US for two years. Upon his return, Oreja praised efficiency of modern American Catholic organizations like and warned against the Jewish influence in the US. Back in Spain, ACNdP seconded him to \"El Debate\", a dynamic daily owned by a controlled publishing house, Editorial Católica; Oreja entered the executive board and became its manager. He is credited for setting up an affiliated journalism school, renovating linotype infrastructure, introducing new techniques of editing and innovative advertising strategies.\n\nIn the late 1920s Oreja had to leave Madrid due to family reasons and returned to the Vascongadas; instead of his home Biscay he settled in Gipuzkoa, moving into the family estate of his wife in Mondragón. In 1927 he commenced business activity related to his vocation as an engineer, becoming a manager of Vidrieras Españolas, a Bilbao-based glass and mirror company. In 1928 he set up his own enterprise, Agromán, specializing in construction work and gaining governmental contracts. In 1929 he became secretary of Consejo Administracion of Obrascón, a Bilbao construction agglomerate managed by a Carlist politician José Joaquín de Ampuero y del Río, also favored during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship. In early 1930s Marcelino Oreja succeeded his father-in-law as managing director of Unión Cerrajera, at that time somewhat of a hybrid between a typical joint-stock company and a cooperative. Some authors claim that during his term Oreja transformed Union into one of the greatest Biscay businesses, the others acknowledge its dynamics with some 1,500 employees, but do not credit Oreja for its growth.\n\nOreja represented a new breed of managers, attempting to defuse social conflict with a social-Catholic mixture of papal teachings of Leo XIII and traditionalist corporativism of Juan Vázquez de Mella. To promote this vision he co-founded Agrupación Vasca de Acción Social Cristiana in 1931, though he was able to test its feasibility at Union Cerrajera. As a manager he remained attentive to questions of workplace safety, social insurance and education; in 1933 he drafted the statute of Hermandad de Trabajadores de Unión Cerrajera, a Catholic trade union eventually set up after his death. However, he was vehemently hostile to competitive visions of labor relations, denouncing both Fascism and Marxism. Having developed a reputation for being authoritarian, he was considered prime enemy by the local UGT branch, especially that Oreja pledged never to employ a socialist or an anarchist, a statement which might be indicative of both his corporativist and Basque leanings.\n\nFollowing in footsteps of his older brothers, as a teenager Oreja was active in local Carlist structures; together with Ricardo and Benigno he defected to the secessionist Mellist branch of Traditionalism in 1919. After the Primo de Rivera coup he engaged in collaboration with the regime, though its nature remains unspecified. During the dictablanda period he came out with his first major proposal, presented to the orphaned primoderiveristas: instead of building a successor to Union Patriotica, named , he suggested to build a social-Catholic confederation of regionalist movements across Spain. These plans were cancelled by fall of the monarchy and proclamation of the republic. In the early 1930s Oreja already emerged as one of the Basque Right leaders.\n\nDuring the first republican electoral campaign of 1931 Oreja, still representing the mellistas, forged an alliance with PNV and mainstream Carlism. It eventually materialized in Vascongadas and Navarre as , with Oreja elected as its deputy from the rural Biscay district. During his first term as a deputy he dedicated himself to the Basque-Navarrese autonomy, approached not as a tactical necessity, but as a matter of principle. He contributed to the so-called and kept supporting autonomous regulations even when the government-imposed draft moved religious issues from regional to central portfolio. Another thread of his parliamentary activity – often merged with the Basque cause - was opposing secularization motions of the Left and backing the Church, especially trying to preserve its education infrastructure. \n\nSupporting reunification of Carlism in 1932 Oreja joined its united organization, , though he remained relatively lukewarm to dynastical issues and supported broad monarchical alliances on national or regional basis. He was heading the Biscay section of Requeté, a rapidly growing Carlist paramilitary militia. He successfully represented the party during the 1933 electoral campaign to the Cortes, again standing in the Biscay province and again in alliance with PNV. As late as November 1933 he still advocated the apparently doomed autonomy “contra viento y marea”, which, however, did not amount to endorsing Basque nationalism or Basque separatism. Some scholars oppose him to “integristas” in the autonomy discourse.\n\nDuring the , the tension in Mondragon was running high. Oreja was arrested in his home by socialist militiamen, reportedly employees of the company he managed. Following a brief detention, he was shot dead.\n\nOreja was the best known single victim of the 1934 revolution in Spain, as no other parliamentary deputy was killed during the turmoil. His death has long reverberated in the national public debate. The Right presented it as a proof of barbarian and Bolshevik nature of the Left, a prefiguration of the future bloody terror, to be imposed by the mass workers’ movements. For the Carlists, Oreja became another of their martyrs; the following year he was already honored during Fiesta de los Mártires de la Tradición, the feast dedicated to the fallen Carlists and observed every March from 1895. In the Francoist Spain many streets have been named after him. Today “calle Marcelino Oreja” exists, among other places, in Bilbao and Mislata.\n\nThe public memory of Marcelino Oreja Elósegui has been kept alive mostly thanks to his son, Marcelino Oreja Aguirre, who remained a well-known figure in Spain until the late 20th century. Today the Basques usually appreciate Oreja's work on the Basque autonomy, though they tend to ignore his Carlist political identity; the Leftist-minded Basques view the Basque and the socialist cases as tantamount and consider Oreja the enemy of both. In the Carlist historical discourse he does not figure prominently. In the partisan debates of current-day Spanish politics he is sometimes acknowledged in relation to Jaime Mayor Oreja, depending on political preferences mentioned either with hostility.\n\n\n\n"}

It established or kept the following holidays:\n\n\nThe same law abolished, by omission, four religious holidays: Epiphany (\"Adoración de los Santos Reyes\", January 6), Carnival (\"Carnaval\", mobile), Annunciation (\"Anunciación del Señor\", march 25) and Nativity of the Virgin Mary (\"Natividad de la Virgen\", September 8). It also shortened the national independence holiday to two days (until 1914, they occupied September 18, 19 and 20).\n\nOn November 14, 1921, President Arturo Alessandri Palma promulgated Law 3,810, marking October 12 (Columbus Day) as holiday.\n\nOn April 30, 1931, President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo promulgated the \"Decree Enforceable as Law\" (\"Decreto con Fuerza de Ley\") 130, marking May 1 (May Day) as holiday.\n\nIn 1932, Provisional President Bartolomé Blanche reinstated the September 20 holiday, which existed until 1944.\n\nIn 1968, the holidays of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Ascension of Jesus Christ and Corpus Christi were eliminated by Article 144 of Law 16,840. The Catholic Church agreed to celebrate them on the nearest Sunday.\n\nSeptember 11 (the day of the military coup in 1973) was established as a holiday (\"Día de la Liberación Nacional\", \"Day of National Liberation\") by the military regime in 1981. In 1998 it was replaced by the \"Día de la Unidad Nacional\" (\"Day of National Unity\"), to be observed the first Monday in September. In March 2002 the latter was abolished.\n\nThe holiday on June 29 (Saint Peter and Saint Paul) was reestablished in September 1985.\n\nIn 1987, during a visit by Pope John Paul II, Corpus Christi was reestablished (although the Church continued to observe the holiday on the nearest Sunday).\n\nOn March 10, 2000, Law 19,668 moved the Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Columbus Day and Corpus Christi holidays to the preceding Monday, if they were to fall on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, or to the following Monday, if they were to fall on a Friday. Additionally, the designation of Columbus Day was changed from \"Aniversario del Descubrimiento de América\" to \"Día del Descubrimiento de Dos Mundos\" (\"Discovery of Two Worlds' Day\"), an obvious corruption from the then-recent ubiquitous \"Encuentro de dos mundos\" (\"The Meeting of Two Worlds\") slogan.\n\nOn January 6, 2007, Law 20,148 replaced Corpus Christi with Our Lady of Mount Carmel, to be observed July 16, starting that year.\n\nOn September 14, 2007, Law 20,215. declared holidays all September 17s falling on a Monday and all September 20s falling on a Friday.\n\nOn October 11, 2008, Law 20,299 established Reformation Day on October 31 as a national holiday, starting that year. This holiday is moved to the preceding Friday if it falls on a Tuesday, or to the following Friday if it falls on a Wednesday.\n\nOn April 30, 2013, Law 20,663 established the regional Battle of Arica holiday, to be observed only in the Arica and Parinacota region.\n\nOn December 30, 2016, Law 20,983 declared as holidays those days that are Monday January 2 or Friday September 17.\n\nBesides yearly holidays, since 1901 presidential elections are declared holidays, as mandated by successive versions of the General Elections law (Law 18,700 being the current one; see laws 1,464, 1,752, 2,977, decree-law 542, 6,250, 6,834, 9,334 and 12,891). Since the late 20th century, parliamentary and municipal elections are also public holidays (see Law 18,700). Censuses, held every ten years, are also declared holidays since 1982; that year's census and 1992's were so due to ad-hoc laws; censuses taken from 1992 onwards are declared holidays due to a reform in the Census law. (This did not occur in 2012, where the census was carried out in the space of two months, using a different methodology.)\n\nShortly after Chile's independence, an 1824 (government-approved) Church decree reduced the amount of religious holidays, enumerating and the surviving holidays, including the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, observed on January 1. Law 2,977 (passed in 1915, still in vigour) lists this holiday by date only, without using any name, but does treat it as religious one. However, nowadays (as of 2009) it's widely celebrated as the (civic) New Year holiday. As a matter of fact, there aren't any known regulations later than 1915 that use the \"Circumcision of Christ\" name, while \"New Year\" is used by numerous regulations of all types (laws (19.925), decree-laws (\"decretos ley\") (1.299, 1.613 and 2,408), decrees enforceable as law (\"decretos con fuerza de ley\") (D.F.L 338 of 1960), ministerial decrees and resolutions (decree 6234 of 1929 of the Public Education Ministry (the oldest such regulation), decree 83 of 1985 of the Labor Ministry, decree 48 of 2007 of the Labor Ministry, et cetera) and municipal decrees and ordinances (decree 1316 of 2004 of the Las Condes Municipality, decree 23 of 2006 of the Padre Las Casas Municipality, decree 23 of 2009 of the San Carlos Municipality, et cetera).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58088", "title": "Sakhalin", "text": "Sakhalin\n\nSakhalin ( or ; ; , \"Karafuto\") is a large Russian island in the North Pacific Ocean, lying between 45°50' and 54°24' N. It is Russia's largest island, and is administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast. Sakhalin, which is about one third the size of Honshu, is just off the east coast of Russia, and just north of Japan. The island's population was 497,973 as of the 2010 census, made up of mostly ethnic Russians and a smaller Korean community. The indigenous peoples of the island are the Ainu, Oroks and Nivkhs.\n\nSakhalin was claimed by both Russia and Japan over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. These disputes sometimes involved military conflict and divisions of the island between the two powers. In 1875, Japan ceded its claims to Russia in exchange for the northern Kuril Islands. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War, the island was divided, with the south going to Japan. Russia has held all of the island since seizing the Japanese portion—as well as all the Kuril Islands—in the final days of World War II in 1945. Japan no longer claims any of Sakhalin, although it does still claim the southern Kuril Islands. Most Ainu on Sakhalin moved to Hokkaido, only to the south, when the Japanese were displaced from the island in 1949.\n\nThe island is known in Russian as Sakhalin (Сахалин). In Chinese, it is known as Kuye (). In Japanese, it is known as or, borrowing the Russian appellation, as . The spelling Saghalien may be found in historical texts. Choka (or Tchoka) is another name found in the early literature and seems to have been the name used by the islanders themselves, but it is not clear whether these were the Gilyak or the Ainu.\n\nThe European names derive from misinterpretation of a Manchu name \"sahaliyan ula angga hada\" (\"peak/craggy rock at the mouth of the Amur River\"). \"Sahaliyan\", the word that has been borrowed in the form of \"Sakhalin\", means \"black\" in Manchu, \"ula\" means \"river\" and \"sahaliyan ula\" ( , \"Black River\") is the proper Manchu name of the Amur River. Its Japanese name, , supposedly comes from Ainu \"kamuy kar put ya mosir\" (, shortened to \"Karput\" ), which means \"the island a god has created at the estuary (of the Amur River)\". The name was used by the Japanese during their possession of its southern part (1905–1945).\n\nSakhalin was inhabited in the Neolithic Stone Age. Flint implements such as those found in Siberia have been found at Dui and Kusunai in great numbers, as well as polished stone hatchets similar to European examples, primitive pottery with decorations like those of the Olonets, and stone weights used with fishing nets. A later population familiar with bronze left traces in earthen walls and kitchen-middens on Aniva Bay.\n\nAmong the indigenous people of Sakhalin are the Ainu in the southern half, the Oroks in the central region, and the Nivkhs in the north. Chinese chronicled the Xianbei and Hezhe tribes, which had a way of life based on fishing.\n\nThe Mongol Empire made some efforts to subjugate the native people of Sakhalin starting in about 1264 CE. According to Yuanshi, the official history of the Yuan dynasty, the Mongols militarily subdued the \"Guwei\" (骨嵬, \"Gǔwéi\"), and by 1308, all inhabitants of Sakhalin had submitted to the Yuan. The Nivkhs and the Oroks were subjugated earlier, whereas the Ainu people submitted to the Mongols later. Following their subjugation, \"Gǔwéi\" elders made tributary visits to Yuan posts located at Wuleihe, Nanghar, and Boluohe until the end of the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China (1368). In the early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the tributary relationship was re-established. By the middle of the 15th century, following the introduction of Chinese political and commercial institutions in the Amur region, the Sakhalin Ainu were making frequent tributary visits to Chinese-controlled outposts. Chinese of the Ming dynasty knew the island as Kuyi (苦夷 \"Kǔyí\") or Kuwu (), and later as Kuye (), as it is known today. There is some evidence that the Ming eunuch Admiral Yishiha reached Sakhalin in 1413 during one of his expeditions to the lower Amur, and granted Ming titles to a local chieftain. Under the Ming dynasty, commerce in Northeast Asia and Sakhalin was placed under the \"system for subjugated peoples\", or \"ximin tizhi\". This suggests that the island was at least nominally under the administration of the Nurgan Regional Military Commission, which was established by Yishiha near today's village of Tyr on the Siberian mainland in 1411, and continued operating until the mid-1430s. A Ming boundary stone still exists on the island.\n\nAccording to Wei Yuan's work \"Military history of the Qing dynasty\" (), the Later Jin sent 400 troops to Sakhalin in 1616 in response to Japanese activity in the area, but later withdrew, judging there to be no major threat to their control of the island.\n\nIn an early colonization attempt, a Japanese settlement was established at Ootomari on Sakhalin's southern end in 1679. Cartographers of the Matsumae clan created a map of the island and called it \"Kita-Ezo\" (Northern Ezo, Ezo being the old name for the islands north of Honshu). The 1689 Nerchinsk Treaty between Russia and China, which defined the Stanovoy Mountains as their mutual border, made no explicit mention of the island; however, the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) did consider the island to be part of its territory, and enacted policies of a pattern similar to the previous Ming dynasty, which drew Sakhalin further into the \"system for subjugated peoples\". Local people were forced to pay tribute at Qing posts, and Qing officials sometimes granted titles to local elders, entrusting them with the task of \"keeping the peace\". By the mid-18th century, Qing officials had registered 56 surname groups; of these, Qing sources note that six clans and 148 households were those of Ainu and Nivkh who came under the Qing administrative umbrella. However, since the Chinese government did not have a military presence on the island, Japanese attempts at colonization continued.\n\nThe first European known to visit Sakhalin was Martin Gerritz de Vries, who mapped Cape Patience and Cape Aniva on the island's east coast in 1643. The Dutch captain, however, was unaware that it was an island, and 17th century maps usually showed these points (and often Hokkaido as well) as being part of the mainland.\n\nAs part of a nationwide Sino-French cartographic program, the Jesuits Jean-Baptiste Régis, Pierre Jartoux, and Xavier Ehrenbert Fridelli joined a Chinese team visiting the lower Amur (known to them under its Manchu name, Saghalien Ula, i.e. the \"Black River\"), in 1709, and learned of the existence of the nearby offshore island from the \"Ke tcheng\" natives of the lower Amur. The Jesuits were told that the islanders were believed to be good at reindeer husbandry. They reported that the mainlanders used a variety of names to refer to the island, but \"Saghalien anga bata\" (i.e. \"the Island [at] the mouth of the Black River\") was the most common, while the name \"Huye\" (presumably, \"Kuye\", 庫頁), which they had heard in Beijing, was completely unknown to the locals.\n\nThe Jesuits did not have a chance to visit the island personally, and the geographical information provided by the \"Ke tcheng\" people and Manchus who had been to the island was insufficient to allow them to identify it as the land visited by de Vries in 1643. As a result, many 17th century maps showed a rather strangely shaped Sakhalin, which included only the northern half of the island (with Cape Patience), while Cape Aniva, discovered by de Vries, and the \"Black Cape\" (Cape Crillon) were thought to be part of the mainland.\n\nIt was not until the 1787 expedition of Jean-François de La Pérouse that the island began to resemble something of its true shape on European maps. Though unable to pass through its northern \"bottleneck\" due to contrary winds, La Perouse charted most of the Strait of Tartary, and islanders he encountered near today's Strait of Nevelskoy told him that the island was called \"Tchoka\" (or at least that is how he recorded the name in French), and it was used on some maps thereafter.\n\nThe Russian explorer Adam Johann von Krusenstern visited Sakhalin in 1805, but regarded it as a peninsula.\n\nAlarmed by the visits of European powers, Japan proclaimed its sovereignty over the whole island in 1807. Most Japanese sources claim Mamiya Rinzō as the true discoverer of the Strait of Tartary, in 1809.\n\nOn the basis of its belief that it was an extension of Hokkaido, both geographically and culturally, Japan again proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island (as well as the Kuril Islands chain) in 1845, in the face of competing claims from Russia. In 1849, however, the Russian navigator Gennady Nevelskoy recorded the existence and navigability of the strait later given his name, and – in defiance of the Qing and Japanese claims – Russian settlers began establishing coal mines, administration facilities, schools, and churches on the island.\n\nIn 1855, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Shimoda, which declared that nationals of both countries could inhabit the island: Russians in the north, and Japanese in the south, without a clearly defined boundary between. Russia also agreed to dismantle its military base at Ootomari. Following the Opium War, Russia forced China to sign the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860), under which China lost to Russia all claims to territories north of Heilongjiang (Amur) and east of Ussuri, including Sakhalin.\n\nIn 1857 the Russians established a penal colony. In 1890 the distinguished author Anton Chekhov visited the penal colony on Sakhalin and published a memoir of his journey.\n\nJapan proclaimed its sovereignty over Sakhalin (which they called Karafuto) yet again in 1865, and the government built a stele announcing the claim at the northern extremity of the island. The island remained under shared sovereignty until the signing of the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, in which Japan surrendered its claims in Sakhalin to Russia.\n\nBetween 1848 and 1902, American whaleships hunted whales off Sakhalin. They cruised for bowhead and gray whales to the north and right whales to the east and south. On 7 June 1855, the ship \"Jefferson\" (396 tons), of New London, was wrecked on Cape Levenshtern, on the northeastern side of the island, during a fog. All hands were saved as well as 300 barrels of whale oil.\n\nJapanese forces invaded and occupied Sakhalin in the closing stages of the Russo-Japanese War. In accordance with the Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, the southern part of the island below the 50th parallel north reverted to Japan, while Russia retained the northern three-fifths. In 1920, during the Siberian Intervention, Japan again occupied the northern part of the island, returning it to the Soviet Union in 1925.\n\nSouth Sakhalin was administered by Japan as Karafuto Prefecture (), with the capital at Toyohara (today's Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk). A large number of migrants were brought in from Korea.\n\nThe northern, Russian, half of the island formed Sakhalin Oblast, with the capital at Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky.\n\nIn August 1945, after repudiating the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviet Union invaded southern Sakhalin. The Soviet attack started on August 11, 1945, a few days before the surrender of Japan. The Soviet 56th Rifle Corps, part of the 16th Army, consisting of the 79th Rifle Division, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the 214 Armored Brigade, attacked the Japanese 88th Infantry Division. Although the Soviet Red Army outnumbered the Japanese by three to one, they advanced only slowly due to strong Japanese resistance. It was not until the 113th Rifle Brigade and the 365th Independent Naval Infantry Rifle Battalion from Sovetskaya Gavan landed on Tōro, a seashore village of western Karafuto on August 16 that the Soviets broke the Japanese defense line. Japanese resistance grew weaker after this landing. Actual fighting continued until August 21. From August 22 to August 23, most remaining Japanese units agreed to a ceasefire. The Soviets completed the conquest of Karafuto on August 25, 1945 by occupying the capital of Toyohara.\n\nOf the approximately 400,000 people – mostly Japanese and Korean – who lived on South Sakhalin in 1944, about 100,000 were evacuated to Japan during the last days of the war. The remaining 300,000 stayed behind, some for several more years. While the vast majority of Sakhalin Japanese and Koreans were gradually repatriated between 1946 and 1950, tens of thousands of Sakhalin Koreans (and a number of their Japanese spouses) remained in the Soviet Union.\nNo final peace treaty has been signed and the status of four neighboring islands remains disputed. Japan renounced its claims of sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in the Treaty of San Francisco (1951), but maintains that the four offshore islands of Hokkaido currently administered by Russia were not subject to this renunciation. Japan has granted mutual exchange visas for Japanese and Ainu families divided by the change in status. Recently, economic and political cooperation has gradually improved between the two nations despite disagreements.\n\nOn 1 September 1983, the Korean Air Flight 007, a South Korean civilian airliner, flew over Sakhalin and was shot down by the Soviet Union, just west of Sakhalin Island, near the smaller Moneron Island; the Soviet Union claimed it was a spy plane. All 269 passengers and crew died, including a U.S. Congressman, Larry McDonald.\n\nOn 27 May 1995, the 7.0 Neftegorsk earthquake shook the former Russian settlement of Neftegorsk with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (\"Violent\"). Total damage was $64.1–300 million, with 1,989 deaths and 750 injured. The settlement was not rebuilt.\n\nSakhalin is separated from the mainland by the narrow and shallow Strait of Tartary, which often freezes in winter in its narrower part, and from Hokkaido, Japan by the Soya Strait or La Pérouse Strait. Sakhalin is the largest island in Russia, being long, and wide, with an area of .\n\nIts orography and geological structure are imperfectly known. One theory is that Sakhalin arose from the Sakhalin Island Arc. Nearly two-thirds of Sakhalin is mountainous. Two parallel ranges of mountains traverse it from north to south, reaching . The Western Sakhalin Mountains peak in Mount Ichara, , while the Eastern Sakhalin Mountains's highest peak, Mount Lopatin , is also the island's highest mountain. Tym-Poronaiskaya Valley separates the two ranges. Susuanaisky and Tonino-Anivsky ranges traverse the island in the south, while the swampy Northern-Sakhalin plain occupies most of its north.\nCrystalline rocks crop out at several capes; Cretaceous limestones, containing an abundant and specific fauna of gigantic ammonites, occur at Dui on the west coast; and Tertiary conglomerates, sandstones, marls, and clays, folded by subsequent upheavals, are found in many parts of the island. The clays, which contain layers of good coal and abundant fossilized vegetation, show that during the Miocene period, Sakhalin formed part of a continent which comprised north Asia, Alaska, and Japan, and enjoyed a comparatively warm climate. The Pliocene deposits contain a mollusc fauna more Arctic than that which exists at the present time, indicating that the connection between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans was probably broader than it is now.\n\nMain rivers: The Tym, long and navigable by rafts and light boats for , flows north and northeast with numerous rapids and shallows, and enters the Sea of Okhotsk. The Poronai River flows south-southeast to the Gulf of Patience or Shichiro Bay, on the southeastern coast. Three other small streams enter the wide semicircular Gulf of Aniva or Higashifushimi Bay at the southern extremity of the island.\n\nThe northernmost point of Sakhalin is Cape of Elisabeth on the Schmidt Peninsula, while Cape Crillon is the southernmost point of the island.\n\nSakhalin has two smaller islands associated with it, Moneron Island and Ush Island. Moneron, the only land mass in the Tatar strait, long and wide, is about west from the nearest coast of Sakhalin and from the port city of Nevelsk. Ush Island is an island off of the northern coast of Sakhalin.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, some 32,000 Russians (of whom over 22,000 were convicts) inhabited Sakhalin along with several thousand native inhabitants. In 2010, the island's population was recorded at 497,973, 83% of whom were ethnic Russians, followed by about 30,000 Koreans (5.5%). Smaller minorities were Ukrainians, Tatars, Yakuts and Evenks. The native inhabitants consist of some 2,000 Nivkhs and 750 Oroks. The Nivkhs in the north support themselves by fishing and hunting. In 2008 there were 6,416 births and 7,572 deaths.\n\nThe administrative center of the oblast, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, a city of about 175,000, has a large Korean minority, typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans, who were forcibly brought by the Japanese during World War II to work in the coal mines. Most of the population lives in the southern half of the island, centered mainly around Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and two ports, Kholmsk and Korsakov (population about 40,000 each).\n\nThe 400,000 Japanese inhabitants of Sakhalin (including all indigenous Ainu) were deported following the invasion of the southern portion of the island by the Soviet Union in 1945 at the end of World War II.\n\nThe Sea of Okhotsk ensures Sakhalin has a cold and humid climate, ranging from humid continental (Köppen \"Dfb\") in the south to subarctic (\"Dfc\") in the centre and north. The maritime influence makes summers much cooler than in similar-latitude inland cities such as Harbin or Irkutsk, but makes the winters much more snowy and a few degrees warmer than in interior East Asian cities at the same latitude. Summers are foggy with little sunshine.\n\nPrecipitation is heavy, owing to the strong onshore winds in summer and the high frequency of North Pacific storms affecting the island in the autumn. It ranges from around on the northwest coast to over in southern mountainous regions. In contrast to interior east Asia with its pronounced summer maximum, onshore winds ensure Sakhalin has year-round precipitation with a peak in the autumn.\nThe whole of the island is covered with dense forests, mostly coniferous. The Yezo (or Yeddo) spruce (\"Picea jezoensis\"), the Sakhalin fir (\"Abies sachalinensis\") and the Dahurian larch (\"Larix gmelinii\") are the chief trees; on the upper parts of the mountains are the Siberian dwarf pine (\"Pinus pumila\") and the Kurile bamboo (\"Sasa kurilensis\"). Birches, both Siberian silver birch (\"Betula platyphylla\") and Erman's birch (\"B. ermanii\"), poplar, elm, bird cherry (\"Prunus padus\"), Japanese yew (\"Taxus cuspidata\"), and several willows are mixed with the conifers; while farther south the maple, rowan and oak, as also the Japanese \"Panax ricinifolium\", the Amur cork tree (\"Phellodendron amurense\"), the Spindle (\"Euonymus macropterus\") and the vine (\"Vitis thunbergii\") make their appearance. The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. cloudberry, cranberry, crowberry, red whortleberry), red-berried elder (\"Sambucus racemosa\"), wild raspberry, and Spiraea.\n\nBears, foxes, otters, and sables are numerous, as are reindeer in the north, and musk deer, hares, squirrels, rats, and mice everywhere. The bird population is mostly the common east Siberian, but there are some endemic or near-endemic breeding species, notably the endangered Nordmann's greenshank (\"Tringa guttifer\") and the Sakhalin leaf warbler (\"Phylloscopus borealoides\"). The rivers swarm with fish, especially species of salmon (\"Oncorhynchus\"). Numerous whales visit the sea coast, including the critically endangered Western Pacific gray whale, for which the coast of Sakhalin is the only known feeding ground. Other endangered whale species known to occur in this area are the North Pacific right whale, the bowhead whale, and the beluga whale.\n\nTransport, especially by sea, is an important segment of the economy. Nearly all the cargo arriving for Sakhalin (and the Kuril Islands) is delivered by cargo boats, or by ferries, in railway wagons, through the Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry from the mainland port of Vanino to Kholmsk. The ports of Korsakov and Kholmsk are the largest and handle all kinds of goods, while coal and timber shipments often go through other ports. In 1999, a ferry service was opened between the ports of Korsakov and Wakkanai, Japan, and operated through the autumn of 2015, when service was suspended.\n\nFor the 2016 summer season, this route will be served by a highspeed catamaran ferry from Singapore named Penguin 33. The ferry is owned by Penguin International Limited and operated by Sakhalin Shipping Company.\n\nSakhalin's main shipping company is Sakhalin Shipping Company, headquartered in Kholmsk on the island's west coast.\n\nAbout 30 percent of all inland transport volume is carried by the island's railways, most of which are organized as the Sakhalin Railway (), which is one of the 17 territorial divisions of the Russian Railways.\n\nThe Sakhalin Railway network extends from Nogliki in the north to Korsakov in the south. Sakhalin's railway has a connection with the rest of Russia via a train ferry operating between Vanino and Kholmsk.\n\n, the railways are only now being converted from the Japanese gauge to the Russian gauge. The original Japanese D51 steam locomotives were used by the Soviet Railways until 1979.\n\nBesides the main network run by the Russian Railways, until December 2006 the local oil company (Sakhalinmorneftegaz) operated a corporate narrow-gauge line extending for from Nogliki further north to Okha (). During the last years of its service, it gradually deteriorated; the service was terminated in December 2006, and the line was dismantled in 2007–2008.\n\nSakhalin is connected by regular flights to Moscow, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok and other cities of Russia. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport has regularly scheduled international flights to Hakodate, Japan, and Seoul and Busan, South Korea. There are also charter flights to the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Niigata, and Sapporo and to the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Dalian and Harbin. The island was formerly served by Alaska Airlines from Anchorage, Petropavlovsk, and Magadan.\n\nThe idea of building a fixed link between Sakhalin and the Russian mainland was first put forwarded in the 1930s. In the 1940s, an abortive attempt was made to link the island via a undersea tunnel. The project was abandoned under Premier Nikita Khrushchev. In 2000, the Russian government revived the idea, adding a suggestion that a 40-km-long bridge could be constructed between Sakhalin and the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, providing Japan with a direct connection to the Eurasian railway network. It was claimed that construction work could begin as early as 2001. The idea was received skeptically by the Japanese government and appears to have been shelved, probably permanently, after the cost was estimated at as much as $50 billion.\n\nIn November 2008, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev announced government support for the construction of the Sakhalin Tunnel, along with the required regauging of the island's railways to Russian standard gauge, at an estimated cost of 300–330 billion roubles.\n\nIn July 2013, Russian Far East development minister Viktor Ishayev proposed a railway bridge to link Sakhalin with the Russian mainland. He also again suggested a bridge between Sakhalin and Hokkaidō, which could potentially create a continuous rail corridor between Europe and Japan. In 2018, president Vladimir Putin ordered a feasibility study for a mainland bridge project.\n\nSakhalin is a classic \"primary sector of the economy\" relying on oil and gas exports, coal mining, forestry, and fishing. Limited quantities of rye, wheat, oats, barley and vegetables are grown, although the growing season averages less than 100 days.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic liberalization, Sakhalin has experienced an oil boom with extensive petroleum exploration and mining by most large oil multinational corporations. The oil and natural gas reserves contain an estimated 14 billion barrels (2.2 km) of oil and 2,700 km (96 trillion cubic feet) of gas and are being developed under production-sharing agreement contracts involving international oil companies like ExxonMobil and Shell.\n\nIn 1996, two large consortia signed contracts to explore for oil and gas off the northeast coast of the island, Sakhalin-I and Sakhalin-II. The two consortia were estimated to spend a combined US$21 billion on the two projects which almost doubled to $37 billion as of September 2006, triggering Russian governmental opposition. The cost will include an estimated US$1 billion to upgrade the island's infrastructure: roads, bridges, waste management sites, airports, railways, communications systems, and ports. In addition, Sakhalin-III-through-VI are in various early stages of development.\n\nThe Sakhalin I project, managed by Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), completed a production-sharing agreement (PSA) between the Sakhalin I consortium, the Russian Federation, and the Sakhalin government. Russia is in the process of building a pipeline across the Tatar Strait from Sakhalin Island to De-Kastri terminal on the Russian mainland. From De-Kastri, the resource will be loaded onto tankers for transport to East Asian markets, namely Japan, South Korea and China.\n\nThe second consortium, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd (Sakhalin Energy), is managing the Sakhalin II project. It completed the first production-sharing agreement (PSA) with the Russian Federation. Sakhalin Energy will build two 800-km pipelines running from the northeast of the island to Prigorodnoye (Prigorodnoe) in Aniva Bay at the southern end. The consortium will also build, at Prigorodnoye, the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant to be built in Russia. The oil and gas are also bound for East Asian markets.\n\nSakhalin II has come under fire from environmental groups, namely Sakhalin Environment Watch, for dumping dredging material in Aniva Bay. These groups were also worried about the offshore pipelines interfering with the migration of whales off the island. The consortium has (as of January 2006) rerouted the pipeline to avoid the whale migration. After a doubling in the projected cost, the Russian government threatened to halt the project for environmental reasons. There have been suggestions that the Russian government is using the environmental issues as a pretext for obtaining a greater share of revenues from the project and/or forcing involvement by the state-controlled Gazprom. The cost overruns (at least partly due to Shell's response to environmental concerns), are reducing the share of profits flowing to the Russian treasury.\n\nIn 2000, the oil and gas industry accounted for 57.5% of Sakhalin's industrial output. By 2006, it is expected to account for 80% of the island's industrial output. Sakhalin's economy is growing rapidly thanks to its oil and gas industry. By 2005, the island had become the largest recipient of foreign investment in Russia, followed by Moscow. Unemployment in 2002 was only two percent\n\nAs of 18 April 2007, Gazprom has taken a 50 percent plus one share interest in Sakhalin II by purchasing 50 percent of Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi's shares.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name is derived from the early Slavic word for \"freedom\" and may be loosely translated as \"(tax-)free settlement\". In modern Russia, the term is used to denote a type of a rural locality and is used in Kursk, Lipetsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Oryol, Rostov, Ryazan, Tula, and Voronezh Oblasts.\n\nOften a \"sloboda\" was a colonization-type settlement in sparsely populated lands, particularly by Cossacks in Cossack Hetmanate, see \"Sloboda Ukraine\". Initially, the settlers of such \"sloboda\" were freed from various taxes and levies for various reasons, hence the name. Freedom from taxes was an incentive for colonization.\n\nBy the first half of the 18th century, this privilege was abolished, and \"slobodas\" became ordinary villages, \"shtetls\", townlets, suburbs.\n\nSome \"slobodas\" were suburban settlements, right behind the city wall. Many of them were subsequently incorporated into cities, and the corresponding toponyms indicate their origin, such as Ogorodnaya Sloboda Lane, Moscow ().\n\nThe Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary writes that by the end of the 19th century a sloboda was a large village with more than one church, a marketplace, and \"volost\" administration, or a village-type settlement of industrial character, where the peasants have little involvement in agriculture.\n\nThe term is preserved in names of various settlements and city quarters. Some settlements were named just thus: \"Sloboda\", \"Slobodka\" (diminutive form), \"Slabodka\", \"Slobidka\" (Ukrainian).\n\nSimilar settlements existed in Wallachia and Moldavia, called \"slobozie\" or \"slobozia\". The latter term is also the name of the capital city of Ialomiţa County in modern Romania, located in the historical region of Wallachia.\n\n"}

The artwork consists of fiberglass grids that sit upon a support system made of steel. The support system sits at varied heights. Visitors are welcome to walk on, sit, fish at and explore the structure, which is occasionally non-accessible due to flooding.\n\n\"Stratum Pier\" was created to appear as if it is an extension of the shoreline, exhibiting artist Kendall Buster's desire to merge \"the natural and the built environment.\" A visit to the structure allows one to view the cycles of erosion and growth in the 100 Acres environment, cycles that are represented in \"Stratum Pier\"s layered build. Fiberglass was chosen due to its light weight allowing it to easily sit in its present location and its durability which allows for heavy use by visitors to the park. Buster started to design the piece after a visit to the park and inspiration from the topographical maps created to document the parks environment. Buster expects the work to merge with the landscape as the grass and brush that surrounds the area grows into the work.\n\nBuster worked with architect Jeremy Olsen of Wheeler Kearns and project engineer Chris Rockey of Rockey Structures to create the piece. The artwork was commissioned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art and funded by a grant from The Indianapolis Foundation. In June 2010 Indianapolis based Motus Dance Theatre performed one day, every 45 minutes, on \"Stratum Pier\" in response to the installation and to celebrate the opening of the park.\n\nBefore pursuing fine art, Kendall Buster obtained her degree in medical technology, then moved on to earning her BFA at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. After receiving her MFA from Yale University she was involved in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Studio Program. Buster's work is described as \"biological architecture\" and resides in the collections of the Kreeger Museum, the Kemper Museum, Hirshhorn Museum, among others. She has been commissioned to create public art for the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Markel Corporation, the BOK Center, Nevada Museum of Art, and many others. In 2005 Buster was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in the Arts. Teaching at Virginia Commonwealth University, she lives and works in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n\n"}
