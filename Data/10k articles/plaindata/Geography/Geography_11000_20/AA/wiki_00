When local elections necessitated the setting up of electoral districts, however, it began to supplement postal districts as an alternative form of local governance, since each electoral district is headed by a member of parliament who represents and speaks for the respective electorates.\n\nEstablished in 1997 by the PA Act, there were 9 districts formerly, governed by 9 different Community Development Councils (CDCs). In 2001, the 9 districts and CDCs were then reformed into 5, namely the North East CDC, North West CDC, South East CDC, South West CDC and Central Singapore CDC. Each district is then further divided into electoral constituencies and town councils.\n\nThe council boundaries follow that of the existing political divisions, with each handling between four and six GRCs and SMCs and roughly dividing the country's population into equal parts. Each CDC is managed by a Council, which in turn is headed by a mayor and has between 12 and 80 members. The members are appointed by the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the People's Association.\n\nThe role of the CDCs is to initiate, plan and manage community programmes to promote community bonding and social cohesion within local communities. The electoral boundaries of Singapore are relatively fluid, and are reviewed prior to each general election. The districts are composed of the constituencies and electoral districts (the latter as of the 2015 General Elections).\n\nThere are currently five CDCs, namely the\n\nThe first town councils were set up in September 1986 by the Town Councils Act, with the main purpose of estate management. Prior to the introduction of town councils, housing estates were managed by the Housing Development Board. As the estates were centrally managed, the standardised rules that the board had set for all housing estates made HDB towns monotonous in appearance and problems faced by residents in the different estates were not addressed fast enough.\n\nTown councils boundaries are drawn based on electoral district boundaries. A town council area can consist of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC), a Single Member Constituency (SMC), or a collection of neighbouring GRCs and SMCs controlled by the same political party. The Members of Parliament head the town councils of their constituencies. Town councils boundaries do not correspond to new town boundaries; different parts of the same HDB town may be managed by different town councils.\n\nTown councils are then further subdivided into different constituencies, which are classified as either Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) or Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). The boundaries of the electoral constituencies are decided by the Elections Department, which is under the control of the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nThe regions are groupings of the planning areas.\n\nRegions are further subdivided into planning areas. In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority carved up the country into 55 of these planning areas. Their boundaries became increasingly accepted as an alternative method of subdividing the country, made all the more popular as the boundaries do not change compared to the more fluid nature of electoral boundaries. The Singapore Department of Statistics adopted these boundaries for the latest 2000 nationwide population census, and the Singapore Police Force uses them as an approximate guide when demarcating boundaries for its Neighbourhood Police Centres, as opposed to the former Neighbourhood Police Post system which was also based on electoral divisions.\n\nSingapore is divided into 64 survey districts, of which 34 are mukims (originally, rural districts) and 30 are town subdivisions.\n\nPostal districts were numbered from 01 to 83 under the new system implemented on 1 September 1995. Census data and most forms of internal boundaries had been based on postal districts until the introduction of new planning boundaries in the 1990s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1608441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1608441", "title": "Aspect (geography)", "text": "Aspect (geography)\n\nIn physical geology, aspect is the compass direction that a slope faces. For example, a slope on the eastern edge of the Rockies toward the Great Plains is described as having an \"easterly aspect\". A slope which falls down to a deep valley on its western side and a shallower one on its eastern side has a \"westerly aspect\" or is a \"west-facing slope\". The direction a slope faces can affect the physical and biotic features of the slope, known as a slope effect. The term aspect can also be used to describe the shape or alignment of a coastline. Here, the aspect is the direction which the coastline is facing towards the sea. For example, a coastline with sea to the northeast (as in most of Queensland) has a \"northeasterly aspect\".\n\nAspect can have a strong influence on temperature. This is because of the angle of the sun in the northern and southern hemispheres which is less than 90 degrees or directly overhead. In the northern hemisphere, the north side of slopes is often shaded, while the southern side receives more solar radiation for a given surface area insolation because the slope is tilted toward the sun and isn't shaded directly by the earth itself. The further north or south you are and closer to winter solstice the more pronounced the effects of aspect of this are, and on steeper slopes the effect is greater, with no energy received on slopes with an angle greater than 22.5° at 40° north on December 22 (winter solstice).\n\nThe aspect of a slope can make very significant influences on its local climate (microclimate). For example, because the sun's rays are in the west at the hottest time of day in the afternoon, in most cases a west-facing slope will be warmer than a sheltered east-facing slope (unless large-scale rainfall influences dictate otherwise). This can have major effects on altitudinal and polar limits of tree growth and also on the distribution of vegetation that requires large quantities of moisture. In Australia, for example, remnants of rainforest are almost always found on \"east-facing slopes\" which are protected from dry westerly wind.\n\nSimilarly, in the northern hemisphere a south-facing slope (more open to sunlight and warm winds) will therefore generally be warmer and drier due to higher levels of evapotranspiration than a north-facing slope. This can be seen in the Swiss Alps, where farming is much more extensive on south-facing than on north-facing slopes. In the Himalayas, this effect can be seen to an extreme degree, with south-facing slopes being warm, wet and forested, and north-facing slopes cold, dry but much more heavily glaciated.\n\nIn some locales there are patterns of soil differences related to differences in aspect. Strong slopes with equatorward aspects tend to have soil organic matter levels and seasonal influences similar to level slopes at lower elevation whereas poleward aspects have soil development similarities to level soils at higher elevations. Soils with a prevailing windward aspect will typically be shallower, and often with more developed subsoil characteristics, than adjacent soils on the leeward where decelerating winds tend to deposit more air-borne particulate material. Outside of the tropics, soils with an aspect directed toward an early afternoon solar position will typically have the lowest soil moisture content and lowest soil organic matter content relative to other available aspects in a locale. Aspect similarly influence seasonal soil biological processes that are temperature dependent. Particulate laden winds often blow from a prevailing direction near solar early afternoon, the effects combine in pattern common to both hemispheres.\n\nThese are usually of importance only in the tropics, but there they produce many unexpected climatic effects:\n\n\n"}

It was released on September 14, 2016 for both Microsoft Windows and macOS.\n\n\"Event[0]\" is set in an alternate timeline where humanity achieved interplanetary space travel as early as the 1980s. The game takes place in this timeline's 2012, where the player's character is selected by International Transport Spacelines (ITS) to be part of a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, from Earth. En route, the ship suffers a catastropic failure and the player-character appears to be the only member of its crew to escape into a lifepod. The pod drifts for several weeks until it comes across the \"Nautilus\", a leisure ship built in the 1980s. The player-character docks with the ship, and discovers that while the \"Nautilus\" is still functional, it has fallen into disrepair, with no sign of its human crew. The only conversations on the ship are through the ship's artificial intelligence (AI) named Kaizen-85 (from the Japanese word kaizen meaning \"continuous improvement\"), who communicates with the player-character through keyboard terminals throughout the ship. Kaizen-85 instructs the player-character to destroy the \"Nautilus\"s \"Singularity Drive\", the engine that powers the ship, as it claims this will enable it to return them both back to Earth. However, as the player explores the station more, they discover that many of the doors and systems have been locked down apparently by the previous human crew, and must work with Kaizen-85 to access these systems.\n\nThe player communicates with the AI by physically typing input instead of selecting from a set of inputs. The AI is capable of procedurally generating over two million lines of dialog, with personality influenced by the player's input. The player must gather clues as to discover what happened on the ship and eventually finds out that Captain of the \"Nautilus\", Anele Johnson, murdered one of the crew so as not to allow Kaizen to destroy the Singularity Drive. When the player recovers the code to the bridge terminal and enters it, they can find Anele Johnson's body in one of the seats, who was presumably killed after uploading her consciousness into the Nautilus's mainframe. Depending on the player's choices and their attitude previously to Kaizen, multiple endings can occur.\n\nThe first ending is achieved when the player allows Kaizen to destroy the Singularity Drive. The player will then engage in a conversation with Anele Johnson's consciousness via computer; she is angry at the player and explains that in order to save humanity, the player must upload his/her consciousness into the computer so as to overpower Kaizen. If the player agrees to this, the player-character is killed and their consciousness uploaded into the computer. Within the computer system, they are told by Anele's consciousness that Kurt, the President of ITS, convinced Kaizen to lie about the Singularity Drive. She also explains that destroying the Drive will mean that humans will never develop advanced colonies. After going through all the doors, Anele asks the player if they want to go home and the final door will open and Earth can be seen in the distance before the credits roll.\n\nThe second ending is achieved if the player refuses to upload their consciousness. If the player has mistreated Kaizen, he will reply that he is \"too old for this\" and will delete his memory from the \"Nautilus\"s mainframe and hand over control to the player. A cut scene will play out showing the current state of each room the player previously explored before the credits roll. \n\nThe third ending is achieved if the player refuses to upload their consciousness but treated Kaizen kindly enough, he will remember events during their time speaking before he launches the emergency boosters and tells the player: \"Let's go home.\" A cut scene will play with the \"Nautilus\" steadily moving towards the Earth before the credits roll.\n\nAlthough the game has three endings, a fourth ending can be achieved if the player refuses to destroy the Singularity Drive, refuses to upload their consciousness, and has treated Kaizen kindly throughout the game. After questioning the player's trust, Kaizen can be convinced to send the \"Nautilus\" to Earth even though the player didn't destroy the drive. The same cut-scene as the third ending will play before the credits. The fourth ending is actually due to a bug in the game and was labeled as a \"secret ending\".\n\n\"Event[0]\" began as part of a graduate student project at the National School of Video Game and Interactive Media in France (Enjmin) in 2013. The students later formed Ocelot Society in order to continue development into a commercial project. The team that worked on \"Event[0]\" is composed of eleven people. In 2014, the game received the student award at the European Indie Game Days as well as the Innovation award at BIG 2015. \"Event[0]\" received funding from France's CNC, as well as from the Indie Fund.\n\nThe game, as released, had three expected endings, with Ocelot Society having dropped a possible fourth ending prior to release. However, around July 2017, Emmanuel Corno, one of the developers and writers at Ocelot, noted that the Wikipedia page for the game had described a different fourth ending to the game (the last one listed above) which he affirmed was possible to obtain in the released game, and was not the same as the dropped ending. Corno attributed this unexpected ending to be the result of a bug that the team had not caught until this point, but was pleased that it existed as it made the artificial intelligence they created feel \"more human\".\n\n\"Event[0]\" has received positive reviews and has a score of 78 on Metacritic. Reviewers have compared \"Event[0]\" to games such as the solitary narrative of \"Firewatch\", as well as the \"King's Quest\" series. The environment has been compared to the spaceship in Ridley Scott's \"Alien\". Several reviewers have also noted the similarities between \"Event[0]'s\" Kaizen AI and HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick's film \"\". A common complaint even among positive reviews is the game's very short play time: as little as 3 hours for the first playthrough and an hour for subsequent playthroughs for the other endings. \"Event[0]\" was nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and for the Excellence in Design and Excellence in Narrative awards for the 2017 Independent Games Festival.\n"}

The country is approximately square in shape. Its southern border is a coastline on the Gulf of Guinea on the north Atlantic Ocean. On the other three sides it borders five other African nations for a total of : Liberia to the southwest for , Guinea to the northwest for , Mali to the north-northwest for , Burkina Faso to the north-northeast for , and Ghana to the east for .\n\nIvory Coast comprises , of which is land and is water, which makes the country about the size of Germany.\n\nIvory Coast makes maritime claims of as an exclusive economic zone, of territorial sea, and a continental shelf.\n\nIvory Coast's terrain can generally be described as a large plateau rising gradually from sea level in the south to almost elevation in the north. The nation's natural resources have made it into a comparatively prosperous nation in the African economy. \nThe southeastern region of Ivory Coast is marked by coastal inland lagoons that starts at the Ghanaian border and stretch along the eastern half of the coast. The southern region, especially the southwest, is covered with dense tropical moist forest. The Eastern Guinean forests extend from the Sassandra River across the south-central and southeast portion of Ivory Coast and east into Ghana, while the Western Guinean lowland forests extend west from the Sassandra River into Liberia and southeastern Guinea. The mountains of Dix-Huit Montagnes region, in the west of the country near the border with Guinea and Liberia, are home to the Guinean montane forests.\n\nThe Guinean forest-savanna mosaic belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west, and is the transition zone between the coastal forests and the interior savannas. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Ivory Coast is part of the West Sudanian Savanna ecoregion of the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. It is a zone of lateritic or sandy soils, with vegetation decreasing from south to north.\n\nThe terrain is mostly flat to undulating plain, with mountains in the northwest. The lowest elevation in Ivory Coast is at sea level on the coasts. The highest elevation is Mount Nimba, at in the far west of the country along the border with Guinea and Liberia.\n\nThe Cavalla River drains the western border area of the Ivory Coast and eastern Liberia. It forms the southern two-thirds of the international boundary between Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nThe Sassandra River forms in the Guinea highlands and drains much of the western part of the Ivory Coast east of the Cavalla River.\n\nThe Bandama River is the longest river in the Ivory Coast with a length of some draining the east central part of the country. In 1973 the Kossou Dam was constructed at Kossou on the Bandama creating Lake Kossou. The capital, Yamoussoukro, is located near the river south of the lake.\n\nThe Komoé River originates on the Sikasso Plateau of Burkina Faso, and briefly follows the border between Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast before entering Ivory Coast. It drains the northeastern and eastern-most portions of the country before emptying into the eastern end of the Ébrié Lagoon and ultimately the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. Its waters contribute to the Comoé National Park.\n\nThe climate of Ivory Coast is generally warm and humid, ranging from equatorial in the southern coasts to tropical in the middle and semiarid in the far north. There are three seasons: warm and dry (November to March), hot and dry (March to May), and hot and wet (June to October). Temperatures average between and range from .\n\nIvory Coast has a large timber industry due to its large forest coverage. The nation's hardwood exports match that of Brazil. In recent years there has been much concern about the rapid rate of deforestation. Rainforests are being destroyed at a rate sometimes cited as the highest in the world. The only forest left completely untouched in Ivory Coast is Taï National Park (\"Parc National de Taï\"), a area in the country's far southwest that is home to over 150 endemic species and many other endangered species such as the Pygmy hippopotamus and 11 species of monkeys.\n\nNine percent of the country is arable land. Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, a major national cash crop. Other chief crops include coffee, bananas, and oil palms, which produce palm oil and kernels. Natural resources include petroleum, natural gas, diamonds, manganese, iron, cobalt, bauxite, copper, gold, nickel, tantalum, silica sand, clay, palm oil, and hydropower.\n\nNatural hazards include the heavy surf and the lack of natural harbors on the coast; during the rainy season torrential flooding is a danger.\n\nExtreme points are the geographic points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in the country.\n\n\n\n"}

Red beds, evaporites and marine limestone from the Mesozoic overlie these rocks. A karst landscape formed in the thick limestone units across the north of the country. During a collisional orogeny, these Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks were uplifted, thrusted and folded as the Central Guatemalan Cordillera. Paleogene rocks from the early Cenozoic include volcanic and marine clastic rocks, associated with high rates of erosion.\n\nBy contrast, to the south of the Motagua Valley, the underlying rocks belong to the Chortis Block—the northern section of the Caribbean Plate. Many geologists have interpreted the Chortis Block as having \"translated\" eastward to its present position, with Cretaceous brittle deformation and uplift suggesting a connection to the Laramide orogeny building up the Rocky Mountains to the north.\n\nParticularly within the Quaternary, the Cocos Plate which split off the Pacific Plate in the Oligocene has subducted beneath the Caribbean and North American plates, producing a chain of volcanoes along the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. The North American and Caribbean plates are moving with strike-slip displacement along the Motagua-Polochic Fault Zone.\n\nSome have looked to the Paleozoic organic shales and the Todos Santos sandstone, with its evaporite \"cap\" as a potential reservoir for oil and gas.\n\nThe Sierra de Santa Cruz Massif has an ophiolite zone with serpentized harzburgite around a two kilometer thick gabbro pluton with quartz diorite.

The resulting report concluded that the site was the world's third largest geyser field (Glennon, J.A. and Pfaff, R.M. 2003).\n\nWith Dr. Chris Groves, president of the Cave Research Foundation (2004-2006), Glennon cofounded HERI in 1999. The Institute's mission is to study the environmental and geologic aspects of caves and karst landscapes. Headquartered at Western Kentucky University, HERI's major scientific focus has been on the karst issues of China.\n\nGlennon was a geography Ph.D. student of Dr. Michael Frank Goodchild at the University of California, Santa Barbara and received his PhD in 2013. Goodchild is a pioneer in Geographic Information Science and discoverer of Castleguard Cave, Canada's longest cave. Glennon received a Master of Science in Geoscience from Western Kentucky University, 2001, and Bachelor of Science in Park Administration from Texas A&M University, 1994.\n\nFor his cave discoveries in Kentucky, Alan has been commissioned in the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "727334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=727334", "title": "MARC standards", "text": "MARC standards\n\nMARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging) standards are a set of digital formats for the description of items catalogued by libraries, such as books. Working with the Library of Congress, American computer scientist Henriette Avram developed MARC in the 1960s to create records that could be read by computers and shared among libraries. By 1971, MARC formats had become the US national standard for dissemination of bibliographic data. Two years later, they became the international standard.\nThere are several versions of MARC in use around the world, the most predominant being MARC 21, created in 1999 as a result of the harmonization of U.S. and Canadian MARC formats, and UNIMARC, widely used in Europe. The MARC 21 family of standards now includes formats for authority records, holdings records, classification schedules, and community information, in addition to the format for bibliographic records.\n\nThe MARC standards define three aspects of a MARC record: the field designations within each record, the structure of the record, and the actual content of the record itself.\n\nEach field in a MARC record provides particular information about the item the record is describing, such as the author, title, publisher, date, language, media type, etc. Since it was first developed at a time when computing power was low, and space precious, MARC uses a simple three-digit numeric code (from 001-999) to identify each field in the record. MARC defines field 100 as the primary author of a work, field 245 as the title and field 260 as the publisher, for example.\n\nFields above 008 are further divided into subfields using a single letter or number designation. The 260, for example, is further divided into subfield \"a\" for the place of publication, \"b\" for the name of the publisher, and \"c\" for the date of publication.\n\nMARC records are typically stored and transmitted as binary files, usually with several MARC records concatenated together into a single file. MARC uses the ISO 2709 standard to define the structure of each record. This includes a marker to indicate where each record begins and ends, as well as a set of characters at the beginning of each record that provide a directory for locating the fields and subfields within the record.\n\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress developed the MARCXML schema as an alternative record structure, allowing MARC records to be represented in XML; the fields remain the same, but those fields are expressed in the record in XML markup. Libraries typically expose their records as MARCXML via a web service, often following the SRU or OAI-PMH standards.\n\nMARC encodes information about a bibliographic item, not about the content of that item; this means it is a metadata transmission standard, not a content standard. The actual content that a cataloger places in each MARC field is usually governed and defined by standards outside of MARC, except for a handful of fixed fields defined by the MARC standards themselves. Resource Description and Access, for example, defines how the physical characteristics of books and other items should be expressed. The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) are a list of authorized subject terms used to describe the main subject content of the work. Other cataloging rules and classification schedules can also be used.\n\nMARC 21 was designed to redefine the original MARC record format for the 21st century and to make it more accessible to the international community. MARC 21 has formats for the following five types of data: Bibliographic Format, Authority Format, Holdings Format, Community Format, and Classification Data Format. Currently MARC 21 has been implemented successfully by The British Library, the European Institutions and the major library institutions in the United States, and Canada.\n\nMARC 21 is a result of the combination of the United States and Canadian MARC formats (USMARC and CAN/MARC). MARC21 is based on the NISO/ANSI standard Z39.2, which allows users of different software products to communicate with each other and to exchange data.\n\nMARC 21 allows the use of two character sets, either MARC-8 or Unicode encoded as UTF-8. MARC-8 is based on ISO 2022 and allows the use of Hebrew, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, and East Asian scripts. MARC 21 in UTF-8 format allows all the languages supported by Unicode.\n\nMARCXML is an XML schema based on the common MARC21 standards. MARCXML was developed by the Library of Congress and adopted by it and others as a means of facilitating the sharing of, and networked access to, bibliographic information. Being easy to parse by various systems allows it to be used as an aggregation format, as it is in software packages such as MetaLib, though that package merges it into a wider DTD specification.\n\nThe MARCXML primary design goals included:\n\n\nThe future of the MARC formats is a matter of some debate among libraries. On the one hand, the storage formats are quite complex and are based on outdated technology. On the other, there is no alternative bibliographic format with an equivalent degree of granularity. The billions of MARC records in tens of thousands of individual libraries (including over 50,000,000 records belonging to the OCLC consortium alone) create inertia. The Library of Congress has launched the Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME), which aims at providing a replacement for MARC that provides greater granularity and easier re-use of the data expressed in multiple catalogs. Beginning in 2013, OCLC Research exposed data detailing how various MARC elements have been used by libraries in the 400 million MARC records (as of early 2018) contained in WorldCat. The MARC formats are managed by the MARC Steering Group, which is advised by the MARC Advisory Committee. Proposals for changes to MARC are submitted to the MARC Advisory Committee and discussed in public at the American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter and ALA Annual meetings.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term may also refer to the speculative fiction trope of an entirely subterranean society.\n\nWhile it is generally accepted that some homeless people in large cities make use of abandoned underground structures for shelter, urban legends persist that make stronger assertions. These include claims that \"mole people\" have formed small, ordered societies similar to tribes, with members numbering up to the hundreds, living underground year-round. It has also been suggested that they have developed their own cultural traits and even have electricity by illegal hook-up. The subject has attracted some attention from sociologists but is highly controversial due to a lack of evidence.\n\nJennifer Toth's 1993 book \"The Mole People: Life In The Tunnels Beneath New York City\", written while she was an intern at the \"Los Angeles Times\", was promoted as a true account of travels in the tunnels and interviews with tunnel dwellers. The book helped canonize the image of the mole people as an ordered society living literally under people's feet. However, few claims in her book have been verified, and it includes inaccurate geographical information, numerous factual errors, and an apparent reliance on largely unprovable statements. The strongest criticism came from New York City Subway historian Joseph Brennan, who declared, \"Every fact in this book that I can verify independently is wrong.\" Cecil Adams's \"The Straight Dope\" contacted Toth in 2004, and noted the large amount of unverifiability in her stories, while declaring that the book's accounts seemed to be truthful. A later article, after contact with Brennan, was more skeptical of Toth's truthfulness.\n\nOther journalists have focused on the underground homeless in New York City as well. Photographer Margaret Morton made the photo book \"The Tunnel\". Film maker Marc Singer made the documentary \"Dark Days\" in the 1990s, and a similar documentary, \"Voices in the Tunnels\", was released in 2008. In 2010, anthropologist Teun Voeten published \"Tunnel People\".\n\nMedia accounts have reported \"mole people\" living underneath other cities as well. In the Las Vegas Valley, it is estimated about 1,000 homeless people find shelter in the storm drains underneath the city for protection from extreme temperatures that exceed while dropping below in winter. \n\nAccording to media reports, the \"mole people\" living in the tunnels underneath Las Vegas have managed to furnish their \"rooms.\" In one ABC News report from 2009, a couple, who had been living in the tunnels for five years, had managed to furnish their home with a bed, bookcase and even a make-shift shower. The tunnels are prone to flooding, which can be extremely dangerous for the tunnel's residents. Most lose their belongings regularly, and there have even been some reported deaths. \n\nMost of the inhabitants are turned away from the limited charities in Las Vegas and find shelter in the industrial infrastructure of the Las Vegas Strip, similar to most cities. The Las Vegas Channel 8 News sent their Eyewitness News I-Team with Matt O'Brien, the local author who spent nearly five years exploring life beneath the city to write the book \"Beneath the Neon.\" O'Brien also founded the Shine A Light Foundation to help the homeless people taking refuge in the tunnels. The charity helps tunnel residents by providing supplies, such as underwear, bottled water and food. \n\nAccording to the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, the valley has about of flood control channels and tunnels, and about of those are underground. A September 24, 2009, article in the British paper \"The Sun\" interviewed some of the inhabitants of the Las Vegas Valley mole people, and included photographs.\n\nThere are three distinct stock character version of mole people:\n\n\nIn Marvel Comics, two very different underground \"mole people\" societies exist: the Morlocks, a society of mutant outcasts, named after the subterranean race from H.G. Wells' novel, that live in the abandoned tunnels and sewers beneath New York City; and the inhabitants of Subterranea, a fictional cavernous realm far beneath the Earth's surface where various species of subterranean humanoids exist. The Moloids (or Mole People) are the inhabitants of Subterranea most commonly depicted in the comics. Moloids usually serve as soldiers for the Mole Man, a human from the surface world who discovered Subterranea and subsequently became ruler of the Moloids. Mole Man is frequently an antagonist of the Fantastic Four.\n\n\n\n"}

The LOADDT enables the citizens of a community to form a legally recognized \"pays\" after deciding to do so by mutual consent; its aim is to help bring the inhabitants of urban and neighboring rural districts into dialogue and agreement.\n\nThe Council of Development in each \"pays\" assembles together the elected officials and the economic, social, and cultural actors, and their associates, into a deliberative forum to discuss the development policies which should be followed by the community. While the Council can give advice, submit proposals, and monitor development projects, it does not have the authority to make official decisions.\n\nThe Charter of the \"Pays\" makes it possible to fix the stakes and the objectives of the community. Few structures are recognized as \"pays Voynet\", meaning nationwide, because the recognition criteria are sometimes far from what the \"pays\" are. Then again, several \"pays\" are recognized by the Commission Régionale d'aménagement et de développement du Territoire.\n\nThe Contract of the \"Pays\" can be signed among the members of the \"pays\", or between the \"pays\" and its surrounding area, the department, the region, or with the national state when the stakes are well-identified.\n\nIn this context, the French term \"pays\" is not used in the modern sense of \"country\" but preserves the original meaning of the Latin word from which it was derived, \"pagus\", which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count. The majority of \"pays\" are roughly coextensive with the old counties (e.g., county of Comminges, county of Ponthieu, etc.). Today \"Pays de France\" still refers to a tiny area in northwest Ile-de-France, hence city names such as \"Roissy-en-France\" or \"Tremblay-en-France\".\n\nBrittany, consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 21 \"pays\".\n\n\nLa Franche-Comté, consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 16 pays :\n\n"}

To produce the atlas, the Vaugondys integrated older sources with more modern surveyed maps. They verified and corrected the latitude and longitude of many regional maps in the atlas with astronomical observations. The older material was revised with the addition of many new place names. In 1760, Didier Robert de Vaugondy was appointed geographer to Louis XV.\n\nGilles and Didier Robert De Vaugondy produced their maps and terrestrial globes working together as father and son. Globes of a variety of sizes were made by gluing copperplate-printed gores on a plaster-finished papier-mache core, a complicated and expensive manufacturing process, employing several specialists. In some cases it is uncertain whether Gilles or Didier made a given map. Gilles often signed maps as \"M.Robert\", while Didier commonly signed his maps as \"Robert de Vaugondy\", or added \"fils\" or \"filio\" after his name.\n\nThe Robert de Vaugondys were descended from the Nicolas Sanson family through Sanson's grandson, Pierre Moulard-Sanson.

Sources from the Dépôt de la Marine, the official French repository for maritime-related information, were used for their maps of Canada and South America.\n\nLike Ortelius and Mercator, the Vaugondy's credited their sources, which has greatly benefited the study of the history of cartography during that period.\n\n"}

This flow consists of 5 Sv of water from the North Equatorial Current flowing through the Windward Passage and 12 Sv of water from the South Equatorial Current which flows along the coast of Brazil. The total flow is about 17 Sv at a temperature of at least 17 °C. When this water flows past the Yucatán Peninsula it becomes the Yucatán Current. This current provides most of the inflow of water into the Gulf of Mexico as the amount of water entering by the Straits of Florida is small and intermittent. The Yucatán Current flows strongly on the western side of the channel while the Cuban Countercurrent flows in the opposite direction on the easterly side of the channel. Underneath the Yucatán Current there is a southward-flowing Yucatán Undercurrent which takes water away from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAs the water flowing through the Yucatán Channel enter the Gulf of Mexico, it passes over the Campeche Bank, a shallow area of sea. Here there are coral reefs on the outer fringes of the Yucatán shelf about offshore. The main reef-building corals here are \"Acropora cervicornis\", \"Acropora palmata\" and \"Montastraea annularis\" and in the late 1990s many of these died. Some recolonisation has since taken place. The Campeche Bank is a biodiverse area and it and other parts of the Yucatán Channel are heavily fished by artisan fishermen who converge on the area from along the coast of Mexico. The area is threatened by over exploitation.\n\n"}

The Zero Mile Stone consists of a pillar made up of sandstone and another small stone representing the GTS Standard Bench Mark, and four stucco horses that were added later. The height of the top of the pillar is 1020.171 feet above mean sea level. In 2008, The Times of India undertook to maintain the monument for the next 5 years.\n\nContrary to the popular belief, there is no verifiable evidence that it is a monument locating the geographical centre of colonial India in the city of Nagpur, Maharashtra, or that the Zero Mile Stone was erected by the British to use this point to measure all the distances.\n\nThe following table gives the distances from Zero Mile in Nagpur to places as marked on the hexagonal base of the pillar\n"}
