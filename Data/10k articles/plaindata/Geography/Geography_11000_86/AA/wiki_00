The largest island is Bougainville Island (also the largest of the Solomon Islands archipelago). The province also includes Buka Island and assorted outlying nearby islands including the Carterets. The capital is temporarily Buka, though it is expected that Arawa will be the permanent provincial capital. The population of the province is 249,358 (2011 census).\n\nBougainville Island is ecologically and geographically part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but is not politically part of the nation of Solomon Islands. Buka, Bougainville, and most of the Solomons are part of the Solomon Islands rain forests ecoregion. The region's biodiversity is heavily threatened by mining activities, mostly conducted by foreign investors.\n\nThe island was named after the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who made expeditions to the Pacific. He is also the namesake of the tropical flowering vines of the genus \"Bougainvillea\". In 1885, the island was taken over by a German administration as part of German New Guinea. Australia occupied it in 1914 during World War I. After the war the League of Nations designated it as a mandatory power and administered the island from 1918 until the Japanese invaded it in 1942 during World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, the island was occupied by Australian, American and Japanese forces. It was an important base for the RAAF, RNZAF and USAAF. On 8 March 1944, during the Pacific War, American forces were attacked by Japanese troops on Hill 700 on this island. The battle lasted five days, ending with a Japanese retreat.\n\nAustralia took over administration of the island when that war ended in 1945, managing it until Papua New Guinea independence in 1975. Bougainville was appointed as a United Nations mandatory power, Australia having accepted dominion sovereignty under the Statute of Westminster 1931 in the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 and therefore being formally empowered to do so. It administered British and German New Guinea, but was not the official colonial power.\n\nThe island is rich in copper and gold. A large mine was established at Panguna in the early 1970s by Bougainville Copper Limited, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. Disputes by regional residents with the company over adverse environmental impacts, failure to share financial benefits, and negative social changes brought by the mine resulted in a local revival for a secessionist movement that had been dormant. Activists proclaimed the independence of Bougainville (Republic of North Solomons) in 1975 and in 1990, but both times government forces suppressed the separatists.\n\nIn 1988, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) increased their activity significantly. Prime Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu ordered the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) to put down the rebellion, and the conflict escalated into a civil war. The PNGDF retreated from permanent positions on Bougainville in 1990, but continued military action. The conflict involved pro-independence and loyalist Bougainvillean groups as well as the PNGDF. The war claimed an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 lives.\n\nIn 1996, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan hired Sandline International, a private military company previously involved in supplying mercenaries in the civil war in Sierra Leone, to put down the rebellion. The Sandline affair was a controversial incident that resulted from use of these mercenary troops.\n\nThe Bougainville conflict ended in 1997, after negotiations brokered by New Zealand. A peace agreement was completed in 2000 and, together with disarmament, provided for the establishment of an Autonomous Bougainville Government. The parties agreed to have a referendum in the future on whether the island should become politically independent.\n\nElections for the first autonomous government were held in May and June 2005; Joseph Kabui, an independence leader, was elected President. He died in office on 6 June 2008. After interim elections to fill the remainder of his term, John Momis was elected as president in 2010 for a five-year term. He supports autonomy within a relationship with the national government of Papua New Guinea.\n\nOn 25 July 2005 rebel leader Francis Ona died after a short illness. A former surveyor with Bougainville Copper, Ona was a key figure in the secessionist conflict and had refused to formally join the island's peace process.\n\nIn 2015 Australia announced it will establish a diplomatic post in Bougainville for the first time.\n\nPresident John Momis confirmed that Bougainville will hold an independence referendum some time before 2020 once the region has resolved some remaining issues. The governments of both Bougainville and Papua New Guinea have set a tentative date of June 15, 2019 for the vote, which is the final step in the Bougainville Peace Agreement. However, certain criteria on Bougainville's part must be met before any vote can occur, including having a viable economy and controlling the flow of illegal weapons. As of September 27, 2017, none of these prerequisites have been met, with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill expressing doubt that such conditions will be met before the target date of the referendum. Australian Strategic Policy Institute analyst Karl Claxton said there is a wide expectation Bougainville will vote to become independent.\n\nA small percentage of the region's economy is from mining. Majority of economic growth comes from agriculture and aquaculture. The region's biodiversity, which is one of the most important in Oceania, is heavily threatened by mining activities, mostly conducted by the rich bracket of society. Mining activities have caused civil unrest in the region many times. In January 2018, a moratorium on one mine was imposed by the Papua New Guinea government, in a bid to calm civil unrest against mining in the region.\n\nEach province in Papua New Guinea has one or more districts, and each district has one or more Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards, and those into census units.\n\nBougainville has been headed by several different types of administration: a decentralised administration headed by a Premier (as North Solomons Province from 1975 to 1990), an appointed administrator during the height of the Bougainville Civil War (from 1990 to 1995), a Premier heading the Bougainville Transitional Government (from 1995 to 1998), the co-chairmen of the Bougainville Constituent Assembly (1999), a Governor heading a provincial government as in other parts of Papua New Guinea (2000 to 2005) and the Autonomous Bougainville Government (since 2005).\n\n\n\n"}

Its creation was proposed after the establishment of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939. However, due to the Axis occupation and partition of Yugoslavia in 1941 (see World War II in Yugoslavia), the proposal was never implemented.\n\nThe creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939–40 had been negotiated between Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and Croatian leader Vladko Maček (of the HSS) in March–August 1939, and settled through an agreement on 26 August. \"Croatia\" now became the only \"banovina\" constituted on the principle of nationality, named after the majority people (with only a minority left outside it), and thus was close to a nation-state. The agreement had little support from Serbian political parties, and the Serbian Orthodox Church and Yugoslav Army opposed it. Relations between Croatian and Serbian politicians (and Croats and Serbs) strained. Its creation opened the question of the political status of the Serb people (\"the Serbian question\") in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, with some Serb intellectuals (notably the members of the Serbian Cultural Club) and politicians (including some members of the Yugoslav government, such as Dragiša Cvetković) proposed and planned the creation of the Serbian Banovina, which would include the territory of the existing banovinas of Vrbas, Drina, Danube, Morava, Zeta and Vardar. The Banovina of Croatia included a notable Serb population, while the Serbian Banovina would similarly include a notable non-Slavic population. The plans were affirmed in the February 1940 number of \"Glas\". It was stated that apart from the Banovina of Croatia, only the Serbian Banovina and Banovina of Slovenia had the right to exist. The organization of the proposed banovina was supposed to be similar to that of Croatia.\n\nAccording to 1931 Yugoslav census, the existing banovinas that, according to the proposal, would be included into the Banovina of Serbia had the following population:\n\n\n"}

She was launched in 1912 from Sandefjord in Norway and was crushed by ice, causing her to sink three years later in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica.\n\nDesigned by Ole Aanderud Larsen, \"Endurance\" was built at the Framnæs shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway and fully completed on 17 December 1912. She was built under the supervision of master wood shipbuilder Christian Jacobsen, who was renowned for insisting that all men in his employment were not just skilled shipwrights but also be experienced in seafaring aboard whaling or sealing ships. Every detail of her construction had been scrupulously planned to ensure maximum durability: for example, every joint and fitting was cross-braced for maximum strength.\n\nThe ship was launched on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened \"Polaris\" (eponymous with Polaris, the North Star). She was long, with a beam and measured 348 tons gross. Her original purpose was as an ice-capable steam yacht, to provide luxurious accommodation for small tourist and hunting parties in the Arctic. As launched she had 10 passenger cabins, a spacious dining saloon and galley (with accommodation for two cooks), a smoking room, a darkroom to allow passengers to develop photographs, electric lighting and even a small bathroom. \n\nThough her hull looked from the outside like that of any other vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of , while its sides were between and thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of oak and Norwegian fir up to thick, sheathed in greenheart, a notably strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of .\nOf her three masts, the forward one was square-rigged, while the after two carried fore and aft sails, like a schooner. As well as sails, \"Endurance\" had a coal-fired steam engine capable of speeds up to .\n\nBy the time of launch on 17 December 1912, \"Endurance\" was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the possible exception of \"Fram\", the vessel used by Fridtjof Nansen and later by Roald Amundsen. However, there was one major difference between the ships. \"Fram\" was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her it would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. By contrast \"Endurance\" was designed with great inherent strength in her hull to resist collision with ice floes and to break through pack ice by ramming and crushing. However she was not intended to be frozen into heavy pack ice, and so was not designed to rise out of a crush. In such a situation she was dependent on the ultimate strength of her hull alone.\n\nAs \"Endurance\" was built for Adrien de Gerlache and Lars Christensen, they intended to use her for polar cruises for tourists to hunt polar bears. Financial problems led to de Gerlache pulling out of their partnership, leaving Christensen unable to pay the Framnaes yard the final amounts to hand over and fit out the ship. For over a year Christensen attempted to sell the ship as her unique design as an ice-capable passenger-carrying ship, with relatively little space for stores and no cargo hold made her useless to the whaling industry. Meanwhile she was too big, slow and uncomfortable to be a private steam yacht. In the event Christensen was happy to sell the ship to Ernest Shackleton for GB£11,600, which represented a significant loss to him as it barely covered the outstanding payments to Framnaes, let alone the ship's total build costs. He is reported to have said he was happy to take the loss in order to further the plans of an explorer of Shackleton's stature . After Shackleton purchased the ship, she was rechristened \"Endurance\" after the Shackleton family motto \"Fortitudine vincimus\" (By endurance we conquer).\n\nShackleton had the ship relocated from Norway to London. She arrived at the Millwall Dock in the spring of 1914 where she was refitted and modified for expedition purposes. She was stripped of most of her luxurious accommodation and fittings. This included removing many of the passenger cabins to make room for space for stores and equipment, while the crew cabins on the lower deck were removed and converted into a cargo hold - the reduced crew of sailors that Shackleton would take on the expedition would make their quarters in the cramped forecastle. The darkroom remained in its original location ahead of the boiler. The refit also saw the ship repainted from her original white paint to a more austere (and visible amongst ice) black, and features such as gilt scrollwork on the bow and stern, were painted over. Despite her change of name she retained a large badge in the shape of a five-pointed star on her stern, which originally symbolized her name after the pole star. \n\nHer new equipment included four ship's boats. Two were 21-foot (6.4 meter) transom-built rowing cutters purchased secondhand from the whaling industry. The third was a larger 22.5-foot (6.85 meter) double-ended rowing whaleboat built for the expedition to specifications drawn up by Frank Worsley, \"Endurance's\" new captain. The fourth was a smaller motorboat. \n\nAfter her refit she made the short coastal journey to Plymouth.\n\nIn the previous 16 years, nearly two dozen wooden vessels had sailed to the icy seas of the far south. All had returned home but the \"Aurora\". Lloyd's of London and the Indemnity Marine Assurance Company had underwritten her hull, machinery and equipment for £15,000. Just before she sailed, \"The Times\" had reported that \"Hitherto the insurance of vessels taking part in Antarctic exploration has ceased at the last port touched, and \"Endurance\" will be the first vessel to be insured in the ice zone.\"\n\nThe Times had praised \"Endurance\" as \"built specially for work in Polar seas,\" adding that \"in an ice-coated sea there can be no turbulent waves which are the causes of so many disasters in warmer zones.\"\n\n\"Endurance\" sailed from Plymouth, England on 6 August 1914 and set course for Buenos Aires, Argentina. Shackleton remained in Britain, finalising the expedition's organization and for some last-minute fundraising. This was \"Endurance's\" first major voyage following its completion and amounted to a shakedown voyage. The trip across the Atlantic took more than two months. Built for the ice, her hull was considered by many of her crew too rounded for the open ocean. Shackleton took a steamer to Buenos Aires and caught up with his expedition a few days after \"Endurance's\" arrival.\n\nOn October 26, 1914 \"Endurance\" sailed from Buenos Aires to what would be her last port of call, the whaling station at Grytviken on the island of South Georgia, arriving on November 5. She left Grytviken on 5 December 1914 heading for the southern regions of the Weddell Sea.\n\nTwo days after leaving from South Georgia, \"Endurance\" encountered polar pack ice and progress slowed down. For weeks \"Endurance\" worked its way through the pack, averaging less than per day. By 15 January 1915 \"Endurance\" was within of her destination, Vahsel Bay. However, by the following day, heavy pack ice was sighted in the morning and in the afternoon a gale developed. Under these conditions it was soon evident progress could not be made, and \"Endurance\" took shelter under the lee of a large grounded berg. During the next two days, \"Endurance\" moved back and forth under the sheltering protection of the berg.\n\nOn 18 January the gale began to moderate and \"Endurance\" set the topsail with the engine at slow. The pack had blown away. Progress was made slowly until hours later \"Endurance\" encountered the pack once more. It was decided to move forward and work through the pack, and at 5:00 pm \"Endurance\" entered it. However, it was noticed that this ice was different from what had been encountered before. The ship was soon amongst thick but soft brash ice. The ship became beset. The gale now increased in intensity and kept blowing for another six days from a northerly direction towards land. By 24 January, the wind had completely compressed the ice in the whole Weddell Sea against the land. \"Endurance\" was icebound. All that could be done was to wait for a southerly gale that would start pushing, decompressing and opening the ice in the other direction. Instead, the days passed and the pack remained unchanged.\n\n\"Endurance\" drifted for months beset in the ice in the Weddell Sea. The changing conditions of the Antarctic spring brought such pressure that broke the hull of \"Endurance\" over the period from 27 October 1915, causing flooding of interior spaces. On the morning of 21 November 1915, \"Endurance\"'s superstructure began to break and her timbers began snapping and thus she had to be abandoned.\n\nThe crew remained on the ice for several more weeks, and when the ice pack broke up they used \"Endurance\"'s three lifeboats to reach Elephant Island. Twenty-two men waited while Shackleton and five others took the largest of the lifeboats, \"James Caird\", and sailed to South Georgia to obtain rescue for the rest of the crew. Shackleton arrived at the whaling station on South Georgia Island two weeks later, but because the whaling ships were not equipped to penetrate Antarctic sea ice it took Shackleton three months before he successfully approached Elephant Island in August 1916 and rescued the rest of his crew on his third attempted rescue mission.\n\nThe crew of \"Endurance\" in her final voyage was made up of the 28 men listed below:\n\nNationalities.\nAll the crew were born and resident in England before the expedition, except for the following:\nBlackborrow was originally refused a post aboard the vessel due to his young age and inexperience and decided to stow away, helped to sneak aboard by William Bakewell, a friend of his, and Walter How. When he was found Shackleton decided to make him a steward rather than leave him ashore at South Georgia. Blackborrow eventually proved his worth, earning the Bronze Polar Medal, and the honour of becoming the first human being ever to set foot on Elephant Island. His name is also the matter of some debate—it is sometimes spelled Percy, or Blackboro, or in other ways.\n\nIt is often said that Shackleton placed an advertisement in a newspaper reading:\n\nNo trace of the supposed advertisement has come to light.\n\nAlfred Lansing wrote a book titled \"\" about the ordeal that Shackleton and his men endured aboard the ship. It became a bestseller when first published in 1959. \n\nTwo Antarctic patrol ships of the British Royal Navy have been named \"Endurance\" in honour of Shackleton's ship. The first , launched in May 1956 and awarded pennant number A171 sometime later, acted as an ice patrol and hydrographic survey ship until 1986. The second was bought from Norway in 1992 where she was named MV \"Polar Circle\". She suffered severe flooding in 2008 due to procedural errors during maintenance and despite being returned to the UK was not repaired prior to being scrapped in 2016.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, an episode of the preeminent Australian fact-based comedy podcast \"Do Go On\" was released wherein the details of \"Endurance\"s final voyage were discussed at great length. The discussion was helmed by David J. Warneke with Jess \"Bop\" Perkins and Matt Stewart also in attendance.\n\nIn 1998, wreckage found at Stinker Point on the south western side of Elephant Island was incorrectly identified as flotsam from the ship. However, it belonged to the 1877 wreck of the Connecticut sealing ship \"Charles Shearer\". In 2001, wreck hunter David Mearns unsuccessfully planned an expedition to find the wreck of \"Endurance\". By 2003, two rival groups were making plans for an expedition to find the wreck; however no expedition was actually mounted. In 2010, Mearns announced a new plan to search for the wreck. The plan is sponsored by the National Geographic Society but is subject to finding sponsorship for the balance of the US$10 million estimated cost. A 2013 study by Dr Adrian Glover of the Natural History Museum, London suggests the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could preserve the wreck on the seabed by keeping wood-boring \"ship worms\" away.\n\n\n"}

This makes SAR very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface, which is useful for environmental monitoring, earth resource mapping and military systems.\n\nSAR technology has provided terrain structural information to geologists for mineral exploration, oil spill boundaries on water to environmentalists, sea state and ice hazard maps to navigators, and intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and detecting information to military operations.\n\nConventional SAR systems are limited in that a wide swath can only be achieved at the expense of a degraded azimuth resolution. Since wide coverage swaths and high resolution output are both important, this poses challenges and contradicting requirements on the design of space-borne SAR systems and related new algorithms.\n\nState-of-the-art high-resolution SAR systems are rather limited with regarding to their acquisition capability.\nAn example is TerraSAR-X, which is a German Earth-Observation satellite. Its major payload is an X-band (3.1 cm) radar sensor, with different modes of operation, which allows it to provide multiple imaging modes for recording images with different swath width, resolution and polarizations, see the figure for more details. In stripmap mode (spatial resolution of 3m), it needs 10 weeks to map global Earth's landmass. This limitation also posed a challenge in the design of the TanDEM-X, which is the twin satellite of TerraSAR-X. Flying in close formation only a few hundred metres apart, the two satellites are imaging the terrain below them simultaneously but from different angles. It requires one year to achieve one global interferometric acquisition of the Earth's landmass for TanDEM-X.\n\nTo overcome this, some scientists propose Tandem-L mission, which is a prominent example. The Tandem-L mission concept is based on the use of two satellites that operate in L-band (24 cm wavelength), which has much longer wavelength compared to X-band. Longer wavelength allows it to fulfills the requirements for a tomographic measurement of the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and ice regions, also for large scale surveying of deformations with millimeter accuracy.\n\nThe future SAR missions may require a mapping capability one or even two orders of magnitude better than that of Tandem-L, whose goal is the investigation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. For this, an extremely powerful SAR instrument is required, capable of mapping the whole Earth's surface twice per week, in full polarization and with a spatial resolution well below 10 m. On the other hand, some other missions requires a much higher spatial resolution.\n\nGiven a single satellite, frequent and seamless coverage can only be achieved if a wide swath is imaged.\n\nThe swath width constrains the pulse repetition interval (PRI) or equivalently pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which equals to 1/PRI in the following way.\n\nIf the SAR sensor flying with speed formula_1, and there are two targets P and Q on the ground, the azimuth angle is calculated as formula_2. For small bandwidth SARs, the usual linear relation between azimuth frequency and angle with wavelength formula_3 is described as follows:\n\nformula_4\n\nIn order to optimize performance and control the range of ambiguities, the PRI must be larger than the time that it takes to collect returns from the entire illuminated swath. However, on the other hand, to avoid huge azimuth ambiguity levels, a large PRI implies the adoption of a small Doppler bandwidth and constrains the achievable azimuth resolution.\n\nOne example is the combination of displaced phase centers in azimuth with the low resolution ScanSAR or terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode.\n\nAs in classical ScanSAR, azimuth bursts are used to map several swaths. Innovative operation of multichannel SAR systems in burst modes is shown in the second image, where multichannel configurations with a single transmit (\"Tx\") antenna and several receiving (\"Rx\") antennas are considered, Tx and Rx can be realized on separate platforms as well as separately on the same platform or even integrated in the same antenna by transmit-and-receive (T/R) module technology.\n\nOne of the key steps is multichannel azimuth processing. A multichannel SAR in azimuth can be interpreted as a linear system of filter functions which characterize the individual apertures’ impulse responses in amplitude and phase in dependence on the Doppler frequency formula_5. A general system model is shown in the left.\n\nformula_6 characterizes the scene, while formula_7 is the azimuth impulse response of a single-aperture system, yieldingformula_8which gives the equivalent monostatic SAR signal. The functions formula_7 represent the channel between the transmitter (Tx) and each receiverformula_10 (Rx formula_10) with respect to the monostatic impulse response, resulting in the respective multichannel SAR signalformula_12. Assuming a single transmitter and several receiver channels, the physical along-track distance between Rx formula_10 and formula_14 is given by Δx, while λ represents the carrier wavelength, formula_15 represents the slant range, andformula_16 andformula_17represent the velocities of the sensor and the beam on ground, respectively.\n\nAfter reception, each signal is sampled in azimuth by the PRF, and hence, the maximum signal bandwidth is N⋅PRF according to the effective sampling rate. A compact characterization of the whole system is then given by the matrix formula_18, where one should note the dependence on the parameter PRF.\n\nAccording to a generalized sampling theorem, N independent representations of a signal, each subsampled at 1/N of the signal's Nyquist frequency, allow for the unambiguous \"reconstruction\" of the original signal from the aliased Doppler spectra of the N representations. This means that any bandlimited signal formula_19 is uniquely determined in terms of the responses formula_12 or, equivalently, by the respective functions formula_21. This is valid independently of the spatial sample distribution as long as the samples do not coincide in space. Then, the inversion of formula_18 yields a matrix formula_23that contains in its rows N functions formula_24 each representing the filter for the multichannel processing of channel formula_10\n\nformula_26\n\nThe original signal formula_8 is then recovered by filtering each channel formula_10 with its appropriate \"reconstruction\" filter formula_24 and subsequent coherent combination of all weighted receiver channels.The associated resolution loss from sharing the synthetic aperture among different swaths is compensated by collecting radar echoes with multiple displaced azimuth apertures.\n\nA possible drawback of multichannel ScanSAR or TOPS approaches is the rather high Doppler centroid, which is one of the most important parameters need to be estimated in computing SAR images. For some of the imaged targets, in case high resolution is desired. Moreover, high squint angles may also challenge co-registration in interferometric applications.\n\nBesides multichannel ScanSAR, concepts based on the simultaneous recording of echoes of different pulses, transmitted by a wide beam illuminator and coming from different directions, are of great interest.\n\nBecause it has following benefits: Multiple apertures that are displaced in along-track can acquire additional samples along the synthetic aperture and meanwhile they enable an efficient suppression of azimuth ambiguities. Moreover, by controlling a highly directive receiver beam following the radar pulse as it travels on the ground, multiple channels in elevation can improve the SNR (signal noise ratio) without reducing the swath width. Also, advanced multi-channel SAR architectures can avoid the use of separate Tx and Rx antennas and enable an increase of the coverage area without the necessity to either lengthen the antenna or employ burst modes.\n\nTo achieve these benefits, the receiving antenna usually is split into multiple sub-apertures, and each is connected to its individual receiver channels. Then, the digitally recorded sub-aperture signals are combined in a spatiotemporal processor to simultaneously form multiple independent beams and to gather additional information about the direction of the scattered radar echoes.\n\nAn alternative to a planar array is a reflector antenna in combination with a digital feed array, which is of special interest for low frequency radar systems operating in L- and P-band (1 m), combines the capabilities of digital beamforming with the high directivity of a large reflector antenna.\n\nThe reflector based architecture offers the potential to use all array elements simultaneously for the transmission of a broad beam without spill-over as desired for wide swath illumination.\n\nFor a paraboloidal reflector with a feed array close to the focal point, the signals which come from a given direction, usually correspond to only one or a very small subset of activated feed elements. And this property could reduce the implementation complexity and the costs of a digital beamforming radar.\n\nHowever, this method also has its drawback that is the presence of blind ranges across the swath, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting.\n\nAn interesting alternative to a planar antenna is a reflector, fed by a multichannel array. A parabolic reflector focuses an arriving plane wave on one or a small subset of feed elements. As the swath echoes arrive as plane waves from increasing look angles, one needs hence to only read out one feed element after the other to steer a high-gain beam in concert with the arriving echoes. A drawback of the multi-beam mode is the presence of blind ranges across the swath, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting.\n\nSeveral innovative techniques using multiple receive apertures (‘Rx’) have been suggested to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional SAR to perform HRWS imaging. For optimum performance the relation between sensor velocity formula_1 and the along-track offsets formula_31 of the formula_32 sub-apertures has to result in equally spaced effective phase centers thus leading to a uniform sampling of the received signal. This requires that optimal PRF equals toformula_33.\n\nIf a non-optimum PRF is chosen, the gathered samples are spaced non-uniformly. This requires a further processing step after down-conversion and quantization of the multi-aperture azimuth signal before conventional monostatic algorithms (such as the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA) and Chirp Scaling Algorithm (CSA)) can be applied. For this, the individual aperture signals are regarded as independent Rx channels (See lower figure,A/D stands for Analog to Digital Converter). The purpose of the azimuth processing is to combine formula_32 channels, each has a bandwidth of formula_35, sub-sampled with formula_36 to obtain a signal effectively sampled with formula_37, which achieve Nyquist criterion by averaging after the processing. So the output signal is free of aliasing in the optimum case.\n\nAs stated in the previous section, that for multi-beam modes, it has a disadvantage which is the presence of blind ranges across the swath, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting. The staggered-SAR can overcome this drawback by continuously varying the \"PRI\" in a cyclic manner, therefore allowing the imaging of a wide continuous swath without the need for a long antenna with multiple apertures.\n\nWhy this will work? Because in satellite SAR imaging, antenna length and required azimuth resolution set an upper bound to the selected \"PRI\". The \"PRI\", in turn, will limit the maximum continuous swath width in slant range, which is only slightly influenced by the uncompressed transmitted pulse length formula_38 . The continuous time interval that the radar echo can be received is upper bounded by the time interval between the end of a transmitted pulse and the beginning of next one, say formula_39. However, when the radar is transmitting, the device cannot receive radar echo, thus the radar can only receive a signal from targets that are included within formula_40. The difference between these two time intervals formula_38 causes the blind range area which is given by formula_42, where formula_43 is the speed of light in free space.\n\nIf the \"PRI\" is uniform, blind ranges will remain unchanged along azimuth, and after compression in azimuth, the image would have blind strips of width formula_42.If the \"PRI\" varies, although, the blind ranges still exist, but the position of these blind ranges also vary and will be different for each transmitted pulse, because transmitted pulse are only related to the preceding transmitted pulses. So when the overall synthetic aperture is taken into consideration, it turns out that at each slant range, only some of the transmitted pulses are missing, thus it is possible to obtain a SAR image over a wide continuous swath. The figure on the right shows the location of blind range of both fixed \"PRI\" and varied \"PRI\".\n"}

{"id": "2286680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2286680", "title": "International Ice Patrol", "text": "International Ice Patrol\n\nThe International Ice Patrol is an organization with the purpose of monitoring the presence of icebergs in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and reporting their movements for safety purposes. It is operated by United States Coast Guard but is funded by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. As of 2011 the governments contributing to the International Ice Patrol include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\nThe organization was established in 1914 in response to the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\". The primary mission of the Ice Patrol is to alert any seacraft traveling the great circle shipping lanes between Europe and the major ports of the United States and Canada of the presence of any icebergs there. \n\nFrom the earliest journeys into the North Atlantic, icebergs have threatened vessels. A review of the history of navigation prior to the turn of the 20th century shows an impressive number of casualties occurred in the vicinity of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. For example, \"Lady of the Lake\" sank in 1833 with a loss of 215 people. Between 1882 and 1890, 14 vessels were lost and 40 seriously damaged due to ice. This does not include the large number of whaling and fishing vessels lost or damaged by ice. It took one of the greatest marine disasters of all time to arouse public demand for international cooperative action to deal with this marine hazard. This disaster, the sinking of the on 15 April 1912, was the prime impetus for the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.\n\nOn her maiden voyage from Southampton, England bound for New York, \"Titanic\" collided with an iceberg just south of the tail of the Grand Banks and sank in less than three hours. The loss of life was enormous with more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perishing. \"Titanic\", the brand new ship of the White Star Line, was the largest passenger liner of her time displacing 45,000 tons and capable of sustained speed in excess of . Loss of \"Titanic\" gripped the world with a sobering awareness of an iceberg's potential for tragedy. The sheer dimensions of the \"Titanic\" disaster created sufficient public reaction on both sides of the Atlantic to prod reluctant governments into action, producing the first Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention in 1914. \n\nAfter the \"Titanic\" disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the cruisers and to patrol the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the Navy could not spare ships for this purpose, so the Revenue Cutter Service (forerunner of the United States Coast Guard) assumed responsibility, assigning the USRC \"Seneca\" and USRC \"Miami\" to conduct the patrol.\n\nAt the first International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea, which was convened in London on 12 November 1913, the subject of patrolling the ice regions was thoroughly discussed. The convention signed on 30 January 1914, by the representatives of the world's various maritime powers, provided for the inauguration of an international derelict-destruction, ice observation, and ice patrol service, consisting of vessels, which should patrol the ice regions during the season of iceberg danger and attempt to keep the trans-Atlantic lanes clear of derelicts during the remainder of the year. Due primarily to the experience gained in 1912 and 1913, the United States Government was invited to undertake the management of the triple service, the expense to be defrayed by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation.\n\nThe second International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea was convened in London on 16 April 1929. Eighteen nations participated, all of which signed the final act on 31 May 1929. Because of the fear in the United States Senate as a result of ambiguities in Article 54 dealing with control, the 1929 convention was not ratified by the United States until 7 August 1936, and even then the ratification was accompanied by three reservations. At the same time, Congress enacted legislation on 25 June 1936, formally requiring the Commandant of the Coast Guard to administer the International Ice Observation and Ice Patrol Service (Chap. 807, para. 2 49 USC 1922) and describing in general fashion the manner in which this service was to be performed. With only minor changes, this remains today as the basic Coast Guard authority to operate the International Ice Patrol. Since 1929, there have been three SOLAS conventions (1948, 1960 & 1974). None of these have recommended any basic change affecting the Ice Patrol.\n\nEvery year since 1914, the United States Coast Guard and the International Ice Patrol lay a wreath from a ship or an aircraft at the site of the \"Titanic\" disaster on 15 April. The solemn ceremony is attended by the craft's crew and a dedication statement to the \"Titanic\" and her lost passengers is read.\n\nFrom its inception until the beginning of World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern ice limits. In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations in the vicinity of the Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, , was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time.\n\nFrom 1946 until 1966, the Ice Patrol offices, operations center and reconnaissance aircraft were based at the Coast Guard Air Detachment Argentia, Newfoundland during the ice season.\n\nDue to changing operational commitments and financial constraints the Coast Guard Argentia Air Detachment closed in 1966. Ice Patrol headquarters and operations center moved to Governors Island, New York where they remained until October 1983. \n\nToday the International Ice Patrol is located at the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in New London, Connecticut. The ice reconnaissance detachment, usually composed of eleven aircrew and four ice observers flying in a HC-130 aircraft, continues to work out of Newfoundland.\n\nThe Ice Patrol disseminates information on icebergs and the limit of all known sea ice via radio broadcast from the U.S. Coast Guard Communications Command (COMMCOM) located in Chesapeake, Virginia via Inmarsat Safetynet, and radio facsimile chart. Ice Patrol information is also available via http Internet access. 2002 changes to SOLAS requires ships transiting the region guarded by the Ice Patrol to use the services provided during the ice season.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21491730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21491730", "title": "Judea", "text": "Judea\n\nJudea or Judæa (; from , \"Yəhuda\", \"Yəhûḏāh\", , ; , , \"Yahudia\") is the ancient Hebrew and Israelite biblical, the exonymic Roman/English, and the modern-day name of the mountainous southern part of the region of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew name \"Yehudah\", a son of the Jewish patriarch Jacob/Israel, and Yehudah's progeny forming the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and later the associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively.\n\nAs a consequence of the Bar Kokhba revolt, in 135 CE the region was renamed and merged with Roman Syria to form \"Syria Palaestina\" by the victorious Roman Emperor Hadrian. A large part of Judea was included in Jordanian West Bank between 1948 and 1967 (i.e., the \"West Bank\" of the Kingdom of Jordan). The term \"Judea\" as a geographical term was revived by the Israeli government in the 20th century as part of the Israeli administrative district name Judea and Samaria Area for the territory generally referred to as the West Bank.\n\nThe name \"Judea\" is a Greek and Roman adaptation of the name \"Judah\", which originally encompassed the territory of the Israelite tribe of that name and later of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. Nimrud Tablet K.3751, dated c.733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name Judah (written in Assyrian cuneiform as Yaudaya or KUR.ia-ú-da-a-a).\n\nJudea was sometimes used as the name for the entire region, including parts beyond the river Jordan. In 200 CE Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius (\"Church History\" 1.7.14), described \"Nazara\" (Nazareth) as a village in Judea.\n\n\"Judea\" was a name used by English speakers for the hilly internal part of Palestine until the Jordanian rule of the area in 1948. For example, the borders of the two states to be established according to the UN's 1947 partition scheme were officially described using the terms \"Judea\" and \"Samaria\" and in its reports to the League of Nations Mandatory Committee, as in 1937, the geographical terms employed were \"Samaria and Judea\". Jordan called the area \"ad-difa’a al-gharbiya\" (translated into English as the \"West Bank\"). \"Yehuda\" is the Hebrew term used for the area in modern Israel since the region was captured and occupied by Israel in 1967.\n\nThe classical Roman-Jewish historian Josephus wrote (\"Wars\" 3.3.5): In the limits of Samaria and Judea lies the village Anuath, which is also named Borceos. This is the northern boundary of Judea. The southern parts of Judea, if they be measured lengthways, are bounded by a village adjoining to the confines of Arabia; the Jews that dwell there call it Jordan. However, its breadth is extended from the river Jordan to Joppa. The city Jerusalem is situated in the very middle; on which account some have, with sagacity enough, called that city the Navel of the country. Nor indeed is Judea destitute of such delights as come from the sea, since its maritime places extend as far as Ptolemais: it was parted into eleven portions, of which the royal city Jerusalem was the supreme, and presided over all the neighboring country, as the head does over the body. As to the other cities that were inferior to it, they presided over their several toparchies; Gophna was the second of those cities, and next to that Acrabatta, after them Thamna, and Lydda, and Emmaus, and Pella, and Idumea, and Engaddi, and Herodium, and Jericho; and after them came Jamnia and Joppa, as presiding over the neighboring people; and besides these there was the region of Gamala, and Gaulonitis, and Batanea, and Trachonitis, which are also parts of the kingdom of Agrippa. This [last] country begins at Mount Libanus, and the fountains of Jordan, and reaches breadthways to the lake of Tiberias; and in length is extended from a village called Arpha, as far as Julias. Its inhabitants are a mixture of Jews and Syrians. And thus have I, with all possible brevity, described the country of Judea, and those that lie round about it.\n\nJudea is a mountainous region, part of which is considered a desert. It varies greatly in height, rising to an altitude of 1,020 m (3,346 ft) in the south at Mount Hebron, southwest of Jerusalem, and descending to as much as 400 m (1,312 ft) \"below\" sea level in the east of the region. It also varies in rainfall, starting with about in the western hills, rising to around western Jerusalem (in central Judea), falling back to in eastern Jerusalem and dropping to around in the eastern parts, due to a rainshadow effect (this is the Judean desert). The climate, accordingly, moves between Mediterranean in the west and desert climate in the east, with a strip of steppe climate in the middle. Major urban areas in the region include Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gush Etzion, Jericho and Hebron.\n\nGeographers divide Judea into several regions: the Hebron hills, the Jerusalem saddle, the Bethel hills and the Judean desert east of Jerusalem, which descends in a series of steps to the Dead Sea. The hills are distinct for their anticline structure. In ancient times the hills were forested, and the Bible records agriculture and sheep farming being practiced in the area. Animals are still grazed today, with shepherds moving them between the low ground to the hilltops as summer approaches, while the slopes are still layered with centuries-old stone terracing. The Jewish Revolt against the Romans ended in the devastation of vast areas of the Judaean countryside.\n\nMount Hazor marks the geographical boundary between Samaria to its north and Judea to its south.\n\nThe early history of Judah is uncertain; the Biblical account states that the Kingdom of Judah, along with the Northern Kingdom, was a successor to a united Kingdom of Israel, but modern scholarship generally holds that the united monarchy is ahistorical. Regardless, the Northern Kingdom was conquered into the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 720 BCE. The Kingdom of Judah remained nominally independent, but paid tribute to the Assyrian Empire from 715 and throughout the first half of the 7th century BCE, regaining its independence as the Assyrian Empire declined after 640 BCE, but after 609 again fell under the sway of imperial rule, this time paying tribute at first to the Egyptians and after 601 BCE to the Neo-Babylonian Empire, until 586 BCE, when it was finally conquered by Babylonia.\n\nJudea is central to much of the narrative of the Torah, with the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob said to have been buried at Hebron in the Tomb of the Patriarchs.\n\nThe Babylonian Empire fell to the conquests of Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE.\nJudea remained under Persian rule until the conquest of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, eventually falling under the rule of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire until the revolt of Judas Maccabeus resulted in the Hasmonean dynasty of Kings who ruled in Judea for over a century.\n\nJudea lost its independence to the Romans in the 1st century BCE, by becoming first a tributary kingdom, then a province, of the Roman Empire. The Romans had allied themselves to the Maccabees and interfered again in 63 BCE, at the end of the Third Mithridatic War, when the proconsul Pompeius Magnus (\"Pompey the Great\") stayed behind to make the area secure for Rome, including his siege of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. Queen Alexandra Salome had recently died, and a civil war broke out between her sons, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. Pompeius restored Hyrcanus but political rule passed to the Herodian family who ruled as client kings. In 6 CE, Judea came under direct Roman rule as the southern part of the province of Iudaea, although Jews living in the province still maintained some form of independence and could judge offenders by their own laws, including capital offences, until c. 28 CE. The Province of Judea, during the late Hellenistic period and early Roman period was also divided into five conclaves: Jerusalem (ירושלם), Gadara (גדרה), Amathus (עמתו), Jericho (יריחו), and Sepphoris (צפורין), and during the Roman period had eleven administrative districts (toparchies): Jerusalem, Gophna, Akrabatta, Thamna, Lydda, Ammaus, Pella, Idumaea, Engaddi, Herodeion, and Jericho. Eventually, the Jewish population rose against Roman rule in 66 CE in a revolt that was unsuccessful. Jerusalem was besieged in 70 CE and much of the population was killed or enslaved.\n\nAnother 70 years later, the Jewish population revolted under the leadership of Simon bar Kokhba and established the last Kingdom of Israel, which lasted three years, before the Romans managed to conquer the province for good, at a high cost in terms of manpower and expense.\n\nAfter the defeat of Bar Kokhba (132–135 CE) the Roman Emperor Hadrian was determined to wipe out the identity of Israel-Judah-Judea, and renamed it Syria Palaestina. Until that time the area had been called \"province of Judea\" (Roman Judea) by the Romans. At the same time, he changed the name of the city of Jerusalem to \"Aelia Capitolina\". The Romans killed many Jews and sold many more into slavery; many Jews departed into the Jewish diaspora, but there was never a complete Jewish abandonment of the area, and Jews have been an important (and sometimes persecuted) minority in Judea since that time.\n\nThe Byzantines redrew the borders of the Land of Palestine. The various Roman provinces (Syria Palaestina, Samaria, Galilee, and Peraea) were reorganized into three diocese of Palaestina, reverting to the name first used by Greek historian Herodotus in the mid-5th century BCE: Palaestina Prima, Secunda, and Tertia or Salutaris (First, Second, and Third Palestine), part of the Diocese of the East. \"Palaestina Prima\" consisted of Judea, Samaria, the Paralia, and Peraea with the governor residing in Caesarea. \"Palaestina Secunda\" consisted of the Galilee, the lower Jezreel Valley, the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former Decapolis with the seat of government at Scythopolis. \"Palaestina Tertia\" included the Negev, southern Jordan—once part of Arabia—and most of Sinai with Petra as the usual residence of the governor. Palestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris. According to historian H.H. Ben-Sasson, this reorganisation took place under Diocletian (284–305), although other scholars suggest this change occurred later in 390.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51402", "title": "Low Countries", "text": "Low Countries\n\nThe Low Countries, the Low Lands (, ), or historically also the Netherlands (), is a coastal lowland region in northwestern Europe, forming the lower basin of the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt rivers, divided in the Middle Ages into numerous semi-independent principalities that consolidated in the countries of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, as well as today's French Flanders.\n\nHistorically, the regions without access to the sea have linked themselves politically and economically to those with access to form various unions of ports and hinterland, stretching inland as far as parts of the German Rhineland. It is why that nowadays some parts of the Low Countries are actually hilly, like Luxembourg and the south of Belgium. Within the European Union the region's political grouping is still referred to as the Benelux (short for Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg).\n\nDuring the Roman empire the region contained a militarised frontier and contact point between Rome and Germanic tribes. With the collapse of the empire, the Low Countries were the scene of the early independent trading centres, that marked the reawakening of Europe in the 12th century. In that period, they rivalled northern Italy as one of the most densely populated regions of Western Europe. Most of the cities were governed by guilds and councils along with a figurehead ruler; interaction with their ruler was regulated by a strict set of rules describing what the latter could and could not expect from them. All of the regions mainly depended on trade, manufacturing and the encouragement of the free flow of goods and craftsmen.\n\nDutch and French dialects were the main languages used in secular city life.\n\nHistorically, the term \"Low Countries\" arose at the Court of the Dukes of Burgundy, who used the term ' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ' (\"the lands over there\") for the Duchy of Burgundy and the Free County of Burgundy, which were part of their realm but geographically disconnected from the Low Countries. Governor Mary of Hungary used both the expressions ' and ' (\"lands down here\"), which evolved to \"\" or \"Low Countries\". Today the term is typically fitted to modern political boundaries and used in the same way as the term \"Benelux\".\n\nThe name of the country of the Netherlands has the same etymology and origin as the name for the region Low Countries, due to \"nether\" meaning \"low\". In the Dutch language itself \"De Lage Landen\" is the modern term for Low Countries, and \"De Nederlanden\" (plural) is in use for the 16th century domains of Charles V, the historic Low Countries, while \"Nederland\" (singular) is in use for the country of the Netherlands. However, in official use, the name of the Dutch kingdom is still Kingdom of the Netherlands, \" (plural). This name derives from the 19th-century origins of the kingdom which originally included present-day Belgium.\n\nIn Dutch, and to a lesser extent in English, the Low Countries colloquially means the Netherlands and Belgium, sometimes the Netherlands and Flanders—the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium. For example, a \" (\"Derby der Lage Landen\"), is a sports event between Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nBelgium separated in 1830 from the (northern) Netherlands. The new country took its name from \"Belgica\", the Latinised name for the Low Countries, as it was known during the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648). The Low Countries were in that war divided in two parts. On one hand, the northern Federated Netherlands or \"Belgica Foederata\" rebelled against the Spanish king; on the other, the southern Royal Netherlands or \"Belgica Regia\" remained loyal to the Spanish king. This divide laid the early foundation for the later modern states of Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nThe region politically had its origins in Carolingian empire; more precisely, most of the people in it was within the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia. After the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia, the Low Countries were brought under the rule of various lordships until they came to be in the hands of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. Hence, a large part of the low countries came to be referred to as the Burgundian Netherlands also called the Seventeen Provinces up to 1581. Even after the political secession of the autonomous Dutch Republic (or \"United Provinces\") in the north, the term \"low countries\" continued to be used to refer collectively to the region. The region was temporarily united politically between 1815 and 1839, as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nThe Low Countries were part of the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. They were inhabited by Belgic and Germanic tribes. In the 4th and 5th century, Frankish tribes had entered this Roman region and came to run it increasingly independently. They came to be ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, under which dynasty the southern part (below the Rhine) was re-Christianised.\n\nBy the end of the 8th century, the Low Countries formed a core part of a much expanded Francia and the Merovingians were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty. In 800, the Pope crowned and appointed Charlemagne Emperor of the re-established Roman Empire.\n\nAfter the death of Charlemagne, Francia was divided in three parts among his three grandsons. The middle slice, Middle Francia, was ruled by Lothair I, and thereby also came to be referred to as \"Lotharingia\" or \"Lorraine\". Apart from the original coastal County of Flanders, which was within West Francia, the rest of the Low Countries were within the lowland part of this, \"Lower Lorraine\".\n\nAfter the death of Lothair, the Low Countries were coveted by the rulers of both West Francia and East Francia. Each tried to swallow the region and to merge it with their spheres of influence. Thus, the Low Countries consisted of fiefs whose sovereignty resided with either the Kingdom of France (987–1498) or the Holy Roman Empire. While the further history the Low Countries can be seen as the object of a continual struggle between these two powers, the title of Duke of Lothier was coveted in the low countries for centuries.\n\nIn the 14th and 15th century, separate fiefs came gradually to be ruled by a single family through royal intermarriage. This process culminated in the rule of the House of Valois, who were the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy. During the height of Burgundian influence, the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods, notably early Netherlandish painting, which is the work of artists who were active in the flourishing cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Louvain, Tournai and Brussels, all in present-day Belgium.\n\nIn 1477 the Burgundian holdings in the area passed through an heiress—Mary of Burgundy—to the Habsburgs. The Low Countries were roughly divided into Seventeen Provinces. Charles V united the provinces into one indivisible territory, covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, while retaining existing customs, laws, and forms of government within the provinces. Therefore, Charles V introduced the title of \"Heer der Nederlanden\" (\"Lord of the Netherlands\"). Only he and his son could ever use this title.\n\nThe Pragmatic Sanction transformed the agglomeration of lands into a unified entity, of which the Habsburgs would be the heirs. By streamlining the succession law in all Seventeen Provinces and declaring that all of them would be inherited by one heir, Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity. After Charles' abdication in 1555, the Seventeen Provinces passed to his son, Philip II of Spain.\n\nThe Pragmatic Sanction is said to be one example of the Habsburg contest with particularism that contributed to the Dutch Revolt. Each of the provinces had its own laws, customs and political practices. The new policy, imposed from the outside, angered many inhabitants, who viewed their provinces as distinct entities. It and other monarchical acts, such as the creation of bishoprics and promulgation of laws against heresy, stoked resentments, which fired the eruption of the Dutch Revolt.\n\nAfter the northern Seven United Provinces of the seventeen declared their independence from Habsburg Spain in 1581, the ten provinces of the Southern Netherlands remained occupied by the Army of Flanders under Spanish service and are therefore sometimes called the Spanish Netherlands. In 1713, under the Treaty of Utrecht following the War of the Spanish Succession, what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria and thus became known as the Austrian Netherlands. \n\nThe United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830) temporarily united the Low Countries again, before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nDuring the early months of World War I (around 1914), The Central Powers invaded the Low Countries of Luxembourg and Belgium in what has been come to be known as the German invasion of Belgium. It led to the German occupation of the two countries. However, the German advance into France was quickly halted, causing a military stalemate for most of the war. In the end, a total of approximately 56,000 people were killed in the invasion.\n\nWorld War II started in the region when Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht forces turned their eyes west to France. The Low Countries were an easy route of getting around the feared French Maginot Line. Hitler ordered a conquest of the Low Countries to be executed at the shortest possible notice to forestall the French and prevent Allied air power from threatening the vital German Ruhr Area. It would also provide the basis for a long-term air and sea campaign against Britain. As much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied. Germany used its Blitzkrieg tactics and took out the countries in a matter of two weeks. \n\nBelgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were occupied from about May 1940 to about May 1945. During the occupation, their governments were forced to be exiled in Britain. In 1944, they signed the London Customs Convention, laying the foundation for the Benelux Economic Union, an important forerunner of the EEC (later the EU)..\n\nOne of the Low Countries' earliest literary figures is the blind poet Bernlef, from , who sang both Christian psalms and pagan verses. Bernlef is representative of the coexistence of Christianity and Germanic polytheism in this time period.\n\nThe earliest examples of written literature include the Wachtendonck Psalms, a collection of twenty five psalms that originated in the Moselle-Frankish region around the middle of the 9th century.\n\n"}

{"id": "245787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245787", "title": "Nogales, Sonora", "text": "Nogales, Sonora\n\nHeroica Nogales (), more commonly known as Nogales, is a city and the county seat of the Municipality of Nogales. It is located on the northern border of the Mexican state of Sonora. The city is abutted on its north by the city of Nogales, Arizona, across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe independent Nogales Municipality, which included the town of Nogales, was established on July 11, 1884. The Nogales Municipality covers an area of 1,675 km². Nogales was declared a city within the Municipality on January 1, 1920.\n\nThe international trade that existed between the two cities greatly propelled the economic development of Nogales, Sonora, and the greater Northern Sonora region, but that did not prevent significant problems from forming in the area after the outbreak of the 1910 Mexican Revolution.\n\nOn August 27, 1918, at about 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without being interrogated at the U.S. Customs house. After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the U.S. Border Patrol did not exist until 1924). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regimental soldiers and militia. Hostilities quickly escalated and several soldiers were killed and others wounded on both sides. The mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza was killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane.\n\nDue in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops it was claimed they led into battle. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales prior to the August 27, 1918 battle documented the departure of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels. Furthermore, an investigation by Army officials from Fort Huachuca, Arizona, could not substantiate accusations of militant German agents in the Mexican border community and instead traced the origins of the violence to the abuse of Mexican border crossers in the year prior to the Battle of Ambos Nogales. The main result of this battle was the building of the first permanent border fence between the two cities of Nogales. Though largely unheard of in the U.S. (and even within most of Mexico), the municipal leaders of Nogales, Sonora, successfully petitioned the Mexican Congress in 1961 to grant the Mexican border city the title of \"Heroic City\", leading the community's official name, Heroica Nogales, a distinction shared with the Sonoran cities of Guaymas, Caborca, and Ures, and a number of other cities in Mexico.\n\nEarly in March 1929, the Escobarista Rebellion exploded in Nogales, sponsored by Obregonistas, supporters of Mexican president Álvaro Obregón, who had been assassinated on July 17, 1928. General Manuel Aguirre, commanding the rebellious 64th Regiment, took power without firing a shot, causing \"federales\" from Naco to send a daily airplane to attack the rebels. It dropped a few bombs over Nogales without doing any damage, while the rebels fought back with machine guns from the roofs without doing any damage to the airplane. There was only one casualty, a woman who was scared by a bomb explosion and had a heart attack. That same month, a hooded man appeared at night driving a tank on Morley Street on the U.S. side, then entered Mexico to help the \"federales\" in Naco. It seems that the tank had been bought in 1927 for fighting the Yaquis, but U.S. officials prohibited it from leaving the U.S., and it had been kept in a warehouse in Nogales, Arizona.\n\nNogales has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen \"Csa\"), with warm summers and cool winters, often presenting freezing temperatures.\n\n, the census reported that the City of Nogales had a population of 159,103 people, representing approximately 50% growth from 1990. By the 2005 census the official population of the city was 189,759, and that of Nogales Municipality was 193,517. At the latest census in 2010, the official numbers were 212,533 for the City of Nogales, and 220,292 for the Municipality.\n\nThe city and the municipality both rank third in the state in population, after Hermosillo and Ciudad Obregón. The municipality includes many outlying but small rural communities. The only other localities with over 1,000 inhabitants are La Mesa (2,996) and Centro de Readaptación Social Nuevo (2,203) . Nogales is served by Nogales International Airport.\n\nThe population growth is in part due to the influx of industry that has come since the opening of the maquiladora industry through the National Industrialization Program, decades before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the 90s, this economic context was, in part, held by an important Sonora state social policy by the Secretary of Urban Infrastructure and Ecology, Vernon Perez Rubio, accomplishing the city´s total coverage on drinking water, with a 20-year guaranteed service. Manufacturing now accounts for 55% of the city's gross domestic product, and services are growing as well, most of this caused by the growing jobs in the city.\n\nNogales is known for its recent enormous population growth which covers the hills along the central narrow north-south valley. Dispersed among the houses, the visitor will find a mixture of factories, stores, etc. In 2006, the southern half of the city experienced a modern urbanization development including shopping malls, wide avenues, and modern housing conglomerations.\n\nAt the center of Nogales, there is the Plaza de Benito Juárez. Here there is a statue with two leading figures designed by Spanish sculptor Alfredo Just. This is a tribute to Mexican President Benito Juárez, and the other is the \"Monument to Ignorance\", where a naked man who represents the Mexican people is fighting with a winged creature that represents ignorance.\n\nThe primary commercial artery is Mexico Federal Highway 15, which links the state with the U.S. as well as major cities in Mexico.\n\nIn aviation, the city is served by the Aeropuerto internacional de Nogales, which, had no commercial airline service.\n\nDue to its location, Nogales is one of the most important ports of entry for U.S. tourists. The downtown area consists of bars, strip clubs, hotels, restaurants, and a large number of curio stores, which sell a large variety of artesanias (handicrafts, leather art, handmade flowers, clothes) brought from the deeper central and southern states of Mexico. Local dishes commonly available in restaurants include many types of antojitos (Mexican food) such as enchiladas, tacos, burritos with carne machaca (dried meat), menudo and tamales.\n\nMaquiladoras, or manufacturing plants, employ a large percentage of the population. Nogales' proximity to the U.S. and the abundance of inexpensive labor make it an efficient location for foreign companies to have manufacturing and assembly operations. Some of the companies that have established maquiladoras in Nogales include: Continental AG, The Chamberlain Group, Walbro, General Electric.\n\nApproximately 92 establishments produce foreign exports. Sixty-five of these establishments are located in seven industrial parks, which employ approximately 25,400 workers, around 50 percent of the total employed population of the municipality. Also important to the economy is livestock for both foreign export and cattle breeding.\n\nProduce is one of Mexico's largest exports to the United States and the Mariposa Port of entry, at Nogales, is the most widely used route for produce destined for the U.S. It is estimated that over 80 percent of Americas produce passes through Nogales each year. The produce industry requires facilities for the storage, packing, transport and logistics of these goods and provides many with employment on both sides of the border.

It was invented by Ernst Schmidt, a Swiss engineer.\nThe hammer measures the rebound of a spring-loaded mass impacting against the surface of a sample. The test hammer hits the concrete at a defined energy. Its rebound is dependent on the hardness of the concrete and is measured by the test equipment. By reference to a conversion chart, the rebound value can be used to determine the concrete's compressive strength. When conducting the test, the hammer should be held at right angles to the surface, which in turn should be flat and smooth. The rebound reading will be affected by the orientation of the hammer: when used oriented upward (for example, on the underside of a suspended slab), gravity will increase the rebound distance of the mass, and vice versa for a test conducted on a floor slab. Schmidt hammer measurements are on an arbitrary scale ranging from 10 to 100. \n\nSchmidt hammers are available from manufacturers in several different energy ranges, including (i) Type L-0.735 Nm impact energy, (ii) Type N-2.207 Nm impact energy, and (iii) Type M-29.43 Nm impact energy.\n\nThe test is also sensitive to other factors:\n\nPrior to testing, the Schmidt hammer should be calibrated using a calibration test anvil supplied by the manufacturer. Twelve readings should be taken, dropping the highest and lowest, and then taking the average of the ten remaining. This method of testing is classed as indirect as it does not give a direct measurement of the strength of the material. It simply gives an indication based on surface properties, and as such is suitable only for making comparisons between samples. \n\nThis method for testing concrete is governed by ASTM C805.

{"id": "28894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28894", "title": "Scottish Highlands", "text": "Scottish Highlands\n\nThe Highlands (; , \"the place of the Gaels\") is a historic region of Scotland. Culturally, the Highlands and the Lowlands diverged from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \"\" literally means \"the place of the Gaels\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.\n\nThe area is very sparsely populated, with many mountain ranges dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles, Ben Nevis. Before the 19th century the Highlands was home to a much larger population, but from \"circa\" 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the USA and Australia) and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England. The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe. At 9.1 per km (23.6 per square mile) in 2012, the population density in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland's as a whole, comparable with that of Bolivia, Chad and Russia.\n\nThe Highland Council is the administrative body for much of the Highlands, with its administrative centre at Inverness. However, the Highlands also includes parts of the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire. \n\nThe Scottish highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the taiga biome as it features concentrated populations of Scots pine forest: see Caledonian Forest.\n\nBetween the 15th century and the 20th century, the area differed from most of the Lowlands in terms of language. In Scottish Gaelic, the region is known as the \"\", because it was traditionally the Gaelic-speaking part of Scotland, although the language is now largely confined to The Hebrides. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably but have different meanings in their respective languages. Scottish English (in its Highland form) is the predominant language of the area today, though Highland English has been influenced by Gaelic speech to a significant extent. Historically, the \"Highland line\" distinguished the two Scottish cultures. While the Highland line broadly followed the geography of the Grampians in the south, it continued in the north, cutting off the north-eastern areas, that is Caithness, Orkney and Shetland, from the more Gaelic Highlands and Hebrides.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jacobite risings, the British government enacted a series of laws to try to speed up the destruction of the clan system, including bans on the bearing of arms and the wearing of tartan, and limitations on the activities of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Most of this legislation was repealed by the end of the 18th century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a rehabilitation of Highland culture. Tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British Army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers in the era of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815). Tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region, but in the 1820s, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe. The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the Ossian cycle, and further popularised by the works of Walter Scott. His \"staging\" of the visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish woollen industry. Individual clan tartans were largely designated in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity. This \"Highlandism\", by which all of Scotland was identified with the culture of the Highlands, was cemented by Queen Victoria's interest in the country, her adoption of Balmoral as a major royal retreat, and her interest in \"tartenry\".\n\nThe Highlands before 1800 were very poor and traditional, and were not much affected by the uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution that was sweeping the Lowlands of Scotland. The period of the Napoleonic wars brought prosperity, optimism, and economic growth to the Highlands. The economy grew thanks to wages paid in industries such as kelping (in which kelp was burned for the useful chemicals obtained from the ashes), fisheries, and weaving, as well as large-scale infrastructure spending such as the Caledonian Canal project. On the East Coast, farmlands were improved, and high prices for cattle brought money to the area. Service in the Army was also attractive to young men from the Highlands, who sent pay home and retired there with their army pensions. This prosperity ended after 1815, and long-term negative factors began to undermine the economic position of the poor tenant farmers, who typically rented a few acres, and were known as crofters. Landowners were increasingly market-oriented in the century after 1750, and this tended to dissolve the traditional social and economic structure of the North-West Highlands and the Hebrides, causing great disruption for the crofters. The Highland Clearances and the end of the township system followed changes in land ownership and tenancy and the replacement of cattle by sheep. The Great Irish Famine of the 1840s was caused by a plant disease that reached the Highlands in 1846, causing great distress. \n\nThe unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional and controversial subject, of enormous importance to the Highland economy, and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The poor crofters were politically powerless, and many of them turned to religion. They embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian revival after 1800. Most joined the breakaway \"Free Church\" after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. The religious change energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords; it helped prepare them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the Highland Land League.\nViolence erupted, starting on the Isle of Skye, when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quietened when the government stepped in, passing the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless. This contrasted with the Irish Land War under way at the same time, where the Irish were intensely politicised through roots in Irish nationalism, while political dimensions were limited. In 1885 three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, which listened to their pleas. The results included explicit security for the Scottish smallholders; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants; and the creation of a Crofting Commission. The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the Liberal Party gained their votes.\n\nThe Scottish Reformation achieved partial success in the Highlands. Roman Catholicism remained strong in some areas, owing to remote locations and the efforts of Franciscan missionaries from Ireland, who regularly came to celebrate Mass. Although the presence of Roman Catholicism has faded, there remain significant Catholic strongholds within the Highlands and Islands such as Moidart and Morar on the mainland and South Uist and Barra in the southern Outer Hebrides. \nThe remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw somewhat greater success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society after the Battle of Culloden in 1746. In the 19th century, the evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.\n\nFor the most part, however, the Highlands are considered predominantly Protestant, loyal to the Church of Scotland. In contrast to the Catholic southern islands, the northern Outer Hebrides islands (Lewis, Harris and North Uist) have an exceptionally high proportion of their population belonging to the Protestant Free Church of Scotland or the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The Outer Hebrides have been described as the last bastion of Calvinism in Britain and the Sabbath remains widely observed. Inverness and the surrounding area has a majority Protestant population, with most locals belonging to either The Kirk or the Free Church of Scotland. The church maintains a noticeable presence within the area, with church attendance notably higher than in other Scottish cities. Religion continues to play an important role in Highland culture, with Sabbath observance still widely practised, particularly in the Hebrides.\n\nIn traditional Scottish geography, the Highlands refers to that part of Scotland north-west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which crosses mainland Scotland in a near-straight line from Helensburgh to Stonehaven. However the flat coastal lands that occupy parts of the counties of Nairnshire, Morayshire, Banffshire and Aberdeenshire are often excluded as they do not share the distinctive geographical and cultural features of the rest of the Highlands. The north-east of Caithness, as well as Orkney and Shetland, are also often excluded from the Highlands, although the Hebrides are usually included. The Highland area, as so defined, differed from the Lowlands in language and tradition, having preserved Gaelic speech and customs centuries after the anglicisation of the latter; this led to a growing perception of a divide, with the cultural distinction between Highlander and Lowlander first noted towards the end of the 14th century. In Aberdeenshire, the boundary between the Highlands and the Lowlands is not well defined. There is a stone beside the A93 road near the village of Dinnet on Royal Deeside which states 'You are now in the Highlands', although there are areas of Highland character to the east of this point.\n\nA much wider definition of the Highlands is that used by the Scotch Whisky industry. Highland Single Malts are produced at distilleries north of an imaginary line between Dundee and Greenock, thus including all of Aberdeenshire and Angus.\n\nInverness is traditionally regarded as the capital of the Highlands, although less so in the Highland parts of Aberdeenshire, Angus, Perthshire and Stirlingshire which look more to Aberdeen, Perth, Dundee and Stirling as their commercial centres. Under some of the wider definitions in use, Aberdeen could be considered the largest city in the Highlands, although it does not share the recent Gaelic cultural history typical of the Highlands proper.\n\nThe Highland Council area, created as one of the local government regions of Scotland, has been a unitary council area since 1996. The council area excludes a large area of the southern and eastern Highlands, and the Western Isles, but includes Caithness. \"Highlands\" is sometimes used, however, as a name for the council area, as in \"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service\". \"Northern\", as in \"Northern Constabulary\", is also used to refer to the area covered by the fire and rescue service. This area consists of the Highland council area and the island council areas of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles.\n\nHighland Council signs in the Pass of Drumochter, between Glen Garry and Dalwhinnie, say \"Welcome to the Highlands\".\n\nMuch of the Highlands area overlaps the Highlands and Islands area. An electoral region called \"Highlands and Islands\" is used in elections to the Scottish Parliament: this area includes Orkney and Shetland, as well as the Highland Council local government area, the Western Isles and most of the Argyll and Bute and Moray local government areas. \"Highlands and Islands\" has, however, different meanings in different contexts. It means Highland (the local government area), Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles in \"Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service\". \"Northern\", as in \"Northern Constabulary\", refers to the same area as that covered by the fire and rescue service.\n\nThere have been trackways from the Lowlands to the Highlands since prehistoric times. Many traverse the Mounth, a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the North Sea slightly north of Stonehaven. The most well-known and historically important trackways are the Causey Mounth, Elsick Mounth, Cryne Corse Mounth and Cairnamounth.\n\nAlthough most of the Highlands is geographically on the British mainland, it is somewhat less accessible than the rest of Britain; thus most UK couriers categorise it separately, alongside Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and other offshore islands. They thus charge additional fees for delivery to the Highlands, or exclude the area entirely. Whilst the physical remoteness from the largest population centres inevitably leads to higher transit cost, there is confusion and consternation over the scale of the fees charged and the effectiveness of their communication, and the use of the word Mainland in their justification. Since the charges are often based on postcode areas, many far less remote areas, including some which are traditionally considered part of the lowlands, are also subject to these charges. Royal Mail is the only delivery network bound by a Universal Service Obligation to charge a uniform tariff across the UK. This, however, applies only to mail items and not larger packages which are dealt with by its Parcelforce division.\n\nThe Highlands lie to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Arran to Stonehaven. This part of Scotland is largely composed of ancient rocks from the Cambrian and Precambrian periods which were uplifted during the later Caledonian Orogeny. Smaller formations of Lewisian gneiss in the northwest are up to 3 billion years old. The overlying rocks of the Torridon Sandstone form mountains in the Torridon Hills such as Liathach and Beinn Eighe in Wester Ross.\n\nThese foundations are interspersed with many igneous intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain massifs such as the Cairngorms and the Cuillin of Skye. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstone found principally along the Moray Firth coast and partially down the Highland Boundary Fault. The Jurassic beds found in isolated locations on Skye and Applecross reflect the complex underlying geology. They are the original source of much North Sea oil. The Great Glen is formed along a transform fault which divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands.\n\nThe entire region was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages, save perhaps for a few nunataks. The complex geomorphology includes incised valleys and lochs carved by the action of mountain streams and ice, and a topography of irregularly distributed mountains whose summits have similar heights above sea-level, but whose bases depend upon the amount of denudation to which the plateau has been subjected in various places.\n\n\n\n"}

As both countries were colonised by Great Britain during the same period of history, their survey systems share many similarities. Although they inherited the title deed system from the United Kingdom, a distinctive feature is the Torrens System, where real estate records are held in a central deposit and guaranteed by the state.\n\nThe first accurate mapping of both countries was compiled during the voyages of Captain Cook. Cook's experience in creating nautical charts of the eastern seaboard of Canada was an important factor in his appointment as captain of the voyage observing the transit of Venus. As he sailed the coastlines, he charted the bays and coastlines.\n\nMost states appointed surveyors-general early in their history. These officials were responsible for setting up reliable systems to record land purchases and claims. The current Australian survey system is the geocentric datum of Australia, established in 1994. It was adopted nationally on 1 January 2000. Surveying is regulated at a federal level by Geoscience Australia.\n\nInitially surveys were conducted using magnetic bearings. Later measurements were made on county arbitrary meridians, where surveys in each county were based off an initial point determined by government surveyors. In 1966, the first nationwide system, the Australian geodetic datum (AGD) was established.\n\nEarly surveying efforts concentrated on finding suitable town sites. Many towns in Australia were established by dividing a suitable site into small plots of land that were sold to English residents who then emigrated. Other exploration expeditions were made to the interior in an attempt to find fertile land.\n\nThe first attempts to regulate surveying in New South Wales was in 1836. In 1876, use of the circumferentor was prohibited. The theodolite supplanted it as a more accurate measurer of angles. The Torrens system was introduced in 1862 by the Real Property Act. The previous system of registering deeds is now known as the \"old system\".\n\nA fully qualified surveyor in Western Australia is known as a licensed surveyor. The title is administered by the Land Surveyors Licensing Board of Western Australia.\n\nPrior to European colonisation, New Zealand was divided into territories of tribes (Iwi) and subtribes (hapu). Boundaries were defined by landmarks which were remembered in chants and oral tradition. Land was held by customary possession, gifted, or by conquest and occupation.\n\nSales of land to European colonists prior to 1840 were not regulated. Disputes arose mainly in areas where tribal possession was unclear.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, all lands of New Zealand came under the dominion of the British crown. The treaty allowed the tribes possession of their customary lands. Europeans wanting to purchase land negotiated through a government commission. If negotiations were successful, the applicant was given a crown grant that gave them ownership under British law. The purchases prior to 1840 were known as old land claims and required to go through the same process. Many of these claims were reduced in size from the original agreements.\n\nThe position of surveyor-general was created in the royal instructions of 1840. The first regulations for surveying were established in 1842, when surveyors were required to deposit their licenses with the surveyor general's office to be returned upon completion of a survey. In 1852, provinces were established and each established a survey department. These were often underfunded and most failed to systemise surveys in their territory, making boundaries unreliable because of gaps and overlaps between abutting surveys. Some small triangulation networks were established, and some cities established survey control points on routes known as standard traverses that surveyors could use as a basis for local surveys. In Otago, true north was determined at six points throughout the province. Local surveys could be linked to these points so that their angle measurements were consistent throughout the district. The districts were known as meridional circuits, a term that has persisted in New Zealand surveying. \n\nIn 1875 Major H S Palmer of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain presented a damning report on the state of the survey system to the New Zealand Parliament. He recommended that a unified map projection was adopted and a single system of reference points was established across the country. In 1876, the provinces were abolished and the survey departments were combined. The chief surveyor of the Otago province, John Turnbull Thomson, was made surveyor-general of the new government survey department. Thompson established meridional circuits throughout the country as well as reorganising the way land records were identified and recorded. By 1880, the small original triangulation networks had been extended and joined throughout New Zealand.\n\nIn the years following Major Palmer's report, triangulation had been extended throughout New Zealand, but accuracy had been found wanting. It was not until 1921 that Surveyor-General W.T. Neill began work on a system that would create accurate reference points throughout New Zealand. In 1923, the first baseline was measured near Kaingaroa. From 1930 onward, observations were made at night to improve accuracy. The longest observation was across Cook Strait. Work continued through World War II as the project was allowed topographical maps for military use to be quickly compiled. The last fieldwork was completed in early 1949, and the system became known as the New Zealand Geodetic Datum 1949. \n\nThe 1949 datum was updated in 2000. To ease GPS measurement the new system was slightly shifted to become geocentric (the origin point of the system coincides with the centre of the Earth). It was also designed to be semi-dynamic, to cope better with seismic movement. This system is called the New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000, and includes the NZ Transverse Mercator projection that topographical maps are published in.\n\nThese geodetic activities are responsible for the ubiquitous trig stations that reside mostly at the top of many hills throughout New Zealand.\n\nCadastral surveying in New Zealand is governed by the Cadastral Survey Act 2002, which defines legal bodies that deal with aspects of the profession. The act devolves power to create specific regulations to the surveyor-general, who periodically issues the surveyor-general's rules for cadastral surveys. The Land Transfer Act 1952 also influences the way surveys are done.\n\nThe Torrens system of land registration was introduced in the Land Transfer Act 1870. The act introduced a system where land title is held in a register as opposed to the previous system that registered the document containing the title information. It therefore made it unnecessary to search the history of a title, and made titles indefeasible, meaning that it cannot be claimed by persons other than the registered owner.\n\nA separate system exists in parallel with the general land titles for land held in common by Māori as a tribe. This is controlled by the Te ture Whenua Maori (Maori Land) Act 1993. In 1980, 4.5% of New Zealand land was held in the Māori land system. This does not include land held by Māori individuals in the general land system.\n\nA surveyor who has fulfilled the requirements to legally sign subdivision plans is known as a licensed cadastral surveyor.\n\nConstruction surveying is not regulated at the state level in New Zealand. However, matters relating to surveying may require certification by a registered professional surveyor under contract law or local authority regulations.\n\nSurveying in New Zealand uses whole circle (azimuth) bearings. Another oddity is the convention of writing coordinates where the northing is written before the easting, at odds with much of the rest of the world.\n\nNew Zealand Institute of Surveyors was established in 1888 after an earlier attempt in 1881.\n\nThe Surveying & Spatial Sciences Institute (SSSI)\n\nThe Institution of Surveyors NSW Inc\n\nThe Institution of Surveyors Victoria\n\nWestern Australian Institution of Surveyors\n\nQueensland Spatial & Surveying Association\n\nSurveyors Board of South Australia.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Mine Surveyors\n\nAustralasian Institute of Marine Surveyors\n\nThe Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM)\n"}

Noticeable ridges emanate from the east-southeastern, southwestern, west-northwestern and north-northeastern corners of the seamount; they appear to be rift zones, and flank cones are found on the eastern slopes. The southern slopes feature slump deposits, and the entire seamount is surrounded by a sediment fan. The volume of the entire seamount is about . Two large seamounts lie west and southwest of Takuyo-Daisan with a smaller seamount between the two; Takuyo-Daini is the western one and Jensen seamount the south-western one. The seafloor underneath Takuyo-Daisan has an age of 143 million years.\n\nThe Western Pacific Ocean features many seamounts with flat tops at depths of below sea level which are known as guyots. They were considered to be remnants of eroded islands before Cretaceous carbonate platforms were discovered on them which resemble present-day atolls although they do not have exactly the same properties. Later similar submarine mountains were identified elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean as well. Menard 1958 suggested that the Western Pacific guyots once were part of an elevated region known as the Darwin Rise, later compared to present day French Polynesia.\n\nMany of these seamounts originally formed in the South Pacific, such as in French Polynesia, where a number of recent volcanoes and volcanic chains can be found. The original location of Takuyo-Daisan closely matches the present-day location of the Society hotspot, and together with Takuyo-Daini, Winterer Guyot and Isakov Guyot appears to form a linear volcanic chain, the Geisha guyots.\n\nTakuyo-Daisan has erupted basalt containing olivine and plagioclase and which define an intermediary to tholeiitic magma suite. Weathering of volcanic rocks has given rise to calcite, clay which also contains coal, iddingsite and zeolite. Carbonates occur in the form of floatstone, grainstone, limestone, packstone, oncoids, peloids, rudstone and wackestone; the limestone is of reefal origin.Hypersthene andesite samples taken from Takuyo-Daisan were probably brought there by ice rafting as no such rocks have ever been found on this kind of volcanic island.\n\nObtaining reliable radiometric ages from Takuyo-Daisan has been difficult; the most reliable age has been obtained from nearby Takuyo-Daini, 118.4 ± 1.8 million years ago. From this date an age of 119.0 ± 1.8 million years ago has been inferred for Takuyo-Daisan. A more recent date from Takuyo-Daisan is 117.5 ± 1.1 million years ago. The seamount formed at 9-7 degrees south from the equator.\n\nVolcanic activity formed breccia, lava flows with thicknesses of about and volcanic sediments. The volcanic rocks were subject to weathering, forming over thick soils. Phreatomagmatic deposits and rocks interpreted as peperite have also been found, implying that some lava flows may have interacted with wet soils as they were emplaced. Takuyo-Daisan at this time might have been an at least and possibly as much as high tropical volcanic island with marshes that were inhabited by bioturbatory organisms.\n\nCarbonate sedimentation at Takyuo-Daisan lasted from the Aptian to the Albian (based on foraminiferal fossils) and led to the deposition of about - of carbonate sediment. Carbonate sedimentation took place while the initial volcanic edifice was still emergent, similar to present-day Truk, Micronesia; this resulted in terrigenous sedimentation in the carbonates. The total duration of carbonate sedimentation is about 15 million years, thick distinct sequences in the carbonate sediments may be correlated to Milankovich cycles.\n\nThe carbonate platform at Takuyo-Daisan featured both barrier shoals and lagoonal environments. Biogenic mounds grew at the margin of the platform. Redeposition of carbonate sediments led to the formation of sandy shoals which formed the later perimeter ridge. Overall the environment of the platform was a warm Tethyan environment.\n\nAlgae including algal mats, bivalves, corals, cyanobacteria, echinoids, foraminifera, molluscs, nannofossil-forming species and rudists inhabited the carbonate platform, and arthropods and woods have been found in the oldest carbonate deposits. The fauna of Takuyo-Daisan was not particularly diverse, probably because the seamount was located close to the paleoequator and away from the Tethyan margin that many species found at Takuyo-Daisan originate from. \n\nThe drowning of the carbonate platform at Takuyo-Daisan has been attributed to different causes. A large transgression took place in the late Albian and may have caused the drowning. In other guyots nutrient excess has been implicated but there is no evidence of such at Takuyo-Daisan. Other factors may include hostile conditions close to the equator and unfavourable changes of the geomorphology of the platform at the time of its drowning. The drowning of the Takuyo-Daisan platform was simultaneous to the drowning of carbonate platforms elsewhere around the world and may have been caused by tectonically-induced sea level fluctuations.\n\nAfter cessation of the platform activity, manganese crusts and chalks later modified by phosphate developed on exposed rocks. During the Neogene, oozes, terrigenous sediments, wind-borne material such as pollen and volcanic ash from the approaching Japanese volcanic arc accumulated on Takuyo-Daisan.\n\nPresently, Takuyo-Daisan lies in a region of high plankton productivity which has led to a high diatom deposition rate as well as high sedimentation rates in general. Corals and sponges have been found on the seamount; crinoids may also occur there.\n\n"}

Tide heights at intermediate times (between high and low water) can be approximated by using the rule of twelfths or more accurately calculated by using a published tidal curve for the location. Tide levels are typically given relative to a low-water datum, e.g. the mean lower low water (MLLW) datum in the US.\n\nTide tables are published in various forms, such as paper-based tables and tables available on the Internet. Most tide tables are calculated and published only for major ports, called \"standard ports\", and only for one year — standard ports can be relatively close together or hundreds of kilometers apart. The tide times for a minor port are estimated by the tide-table user manually calculating using the published time and height differences between a standard port and the minor port.\n\nThe dates of spring tides and neap tides, approximately seven days apart, can be determined by the heights of the tides on the classic tide tables: a small range indicates neaps and large indicates springs. \n\nThe cycle of tides is dependent on the phase of the moon, with the highest tides spring tides occurring near full moon and new moon. As the lunar cycle is about 29.5 days, successive tides are approximately 24/29th of an hour later each day or about 50 minutes but many other observations and considerations are required to develop accurate tide tables. On the Atlantic coast of northwest Europe, the interval between each low and high tide averages about 6 hours and 10 minutes, giving two high tides and two low tides each day, with the highest tides about 2 days after full moon.\n\nTide prediction was long beset by the problem of laborious calculations; and in earlier times, before the use of digital computers, official tide tables were often generated by the use of a special-purpose calculating machine, the tide-predicting machine.\n\n\n"}

It is one of two border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and China, the other being Irkeshtam, some 165 km (103 mi) to the southwest.\n\nThe scenic Lake of Chatyr-Kul lies near the pass on the Kyrgyz side. The road to Naryn and then to Balykshy and Bishkek—stretching for some —is narrow and in winter often impassable due to heavy snowfall and frequent avalanches. On the Chinese side, the Torugart Port of Entry (吐尔尕特口岸), where travelers must clear for customs, is located about from the pass itself in Ulugqat County of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture. Distances from the pass to major cities are: to Ulugqat, to Kashgar, to Artux and some to Urumqi.\n\nThe pass was used since antiquity. During the Han dynasty it was under the jurisdiction of a micro-state called Juandu (). During the Tang dynasty, the region came under Tang control as part of Anxi Protectorate\n\nRussia and China first established a port of entry at the Torugart Pass in 1881. In 1906, Russia's Sino-Russian Transport Bank financed the construction of the road from the pass to Kashgar for 20 million rubles. In 1952, the Torugart Pass replaced the Irkeshtam Pass, which lies some southwest, as the primary overland link between Xinjiang and the then-Soviet Kyrgyz Republic. The pass was closed in 1969 due to the Sino-Soviet Split and reopened again in 1983. In 1995, the Torugart Port of Entry was relocated to a lower elevation (2,000m), closer to Kashgar, some away.\n\nThe pass is open to all nationalities but clearance requires careful arrangement of transportation.\n\nA China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway going through Torugard Pass has been in the works that would connect Kashgar and the Ferghana Valley since 2012. However, the Kyrgyz section of the rail has been stalled due to financial and technical issues.\n\n"}

{"id": "499291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=499291", "title": "Zagros Mountains", "text": "Zagros Mountains\n\nThe Zagros Mountains (; Lurish: ; ) are a long mountain range in Iran, Iraq and southeastern Turkey. This mountain range has a total length of . The Zagros mountain range begins in northwestern Iran and roughly follows Iran's western border, while covering much of southeastern Turkey and northeastern Iraq. From this border region, the range roughly follows Iran's coast on the Persian Gulf. It spans the whole length of the western and southwestern Iranian plateau, ending at the Strait of Hormuz. The highest point is Mount Zardkuh, at .\n\nThe Zagros fold and thrust belt was formed by the collision of two tectonic plates, the Eurasian Plate and the Arabian Plate. This collision primarily happened during the Miocene and folded the entire rocks that had been deposited from the Carboniferous to the Miocene in the geosyncline in front of the Iranian Plate. The process of collision continues to the present and as the Arabian Plate is being pushed against the Eurasian Plate, the Zagros Mountains and the Iranian Plateau are getting higher and higher. Recent GPS measurements in Iran have shown that this collision is still active and the resulting deformation is distributed non-uniformly in the country, mainly taken up in the major mountain belts like Alborz and Zagros. A relatively dense GPS network which covered the Iranian Zagros also proves a high rate of deformation within the Zagros. The GPS results show that the current rate of shortening in the southeast Zagros is ~, dropping to ~ in the northwest Zagros. The north-south Kazerun strike-slip fault divides the Zagros into two distinct zones of deformation. The GPS results also show different shortening directions along the belt, normal shortening in the southeast and oblique shortening in the northwest Zagros. The Zagros mountains were created around the time of the second ice age, which caused the tectonic collision, leading to it's uniqueness.\n\nThe sedimentary cover in the SE Zagros is deforming above a layer of rock salt (acting as a ductile decollement with a low basal friction), whereas in the NW Zagros the salt layer is missing or is very thin. This different basal friction is partly responsible for the different topographies on either side of the Kazerun fault. Higher topography and narrower zone of deformation in the NW Zagros is observed whereas in the SE, deformation was spread more and a wider zone of deformation with lower topography was formed. Stresses induced in the Earth's crust by the collision caused extensive folding of the preexisting layered sedimentary rocks. Subsequent erosion removed softer rocks, such as mudstone (rock formed by consolidated mud) and siltstone (a slightly coarser-grained mudstone) while leaving harder rocks, such as limestone (calcium-rich rock consisting of the remains of marine organisms) and dolomite (rocks similar to limestone containing calcium and magnesium). This differential erosion formed the linear ridges of the Zagros Mountains. The depositional environment and tectonic history of the rocks were conducive to the formation and trapping of petroleum, and the Zagros region is an important area for oil production. Salt domes and salt glaciers are a common feature of the Zagros Mountains. Salt domes are an important target for petroleum exploration, as the impermeable salt frequently traps petroleum beneath other rock layers.\n\nThe mountains have a totally sedimentary origin and are made primarily of limestone. In the Elevated Zagros or the Higher Zagros, the Paleozoic rocks could be found mainly in the upper and higher sections of the peaks of the Zagros Mountains along the Zagros main fault. On both sides of this fault, there are Mesozoic rocks, a combination of Triassic and Jurassic rocks that are surrounded by Cretaceous rocks on both sides. The Folded Zagros (the mountains south of the Elevated Zagros and almost parallel to the main Zagros fault) is formed mainly of Tertiary rocks, with the Paleogene rocks south of the Cretaceous rocks and then the Neogene rocks south of the Paleogene rocks. The mountains are divided into many parallel sub-ranges (up to wide), and orogenically have the same age as the Alps. Iran's main oilfields lie in the western central foothills of the Zagros mountain range. The southern ranges of the Fars Province have somewhat lower summits, reaching . They contain some limestone rocks showing abundant marine fossils.\n\nSigns of early agriculture date back as far as 9000 BC to the foothills of the mountains. There were settlements that later grew into cities, eventually named Anshan and Susa. Jarmo is one archaeological site in this area. Shanidar, where the ancient skeletal remains of Neanderthals have been found, is another. Some of the earliest evidence of wine production has been discovered in the mountains; both the settlements of Hajji Firuz Tepe and Godin Tepe have given evidence of wine storage dating between 3500 and 5400 BC.\n\nDuring early ancient times, the Zagros was the home of peoples such as the Kassites, Guti, Elamites and Mitanni, who periodically invaded the Sumerian and/or Akkadian cities of Mesopotamia. The mountains create a geographic barrier between the Mesopotamian Plain, which is in Iraq, and the Iranian Plateau. A small archive of clay tablets detailing the complex interactions of these groups in the early second millennium BC has been found at Tell Shemshara along the Little Zab. Tell Bazmusian, near Shemshara, was occupied between 5000 BCE and 800 CE, although not continuously.\n\nThe mountains contain several ecosystems. Prominent among them are the forest and forest steppe areas with a semi-arid climate. As defined by the World Wildlife Fund and used in their Wildfinder, the particular terrestrial ecoregion of the mid to high mountain area is \"Zagros Mountains forest steppe\" (PA0446). The annual precipitation ranges from and falls mostly in winter and spring. Winters are severe, with low temperatures often below . The region exemplifies the continental variation of the Mediterranean climate pattern, with a snowy winter and mild, rainy spring, followed by a dry summer and autumn.\n\nThe mountains of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar (), Kuh-i-Lalezar () and Kuh-i-Hezar () do not currently have glaciers. Only at Zard Kuh and Dena some glaciers still survive. However, before the Last Glacial Period they had been glaciated to a depth in excess of , and during the Last Glacial Period to a depth in excess of . Evidence exists of a wide glacier fed along a long valley dropping approximately along its length on the north side of Kuh-i-Jupar with a thickness of . Under precipitation conditions comparable to the current conditions, this size of glacier could be expected to form where the annual average temperature was between , but since conditions are expected to have been dryer during the period in which this glacier was formed, the temperature must have been lower.\n\nAlthough currently degraded through overgrazing and deforestation, the Zagros region is home to a rich and complex flora. Remnants of the originally widespread oak-dominated woodland can still be found, as can the park-like pistachio/almond steppelands. The ancestors of many familiar foods, including wheat, barley, lentil, almond, walnut, pistachio, apricot, plum, pomegranate and grape can be found growing wild throughout the mountains.\nPersian oak (\"Quercus brantii\") (covering more than 50% of the Zagros forest area) is the most important tree species of the Zagros in Iran.\n\nOther floral endemics found within the mountain range include: \"Allium iranicum\", \"Astragalus crenophila\", \"Bellevalia kurdistanica\", \"Cousinia carduchorum\", \"Cousinia odontolepis\", \"Echinops rectangularis\", \"Erysimum boissieri\", \"Iris barnumae\", \"Ornithogalum iraqense\", \"Scrophularia atroglandulosa\", \"Scorzonera kurdistanica\", \"Tragopogon rechingeri\", and \"Tulipa kurdica\".\n\nThe Zagros are home to many threatened or endangered organisms, including the Zagros Mountains mouse-like hamster (\"Calomyscus bailwardi\"), the Basra reed-warbler (\"Acrocephalus griseldis\") and the striped hyena (\"Hyena hyena\"). Luristan newt (\"Neurergus kaiseri\") - vulnerable endemic to the central Zagros mountains of Iran. The Persian fallow deer (\"Dama dama mesopotamica\"), an ancient domesticate once thought extinct, was rediscovered in the late 20th century in Khuzestan Province, in the southern Zagros.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Asiatic lion (\"Panthera leo leo\") inhabited the southwestern part of the mountains. It is now extinct in this region.\n\n\n"}
