{"id": "472361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=472361", "title": "A31 road", "text": "A31 road\n\nThe A31 is a major trunk road in southern England that runs from Guildford in Surrey to Bere Regis in Dorset.\n\nThe road begins in Guildford at the start of Farnham Road near Guildford Station, coming out of the town and passing over the A3 where shortly after it becomes a dual carriageway running in a westerly direction along the Hog's Back escarpment of the North Downs. At Tongham it leaves the older Hogs Back route to join with the A331 and follow a modern bypass round Farnham, rejoining the older route at the roundabout junction with the A325 where it follows Alton Road toward Alton which it bypasses, rejoining the older route near Jane Austen's house, then continuing to Alresford before joining the route of the M3 motorway at its junction on the eastern boundary of Winchester. \n\nThe old route to Winchester's centre then Romsey and the New Forest forms two roads: the B3404 and A3090 roads and is marked for cyclists. The west branch of the M27 motorway - M3 interchange has a flyover junction with the winding westbound A3090 on the western boundary of Cadnam, having passed through the conservation area village centre, from where the resumed A31 continues as a dualled trunk road through the rest of the New Forest, past Ringwood and enters Dorset just before it passes Ferndown where it resumes single carriageway width. It passes Wimborne Minster and by-passes Charborough Park before terminating at a roundabout junction with the A35 road at Bere Regis. The A35 is not a trunk road east of Bere Regis, but is a continuation of the A31 trunk road to the west, thus the Highways Agency maintain it.\n\nThe A31 is part of the ancient route from London to Winchester.\n\nThe A31 between Wimborne Minster and Bere Regis, most of its Dorset stretch is primarily a single-carriageway road, used by heavy goods vehicles, and as such is relatively slow for a trunk road during busy times of the day. However the River Stour is one of the most flood-prone rivers alongside in the region and a widened road would accelerate drainage and disrupt views of the valley from Areas of Outstanding Beauty on the escarpments to the north.\n\nMany sections of the A31 were upgraded to dual carriageway in the 1960s, except for the section of road running through the New Forest.\n\nThe upgrade of the A31 through the New Forest started in the early 1960s, following two decades of debate. The Government's intention was to create at least one high-speed route to the south coast, while the guardians of the forest, the Verderers, resisted any further development.\n\nThe first section of the A31 to be dualled was the section that the M27 feeds into at Jct1; the westbound carriageway is the original two-way A-road while the eastbound side was laid down nearby. Further developments occurred from Ringwood to Picket Post near the turn-off for Burley. From 1966-1972, the remaining sections were completed rapidly due to the construction of the M27 motorway up to Jct 1.\n\nThe Highways Agency declares the New Forest A31 section as being 'an abnormal and heavy load route'. The westbound route, particularly, suffers from poor horizontal and vertical alignment due to its original function as an old single carriageway. The Highways Agency's route management strategy (RMS) for the A31 has identified that the westbound carriageway needs realigning at Cadnam where it undulates rapidly before negotiating a sharp right turn and passes an at-grade U-turn box, though there is no timetable for this at present. There is also a pinch point at Ringwood where the A31 interplexes with the A338; the section of road was widened to four lanes each way for the duration of the A338 interplex (following the upgrade of the Ashley Heath Junction to Bournemouth in the early 1990s) but a short section where westbound A338 traffic joins westbound A31 was left with 2 lanes, and the lack of capacity at this section causes safety problems and queues at peak times. Dorset County Council cites relieving this junction as a high priority in the Bournemouth LTP 2006-2011. In December 2014 the Government announced a series of schemes as part of a £15bn investment in transport infrastructure that included widening the Westbound carriageway to 3 lanes. \nA Highways Agency review in 2010 records that the collision rate between the A338 Ringwood junction and the Poulner Hill Interchange was 4.5 Personal Injury Collisions (PICs) per 100million vehicle kilometers, whilst the rate for the stretch between Poulner Hill and Picket Post is 11.7 PICs per 100million vehicle kilometers.\n\nThis section of road is single carriageway for its entire length, a long section around Winterborne Zelston has a 40 mph speed limit, and occasionally has mobile speed cameras in place.\n\nThere are no good overtaking places on this stretch of road due to its narrow, twisty nature. There are three long straight sections of road along Charborough Park, at the end of each straight there is blind bend. Due to the lack of alternative overtaking places traffic use this stretch of road to overtake, but due to the blind bends this sometimes results in head-on collisions between vehicles. The 6 ft wall that runs alongside the road has many holes, and repaired sections which have been hit by cars over the years.\n\nThe A31 crosses the A350 at a large roundabout. Due to the volume of traffic crossing this roundabout on both the A350 and A31, clear lane markings have been added to ease congestion.\n\nSections along the A31 have been widened or straightened and junctions enhanced, particularly as the population of the main towns in Dorset has expanded.\n\nA section of the A31 between Winchester and Ower in Hampshire is now known as the A3090.\n\nPrior to completion of the M3 past Winchester in the 1995, the A3090 ran south west from the A33 at Kings Worthy (where the A33 diverted around the Winchester Bypass) to the centre of Winchester, before continuing along the historic route of the A31 from Winchester to Hursley. Here it ended at a junction with the A31, which at this time, having merged with the by-pass east of Winchester, re-emerged from the A33 at Otterbourne and ran to Hursley and on along the current route of the A3090.\n\nA short dual carriageway section starts from the A36 roundabout near Ower and terminates just before the A27 multiplex south west of Romsey.\n\n"}

He was an undergraduate (BA 1961), graduate student (DPhil, 1964), and lecturer at Merton College, Oxford before being appointed to a lectureship in geography at St Catherine's College, Oxford (known colloquially as St Catz) in 1965 at the age of 26. He held this post jointly with a lectureship at Keble College, Oxford and a Faculty Lectureship at the University of Oxford.\n\nHe was elected as a tutorial fellow (teaching fellow) in geography at St Catherine's in 1969 and also held various non-teaching posts, including several college offices: Domestic Bursar, Senior Tutor, Finance Bursar and Acting Master. During his tenure as Senior Tutor, women were first admitted to the college. As Domestic Bursar, he negotiated college charges with the then Junior Common Room President, Peter Mandelson.\n\nHe was Professor of Social geography at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford from 1992 to 2007 and on retirement from his Oxford chair he was appointed Professor of at the Institute for Social Change at the University of Manchester.\n\nPeach found the move from Merton, Oxford's oldest college, to St Catherine's (known as St Catz), Oxfords newest college, to be liberating:\n\nDuring his time at St Catherine's the number of undergraduate geographers accepted by the college increased from 4 each year to between 10 and 12. The University Schools results also became some of the best in the arts subjects at the college. Notable students taught by Ceri Peach include Denis Cosgrove, who went on to become Alexander von Humboldt Professor of Geography at University of California, Los Angeles; Mike Walker and Geoff Duller, who went on to become professors of geography at the University of Wales; Mike Summerfield, Professor of Physical Geography at the University of Edinburgh; Vaughan Robinson, professor at King's College London; Michael Keith, professor of sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London; Gary Bridge, professor at Cardiff University, Chris Keylock, professor of fluid mechanics at Loughborough University, and Dr Margaret Byron, teaching fellow at the University of Leicester.\n\nOther graduates in geography taught by Peach at St Catherine's have achieved success in other fields and include Matthew Pinsent, who received four gold medals for rowing in successive Olympic Games.\n\nPeach's main field of research is human migration and the racial segregation of minority groups, ethnic groups and religious groups in the United Kingdom, the United States and Western Europe.\n\nDuring his sabbatical at the Demography Department of Australian National University, in 1973, his understanding of the relationship between spatial patterns of residential segregation was transformed. This led him to investigate ethnic intermarriage as an index of social interaction.\n\nDuring his next sabbatical at Yale University, in 1977, he disproved the 'triple melting pot theory' of American cultural assimilation which, based on data collection in New Haven, Connecticut, argued that while national ethnic identity in the United States would dissolve, it would do so within maintained religious boundaries of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. His research proved that while the so-called 'Protestant pot' seemed plausible, a 'Catholic-pot' seemed unlikely:\n\nHis research in the 1970s and 1980s focused on housing tenure and segregation in the United Kingdom and the United States and during this time he worked closely with Dr Samir Shah and later with Dr Margaret Byron.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Peach continued his research on issues of segregation with particular focus on the dynamics relating to, and the arguments surrounding, Ghetto formation and White flight. This included differences between British and American cities and whether British cities had become more segregated than Chicago. He also examined the growth of the Muslim population in Europe, and particularly in Britain, and this has developed into a large scale study of the cultural geography of Muslim mosques, Sikh Gurdwaras and Hindu Mandirs on the landscape of Britain.\n\nHis Economic and Social Research Council funded project on ethno-religio-linguistic sub-communities links his database on Muslim, Hindu and Sikh places of worship in the United Kingdom, completed as a millennium project, and funded by the Leverhulme Trust, with the United Kingdom Census 2001 data on ethnicity and religion. The Leverhulme survey photographed and collected data on religion, tradition, movements, vernacular language, date of foundation and other variables on nearly 1,000 buildings. Peach is a member of the Advisory Board of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies.\n\nOn 22 September 2007 Ceri Peach retired from St Catherine’s College and became an emeritus fellow at the College. a series of talks were given by former pupils and colleagues at the Oxford University Centre for the Environment on 22 September followed by a reception and speeches by professors Ron J. Johnston and Gary Bridge. St Catherine's has created the Ceri Peach Trust Fund to honour the 40 years' contribution Peach has made to the study of geography, and to ensure that geography continues to flourish at the college.\n\nRecalling his time at the college Peach remarked:\n\nIn 2008, the BBC reported that, along with Ludi Simpson and Danny Dorling, Peach is considered to be one of the top three British thinkers in the field of racial segregation. In the same year, he was nominated as \"Ethnic Geography Distinguished Scholar of 2008\" by the Association of American Geographers at their April meeting in Boston.\n\nIn 2016, Peach was awarded a Doctorate of Letters by the University of Oxford, which is one of the highest academic honors that the University may confer. It was given in recognition of contribution he has made to academia throughout his career, particularly to his main field of research in human migration and the racial segregation of minority groups, ethnic groups and religious groups in the United Kingdom, United States and Western Europe.\n\nSelected publications include:\n\n\nSelected co-authored, or co-edited, publications include:\n\n\nOutside his research interests, Peach has maintained a keen interest in rowing:\n\nOther notable rowers, who comprise part of the strong Olympic Games rowing tradition at St Catherine's, include Colin Smith (2003, Geography), Andrew Triggs Hodge (2004, Geography and the Environment) and Stephan Mølvig (2005, Geography and the Environment).\n"}

It was developed in 1946 by Wellman Chamberlin for the National Geographic Society.\nChamberlin was chief cartographer for the Society from 1964 to 1971.\nThe projection's principal feature is that it compromises between distortions of area, direction, and distance. A Chamberlin trimetric map therefore gives an excellent overall sense of the region being mapped.\nMany National Geographic Society maps of single continents use this projection.\n\nAs originally implemented, the projection algorithm begins with the selection of three points near the outer boundary of the area to be mapped. From these three base points, the true distances to a point on the mapping area are calculated. The distances from each of the three base points are then drawn on the plane by compass circles. Unlike triangulation on a plane where three such compass circles will intersect at a unique point, the compass circles from a sphere do not intersect precisely at a point. A small triangle is generated from the intersections, and the center of this triangle is calculated as the mapped point.\nA Chamberlin trimetric projection map was originally obtained by graphically mapping points at regular intervals of latitude and longitude, with shorelines and other features then mapped by interpolation. Based on the principles of the projection, precise, but lengthy, mathematical formulas were later developed for calculating this projection by computer for a spherical earth.\n\nThe Chamberlin trimetric projection is neither conformal nor equal-area. Rather, the projection was conceived to minimize distortion of distances everywhere with the side-effect of balancing between areal equivalence and conformality. This projection is not appropriate for mapping the entire sphere because the outer boundary would loop and overlap itself in most configurations.\n\n\n"}

Located just south of the residential area Kvarntorp, and north of the densely populated central Haninge, the wetland lake receives considerable amount of nutritive salts.\n\nThe lake and the surrounding wetlands, together with local forests, are regarded as a valuable local natural resource worth to protect. However, while the lake system as a whole is regarded as sensitive to further loads of surface runoff, Dammträsk is one of the lakes in Haninge already to contaminated to be regarded as vulnerable. It has been a conscious decision to redirect water from Rudasjön to Dammträsk, and, as much of the waste the lake receives is sedimented into the lake, Drevviken, the lake downstream is saved from contamination.

{"id": "38619096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38619096", "title": "Franciscus Haraeus", "text": "Franciscus Haraeus\n\nFranciscus Haraeus (Latinised form of Franciscus Verhaer; also known as Frans Verhaer), (Utrecht 1555? - Leuven, 11 January 1631), was a \"Netherlandish\" theologian, historian, and cartographer. He is best known for his history (from a Catholic point of view) of the Dutch Revolt. He was one of the first cartographers who made thematic maps and globes.\n\nHaraeus first attended the Latin school of the Brethren of the Common Life in Utrecht and subsequently studied theology at the University of Louvain under Thomas Stapleton and Johannes Molanus. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest at an early age, probably in 1578. He was appointed as a professor of rhetoric at the then-new University of Douai where he also obtained a Licentiate of Theology. In 1581 he accompanied the papal legate Possevin on an embassy to John III of Sweden and Ivan the Terrible.\n\nBack in the Dutch Republic he became a canon at St. John's Cathedral ('s-Hertogenbosch), later dean in Duinkerken and professor of theology at Tongerlo Abbey. In 1604-1609 he worked as a priest in Utrecht where he was in contact with Buchelius. After 1609 he moved permanently to the Spanish Netherlands where he became the rector of a nunnery in Antwerp, before becoming a canon in Namur in 1617, and after 1621 in Leuven. He died in the latter city on 11 January 1631, and was buried in the St. Peter Church in Leuven, near the tomb of Thomas Stapleton.\n\nHaraeus wrote (or maybe better, compiled) a large number of hagiographies. However, his historical works of longer lasting import concerned the first part of the Eighty Years' War through which he had lived himself. He took clearly the side of king Philip II of Spain against William the Silent which gave his work a polemical and sometimes biased character. His first publication in this field was \"Onpartijdighe Verklaringhe der oorsaken der Nederlantsche oorloghs sedert 't jaer 1566 tot 1608\" (Antwerp 1612). This provoked a critical reply by the Dutch-Supreme-Court Justice François Vranck, entitled: \"Wederlegghinghe van een seker Boecxke uytghegheven bij Franchois Verhaer, ghenaemt onpartijdighe verclaringhe der oorsaken van de Nederlantsche Oorloghe, sedert den Jare 1566 tot ten Jare 1608 toe\"(published posthumously, 1618). Meanwhile, Haraeus had already started on his major history: \"Annales ducum seu principum Brabantiae totiusque Belgii tomi tres: quorum primo solius Brabantiae, secundo Belgii uniti principum res gestae, tertio Belgici tumultus usque ad inductas anno MDCIX pactas, enarrantur\" (Antwerp 1623). This work was well received in the Spanish Netherlands where it long was a \"best seller,\" not so much because of its originality, but because of its tenor. The third volume was reworked by its author, but this version only exists in manuscript; it was never printed.\n\nHaraeus was one of several clergymen from the Netherlands who around the turn of the 17th century made important contributions to the young science of map-making (another one was Petrus Plancius). He was one of the three cartographers in the Spanish Netherlands who kept the craft of globe-making alive there after the exodus of many cartographers around the turn of the 17th century. In 1614 he published a six-gore map entitled \"Novus typus orbis ipsus globus, ex Analemmate Ptolomaei diductus\" This was one of the first instances of a thematic map as it showed the dispersion of Christianity and Islam at the time, using map symbols developed by Jodocus Hondius in his \"Designatio Orbis Christiani\" (1607)\n\nIn 1624 a map entitled \"Lumen Historiarum per Orientem\" was published by Balthasar Moretus as part of a new edition of Ortelius' \"Theatrum orbis terrarum Parergon\" which recognized Haraeus as its maker. This map was part of a set of two made earlier by Haraeus and designed as a catchall guide to sacred geography.\n\nAs a final example, Haraeus \"Geographica restituta per globi trientes \" (1618; see the illustration above) shows the world in three globe-gores. Note the insets: there is a map representing the 2nd-century worldview of Ptolemy in the lower-Eastern section, and a legend for the map in the lower-center, explaining symbols which identify religious habitations (a cross for Christian regions, a crescent for Islam, and a slanted arrow for barbarians).\n"}

The island has been submerged or partially submerged for much of its existing, forming large limestone and sedimentary rock formations, atop a thick basement of volcanic rocks. \n\nThe Washikemba Formation and Rincon Formation are the two oldest rock formations on Bonaire, both dating to the Cretaceous. The Washikemba Formation is five kilometers thick and contains basalt pillow lava formed as lava rapidly cooled in seawater, as well as submarine pyroclastic flows and some ammonite fossils in sedimentary rocks formed in a deep water environment. In addition to basalt, there is also rhyolite and basaltic andesite. Together, the formation was affected by low-grade metamorphism and primary minerals such as pyroxene, plagioclase and hornblende altered to prehnite, pumpellyite and zeolite. The Rincon Formation is a 30 meter succession of marl and calcareous sandstone outcropping in the center of the island and is faulted from the Washikemba Formation, making their exact relationship difficult to determine. It contains Maastrichtian Late Cretaceous shallow water fossils such as foraminifera, algae, gastropods, bivalves and rudists.\nThe Paleocene Soebi Blanco Formation is a 400 meter thick sequence of conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones at Seroe Largo in central Bonaire. It is similar to the Midden Curacao Formation in that it contains fragments of exotic rock not found in the area, such as quartzite, gneiss and schist. Uranium-lead dating gives an age of 1.15 billion years old on zircon fragments within a granulite pebble from the formation, suggesting that it is eroded material from much older rock in South America. In other cases, fragments of Cretaceous limestone are included as well. \n\nOutcropping southwest of Montagne is the Eocene Montagne Formation, made up of yellow, weathering limestones. A lower limestone unit contains molluscs while an upper unit includes echinoids and large foramins. The Seroe Domi Formation spans Bonaire and neighboring Curacao and Aruba. Its base is volcanic breccia but on Bonaire contains Miocene fossils not found on the other islands. The largely dolomite formation seems to have formed in a deep reef offshore environment.

Igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock forms the Archean Tanzania Craton, which is surrounded by the Proterozoic Ubendian belt, Mozambique Belt and Karagwe-Ankole Belt. The region experienced downwarping of the crust during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, as the massive Karoo Supergroup deposited. Within the past 100 million years, Tanzania has experienced marine sedimentary rock deposition along the coast and rift formation inland, which has produced large rift lakes. Tanzania has extensive, but poorly explored and exploited natural resources, including coal, gold, diamonds, graphite and clays. \n\nThe oldest Precambrian rocks in Tanzania form the stable continental crust of the Tanzania Craton and date to the Archean more than 2.5 billion years ago. The craton includes the vestiges of two Archean orogenic belts, the Dodoman Belt in central Tanzania, and the Nyanzian-Kavirondian in the north. The remains of these two belts produce lenses of sedimentary and volcanic rocks within granites and migmatite. The Dodoman Belt stretches for 480 kilometers, broadening westward and is composed of banded quartzites, aplite, sericitic schist, pegmatite and ironstone. \n\nThe Nyanzian Belt, by contrast, is mainly acid and basic basalt, dolerite, trachyte, rhyolite and tuff in separated zones south and east of Lake Victoria. The Kavirondian System is closely related to the Nyanzian, but separated by an unconformity and a zone of intense deformation. The Kavirondian is believed to be the remains of a molasse that formed by the Nyanzian as evidenced by sedimentary rocks such as mudstone, conglomerate as well as volcanics and grit. \n\nThe Ubendian Belt is a highly metamorphosed and folded metamorphic zone with intrusive granites southwest of the Tanzania Craton, paralleling Lake Tanganyika and Lake Rukwa. It likely formed in the Paleoproterozoic. Most rocks in the belt are pelite or various types of volcanic rock. Gneiss, hornblende, biotite, garnet and kyanite are common in the belt. \n\nNorthwestern Tanzania has the Mesoproterozoic Karagwe-Ankole Belt, with argillite, moderately metamorphosed phyllite, quartzites and sericitic schists. For the most part, the belt is only moderately folded, although deformation increases near granite intrusions. The belt is associated with Bukoban Series conglomerates, bedded sandstones and basalt flows which extend from the Ugandan border and terminate at the Rukwa Rift. \n\nThe Mozambique Belt is a structurally and metamorphically complex terrane that abuts the edge of the Tanzania Craton and formed during the Neoproterozoic. The formation of the belt is related to the widespread Pan-African orogeny and most rocks are highly metamorphosed pyroxene-gneiss, charnockite, biotite, hornblende. It also contains smaller occurrences of graphitic schist, quartzites and crystalline limestone. \n\nDuring the Paleozoic, after the Pan-African orogeny and the formation of the supercontinent Gondwana the Mozambique Belt experienced millions of years of erosion. This erosive period continued as Gondwana joined with Euramerica to become the supercontinent Pangaea. \n\nIn the Mesozoic, a major rift valley spanning what is today southern Africa and southern South America began to fill with sediments, depositing the first rock units of the Karoo Supergroup—the most extensive stratigraphic unit in southern Africa. In the Tanzania region, situated in the interior of Pangaea, the Karoo Supergroup deposited between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Jurassic, with sequences of terrestrial sediments. These sediments formed diverse rock units including sandstones, conglomerates, tillite, shale, red and gray mudstones and periodically, limestone deposits. Many of the Tanzanian Karoo rocks from this period contain plant and animal fossils. \n\nWith the fragmentation of Pangaea, the modern coastal region of Tanzania experienced a long lasting marine transgression, which deposited limestone, marl, sandstone and shale throughout the Late Jurassic, Cretaceous and almost all of the past 66 million years of the Cenozoic, up until the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. In the interior, the beginning East Africa Rift created large rift troughs, which filled with terrestrial sediments. Carbonatite volcanoes began erupting in the Cretaceous, a process that continued into the Cenozoic. \n\nAlkaline volcanic rocks, including olivine basalt, alkaline basalt, nephelinite, phonolite, trachyte and pyroclastic flows from the Neogene are common north of Lake Nyasa and Lake Natron. \n\nThe East African Rift system plays a key role in Tanzania's current day structural geology. Graben rift valleys often have volcanism associated with them. The Western Rift is filled with Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyasa, while the section from Lake Natron to Lake Nyasa is part of the Eastern Rift (also known as the Gregory Rift). Lake Rukwa and the Selous Basin occupy small, subsidiary rift basins. Structural geologists infer that Lake Victoria is situated in a downwarp in the crust between the two major rifts. \n\nOl Doinyo Lengai is the world's only active volcano with carbonatite lava and last had a large-scale eruption in 1966.\n\nUnconsolidated, near surface alluvial aquifers, recharged from rainwater are common in coastal deltas and river valleys, with an average depth of 10 to 20 meters, with some as much as 200 meters deep. The Sanya Plain and Kahe Basin around Mount Kilimanjaro have a mix of pyroclastic flow debris and alluvial sediments, creating some of the best aquifer potential. \n\nThe Coastal Sedimentary Aquifer is typically five to 30 meters thick, with a water depth of 10 to 35 meters below ground. Water quality varies, with periodic nitrate and salinity issues and better productivity from limestone and sandstone, compared with shale and marl. The Karoo Sandstone Aquifer is unconfined with intergranular flow and is also comparatively near surface—boreholes are seldom drilled more than 80 meters deep. \n\nAlthough often exhibiting low-permeability, the crystalline basement rock that underlies much of the country does host groundwater in fractures and weathered layers. The Pangani Basin has high yield bands of gneiss and metasediments, along with weathered zones and bedrock fractures in the Makutopuri Basin. Basement aquifers are typically 50 meters thick. \n\nTanzania has extensive natural resources, although many remain poorly explored and underdeveloped. The country has 300 kimberlite locations, centered within 200 kilometers of Shinyanga, in the north. Of these, about 20% contain diamonds. Approximately 70 tons of gold have been produced Archean rocks, near Geita on Lake Victoria as well as Proterozoic rocks in the Mpanda and Lupa districts. \n\nTanzania has some of the largest coal deposits in East Africa. A coal mine at Kiwira, close to Lake Nyasa produces 35,000 tons of coal per year. The Mongoro region has limestone, dolomite and white marble deposits. Rift valley lakes and coastal areas host poorly exploited evaporites. Tanzania has significant clay resources, including kaolin and bentonite. The Pugu Hill kaolin deposit is only partially exploited. International companies have been attracted to Tanzania by large graphite reserves, formed in kyanite gneiss and altered ore deposits. The altered ore type contains coarse flakes of graphite, often associated with tsavorite and tanzanite. \n\nA phosphate mine, in the north, near Minjingu stopped production in the 1990s before rehabilitation got underway in the mid-2000s. Because of its high growth economy, cement for building construction is an important natural resource. Tanga Cement has a 40 percent market share, producing 500,000 tons of cement a year from Jurassic limestones. \n\nA large natural gas deposit was discovered at Songo Songo Island, 300 kilometers southeast of Dar es Salaam. However, other offshore and onshore exploration did not yield any results. \n"}

The Gramvousa Peninsula forms the westernmost of the two pairs of peninsulae in north-western Crete (the other being Rodopos Peninsula) and is the western part of Kissamos Bay.\n\nThe Gramvousa islands are administered from the municipality of Kissamos. \n\nImeri Gramvousa (), which translates to \"Tame Gramvousa\", hosts the remains of a Venetian fort and the remains of buildings left behind by Cretan insurgents, who were compelled to live as pirates during the Greek War of Independence. Today, Imeri Gramvousa is a popular tourist attraction.\n\nAgria Gramvousa (), which translates to \"Wild Gramvousa\", is much less hospitable and is located due north of Imeri Gramvousa. It has also been named \"False Gramvousa\".\n\nIn ancient times the larger island was known as \"Korykos\", which means \"leather bag\". The island was name \"Gramvousa\" in honour of Vousa, the wife of a pirate chief and the only inhabitant of the island to evade capture when the pirates were forcibly removed.\n\nThe fort at Imeri Gramvousa was built between 1579 and 1584 during Venetian rule over Crete to defend the island from the Ottoman Turks. The fort remained in Venetian hands throughout the prolonged Cretan War, and in the treaty of 16 September 1669, which surrendered Crete to the Ottomans, Gramvousa, along with the fortresses of Souda and Spinalonga, was retained by Venice. These three forts defended Venetian trade routes and were also strategic bases in the event of a new Ottoman–Venetian war for Crete.\n\nOn 6 December 1691, during the Morean War (another Ottoman–Venetian war), the Neapolitan Captain de la Giocca betrayed the Venetians by surrendering Gramvousa to the Ottoman Turks for a generous bribe. He lived the rest of his life in Constantinople and was well known by the nickname \"Captain Grambousas\". Not long after the start of Turkish rule, Cretan insurgents used to gather at the three coastal forts which included Gramvousa.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, the fort fell to the insurgents' hands. In 1823, Emmanouil Tombazis, the Greek provisional government's commissioner for Crete, failed to strengthen the defences at Gramvousa when he had the opportunity, soon after his arrival on the island.\n\nTowards the summer of 1825, a body of three to four hundred Cretans, who had fought with other Greeks in the Peloponnese, journeyed to Crete. On 9 August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans, disguised as Turks, captured the fort at Gramvousa, which became their base. These and subsequent actions revitalized the Cretan insurgency, ushering the so-called \"Gramvousa period\".\n\nAlthough the Ottomans did not manage to retake the fort, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the islands' western provinces. The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa for more than two years and they had to resort to piracy to survive. Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish-Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and they built a school and a church. The church was called \"Panagia i Kleftrina\" and was dedicated to the wives of the klephts, namely the pirates.\n\nIn 1828, the new Governor of Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias, sent Alexander Mavrocordatos with British and French ships to Crete to deal with the pirates. This expedition resulted in the destruction of all pirate ships at Gramvousa and the fort came under British control. On 5 January 1828, on Kapodistrias' orders Hatzimichalis Dalianis landed at Gramvousa with 700 men.\n\nDuring the Cretan revolt of 1878, only the forts at Gramvousa, Ierapetra, Spinalonga, Heraklion, Rethymnon, Izeddin, Hania, and Kissamos could not be captured by the insurgents because they did not have the necessary artillery.\n\nThere is a lagoon, named the Balos lagoon, between the island and the coast of Crete. There is an islet which forms part of a cape, through the lagoon, called Cape Tigani (which means \"frying pan\" in Greek). North of Balos, at the Korykon cape, are the ruins of the small ancient Roman city of Agnion, with a temple to the god Apollo.\n\n\n"}

He retired from the Australian National University in 1991.\n\nHarold Brookfield grew up in North London, England and attended Minchenden Grammar School from 1937–1943. Apparently remaining in London through the war, he took a BSc degree in geography, graduating in 1945 from the London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London at age 19 or 20. His PhD followed in 1950, a study of post-eighteenth century urban development in coastal Sussex. However interests soon shifted to rural issues in developing nations.\n\nHis academic positions were:\n\nHe was also an Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex in the 1970s, and led the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme in Fiji.\n\nBrookfield's research was primarily dedicated to the study of rural societies and the environment in developing nations. He emphasises field studies at the microlevel, drawing on understandings from a range of disciplines. He developed close comparative research methods, identified with cultural ecology to understand rural societies and particularly food-getting activities and farming systems. Brookfield wrote that his abiding concern was the ‘… adaptation of the use and management of land to variability and change in society, economy and natural environment’; this he called the ‘soul’ of geography (Brookfield, 2004, 40). He was always ‘… drawn back to the practice and often times humbling experience of fieldwork in distant farmlands, forests, islands and mountains of the developing world’ (Connell and Waddell, 2005, 130). Particularly while working at the ANU, beginning in Papua New Guinea, he worked on the 'how' and the 'why' of land use, agrarian systems, and rural development. This came to be known as the 'Brookfield school' of analysis.\n\nBrookfield’s book ‘Interdependent Development’, written in 1975 was lauded as a classic (Corbridge, 1996; O’Connor, 1996). It started a ‘… theoretical backlash against the irrelevance of several geographical traditions’, and argued for a more historical and green/environmental perspective, based on empirical research (Connell and Rugendyke, 2005, 58). His collaboration with Piers Blaikie produced one of the key political ecology texts, 'Land Degradation and Society' in 1987.\n\nThe United Nations University's Project on People, Land, Management and Environmental Change (PLEC) was a major comparative initiative begun by Brookfield and others, looking at different land use trajectories and how farming actually creates positive biodiversity in the tropics. It promoted farmers as experts. It started in 1992 and was latterly funded by the Global Environmental Facility until 2002. It has resulted in many substantial works.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9888521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9888521", "title": "Hogback (geology)", "text": "Hogback (geology)\n\nIn geology and geomorphology, a hogback or hog's back is a long, narrow ridge or a series of hills with a narrow crest and steep slopes of nearly equal inclination on both flanks. Typically, the term is restricted to a ridge created by the differential erosion of outcropping, steeply dipping (greater than 30–40°), homoclinal, and typically sedimentary strata. One side of a hogback (its backslope) consists of the surface (bedding plane) of a steeply dipping rock stratum called a dip slope. The other side (its escarpment, frontslope or \"scarp slope\") is an erosion face that cuts through the dipping strata that comprises the hogback. The name \"hogback\" comes from the Hog's Back of the North Downs in Surrey, England, which refers to the landform's resemblance in outline to the back of a hog. The term is also sometimes applied to drumlins and, in Maine, to both eskers and ridges known as \"horsebacks\".\n\nHogbacks are a typical regional topographic expression of outcrops of steeply dipping strata, commonly sedimentary strata, that consist of alternating beds of hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. sandstone and limestone, and either weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. shale, mudstone, and marl. The surface of a hard, erosion-resistant layer forms the back slope (dip-slope) of the hogback where weaker strata have been preferentially stripped off of it by erosion. The opposite slope that forms the front of a hogback, which is its escarpment or scarp, consists of a slope that cuts across the bedding of the strata. Because of the steeply dipping nature of the strata that forms a hogback, a slight shift in location may take place as the landscape is lowered by erosion, but it will be a matter of feet rather than miles, as might happen with cuestas.\n\nAll gradations occur between hogbacks, homoclinal ridges, and cuestas. The differences between these landforms are related to the steepness in dip of the resistant beds from which they have been eroded and to their geographic extent. Where each type occurs depends upon whether the local rock attitudes are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact angle of dip and slope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms can be found in the scientific literature. In addition, it also can be difficult to distinguish immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms.\n\n\n\n\nDinosaur Ridge is a well known hogback that is part of Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark within Morrison, Colorado. It is a hogback formed by the differential erosion of well-cemented sandstones of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation, which form the dip slope of this hogback, overlying the less erosion-resistant and interbedded mudstone, siltstone, and thinly-bedded sandstones of the Morrison Formation of Jurassic age. Dinosaur Ridge is only a short segment of the Dakota Hogback that extends the length of the Front Range from Wyoming to southern Colorado.\n\nThe Grand Hogback is a 70-mile-long ridge located in western Colorado. It marks part of the boundary between the Colorado Plateau to the west and the Southern Rocky Mountains to the east.\n\nWhile most hogbacks snake along a surface in a relatively sinuous line, a few, such as those in Sundance, Wyoming, encircle a dome. The Dakota Sandstone Hogback encircles the Black Hills, an elliptical dome spanning from northwestern South Dakota to northeastern Wyoming. The Black Hills are approximately 125 miles long and 65 miles wide. The Dakota Hogback ridge formed when the resistant sandstones of the Dakota Sandstone and underlying strata were uplifted near the center of the present-day Black Hills because of a granite intrusion, approximately 60 million years ago. The Black Hills are the easternmost segment of the Laramide orogeny. The Dakota hogback rim separates the surrounding flat plains from the two-mile-wide Red Valley trench of the Black Hills. The ridge \"presents a steep face towards the valley and rises several hundred feet above it.\n\nGreen Mountain (Google Maps), also known as the Little Sundance Dome, is found just east of Sundance, Wyoming. It is a circular dome about 1800m across and 1400m wide surrounded by a rim of triangular hogbacks (similar in appearance to flatirons). Green Mountain itself, much like the nearby Black Hills, is a laccolith formed by the intrusion of magma into the Earth's crust.\n\n"}

An outcome of globalization and free trade, the phenomenon may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production. The principal effect and intent of these actions is to make labor rates \"more competitive\" (i.e. lower), the principal cost of business, together with other factors (pensions, environmental protection and other externalities), and thus the metaphor where the bottom is the lowest wage that can be paid for that labor.\n\nThe concept of a regulatory \"race to the bottom\" emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century, when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. Some described the concept as the \"race to efficiency\", and others, such as Justice Louis Brandeis, as the \"race to the bottom\".\n\nIn the late 19th century, joint-stock company control was being liberalised in Europe, where countries were engaged in competitive liberal legislation to allow local companies to compete. This liberalization reached Spain in 1869, Germany in 1870, Belgium in 1873, and Italy in 1883. In 1890, New Jersey enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower franchise taxes than other states. Delaware attempted to copy the law to attract companies to its own state. This competition ended when Governor Woodrow Wilson tightened New Jersey's laws through a series of seven statutes.\n\nIn academic literature, the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by A.A. Berle and G.C. Means in \"The Modern Corporation and Private Property\" (1932), while the concept received formal recognition by the US Supreme Court in a decision of Justice Louis Brandeis in the 1933 case \"Ligget Co. v. Lee\" (288 U.S. 517, 558–559).\n\nBrandeis's \"race to the bottom\" metaphor was updated in 1974 by William Cary, in an article in the Yale Law Journal, \"Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware,\" in which Carey argued for the imposition of national standards for corporate governance.\n\nSanford F. Schram explained in 2000 that the term \"race to the bottom\":\n\nThe term has also been used to describe a similar type of competition between corporations. In 2003, in response to reports that British supermarkets had cut the price of bananas, and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations, Alistair Smith, international co-coordinator of Banana Link, said \"The British supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom. Jobs are being lost and producers are having to pay less attention to social and environmental agreements.\"\n\nAnother example is the cruise industry, which registers its ship with flags of convenience, circumventing wage requirements, and other expenses required by developed countries, thus providing the business model for the industry.\n\nThe term has also been used in the context of a trend for some European states to seize refugees' assets.\n\nThe race to the bottom has been a tactic widely used among states within the United States of America. The race to the bottom in environmental policy involves both scaling back policies already in place and passing new policies that encourage less environmentally friendly behavior. Some states use this as an economic development strategy, especially in times of financial hardship. For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker decreased state environmental staff’s capacity in order to accelerate the approval time for a proposed development. Pursuing a race to the bottom philosophy in environmental politics allows states to foster economic growth, but has great consequences for the environment of that state. Conversely, some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy, which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level, with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states. When a state pursues either a race to the bottom or a race to the top strategy, it speaks to its overall environmental agenda.\n\n\n"}

Long-range aircraft fly between Cape Town, South Africa and either the Troll Airfield, located at the Troll research station, or the runway at the Novolazarevskaya Station. From these two main airfields, smaller aircraft may fly further to other Antarctic destinations.\n\nThrough the Troll Airfield, Norway's Troll station serves as a major hub of the DROMLAN network. Research at Troll include air and atmospheric measurements, monitoring of greenhouse gases and bird colonies, as well as meteorological and climate research. The other Norwegian station, Tor, was established for researching birds at the breeding colony in Svarthamaren Mountain. Activities conducted by Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station include environmental monitoring, geodesy/mapping, geomagnetic and meteorological observations, glaciology, biology, ionosphericauroral observations, limnology, geology, geophysics and seismology.\n\nSouth Africa's SANAE IV station, the successor to three former stations, was completed in 1997. Research at SANAE IV include invasion biology/ecology, geology, geomorphology and atmospheric sciences. Its facilities include a small hospital and a two-helicopter hangar. SANAE IV consists of three linked modules, each double-story, long and wide. Two smaller nearby structures contain the satellite dish used for communications and the diesel fuel bunkers. Joined end-on-end in a north-south orientation, the base modules are complemented on the northern end by a large raised helicopter landing area with a lifting section allowing vehicles to be brought up into the hangar for maintenance. C-block, the northern-most module, contains the neutron monitors of the North-West University. The modules are linked by single-story connections that also serve as entrances with stairways down to the surface 4m below the base. Each link contains an entrance hall with two sets of doors (creating a rudimentary 'air-lock' to prevent excessive cooling when entering and exiting the base) as well as a change-room, ablution facility and electronic distribution boards. The base is staffed and maintained year-round by a team of scientists and support personnel. Each overwintering team arrives during the summer expedition and take-over period aboard the research and logistics vessel \"S. A. Agulhas II\", stays at the base through the austral winter and returns to South Africa at the end of the next summer season - an expedition of approximately 16 months.\n\nThe Swedish Wasa station and the Finnish Aboa station together make up the Nordenskiöld Base, and cooperate in research and logistics. Research carried out includes geodesy/mapping, glaciology, human biology, meteorological observations, geology and geophysics.\n\nThe German Neumayer-Station III, finished in 2009, succeeded two former stations that were buried by snow and ice. It conducts geophysical, meteorological and seismological research, as well as air chemistry measurements and atmospheric ozone monitoring. Germany's other station, Kohnen, was opened as part of a major ice-drilling project.\n\nIt is named after geophysicist Georg von Neumayer. The station's assembly kit was transported to its current position early in November 2007. It is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year towards the open sea. After almost ten years of work on the project, beginning in October 1999, including conception, environmental impact assessment, planning and construction phases, regular operation of the station began on 20 February 2009. The station replaces the Neumayer-Station II and the Georg-von-Neumayer-Station that preceded it. The expected lifespan of the station is 25 to 30 years and the entire project is estimated to cost €39 million.\n\nMaitri station succeeded Dakshin Gangotri station in 1989, India's first Antarctic base.

It also includes low-temperature engineering research that is relevant to conditions in the Himalayas.\n\nShowa Station is Japan's main research station in Antarctica. A vast array of research is conducted there, including upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy/mapping, oceanography, glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research. Japan's other station, Dome Fuji Station was opened as part of a major ice-coring project. It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Antarctica was established by Belgium as a project to promote polar sciences, as well as to demonstrate the possibility of building a Zero emission station. Research is conducted by an international team of scientists, studying climatology, glaciology and microbiology. It went into service on February 15, 2009. The station, designed, built and operated by the International Polar Foundation, is the first polar base that combines eco-friendly construction materials, clean and efficient energy use, optimization of the station's energy consumption and clever waste management techniques through the use of a micro smart grid. The station is connected to nine wind turbines that stretch out along the Utsteinen ridge. It houses up to 16 scientists at a time. \nThe station is built against a ridge (The Utsteinen ridge) that is exposed to gales of up to . The station can withstand such strong winds through its aerodynamic shape and its foundation anchoring of several metres deep into the permafrost. Philippe Samyn, a Belgian architect, was involved in designing the shell and underlying structure. The upper deck of the building is the actual station and looks over the ridge edge. The lower deck contains a garage for snowcat vehicles and other utilities. The station is named after Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, Princess of Belgium, the eldest daughter and heiress apparent of Philippe, King of the Belgians.\n\nKohnen-Station is a German summer-only station, able to accommodate up to 20 people. It is named after the geophysicist Heinz Kohnen (1938–1997), who was for a long time the head of logistics at the Alfred Wegener Institute. The station opened in 2001, and is the logistic base for the ice coring project in Dronning Maud Land, the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA).

It lies north-west of Anguilla across the Dog and Prickly Pear Passage. The distance to Dog Island, the next nearest island of Anguilla, is .\n\nSombrero is long north-south, and wide. The land area is . Originally, when viewed from the sea, the island had the shape of a sombrero hat but guano mining operations have left the island with precipitous sides and a relatively flat top that is above sea level. The surface of the island is rough, and vegetation is sparse.\n\nThe guano-mining operation yielded some 3000 tons of phosphate a year by 1870. By 1890, the phosphate reserves had been exhausted.\n\nThe lighthouse marks the Anegada Passage, which is the route from Europe into the Caribbean. The first lighthouse was erected in 1868. In 1960, Hurricane Donna damaged this lighthouse, with the result that a new lighthouse replaced it in 1962. The lighthouses were manned from 1868 to 2001. In that year, Trinity House donated and installed the current, automated tower, which is a round tower, painted white. Anguilla's Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources is responsible for the maintenance of the navigational aids.\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Sombrero passed into the hands of the British. Captain Warwick Lake of \"Recruit\" marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner \"Adams\" from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. Still, a court martial dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1814, and again in 1825, a British geologist surveyed the island and found that it abounded in guano and reported this to the British government.\n\nIn 1856 the Americans claimed the island, and in a very short period of time quarried 100,000 tons of phosphate that served as fertilizer for the exhausted lands of the Southern States. Uniquely, an important insurrection occurred when West Indian black workers revolted against the “slavery proclivities” of a white American superintendent vis-à-vis wage-earning free men. Four of the 200 workers \"fatally injured\" Superintendent Snow and commandeered the island and company money and stores.\n\nThe British later intervened and demanded compensation from the United States for the occupation. The conflicting claims to the island were settled in Britain's favour in 1867.\n\nSombrero, lying in the route of shipping from England to South and Central America, lay in an area with many hazards and in 1848 the Admiralty was asked to install a light on it. On 30 June 1859, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's ship \"Paramatta\" was wrecked on her maiden voyage on Horseshoe Reef, which resulted in another request to the Admiralty. The lighthouse was then built and first exhibited its light on the evening of 1 January 1868.\n\nIronically, \"Paramatta\" and the Lighthouse built following her demise were both constructed by the same shipyard, the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, on the banks of the River Lea in Blackwall, London. \"Paramatta\" was the last ship launched from their Middlesex bank, while the lighthouse was built on the Essex side, the yard occupying premises on either side of the river. In 1871, the lease of the island was sold for £55,000 and then sold again for £110,000 to the New Sombrero Phosphate Company, which led to litigation in \"Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co\" (1878) 3 App Cas 1218.\n\nFrom the early 1870s until 1885, a Cornish mining engineer, Thomas Corfield, was Superintendent of Sombrero. His duties included organizing the conveying of the guano to a spot which was convenient for loading the lighters to take the guano to the ships lying off the island, overseeing the construction of derricks and engine houses, and arranging for the laying of the tram lines for the wagons, which were loaded at the quarries. The guano was just piled in dumps near the engine houses and derricks. There was no semblance of a port and no beach.\n\nThe black workers were recruited from various islands and lived in wooden huts during their term of service. Stores and various supplies were obtained from a merchant at Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, a Mr Nesbit. The company's schooner \"Logos\" brought supplies and also took the black labourers to and from their homes on the other islands.\n\nThe superintendent's house was a wooden bungalow near the middle of the island, and around it were grouped the quarters of the technicians, store keepers, and lighthouse keepers, and other wooden buildings. On the side opposite to the main buildings was a small building for the superintendent. There was a wide veranda round the house and he used to live there with his family, except near the hurricane season.\n\nIn 1890, the phosphate works on the island were abandoned and by 1893 the lighthouse had come under the authority of the British Board of Trade, later the Department of Transport. Administration of the light was carried out by Trinity House. In 1931, the old light system was changed and improved to 200,000 candle power and the tower received its first major repair when the basement was encased in concrete.\n\nOn 20 July 1962, after the destruction caused by Hurricane Donna in 1960, the present lighthouse was put into operation and the old tower demolished on 28 July 1962. The lighthouse is located near the centre of the island, and reaches a height of almost above sea level. It protects ships passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea through the Anegada Passage. Full responsibility for the light passed from Trinity House to the Anguillan government on 1 December 2001.\nUntil recently the only inhabitants were the staff of the lighthouse but the light was automated in 2002 and now the island is uninhabited. The only visitors are the occasional fishermen, biologists engaged in fieldwork, and the occasional scuba group visiting the island for its interesting dive sites and post-apocalyptic surface.\nThe island is noted for the endemic Sombrero ameiva, a widespread and easily seen lizard species on the island. A recently discovered dwarf gecko, \"Sphaerodactylus\", may be endemic and has been tentatively named the Sombrero dwarf gecko. The Anguilla Bank anole also inhabits the island. This island also has a unique Lasioglossum bee.\n\nThe surrounding waters are feeding areas for hawksbill turtles. During the late Pleistocene, the island was inhabited by a now-extinct giant tortoise, \"Chelonoidis sombrerensis\".\n\nSombrero has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its breeding seabirds. The island has also been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2018. It supports internationally important numbers of:\n\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n"}

However, two of these federal subjects—the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol—are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation—two delegates each—in the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). They do, however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.\n\nThere are 6 types of federal subjects—22 republics, 9 krais, 46 oblasts, 3 federal cities, 1 autonomous oblast, and 4 autonomous okrugs.\n\nAutonomous okrugs are the only ones that have a peculiar status of being federal subjects in their own right, yet at the same time they are considered to be administrative divisions of other federal subjects (with Chukotka Autonomous Okrug being the only exception).\n\nOn March 18, 2014, as a part of the annexation of Crimea and following the establishment of the Republic of Crimea (an independent entity recognized only by Russia), a treaty was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea incorporating the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol as the constituent members of the Russian Federation. According to the Treaty, the Republic of Crimea is accepted as a federal subject with the status of a republic while the City of Sevastopol has received federal city status. Neither the Republic of Crimea nor the city of Sevastopol are politically recognized as parts of Russia by most countries.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, the administrative-territorial structure of Russia was regulated by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of August 17, 1982 \"On the Procedures of Dealing with the Matters of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of the RSFSR\". The 1993 Constitution, however, did not identify the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions as the responsibility of the federal government nor as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the subjects. This was interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions became solely the responsibility of the federal subjects. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:\n\nAutonomous okrugs and okrugs are intermediary units of administrative divisions, which include some of the federal subject's districts and cities/towns/urban-type settlements of federal subject significance.\n\nTypical lower-level administrative divisions include:\n\nIn the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004–2005, all federal subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of local self-government, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia. The reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified structure of the municipal government bodies by January 1, 2005, and a law enforcing the reform provisions went in effect on January 1, 2006. According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called \"municipal formations\") are as follows:\n\nTerritories not included as a part of municipal formations are known as \"inter-settlement territories\".\n\nThe Federal Law was amended on May 27, 2014 to include new types of municipal divisions:\n\nIn June 2014, Chelyabinsky Urban Okrug became the first urban okrug to implement intra-urban divisions.\n\nAll of the federal subjects are grouped into eight federal districts, each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.\n\nFor economic and statistical purposes the federal subjects are grouped into twelve economic regions. Economic regions and their parts sharing common economic trends are in turn grouped into economic zones and macrozones.\n\nIn order for the Armed Forces to provide an efficient management of military units, their training, and other operational activities, the federal subjects are grouped into five military districts. Each military district operates under the command of the district headquarters, headed by the district commander, and is subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\n\n\n"}

The series of protests originally began in February 2014 when hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protested due to high levels of criminal violence, inflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods because of policies created the Venezuelan government though the size of protests had decreased since 2014.\n\nIn the first two months of 2016, over 1,000 protests and dozens of looting incidents were recorded throughout Venezuela. Much of the looting occurred due to shortages in Venezuela with Venezuelans forced to stand in the sun for hours while waiting in line for scarce products. By September, Venezuela saw some of its largest protests in the country's history with over one million demonstrating on 1 September 2016 and 26 October 2016. Into November, protests ceased due to the Vatican-backed dialogue between the opposition and the Bolivarian government, though the talks began to fall apart by the end of December. The protests are listed below according to the month they had happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It includes Lake Ayding, , the second or third lowest depression on Earth. \nBy some measures, it is also the hottest and driest area in China during the summer.\n\nThe Turpan Basin is a fault-bounded trough located in the eastern part of the Tian Shan. It covers an area of . The surrounding mountain ranges are: the central Tian Shan in the west, the Bogda Shan in the north-west, the Haerlike Shan in the north-west, and the Jueluotage Shan in the south. Beyond the surrounding mountain ranges lie the Junggar Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin in the south.\n\nSome geographers also use the term Turpan-Hami Basin, which is understood as including the Turpan Depression along with the Hami Depression (located to the east of the Turpan Depression, and to the southwest of the city of Hami) and the Liaodong Uplift separating the two depressions. A source using this terminology gave the area of the Turpan Depression proper as , that of the Hami Depression as , and for the entire Turpan-Hami Basin, as .\n\nThe Turpan Basin formed in a shear zone during the Late Permian due to motion between the East European and the Angaran craton. It was subsequently deformed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates in the Cenozoic. In the latter deformation, a thrust fault belt running from east to west, the Flaming Mountains, was formed in the center of the basin. The Flaming Mountains are long and wide; the highest peak reaches an elevation of above sea level. The Turfan volcano is located near Turpan.\n\nAlso in the center of the basin lies the Ayding Lake (Moonlight Lake) which has an elevation of below sea level, the sixth lowest exposed elevation on the Earth's land surface. It is the lowest surface point in China.\n\nThe Shihongtan uranium ore deposit is located at the southwestern margin of the Turpan Depression, some south-southwest from Turpan City.\n\nThe ancient city of Gaochang was a key point on the ancient Silk Road and dates back to the 1st century BC. It was burnt down in wars in the 14th century. The Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves, which are located in the Flaming Mountains' Mutou Valley, about east of the city of Turpan, have been hewn into the rock from the Tang dynasty era up to the time of the Yuan dynasty (13th century). The caves are famous for their murals, which can still be found in about 40 of the 77 known caves. The desert climate has favored preservation of the content of the Astana-Karakhoja ancient tombs, which are located about 6 km from the ancient city of Gaochang. The tombs are the burial place for nobles, officials, and others who were interred there from the times of the Western Jin dynasty until the middle of the Tang dynasty era.\n\nThe Turpan Basin has a harsh, continental desert climate in which the precipitation is far less than the potential evaporation. At Turpan City, July is the hottest month with a 24-hour average temperature of and January the coldest with a 24-hour average temperature of . Monthly rainfall is highest in June, at and lowest in February and April, at . The annual average precipitation is only , falling on only 13 days per year. In contrast to this, the potential annual evaporation rate reaches . Because of its climate, the area is sometimes counted as one of the \"Furnaces of China\", although the locations included under this heading vary.\n\nOn the shores of Aydingkol Lake, reeds, tamarisks, saxauls, as well as other shrubs and weeds can be found. Away from sources of water, the Turpan Basin is not covered by vegetation. Consequently, agriculture is limited to oasis and depends on a sophisticated irrigation system known as the \"Karez System\". The irrigation water comes from the surrounding mountain ranges, in particular from the annual melting of the snow. The Karez System consists of wells, underground channels, ground canals, and small reservoirs, which use the natural slope of the terrain to sustain the water flow and guide the water right to the plants while minimizing evaporation all along the way. The historical record of the system extends back to the Han Dynasty. The number of Karez systems in the area is slightly below one thousand and the total length of the canals is about in length. The Karez System is therefore considered as one of the three great ancient projects in China along with the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. Recently, development of groundwater through tubewells has led to a general fall in water tables, and many karez systems have failed. Farming in the Turpan Basin is particularly famous for its fruit. Because of the dry and hot conditions, the fruits grown in the depression have very high concentrations of sugar. They are traditionally processed by drying in open drying barns. The cultivated fruit include: mulberry, peach, apricot, apple, pomegranate, pear, fig, walnut, as well as grapes, watermelons and muskmelons. Among the fruit, the grapes stand out: more than 100 varieties of grape are cultivated in the area and it accounts for 90% of China's seedless grape crop. Other specialty agricultural products of the region are Donghu Hami melons and long-staple cotton.\n\n\n"}
