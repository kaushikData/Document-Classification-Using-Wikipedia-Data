Its striking landscape draws travelers from around the world, making it one of the most visited locations in the region. It has been a center of local conservation efforts, and was granted temporary protected status in July 2007 by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests—the first step toward making it Madagascar's first natural monument.\n\nAlong the Avenue, over some 2633 metres, are 200-250 grandidieri trees, about 30 metres in height, endemic to Madagascar. Another 20–25 trees of this species grow in nearby rice paddies and meadows.\n\nBaobab trees, up to 2800 years old, known locally as \"renala\" (Malagasy for \"monkey of the forest\"), are a legacy of the dense tropical forests that once thrived on Madagascar. The trees did not originally tower in isolation over the sere landscape of scrub but stood in dense forest. Over the years, as the country's population grew, the forests were cleared for agriculture, leaving only the baobab trees, which the locals preserved as much for their own sake as for their value as a food source and building material.\n\nThe area is not a national park, and the trees are threatened by further deforestation, effluent from encroaching rice paddies and sugarcane plantations, and bush and forest fires. Despite its popularity as a tourist destination, the area has no visitor center or gate fees, and local residents receive little income from tourism. Conservation International in partnership with Fanamby, a Malagasy NGO, has launched an ecotourism project aimed at conservation of the area and economic improvement for the local community.\n\nSome 7 km to the northwest are the famous Baobab Amoureux, which are two \"Adansonia za\" trees twisted together. According to the legend these two loving baobabs came and grew together across the centuries. Baobabs found themselves after an impossible love between a young man and young woman of the nearby village. Both youths already had designated partners and had to marry separately in their respective villages. However, the impossible couple dreamed of a life and child together and asked the help of their god. Both baobabs were born and now live there for eternity as one as the couple always wished.\n\n"}

The forest region west of the gap is called the Upper Guinean forests or Guinean forest zone, and the portion east of the gap is called the Lower Guinean forests, Lower Guinean-Congolian forests, or Congolian Forest Zone.\n\nThe major city in the Gap is Accra. Several other cities, such as Kumasi, exist on the fringe of the Gap.\n\nThe dryness of the Dahomey Gap is unusual, given that it lies surrounded by a very wet monsoon belt on all sides, and no mountains block moisture. Yet, Accra in the heart of the Gap receives only 720 millimetres (28 inches) of rainfall per year — less than half the amount needed to sustain tropical rainforest (which would be expected at a latitude of 6° N).\n\nThe cause of the dryness of the Dahomey Gap can simply be explained thus:\n\n\nEvidence from biogeography suggests that the Dahomey Gap has had significance for up to 90 million years. Murphy and Collier, in their analysis of the Aplocheiloid fishes show a split in the African species which they attribute to the presence of an epicontinental sea between the late Cenomanian and early Eocene.\n\nThe Dahomey Gap has existed in its present form for only about four thousand years. For most of the Quaternary, dry conditions due to a much colder Atlantic Ocean (aided by extensive cold currents from ice sheets in Europe and North America) have meant that the present-day forest zone has supported very little or no rainforest. In interglacial periods, however, rainfall throughout West Africa has often been so heavy that the Gap has become wet enough to support rainforest, thus eliminating the savanna.\n"}

Throughout her life she worked for recognition of marginalised groups including women and Māori, and she published extensively on New Zealand historical geography and on Māori land issues.\n\nEvelyn Mary Dinsdale was born in Tauranga, New Zealand, on 5 December 1936. She was educated at Tauranga Primary School and Tauranga College, where she was one of the first non-Māori to join the local kapa haka group.\nShe then went to Canterbury University College, earning a master's degree with first class honours in geography in 1959. After earning this degree, she took a postgraduate teacher training course from Christchurch Teachers' College and taught briefly at Te Kuiti high school, fulfilling the requirements of the post primary teachers' bursary that had funded her education.\n\nDinsdale was awarded a Fulbright Travel Grant and a Smith-Mundt Grant from the United States government in 1960, freeing her to travel to Syracuse University, where she received her PhD in 1963 under the supervision of Donald Meinig. While in America, she demonstrated long poi swinging on television.\nSoon after her return to New Zealand, in 1964, she married Brian Stokes, changing her name to Evelyn Stokes; they had two children, Donald and Philip. Although Evelyn and Brian Stokes later divorced, Dr. Stokes continued to use her married name professionally for the rest of her career.\n\nStokes was appointed to a lecturership with the Auckland University, and taught for a year for their Waikato branch before becoming a member of the geography department at Waikato University when that university was founded in 1964. At Waikato, she worked hard to promote Māori studies and to integrate local Māori communities into the university's activities, and she continued to serve as a faculty member for nearly 41 years, the longest tenure among the Waikato staff. In 1969 she was promoted to Senior Lecturer, and in 1975 to Reader. In the early 1970s, unusually for geography departments in New Zealand, the department at Waikato split into two, with physical geography moving to the Department of Earth Sciences; Stokes remained with the renamed Department of Human Geography and Environmental Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Johnson recalls her as \"a wise but stroppy woman, someone who would have no truck with fools but who opened her heart, her mind and her home to those whose intellect and politics she respected\", and she was known as the \"kuia\" (a Māori word for a wise old woman) of the geography department.\n\nStokes was founding editor of the \"New Zealand Journal of Geography\", which she formed from what was previously a pamphlet, the \"New Zealand Geographical Society Record\", and for 10 years she served as its editor.\nTwo major areas of Stokes' academic publication were on the history of the Tauranga area of New Zealand and of the Māori. She edited \"Te Raupatu o Tauranga Moana\", a collection of written works related to the Tauranga area, her Masters thesis work was on settlements in the Tauranga area, and in 1980 she published a book on the history of Tauranga County which Bedford calls \"the definitive history\" of the area and for which she received the J. M. Sherrard \"Major Award\" in regional history. Māori resource use more generally was the subject of over 30 of her papers.\n\nAnother of Stokes' many interests was geography education at the secondary school level. She published a series of 20 papers aimed at the curricular needs for this level in both the \"New Zealand Journal of Geography\" and the \"New Zealand Geographer\", and served from 1976 to 1987 as a member of New Zealand's National Geography Curriculum Committee.\n\nAn early experience that shaped Stokes' feminist views was her service as a high school teacher, for which she was paid £100 less per year than men with equivalent levels of experience due to her gender.\nWith Anne Magee, Stokes helped establish gender studies and feminist studies at the University of Waikato in the late 1970s, and from an early date she pushed for feminist perspectives in geography. In 1987 Stokes and four colleagues published a \"collective statement\" on feminist geography in the \"New Zealand Geographer\"; Longhurst and Johnston provide a retrospective look at her work in this area.\n\nStokes also played an important part in building up the map collection of the University of Waikato: in 1964 she and Michael Selby transferred the New Zealand Geographic Society's collection to Waikato, she was the society's map librarian from 1966 to 1983, and she frequently added to the library with purchases from her travels abroad. Robson writes that \"without her Waikato may never have had a Map Library or, at least, it would have been only a much poorer one\", and Bedford adds that \"her passion for maps has kept a tradition of cartography very much alive for almost 40 years in Waikato's Geography Department\". Bedford also states that \"her publications are renowned for the meticulous and innovative cartography\", and that her skills in this area were put to good use in her service on the editorial committee for the \"New Zealand Historical Atlas\" (1991–1997).\n\nIn Stokes' capacity as a member of the Ngāti Tahu Tribal Trust (on which she served from 1980 to 1991) she helped negotiate a major lease of Māori land for the Ohaaki geothermal power plant, a change from previous practices in which the land ownership was transferred to the government. She also worked closely with two other\nMāori tribes, the Ngāti Tūwharetoa and the Ngāti Hauā, whose chief Wiremu Tamihana was the subject of a major biography published by Stokes.\n\nFor nearly 16 years, Stokes served as a member of the Waitangi Tribunal, the New Zealand government commission that adjudicates Māori land claims with respect to the Treaty of Waitangi. Stokes' research on the history of Tauranga County related closely to her work on an important tribunal case on the confiscation of land in the Tauranga area,\nand her experience with the Ngāti Tahu and Ngāti Tūwharetoa helped guide her work with the Waitangi Tribunal on other cases involving geothermal resources. As part of the Waitangi Tribunal, Stokes worked on major reports on Pouakani, Muriwhenua, Te Maunga railways, Turangi township, Mohaka ki Ahuriri, Kaipara, and Hauraki, taking an important role in drafting the reports on these cases.\n\nStokes served as well for many years on the New Zealand Geographic Board, the body charged with assigning official place names in New Zealand. During her tenure on the board, she helped guide it towards the restoration of indigenous names for places that had been renamed as part of the English colonisation of New Zealand.\n\nIn 1990, the University of Waikato awarded Stokes a personal chair \"in recognition of her outstanding contribution to research and teaching\". In the same year she was also awarded the New Zealand Commemoration Medal. In 1999, the New Zealand government made her Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit \"for services to tertiary education and Māori;” she was the last woman in New Zealand to be made a dame before that title was replaced by \"distinguished companion\" in 2001.\n\nIn 2001 the New Zealand Geographical Society honoured her with the Distinguished New Zealand Geographer Medal and with life membership in the society; she was the second academic to be so honoured. At that time, Garth Cant remarked that \"no one within geography has made a more substantial and sustained contribution to the wholeness and wellbeing of this nation we call Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s than Dame Evelyn Stokes\".\n\nA special issue of \"New Zealand Geographer\" (volume 61, issue 2, August 2005) was devoted to \"Evelyn Stokes and Geography at the University of Waikato\". Although the articles in it were written prior to Stokes' death, it was not published until soon after her death. On her death, Stokes was honoured with a tangi, a formal three-day Māori funeral ceremony, on Te Kohinga Mārama marai.\n\nIn 2006, the University of Waikato inaugurated a lecture series and doctoral scholarship in Stokes' memory. The first lecture in the series, by Malcolm McKinnon, president of the Professional Historians' Association of New Zealand / Aotearoa, was entitled \"Mapping the Past: Evelyn Stokes and the History of Aotearoa\".\n\nStokes Peak, a mountain in the Kaimai Ranges directly above the Kaimai Tunnel near Tauranga, was named in her honour in 2010 by the New Zealand Geographic Board; however the name was discontinued in 2012 after objections from the Ngāti Hinerangi.\n\n"}

The association aims at promoting the exchange of medical knowledge and biomedical technology between industry nations and countries with a low health standard, such as Mongolia, Panama, Bolivia and Yemen.\n\nInfectious diseases are worldwide a major cause of death, especially in developing countries. Next to inexpensive drugs, there is an urgent need for affordable diagnostic methods. Recent progress in biomedical research led to new techniques highly appropriate for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. These new methods are advantageous not only because they lead to results in short time, but also because they are affordable and applicable under conditions of poverty. Major objective of GEFEK is the transfer of this knowledge to scientists in low-income countries and to establish the new technology in a way that it can be performed without help from abroad. The transfer includes information on the theoretical background, the performance of molecular diagnostic methods and the knowledge for the production of the necessary test substances. The self-contained operation of this technology by the affected population is the best guarantee for their sustainable application.\n\nIn contrast to other organisations, which provide help directly in crisis regions, the contribution of GEFEK consists in the transfer of basic medical knowledge and technology, in order to help the people in poor countries according to the principle \"help to self-help\". A lot of health problems are not due in the first instance to a lack of medicines, but rather to the lack of appropriate methods for the diagnosis of the affecting diseases. Frequently, there are no adequate diagnostic methods available which could be used, or the available methods are inaffordable, this means, considerably more expensive than the needed drugs. GEFEK not only teaches physicians and technical personal but also the new scientific generation, i.e. students in medicine and other health-related disciplines.\n\nMembers of GEFEK are cooperating with doctors from the Health Science University of Mongolia in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The objective of the common efforts is a countrywide evaluation of the distribution of most important infectious diseases, to enable specific control measures against these major causes of morbidity in the population. Within this cooperation and thanks to private donations, a laboratory in Ulaanbaatar was completely equipped with apparatuses needed for adequate performance of molecular diagnosis. Members of GEFEK were there repeatedly (2004 and 2005) to install the technology and to train Mongolian scientists. In this laboratory it is meanwhile possible to diagnose all important sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, brucellosis, several respiratory pathogens and several diarrhoeal diseases. All these methods are specially designed to be used under limited technical and economical conditions. In the long term it is planned to enable Mongolian scientists to produce all substances needed for the continuation of the diagnosis themselves, such as recombinant diagnostic antigens, or Taq polymerase. In the future, this may make the country independent from help from abroad.\n\nThe population of Bolivia suffers from a multiplicity of infectious diseases, such as Chagas disease. Because of its inapparent symptoms, the disease remains unrecognised most of the time and, untreated, leads after about 20 years to death, mainly due to heart pathologies. It is probably one of the major reasons for the extreme low average age of the population of 34 years only. Further prevalent existing diseases are malaria and, especially among young children, life-threatening diarrhoeal diseases, caused by entamoeba, bacteria or rotavirus. Tuberculosis, dengue fever and different forms of hepatitis are also wide spread. The diagnostic methods developed by GEFEK can be very useful for the fight against Chagas disease. A cooperation has been arranged with the national Chagas disease control initiative at the Universidad Mayor de San Simón, in Cochabamba.\n\nIn July 2006, a one-week practical course was organised at the Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí in David, Panama. About 20 students and 3 professors participated in the course. Although Panama belongs to the richest countries in Central America, the general medical care – except of Panama City - is not well developed.

Among his most prominent books are \"The Character of Egypt\", \"Studies of the Arab World\", and \"The Contemporary Islamic World Geography\", which form a trilogy on Egypt's natural, economic, political and cultural character and its position in the world.\n\nHamdan was born in the Qalyubia Governorate on February 4, 1928. His father, a teacher of Arabic language, had been discharged from Al Azhar educational institution on charges of participating in demonstrations in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.\n\nAt the age of eight, he joined the primary school. He then moved to the prestigious Tawfiqiyya secondary school, which had a nationwide fame for its high educational standard and sports facilities. There, he became aware of his love and innate talent for geography.\n\nHaving completed his secondary education in 1944, with distinction, ranking sixth on the list of graduates nationwide, he joined the Department of Geography at the Cairo University. Faculty of Arts.\n\nAt the age of twenty, he obtained his B.A. with Distinction.\n\nHe was soon appointed a staff member at Faculty of Arts, where he was granted a scholarship at the University of Reading, UK to obtain his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. There, he was a student of the eminent English geographer, professor Austen Miller.\n\nHemdan’s intellectual and geographical achievements constituted the most important accomplishment of the Egyptian geographical school, that stresses Egypt’s uniqueness and singularity in terms of time and place, of geography and history. In his works, he adopted a multi-disciplinary approach, encompassing geography, history, sociology, politics and culture.\n\nHemdan’s writings clearly manifested a unique wealth of knowledge, an immense power of meditation and observation and a distinct, devoted love of Egypt. His was the connoisseur’s love of the components of a unique gem. Utilizing these exceptional resources, Hemdan could delineate and interpret the Egyptian personality as influenced by location and geographical considerations.\n\nHemdan left behind a rich legacy of writing in both Arabic and English languages, including seventeen books in Arabic and eight in English, in addition to several articles in Arabic, published in newspapers, magazines and other publications.\n\nIt is worthy of note that he had a futuristic outlook in his writings. He predicted several events, which, he thought, were compatible or incompatible with the facts of geography. Chief of these was his prediction of the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\nHis encyclopedic work \"The Personality of Egypt\", the most outstanding of his intellectual achievements, was the product of ten years of dedicated efforts, during which time he used 245 Arabic language and 691 foreign reference books in several languages. In this prestigious book, he elaborately expounded the constituent factors making-up the Egyptian personality since the early days of the Pharaohs. To him, Egypt was the central chapter of the book of geography, that turned into the opening chapter of the book of history, maintaining all through a coherent civilization across history. Egypt, to Hemdan was a unique unrepetitive geographical anomaly. Apart from the “Description of Egypt”, which appeared in print during the French Expedition to Egypt, this book remains an unprecedented scientific masterpiece on Egypt.\n\nDr. Gamal Hemdan won several scientific prizes and merit awards including:\n\nState Incentive Prize for Arts and Letters, 1959.\nState Merit Prize for Social Science, 1986.\nScientific Criticism Award, by the State of Kuwait, 1986.\nOrder of Merit of the First Class for Science and Arts, 1988. In line with his full dedication to science and his almost ascetic attitude to formalities, he refused to break up with his self-imposed solitude. Apart from the first prize awarded to him in 1959, he refused to receive any of the other prizes.\n\nHemdan died on April 17, 1993. His works had a far-reaching impact on the entire field of social sciences that was almost tantamount to a revolution in geography. With his unique literary style, Dr. Hemdan turned the science of geography into a universal, encyclopedic social science. Taking geography as an access road to other branches, he skilfully used this multi-disciplinary approach to study Egypt’s location, history, culture and future.\n\nHis body was found with its lower half burned, everyone thought that Dr.Hemdan died of his burns, but Dr.Yosef ElGendy \"Giza health inspector\" proved in his report that the deceased did not die from asphyxiation by gas, and the burns are not the cause of his death, because it did not reach the degree of causing death.\n\nClose people to Dr.Hemdan discovered the disappearance of some of the drafts of the books he was about to finish, and on top of it was topics about Judaism and Zionism, knowing that the fire that broke out in the apartment did not turn up books and papers D. Hamdan, which means the disappearance of the drafts by the active and until this moment no one knew the cause of death, nor where drafts of the books about the Jews.\n\nEverybody was surprised when the former intelligence chief \"Amin Howeidi\" said he knew about how Dr.Hemdan died, and he assured that he had the evidence that confirmed that Dr.Hemdan was killed by the Mossad 'Israeli intelligence'.\n\n\n\n"}

Much of the population of Botswana is concentrated in the eastern part of the country.\n\nSunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.\n\nBotswana is semi-arid, due to the short rain season. However, the relatively high altitude of the country and its continental situation gives it a subtropical climate. The country is remote from moisture-laden air flows for most of the year. The dry season lasts from April to October in the south and to November in the north where, however, rainfall totals are higher. The south of the country is most exposed to cold winds during the winter period (early May to late August) when average temperatures are around . The whole country has hot summers with average temperatures around . Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.\n\nThe land is predominantly flat to gently undulating tableland, although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The Kalahari Desert is in the central and the southwest. The Okavango Delta, one of the world's largest inland deltas, is in the northwest and the Makgadikgadi Pans, a large salt pan lies in the north-central area.

The official name of the standard is \"Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 1: Country codes\". It defines three sets of country codes:\n\nThe alphabetic country codes were first included in ISO 3166 in 1974, and the numeric country codes were first included in 1981. The country codes have been published as ISO 3166-1 since 1997, when ISO 3166 was expanded into three parts, with ISO 3166-2 defining codes for subdivisions and ISO 3166-3 defining codes for former countries.\n\nAs a widely used international standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards and used by international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information. However, it is not the only standard for country codes. Other country codes used by many international organizations are partly or totally incompatible with ISO 3166-1, although some of them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.\n\nCurrently 249 countries, territories, or areas of geographical interest are assigned official codes in ISO 3166-1. According to the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA), the only way to enter a new country name into ISO 3166-1 is to have it registered in one of the following two sources:\n\nTo be listed in the bulletin \"Country Names\", a country must be at least one of the following:\n\n\nThe list of names in \"Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use\" of the UN Statistics Division is based on the bulletin \"Country Names\" and other UN sources.\n\nOnce a country name or territory name appears in either of these two sources, it will be added to ISO 3166-1 by default.\n\nThe ISO 3166/MA may reserve code elements for other entities that do not qualify for inclusion based on the above criteria. For example, because the European Union is not a country, it is not formally included in ISO 3166-1, but for practical reasons, the ISO 3166/MA has \"reserved the two-letter combination for the purpose of identifying the European Union within the framework of ISO 3166-1\".\n\nISO 3166-1 is published officially in both English and French. Since the second edition of ISO 3166-1, the following columns are included for each entry:\n\nThe country names used in ISO 3166-1 are taken from the two UN sources mentioned above. Some country names used by the UN, and accordingly by ISO, are subject to dispute:\n\nThe codes are chosen, according to the ISO 3166/MA, \"to reflect the significant, unique component of the country name in order to allow a visual association between country name and country code\". For this reason, common components of country names like \"Republic\", \"Kingdom\", \"United\", \"Federal\" or \"Democratic\" are normally not used for deriving the code elements. As a consequence, for example, the United Kingdom is officially assigned the alpha-2 code rather than , based on its official name \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" (although is reserved on the request of the United Kingdom). Some codes are chosen based on the native names of the countries. For example, Germany is assigned the alpha-2 code , based on its native name \"Deutschland\".\n\nThe following is a complete ISO 3166-1 encoding list of the countries which are assigned official codes. It is listed in alphabetical order by the country's English short name used by the ISO 3166/MA.\n\n\"Note: Each country's alpha-2 code is linked to more information about the assignment of its code elements.\"\n\nBesides the officially assigned codes, code elements may be expanded by using either reserved codes or user-assigned codes.\n\nReserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. Codes are usually reserved for former countries, overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status. The reserved alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes can be divided into the following four categories \"(click on the links for the reserved codes of each category)\":\n\nUser-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following codes can be user-assigned:\n\nThe ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A country is usually assigned new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries. In general, new alphabetic codes are assigned if a country changes a significant part of its name, while a new numeric code is assigned if a country changes its territorial boundaries. Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.\n\nISO used to announce changes in newsletters which updated the currently valid standard, and releasing new editions which comprise a consolidation of newsletter changes. As of July 2013, changes are published in the online catalogue of ISO only and no newsletters are published anymore. Past newsletters remain available through the search option on the ISO website.\n\n\n"}

They heard of a great lake, and imagined an enormous lake that would be the source of the Benue, Nile, Zambezi and Congo rivers. They drew a map showing a huge \"Lake Uniamesi\" that was published in 1855. The map spurred the expedition of Burton and Speke to investigate the African Great Lakes region, where they found that lakes Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa were separate bodies of water. It was not until 1877 that it was confirmed that these lakes did feed the Nile, Congo and Zambezi, albeit separately.\n\nThe Great Lakes of East Africa include lakes Albert, Edward, Kivu and Tanganyika, all of which lie in the western or Albertine branch of the East African rift system, Lake Victoria to the east of this chain and Lake Nyasa (Malawi) to the south. Lake Victoria is the third largest lake in the world, and lies on the plateau between the west and east rifts. Unlike the long, narrow and deep lakes of the rift, Lake Victoria is wide and relatively shallow.\n\nBantu peoples moved into the region between the Great Lakes and the Indian Ocean some time after 1000 BC and mingled with the local population. By the first century AD ships from the Arabian peninsula were trading along the East African coast. Muslim Arabs from Oman began to colonize the coast in the 8th century AD. The coastal Bantu peoples intermarried with the Arabs to form the Swahili people, with a language that combines Bantu, Arabic and Persian elements. The Swahili culture incorporated many Arabic and Islamic aspects, while remaining essentially Bantu in nature.\n\nThe Unyamwezi region lies around the modern town of Tabora, between the coast and Lake Tanganyika, and includes the Tabora, Nzega and Kahama districts of the western plateau of modern Tanzania. In the 19th century the inhabitants were called Nyamwezi people by outsiders, although this term covered various different groups. \nUnyamwezi lay at a juncture where a trade route from the coast split, with one branch continuing west to the port of Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika while another branch led north to the kingdoms of Buganda and Bunyoro.\nCoastal traders settled in Unyamwezi, some with hundreds of well-armed retainers.\nThe Nyamwezi provided most of the porters for the caravans organized by the coastal Arabs and Swahilis, \nand also conducted their own caravans. The Nyamwezi were long-distance traders throughout East Africa.\n\nIvory was not widely used by the Nyamwezi, but at some point they became aware that there was an overseas market for the product, and began to carry ivory along the route from Tabora down to the Indian Ocean coast opposite Zanzibar. There are records of Sultan Sayyid Said of Zanzibar negotiating with envoys from Unyamwezi in 1839 for safe passage for caravans to the interior.\nThe Nyamwezi did not sell their own people as slaves, since they needed manpower for the ivory trade, but after the 1850s the slave trade began to become important. Slaves brought from the Congo Basin or the Great Lakes region would be held at Tabora, then sent down to the coast in small groups for onward shipment.\n\nEarly in 1844 Sultan Sayyid Said gave the German missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf (1810–1881) permission to establish a mission on the coast. Krapf arrived in Mombasa on 13 March 1844. He was joined in 1846 by Johannes Rebmann (1820–1876). On 12 November 1848 Rebmann started a journey into the interior. The \"Church Missionary Intelligencer\" reported that, \"The ultimate object, which our Missionaries had in view, has been to reach Uniamési, that interior country where the roads to East Africa and West Africa diverge.\" Uniamési was said to lie about 150 to 200 hours to the west of the Chagga kingdom, which lay on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\nOn 10 June 1849 Jakob Erhardt (1823–1901) and John Wagner arrived at the Rabbai Mpia mission station near Mombasa. Wagner died on 1 August 1849. In the spring of 1850 Erhardt and Krapf traveled by dhow down the East African coast from Mombasa. On the journey they met traders from Unyamwezi. Krapf recorded that caravans of three to four thousand men from Unyamwezi would arrive at the coast in December after a three-month journey, and would leave on the return journey in March or April. The Arabs of Zanzibar were hostile to Europeans reaching Unyamwezi. In 1847 they arranged for Washenzis to kill a French trader, Mr. Maison, on his way to the interior.\n\nThe missionaries were impatient to learn more about \"the great central country of Uniamési, whither converge the great rivers which have their embouchures on the western and eastern coasts... from which, according to the native conception, is an outlet to the four quarters of the globe.\" There seemed to be \"no doubt that the Natives of this central land traffic with the western as well as the eastern coast.\" In 1850 Krapf exclaimed that, \"Had we sufficient pecuniary means at our command, and were it not our bounden duty to subordinate all secondary objects to our chief vocation, which consists in the preaching of the Gospel, the map of East Africa would soon wear another aspect.\"\n\nKrapf wrote, \"I have lately perused a paper making the lake Niassa and that of Uniamesi appear as one and the same volume of water... from other native authorities I know at least that the Natives clearly distinguish between the Niassa and the Uniamesi lakes. But as I have made it a rule to distrust all native reports, until they be confirmed by personal observation, I shall say nothing more on this point.\" Later that year the \"Church missionary intelligencer\" published an account by Krapf of a journey to Ukambani that he had made in November and December 1849. He speculated that the Niger and its tributary the Tshadda (Benue), the Congo, Nile and Kilimani (Quelimane – near to the mouth of the Zambezi) would all provide access to the center of Africa.\n\nUniamési was thought to contain a great lake. Krapf said, \n\nJakob Erhardt spent six months at Tanga studying the Kisambara language, where he heard the stories of ivory traders who had visited the interior. According to Rebmann, whose account was published in Krapf's memoirs,\nErhardt was struck by the fact that various travelers who had gone inland from different points on the east coast of Africa had all come to an inland sea, and made a map based on available information, including the findings of Krapf and Rebmann. \nIn November 1854 while talking about the problem to Rebmann, \"at one and the same moment, the problem flashed on both of us solved by the simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain-land, we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea.\" On the map that he and Rebmann drew the three lakes are shown as one very large S-shaped lake.\n\nIn 1855 Erhardt was repatriated due to poor health, and took the map with him.\nRebmann wrote letters to the \"Calwer Missionary Intelligencer (Calwer Missionsblatt)\", received and published in 1855, in which he called the lake Uniamesi or Ukerewe. He said that according to accounts by traders, considered trustworthy by the missionaries, the lake extended from latitude 0.5°N to 13.5°S and from longitude 23.5°E to 36°E, and had an area of 13,600 German square miles, as compared to 7,860 German square miles for the Black Sea and 7,400 for the Caspian.\nThe map was first published in the \"Calwer Missionsblatt\" later in 1855, and then in the \"Church Missionary intelligencer\" in 1856. August Heinrich Petermann published the map in his \"Mittheilungen\", but warned that the missionaries may not have accounted sufficiently for exaggeration by their informants. He provided a supplementary sketch showing the lake extending from 7°S to 12°S and 22.5°E to 30.5°E, one third of Rebmann's estimated size.\n\nThe map was reproduced with commentary in other publications.Ferdinand de Lesseps saw a pen-and-ink version of the map made by \"Mr. Rehman of Moubar, on the Zanguebar coast.\" In a letter of April 1857 to the \"Académie des Sciences\" of Paris he commented that the inland sea would be larger than the Black Sea. He said, \"The existence of this sea was certified to me during my stay at Khartoum by a pilgrim from Mecca, who inhabits Central Africa, and who gave Mahmoud Pasha, one of the Viceroy's ministers, particulars corresponding to Mr. Rehman's map. This pilgrim added that he had seen larger vessels on the \"Uniamesi\" than that in which he had sailed down the Red Sea.\"\n\nThe reports of snow on mounts Kilimanjaro and Kenya, near to the equator, caused considerable controversy. Sir Francis Galton, who had won the Royal Geographical Society's gold medal in 1853 for his southwest African explorations, had Erhardt's map published in the society's \"Proceedings\". Galton was pressed to travel to Africa to confirm the report about Mount Kilimanjaro. He declined on the basis that he had not yet fully recovered his health from his previous expedition. Instead, the Royal Geographical Society persuaded the British government to provide ₤1,000 for an expedition by Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke to investigate the great lake, or lakes, and determine if they were the source of the Nile. The map came to be known as the \"slug map\" from the shape of the Uniamesi or Niassa inland sea. Burton called it the Mombas Mission Map.\n\nBurton and Speke reached Zanzibar on 20 December 1857, visited Rebmann at his Kisuludini mission station, and paid a visit to Fuga, capital of the Usambare kingdom. Burton met king Kimweri ye Nyumbai, once a powerful warrior who had controlled the trade routes to the interior but now extremely old. They left for the interior on 26 June 1858. After travelling through mountainous country they reached the inner plateau of Uniamesi. At the Arab trading post of Kazeh (now Tabora) they recorded an elevation of .\n\nAt Kazeh Burton and Speke found a mixed population of Nyamwezi, Tutsi and Arabs engaged in cattle farming and cultivation of foods such as rice, cassava, pawpaw and citrus. Burton called Unyamwezi the garden of inter-tropical Africa.\nThe land sloped down from there to Lake Takanyika [sic], or Uniamesi, which they reached on 3 March 1849 and where they recorded an elevation of .\n\nBurton and Speke found that the lake extended about north from Ujiji, where it was closed by a crescent-shaped mountain range. They were told by the local people that the lake reached down to latitude 8° south. Later David Livingstone was given consistent information by an Arab trader who had skirted the south of the lake, and a Swahili traveler also confirmed that the \"Taganyika\" was not connected to the Niassa to the south.\nBurton and Speke returned to Kazeh, where Burton was forced to rest while Speke traveled north to explore Lake Victoria (also called Lake Ukerewe), reaching it on 3 August 1849. Speke recorded an elevation of and was told that a river left the north of the lake and flowed into the Nile.\n\nThere was continued controversy about the Great Lakes and the rivers that fed and drained them. Speke made a long journey with James Augustus Grant between October 1860 and February 1863, traveling from the coast opposite Zanzibar via Tabora and Uganda to Khartoum. However, the question of whether the Nile issued from Lake Victoria was left uncertain.\nIn 1866–73 David Livingstone left the coast at Pemba, followed the Ruvuma River inland and walked to the southern end of Lake Nyasa, which he rounded to the west. He then traveled north to Lake Tanganyika. After lengthy explorations of the country southwest of Lake Tanganyika, with his health broken Livingstone reached Ujiji on the east of Lake Tanganyika, where he had his famous meeting with Henry Morton Stanley on 10 November 1871.\n\nVerney Lovett Cameron was sent in 1873 to assist David Livingstone. Shortly after he left Zanzibar he learned that Livingstone had died, but continued to Ujiji. He circumnavigated Lake Tanganyika and found that it had its outlet to the west, feeding into a tributary of the Congo River. Cameron went on to the Atlantic, becoming one of the first Europeans to make an east-west crossing of Equatorial Africa. It was not until Stanley circumnavigated Lake Victoria in 1874–1875 that it was confirmed that the lake was the source of the White Nile. With Stanley's return to Zanzibar in 1877 the last of the main questions surrounding the Great Lakes drainage had been settled. Krapf had conjectured there was one great lake feeding the Congo, Zambezi, Nile and Benue. There had turned out to be three great lakes, feeding the Congo, Zambezi and Nile.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

{"id": "27559396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27559396", "title": "List of decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina", "text": "List of decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nA select number of decisions from the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven to have a profound effect on legal and political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The notable decisions of the Court are listed in chronological order.\n\nOn 13 October 1997, the Croatian 1861 Law Party and the Bosnia-Herzegovina 1861 Law Party requested the Constitutional Court to annul several decisions and to confirm one decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more importantly, to review the constitutionality of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, since they alleged that the agreement violated the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a way that it undermined the integrity of the state and that it may cause the dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court reached the conclusion that it is not competent to decide the disputes in regard to the mentioned decisions, since the applicants were not subjects that were identified in Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution, in regard to those who can refer disputes to the Court. The Court also rejected the other request stating:\n\nThis was one of the early cases in which the Court had to deal with the question of the legal nature of the Constitution. By making the remark in the manner of \"obiter dictum\" concerning the Annex IV (the Constitution) and the rest of the peace agreement, the Court actually \"established the ground for \"legal unity\"\" of the entire piece agreement, which further implied that all the annexes are in the hierarchical equality. In later decisions the Court confirmed this by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis and not only in the context of systematic interpretation of the Annex IV. However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (Annex IV) came to power, and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court used the same reasoning to dismiss the similar claim in a later case.\n\nOn 12 February 1998, Alija Izetbegović, at the time Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted proceedings before the Constitutional Court for an evaluation of the consistency of the Constitution of the Republika Srpska and the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The request was supplemented on 30 March 1998 when the applicant specified which provisions of the Entities’ Constitutions he considered to be unconstitutional. The four partial decisions were made in a year 2000, by which many of articles of the constitutions of entities were found to be unconstitutional, which had a great impact on politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, because there was a need to adjust the current state in the country with the decision of the Court. There was a narrow majority (5-4), in the favor of the applicant. In its third partial decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nThe Court dealt with the following questions: the legal status entities, legal nature of the Constitution of B&H, prohibition of discrimination, equality of constituent peoples, the status of the orthodox church in RS and equality of language and script. The formal name of this item is \"U-5/98\", but it is widely known as the \"Decision on the constituency of peoples\" (), referring to the Court's interpretation of the significance of the phrase \"constituent peoples\" used in the Preamble of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was also the basis for other notable cases that came before the court.\n\nOn 11 February 1999, Mirko Banjac, at the time Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted a request for, among other issues, the evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministries of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina, No. 4/97\") which foresaw the existence of two Co-Chairs and a Vice-Chair of the Council of Ministers. In its decision the Court had, among other things, stated the following:\n\nThe Court gave the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina a three-month period from the date of publication of its decision on this matter in the \"Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina\" to bring the contested provisions of the Law in conformity with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the Parliamentary Assembly failed to do that the Court, acting upon the request of the applicant and pursuant to its decision of 14 August 1999 and the legal standpoint exemplified in the reasons of the decision, established that certain provisions of the Law on Ministers and Ministries shall cease to be valid.\n\nOn 20 April 1998, the Office of the Public Attorney of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina challenged the Decision of the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina in Case No. CH/96/30, claiming that it was not in conformity with the national laws and international conventions. The Constitutional Court had to decide whether it had an appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the later being an institution of a special nature also vested with judicial functions with respect to alleged violations of\nhuman rights as provided for in Annex 6 to the Dayton Agreement, unlike the Constitutional Court regulated in Annex 4 (the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina) of the same Agreement. In its majority decision (4-1), the Court had, among other things, held the following:\nThus, the Court held that it had no jurisdiction and that the appeal had to be rejected. The Court had recognized that the situation created by the Dayton Agreement might result in certain problems such as possible conflicting case law concerning some human rights issues, however it also concluded that the problem was mostly of a temporary nature since the Agreement foresaw the possibility of the transfer of the competence in this area to the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina dealing with human rights. The Human Rights Chamber of B&H existed in the period of 1996-2003, and after 1 January 2004 new cases alleging human rights violations are decided by the Constitutional Court of B&H.\n\nOn 7 February 2000, eleven members of the House of Representatives of the\nParliamentary Assembly of B&H initiated proceedings before the Constitutional Court for the evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on State Border\nService that was enacted by the High Representative for B&H on 13 January 2000, and later published in the Official Gazette of B&H. Among other issues, the applicants contended that the High Representative did not have the normative powers to impose a law in the absence of a vote by the Parliamentary Assembly. In its majority decision (7-2), the Court had, among other things, held the following:\n\nThus, although the Constitutional Court declined to review the \"exercise\" of the powers of the High Representative with regards the possible justification of his intervention in the legislative process of B&H, the Court did declare that it has the competency to review his actions when he acts as a legislator. The Court subsequently determined that the law reviewed was in conformity with the Constitution.\n\nOn 12 October 2000, thirty-four representatives of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska submitted a request to the Constitutional Court of B&H for the evaluation of the conformity of the Decision on Amending the Law on Travel Documents of B&H, adopted by the High Representative on 29 September 2000, with the Constitution of B&H. Besides the general claims that the High Representative can only interpret laws, and thus cannot create them, the applicants, among other issues, asserted that the High Representative cannot amend the Law on Travel Documents by a decision, since a decision represents an act of weaker legal force than laws. In its majority decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:\n\nThus, the Court held that the High Representative has the authority not only to enact the laws, but also to change them, and although the Court could not review the authority of the High Representative in that regard it could review the laws that he had enacted or changed. It also held that the Decision Amending the Law on Travel Documents of Bosnia and Herzegovina was in conformity with the Constitution of B&H.\n\nOn 27 March 2001, 37 representatives of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Federation of B&H, as well as Edhem Bičakčić, filed an appeal against the Decision of the High Representative for B&H to remove Edhem Bičakćić from the office of director general of \"Elektroprivreda BiH\" (public company for distribution of electric energy) and to prohibit him from holding any public or appointed office unless or until such time as the High Representative may expressly authorize him to hold such office. Bičakćić was removed on the grounds of criminal offenses that were allegedly committed during the performance of his duties as the Prime Minister of the Federation of B&H. The appellants alleged that the challenged Decision of the High Representative was unconstitutional in regard to both the competence to take such a decision and the substance of the decision, particularly because it was taken, in their opinion, without applying any criteria and without applying a fair procedure for establishing the truth. Thus, the applicants asked the Court to grant the appeals and quash the decision of the High Representative. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:\n\nThus, the Constitutional Court held that it cannot review a decision of the High Representative to remove a public official under Article VI.3 (a) Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn 2005, Milorad Bilbija and Dragan Kalinić lodged appeals before the Constitutional Court against decisions of ordinary courts that had dismissed their appeals against the decisions of the High Representative concerning them. Bilbija was removed by the decision of the High Representative from his position of Deputy Head of the Operative Administration of the Intelligence and Security Agency in Banja Luka and from other public and party positions, while Kalinić was removed from his position as Chairman of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska and President of the Serbian Democratic Party. Both were also barred from other public and party duties that they were performing, and from holding any official, elective or appointive public office and from running in elections and from office within political parties unless or until such time the High Representative, by his subsequent decision, expressly authorizes them to do or hold the same, also ending any entitlements they had to receive remuneration or any privileges or status they had from those positions. Both complained that this violated their rights to effective legal remedy, to a fair trial, to no punishment without law, to freedom of expression, to freedom of assembly and association, to non-discrimination and to free elections. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:\n\nThus, the Court held that the appellants’ right to an effective legal remedy under Article 13 of the European Convention has been violated, and that Bosnia and Herzegovina had a positive obligation to protect the constitutional rights of appellants in that regard. Up until this decision the Court had been rejecting the appeals lodged against the Decisions of the High Representative, initially finding itself not competent and subsequently holding that those appeals were premature. The Court however did not decide in merits on what standard of human rights the High Representative was to comply with, nor did it order the establishment of independent judicial body to review decisions of the High Representative in similar cases. Decision of the Court led to a vigorous response from the High Representative: on 23 March 2007 he issued a decision removing any practical effect from the Courts decision. Kalinić and Bilbija submitted the application before the European Court of Human Rights, but their application was declared incompatible \"ratione personae\". Subsequently the High Representative lifted the ban imposed on Dragan Kalinić.\n\nOn 15 October 2001, Ante Jelavić lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court against the ruling of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo which dismissed Jelavić's appeal against the ruling of an investigative judge of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo on the conduct of investigation against Jelavić. Although the judge confirmed that the alleged offenses were committed in Mostar, he based his competency, among other things, on the Decision of the High Representative of 26 April 2001, on establishing the territorial and subject-matter competence of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo \"for conducting investigation and first instance trial against perpetrators of all criminal acts\" arising from certain events in which the appellant was allegedly involved. Jelavić raised an objection to the territorial competence of the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo, stating that the Cantonal Court in Mostar was competent for conducting the proceedings and that his right to a fair trial was violated. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:\n\nThe Court granted the appeal of Ante Jelavić, and quashed the rulings of the Cantonal Court of Sarajevo and designated the Cantonal Court in Mostar as territorially competent to conduct the investigation. This was also the first and the only time the Constitutional Court had determined that a legislative measure of the High Representative was unconstitutional.\n\nOn 29 June 2001, Živko Radišić, a member of the Presidency of B&H submitted a request to the Constitutional Court for deciding the dispute between the Republika Srpska and Federation of B&H on the Inter-Entity Boundary Line between Dobrinja I and Dobrinja IV and for review of the constitutionality of the Decision of the High Representative which ties both the Republika Srpska and the Federation of B&H into final and binding arbitration on the Inter-Entity Boundary Line in the Sarajevo suburbs of Dobrinja I and IV, No. 84/01 of 5 February 2001 and the Arbitration Award by an independent Arbitrator for Dobrinja I and IV. In its unanimous decision, the Court had, among other things, held the following:\n\nThus, the Court rejected the submission as inadmissible, as it held that it is not competent to adopt a decision.\n\nOn 8 February 2002, thirty-three representatives of the People’s Assembly of the\nRepublika Srpska submitted a request to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a review of constitutionality of Article 18.8, paragraph 3 of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which they considered to be discriminatory. In admissibility stage the Court had to consider the provisions of the Article VI.3 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina which does not expressly grant the jurisdiction to the Court to review the constitutionality of the laws adopted at the state level. The Court unanimously held the following:\n\nAlthough the Court had in the case no. U 1/99 implicitly held that it had jurisdiction to review the laws adopted at the state level, this was the first time it had expressly done so. In the merits stage the Court ruled against the applicants.\n\nOn 12 April 2004, Sulejman Tihić, then Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the review of constitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on the Coat of Arms and Flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (\"Official Gazette of Federation of BiH No. 21/96 and 26/96\"), Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitutional Law on the Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem of the Republika Srpska (\"Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska No. 19/92\"), Articles 2 and 3 of the Law on the Use of Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem (\"Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska No. 4/93\") and Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on the Family Patron-Saint’s Days and Church Holidays of the Republika Srpska (\"Official Gazette of Republika Srpska No. 19/92\"). On 2 December 2004 the applicant submitted a supplement to the request. Two partial decisions were made in a year 2006, when the Court found that the coat of arms and flag of the Federation of B&H, and coat of arms, anthem, family patron-saint days and church holidays of Republika Srpska were unconstitutional. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nThe formal name of the item is \"U-4/04\", but it is widely known as \"Decision on the insignia of entities\" (Bosnian: \"Odluka o obilježjima entiteta\"), since its merritum was about the symbols of entities. The Court has ordered the Parliament of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the National Assembly of Republika Srpska to bring the contested legal documents in line with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina within six months from the publishing date of its decision in the \"Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina\". Since the harmonisation was not done in that granted time-limit, that Court has, on January 27, 2007, adopted the Ruling on failure to enforce in which it established that the contested articles of the interpreted legal documents shall cease to be in force as of the date following the publishing date of the Ruling in \"Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina\". On June 16, 2007, the Government of Republika Srpska had adopted the provisional emblem of Republika Srpska, until it adopted the new Coat of Arms of Republika Srpska. It had also decided to use the melody of its former anthem \"Bože pravde\" as its new intermezzo anthem, but the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska has declared such use of melody as unconstitutional as well, so the new anthem, \"Moja Republika\" was adopted. Both the new anthem (in relation to words \"moja zemlja\" - \"my land\") and new coat of arms have been contested by Bosniak members of National Assembly of Republika Srpska in front of the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska. The Court declared the coat of arms to be unconstitutional since it did not represent Bosniaks in any way, while it rejected the claim in relation to the anthem.\n\nOn 30 July 2001, Sejfudin Tokić, Deputy Chair of the House of Peoples of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time of its filing request, filed with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina a request for a review of constitutionality of Articles 11 and 11(a) of the Law on Territorial Organization and Local Self-Government (\"Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska Nos. 11/94, 6/95, 26/95, 15/96, 17/96, 19/96, and 6/97\") and the title itself of the Law on the Town of Srpsko Sarajevo as well as its Articles 1 and 2 (\"Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska Nos. 25/93, 8/96, 27/96 and 33/97\"). The Court made its decision in 2004, in which it declared the laws that changed the names of the cities to ones with prefixes \"srpski\" (Serbian), were unconstitutional and had to be changed (which was done later). In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\nThe formal name of the item is \"U-44/01\", but it is widely known as the \"Decision on the names of the cities\" (Bosnian: \"Odluka o nazivima gradova\").\n\nThis judgement is important not only because it was unanimous (no division according to ethnic lines inside the Court), but also because it elaborates the collective equality of the constituent peoples and accepts the symbolic importance of names. \n\nOn 7 September 2009, the Bosniak Caucus in the Council of Peoples of the Republika Srpska, represented by its President Edin Ramić, lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina against the decision of the Council for the Protection of Vital Interest of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska (the \"Council\") No. UV-2/09 of 8 July 2009. At the same time the appellant sought a review of the constitutionality of the Rules of Procedure on the Operations of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska and, within that request, sought adoption of an interim measure.\n\nPreviously the Chairman of the Council of Peoples of the Republika Srpska initiated the procedure for the protection of vital national interest of Bosniak people under the Law on Territorial Organization of the Republika Srpska before the Council since that Law did not include prefix \"Bosnian\" in front of the names of the municipalities of Brod and Kostajnica, which had such prefix before, and this prefix was also absent in the names of the municipalities whose names had been previously changed (Gradiška, Novi Grad, Šamac and Kozarska Dubica). The Council had determined that the Law had not violated the vital national interest of Bosniak people. The appellants claimed that the Council had violated the provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina relating to non-discrimination, right to return and right to a fair hearing, as well as provisions of ECHR relating to non-discrimination and a right to a fair hearing. The majority (7-1) of the Court decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nThe Court also decided that the decision of the Council for the Protection of Vital Interest of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska is to be regarded as a \"judgment of the court\" in the meaning of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, against which an application can be made to the Constitutional Court. However, the Court decided that it did not have the jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the Rules of Procedure on the Operations of the Constitutional Court of the Republika Srpska since the collective right of the constitutional peoples of the protection of the vital national interests is a right of political nature that is not covered by the scope of \"civil rights and obligations\" as understood by the Constitution or the ECHR.\n\nOn 27 April 2004, Sulejman Tihić, at the time Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted proceedings before the Constitutional Court for a review of conformity of the provisions of Articles IV.1, IV.1(a), IV.3(b) and V.1) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the provision of Article 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (henceforth: European Convention) and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention. Since the noted Articles of the Constitution establish a \"de iure\" discrimination, especially in relation to \"Others\" (i.e. those that are not members of \"constituent peoples\"), a question arose about a possible conflict between international and domestic law, moreover since the Constitution itself states (in its Article II.2), that the European Convention \"shall have the priority over all other law\". The applicant argued that this meant that the European Convention has a priority even over the Constitution and not only sub-constitutional legal documents. The Court rejected the request as inadmissible, stating:\n\nWith this decision the Court has upheld the discriminatory nature of the Constitution and laws that find their legal basis in it. As a result Jakob Finci, the president of Jewish community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dervo Sejdić, a Roma who has been legally abridged from becoming a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina or a member of House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, have filed separate suits against Bosnia and Herzegovina in front of European Court of Human Rights, which acknowledged Finci's and Sejdić's ineligibility for Presidency and House of Peoples to be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nOn 6 September 2005, Sulejman Tihić, Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a review of conformity of Article 8.1 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention, and Articles 2(1)(c) and 5(1)(c) of the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. This particularly related to the manner in which the members of the Presidency of B&H were elected, as well as total bar from the Presidency of the \"Others\" in the Election Law of B&H, which reflected almost identical constitutional provisions. The majority (7-2) of the Court rejected the request as inadmissible. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nUnlike the case U-5/04, here three judges (Grewe and Palavrić dissenting and Feldman submitting separate opinion) thought that the case was admissible since it did not challenge the Constitutional provisions but the Election Law. Still, the majority decided not to go to the merits stage.\n\nOn 20 September 2006, Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ilijaz Pilav filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Ruling of Court of BiH of 10 August 2006, and Decisions of Central Election Commission of 1 August 2006 and of 24 July 2006, which rejected the application for certification of the candidate Pilav on the Party’s candidate list for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as Serb member, stating that he cannot be elected from the territory of Republika Srpska as he declares himself as Bosniak. Pilav and the Party argued that their rights have been violated, particularly that Pilav was discriminated on national/ethnic basis. The majority (7-2) of the Court decided against the applicants. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nIn this case the Court, for the first time, rejected the request on the merits, rather that declaring it as \"prima facie\" inadmissible. Two of the dissenting judges (Grewe and Palavrić) were of the opinion that differential treatment challenged by the appeal is not justified in an objective or in a proportionate manner.\n\nOn 30 June 2009, Ilija Filipović, Chairman of the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina filed a request for review of the constitutionality of the Law on Protection of Domestic Production under the CEFTA. He also requested the Constitutional Court to issue an interim measure whereby it would suspend the application of the challenged Law pending a decision on the request, which the Court granted. One of the initial problems for the Court was the fact that the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not contain any explicit provision defining the rank of international treaties in domestic law or attributing competence in this field to the Constitutional Court. In addition, the Court had to interpret the Article III(3)(b) which provides that the \"general principles of international law shall be an integral part of the law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities\". The majority (6-3) of the Court decided in the favor of the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nThus, the Court established that the Law on the Protection of the Domestic Production under the CEFTA is inconsistent with Article III(3)(b) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that it is quashed in its entirety.\n\nIn their Separate Joint Dissenting Opinion judges Feldman and Pantiru recognized the importance of \"pacta sunt servanda\" principle but still held that it has no more weight than laws passed by the legislators at the state or entity level and that it does not in any case entail giving provisions of treaties a status superior to that of Laws under the Constitution. Similarly, the President of the Court, Simović, in his dissenting opinion noted that \"if interpreted in this manner, the entire international treaty law obtains a constitutional law level, which has not been the intention of the author of the Constitution.\"\n\nOn 16 November 2009, Sulejman Tihić, then Chairman of the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, filed a request with the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the review of constitutionality of several Articles of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Rules of Procedure of the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The applicant claimed that although the principle of proportional representation of the three constituent peoples and other citizens has been respected in the executive of the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska, as well as in the organs of the public authority and courts in the entities, it is not respected with regards the structure of the legislature in Bosnia and Herzegovina (at the state and entity levels) according to the census from 1991, and that the particular voting procedure in the House of Representatives, popularly called \"the entity voting\", has thus been transformed into \"ethnic voting\" where the ethnic majority from one or the other entity can promote its interests, as opposed to the interests and will of the other two constituent peoples from either entities, as well as the will of other citizens from the territory of those entities. Thus, the applicant claimed that the indicated provisions of the Electoral Law are not in conformity with the lines 3, 8 and 9 of the Preamble of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and with the Article I/2 of the Constitution. The Court unanimously decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nThe Court had particularly reiterated its previous decisions in the cases U-5/98 and U-8/04, with regards the notion of \"effective participation of the constituent peoples in state authorities\" which in principle means that officials appointed to positions in institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be representative reflection of advanced co-existence of all peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but that if such participation falls outside the constitutional framework, it must never be carried out or imposed at the expense of efficient operation of the state and its authorities.\n\nOn 15 September 2008, Haris Silajdžić, at the time the Chairman of the Presidency of B&H, lodged the request with the Constitutional Court in which it was requested that it should establish that the Decision of the Government of RS granting consent to the Agreement entered into between Hill & Knowlton International Belgium and the RS and the Memorandum of Agreement entered into between Quinn Gillespie & Associates and the RS, Conclusion of the RS Government, Memorandum of Agreement entered into between Quinn Gillespie & Associates and the RS and its Annex I, item 614700 of the RS Budget for 2008 and item 614700 of the RS Budget for 2009 (on the allocation of funds for the RS's representation abroad), and the activities of the RS carried out in the USA either directly or indirectly on the basis of the Memorandum of Agreement through the authorized Agent Quinn Gillespie & Associates and directed towards the government, institutions and officials of the USA and officials of some international organizations, are inconsistent with Articles III(1)(a) and (b), III(3)(b), V(3)(a) and (c) and V(4)(a) of the Constitution of B&H. The majority (7-2) of the Court decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nAn important aspect of the Decision was the fact that the request was unanimously found to be admissible since it was held that a series of formal acts and activities undertaken by one of the Entities may raise an issue of existence of a dispute between the Entity and B&H over an issue under the Constitution of B&H in respect of which the Constitutional Court of BiH has sole jurisdiction to decide.\n\nIn her dissenting opinion, joint by judge Mirsad Ćeman, judge Seada Palavrić criticized the Court for not giving a definition of foreign policy and foreign trade policy, since, in her opinion, only a detailed interpretation could assist in determination of the exclusive competence of B&H in this area. She also reiterated the earlier decisions of the Court with regards the lack of international personality of the RS, while the analysis of the relevant documentation show that RS had acted not as an integral part of B&H but as an independent state conducting its foreign policy in an nontransparent matter.\n\nOn 24 November 2009, Beriz Belkić, at the time the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of B&H, filed a request with the Constitutional Court for review of the constitutionality of the Second Report of the RS submitted to the UNSC on the Situation in B&H of 16 November 2009, as well as for review of the constitutionality of the activities of the RS taken either directly or indirectly through its authorized agent and directed towards the UNSC. The majority (5-3) of the Court decided against the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:\n\nImportantly, the Court held that the acts and activities taken by one of the Entities, even of political nature, may raise an issue as to the existence of a dispute between the Entity and B&H over a matter under the Constitution of B&H, which only the Constitutional Court is competent to resolve.\n\nJudge Mirsad Ćeman filed a dissenting opinion, joint by judges Seada Palavrić and Valerija Galić, in which he criticized the Court for not defining the term \"foreign policy\". Also, in his opinion the challenged activities of the RS included the matters and positions which, by their nature, fall within the scope of the foreign policy of B&H and, as such, they are within the sole responsibility of the B&H. He also held that the Government of RS, through the preparation and submission of the challenged Second Report, acted unilaterally on the international scene, which constituted an interference with the responsibilities of the State of B&H by the Entity. Finally, he did not agree with the majority that no legally relevant activity based on the challenged Report was taken to the detriment of the constitutional position of the B&H, since the preparation and submission of the challenged Second Report constituted such an activity and the damages for B&H arising from that activity are reflected in damages to the constitutional capacity, sovereignty and international subjectivity of B&H as a state.\n\n"}

{"id": "4329386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4329386", "title": "Philosophy of environment", "text": "Philosophy of environment\n\nThe philosophy of environment is a trend of free thought located between philosophy, epistemology and anthropology. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental humanism. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.\n\nThe philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the neo-darwinian school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex living being in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.\n\nThis trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by Julian Huxley, notably during the founders congress of the IHEU (International Humanist and Ethical Union) in 1952.\n\nFurther than the basic scientific theory of evolution (notably neo-darwinian, Evolutive Humanism, developed by Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould), looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal environment. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of evolution and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose determinism, genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to Marc Carl, \"Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally\". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.\nA subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our species in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.\n\nThis cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of human evolution, an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, non-deterministic because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated metaphysics, encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.\n\nSupported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned. Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize human society in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as Jacques Chirac (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.\n\nHumanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the human mind, any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with belief but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This school of thought accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.\n\n"}
{"id": "4576518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4576518", "title": "Plant collecting", "text": "Plant collecting\n\nPlant collecting is the acquisition of plant specimens for the purposes of research, cultivation, or as a hobby. Plant specimens may be kept alive, but are more commonly dried and pressed to preserve the quality of the specimen. Plant collecting is an ancient practice with records of a Chinese botanist collecting roses over 5000 years ago.\n\nHerbaria are collections of preserved plants samples and their associated data for scientific purposes. The largest herbarium in the world exist at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, in Paris, France. Plant samples in herbaria typically include a reference sheet with information about the plant and details of collection. This detailed and organized system of filing provides horticulturist and other researchers alike with a way to find information about a certain plant, and a way to add new information to an existing plant sample file.\n\nThe collection of live plant specimens from the wild, sometimes referred to as plant hunting, is an activity that has occurred for centuries. The earliest recorded evidence of plant hunting was in 1495 BC when botanists were sent to Somalia to collect incense trees for Queen Hatshepsut. The Victorian era saw a surge in plant hunting activity as botanical adventurers explored the world to find exotic plants to bring home, often at considerable personal risk. These plants usually ended up in botanical gardens or the private gardens of wealthy collectors. Prolific plant hunters in this period included William Lobb and his brother Thomas Lobb, George Forrest, Joseph Hooker, Charles Maries and Robert Fortune.\nProper pressing and mounting techniques are critical to the longevity of a collected plant sample. Properly preserved plant samples can last for hundreds of years. The New York Botanical Garden itself holds plant samples that date back to the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804–1806.\n\nThe first step of plant pressing begins with the collection of the sample. When collecting a sample it is important to first make sure that land you are collecting on allows for the removal of natural specimens. The next step after finding a suitable plant for collection is to assign it with a number for record keeping purposes. This number system is up to the individual collector, but usually involves the date of collection or the sequential number of that collection. Along with an assigned number, observations about the plant's location and live appearance should be noted in detail. These field notes will accompany the finished sample to provide supplementary information about the plant.\n\nAfter cleaning the sample of any mud or dirt, the next step is to press the sample. Some samples may press better if they have been left to wilt for a few days. However plants should never be allowed to spoil or decompose before pressing, as this will impact the quality of the dried product. Plant presses are most commonly constructed with two flat smooth pieces of wood, and some type of compression mechanism. Compression may be accomplished with tightened nuts and bolts on the corners of the press, with tightened straps around the press, or by placing weights on top of the press. When placing in the press, plant samples should be sandwiched between a few layers of absorbent blotter. Newspaper and cardboard are two common choices for blotter material. When arranging the plant in the press it is important to remember that the dried plant product will be fragile and inflexible, so position the plant exactly as you wish the final product to appear. Tighten the press and wait approximately a day to check up on the plant. The blotter should be taken out and replaced with dry blotter roughly every 24 hours. Complete drying time will vary depending on the type of plant, but is generally 7–10 days. Fleshier plants such as succulents will take longer.\n\nAfter the plant sample has been sufficiently dried and pressed, it must be mounted. The quality of mounting not only impacts the appearance of the plant sample, but also determines the rate of deterioration the sample will experience. Herbarium quality mounts use specialized paper for the best protection against deterioration. This paper can either be 100% alpha cellulose paper or cotton “rag” paper. These types of paper are ideal for preserving plant samples because they are acid free and pH neutral. Samples can be strapped to the paper with linen tape, or glued onto the sheet. If glue is needed, it is recommended that Grade A methyl cellulose mixed with water be used for optimal deterioration resistance.\n\nIn order for plant specimens to be kept in good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should be kept in a low light, low humidity environment. The temperature of the storage space should be kept cool, between 50 – 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIt is important to keep the storage space free of harmful pest. It is recommended to protect the specimens by sheathing the sheets in sealed plastic bags. Various pesticides may also be used to protect the storage space from pest infestation. If pest infestation has already occurred, the samples should be frozen for three to four days. Freezing new additions of plant samples is a suggested preventative measure against the introduction of pest to the storage space.\n\nHerbarium specimens of plants are collected for a number of different uses. They can assist in accurate identification and provide a species record for a time and place that can be used in distribution maps. They can also provide biological material for researchers, a reference point to document scientific names and vouchers for research and seed collections. DNA barcoding, a new method of identification of plant vouchers, is being used in herbaria across the world. The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History creates their barcodes from a short sequence of plant DNA, which can be easily identified from all healthy specimens of the species. This barcode is then printed and placed onto the plant mount. By creating these DNA barcodes, the process of organizing and loaning plant specimens becomes more streamlined and can be mechanized.\n\nVoucher specimens are select herbarium specimens. What distinguishes these specimens from others is that a voucher specimen is a \"representative sample of an expertly identified organism.\" These specimens are usually associated with a professional research article and are considered to be more official references than a typical herbarium specimen. Voucher specimens can be useful in many ways such as use for comparison when scientists think they have found a new species or when dichotomous keys have narrowed the possible species down to a few that have minute differences.\n\nPlant collecting may also refer to a hobby, in which the hobbyist takes identifiable samples of plant species found in nature, dries them, and stores them in a paper sheet album, a simple herbarium, along with the information of the finding location, finding date, etc. necessary scientific information. As in many collecting hobbies, rarer specimens have been valued. However, when collecting living organisms, the conservation aspects must precede the collector's ambitions. This has led in some cases to a collector voluntarily taking part, helping scientists, in some research areas, provided he can store the \"collectible\". In fact, historically, many species have initially been found within a collection of a collector.\n\nUsually, a plant can be identified in nature, since they are stationary.\nThe advent of digital cameras has led many plant collectors to switch totally to photography. Some have switched to collecting live specimens of various plant species in their gardens, building a sort of \"private botanical garden\". Some have specialized in a specific group, the orchids and the roses and their cultivars are among the most collected.\n\nIllegal collection of plants is known as plant poaching. A report on the risk of rare plant poaching has provided data showing possible connections between geography and the rate of poaching in the Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA. The openings for poaching were found to be increased in locations with easy accessibility, such as roads, trails, and developed areas. The condition of the environment can determine the levels of poaching, with regions of higher quality receiving more attention from poachers.\n\nThe hobby and practice of plant collecting is known to have been the cause of declines in certain plant populations. This can be the result of hobbyists being oblivious to the status of a particular species, collectors of valuable species for profit, or researchers over collecting to fill slots in herbaria. This issue can be solved with proper research on the status of species before a plant is collected and taking the smallest sample possible.\n\nWhile plant collecting may seem like a very safe and harmless practice, there is a few things collectors should keep in mind to protect themselves. First collectors should always be aware of the land where they are collecting. As in hiking there will be certain limitations to whether or not public access is granted on a plot of land and if collection from that land is allowed. For example, in a National park of the United States, plant collection is not allowed unless given special permission. Collecting internationally will involve some logistics, such as official permits which will most likely be required to bring plants both from the country of collection and to the destination country. The major herbaria can be useful to the average hobbyist in aiding them in acquiring these permits.\n\nIf traveling to a remote location to access samples, it is safe practice to inform someone of your whereabouts and planned time of return. If traveling in hot weather, collectors should bring adequate water to avoid dehydration. Forms of sun protection such as sunscreen and wide brimmed hats may be essential depending on location. Travel to remote locations will most likely involve walking measurable distances in wild terrain, so precautions synonymous with those related to hiking should be taken.\n\nPlant \"discovery\" means the first time that a new plant was recorded for science, often in the form of dried and pressed plants (a herbarium specimen) being sent to a botanical establishment such as Kew Gardens in London, where it would be examined, classified and named.\n\nPlant \"introduction\" means the first time that living matter – seed, cuttings or a whole plant – was brought back to Europe. Thus, the Handkerchief tree (\"Davidia involucrata\") was discovered by Père David in 1869 but introduced to Britain by Ernest Wilson in 1901.\n\nOften, the two happened simultaneously: thus Sir Joseph Hooker discovered and introduced his Himalayan rhododendrons between 1849 and 1851.\n\n\n"}

The literal translation for Ukupseni is \"little beach\" in English, or \"playa chica\" in Spanish, thus \"Playón Chico\" is a mistranslation, which means roughly \"Little Big Beach\".\n\nUkupseni is a small island, roughly ¼–⅓ mi², or 300–400 yd². The population of the island is about 3,000, which gives Ukupseni a population density of 8,000–12,000 people per square mile.\n\nUkupseni is populated by Kuna. The typical housing structure is a \"pole\"-style thatch hut, which will house an entire family. Building materials are tree trunks for the main pillars, bamboo poles for support, and various types of leaves for the roof. Walls are typically lashed bamboo or \"caña blanca\" (cane). A well-constructed hut can stand for as long as 30 years.\n\nThe elderly will often be cared for by their children, and so one family dwelling will often house several generations.\n\nUkupseni lays approximately from the Panama mainland. Playón Chico Airport is located on the mainland adjacent to the island. Ukupseni is only reachable by plane, boat, or by foot. \n\nThere is no road to Ukupseni. There is now a bridge connecting Ukupseni to the mainland. This is extremely useful, as the majority of local agriculture, schooling, the airport, and potable water are on the mainland.\n\nAside from the bridge, the second most popular form of transportation is the \"kayuco\" (hollowed-out tree canoe). Kayucos range in sizes and styles. Extremely large kayucos, some more than 4 ft wide are used, and others vary in size down to one-person boats. \n\nA typical kayuco is similar to a Western-style canoe. Even though kayukos travel in the ocean they do not have a lateral brace and balance as found on Polynesian ocean-going craft. A distinct, low-profile kayuco is used for navigating rivers.\n\nUkupseni is mostly autonomous, in that it grows most of its own food. Colombian ships travel through Kuna Yala, and Kunas sell coconuts in exchange for goods, including hammocks and other supplies. Lobster, crab, and fish are sold to seafood airplanes on the Ukupseni airstrip.\n\nCommunity projects are conducted by the local government for various needs throughout the year, and every citizen is required to help.\n\nThere are two lodges in private islands nearby, Yandup island and Iskardup island. Both are owned and ran by Kunas from Ukupseni, as it is part of the Kuna law that only Kunas can own businesses in Kuna Yala. These lodges also provide jobs as guides, cooks, handymen, maids and other works to Ukupseni's inhabitants, plus a larger income for fishermen and handicraft sellers, being the Mola the most famous handicraft of the Kunas.\n\nUkupseni, along with the vast majority of the rest of the San Blas Islands lies atop a coral reef that has broken the surface of the ocean. This island is enlarged constantly by people depositing earth, rock, waste, or other debris in order to create a large living area on the island. The elevation of these islands is about 1½ feet above sea level. \n\nLocal tides in the area fluctuate the level of the water by 4–11 inches. Occasionally a \"super-high tide\" of about 18 inches will saturate the outer parts of the island.\n\nThere are several reef islands in close proximity to Ukupseni. Most are not inhabited, but some have tourist hotels on them. The closest populated island is San Ignacio de Tupile, a few miles due east. The mainland communities of Irgandi and Ukupa lie to the northwest.\n\n"}

The General Assembly may determine what privileges it grants with the observer status, such as a right to speak at General Assembly meetings, vote on procedural matters, serve as signatories on working papers, and sign resolutions, but not to sponsor resolutions or vote on resolutions of substantive matters. Exceptionally, the EU was granted in 2011 the right to speak in debates, to submit proposals and amendments, the right of reply, to raise points of order and to circulate documents, etc. , the EU was the only international organisation to hold these enhanced rights, which has been likened to the rights of full membership, short of the right to vote.\n\nObserver status may be granted by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. The status of a permanent observer is based purely on practice of the General Assembly, and there are no provisions for it in the United Nations Charter. A distinction has been made between state and non-state observers. Non-member states, which are members of one or more specialized agencies, can apply for the status of permanent observer state. Non-state observers are the international organizations and other entities.\n\nArticle 4 of Chapter II of the United Nations Charter specifies the qualifications for membership in the United Nations:\n\nAn application for membership must be approved by the United Nations Security Council (which is subject to a veto) and then the General Assembly.\n\nThe General Assembly may invite non-member entities to participate in the work of the United Nations without formal membership, and has done so on numerous occasions. Such participants are described as observers, some of which may be further classified as non-member state observers. Most former non-member observer states accepted observer status at a time when they had applied for membership but were unable to attain it, due to the (actual or threatened) veto by one or more of the permanent members of the Security Council. The grant of observer status is made by the General Assembly only, and not subject to a Security Council veto.\n\nIn some circumstances a state may elect to become an observer rather than full member. For example, to preserve its neutrality while participating in its work, Switzerland chose to remain a permanent non-member state observer from 1948 until it became a member in 2002. The Holy See did not wish to join the United Nations as a member because \"Membership in the organization would not seem to be consonant with the provisions of Article 24 of the Lateran Treaty, particularly as regards spiritual status and participation in possible use of force.\" Since April 6, 1964, the Holy See has accepted permanent observer state status at the United Nations, which was regarded as a diplomatic courtesy, to enable the Vatican to participate in the UN's humanitarian activities and in the promotion of peace.\n\nAs of 2015, there are two permanent non-member observer states at the United Nations: the Holy See and Palestine. The Holy See uncontroversially obtained its non-member observer state status in 1964 and Palestine was so designated in 2012, following an application for full membership in 2011 which has not yet been put to a UN Security Council vote largely due to the U.S. pressure. Both the Holy See and the State of Palestine are described as \"Non-member States having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining permanent observer missions at Headquarters\". \n\nThe change of Palestinian observer status in 2012 from \"non-member observer entity\" to \"non-member observer state\" was regarded as an \"upgrade\" of their status. Many called the change \"symbolic\", but which was regarded as providing new leverage to the Palestinians in their dealings with Israel. As a result, in the change in status, the United Nations Secretariat recognized Palestine's right to become a party to treaties for which the UN Secretary-General is the depositary.\n\nThe seating in the General Assembly Hall is arranged with non-member observer states being seated immediately after UN member states, and before other observers. On 10 September 2015, the General Assembly resolved to approve the raising at the UN of the flags of non-member observer states alongside those of the 193 UN member states.\n\n\nSixteen former non-member states were also granted observer status. Fourteen of those states eventually became members of the United Nations. The other two constitute a single special case.\n\nMost of the former non-member observer states accepted this status at a time when they had applied for membership but were unable to attain it, due to the (actual or threatened) veto of one or more of the permanent members of the Security Council. The vetoes were later overcome either by changes in geopolitical circumstances, or by \"package deals\" under which the Security Council approved multiple new member states at the same time, as was done with a dozen countries in 1955 and with East and West Germany in 1973.\n\nMany intergovernmental organizations and a few other entities (non-governmental organizations and others with various degrees of statehood or sovereignty), are invited to become observers at the General Assembly. Some of them maintain a permanent office in the United Nations headquarters in New York City, while others do not; however, this is the choice of the organization and does not imply differences in their status.\n\nIn the resolution adopted in May 2011 granting additional rights to the European Union the UNGA decided that similar arrangements may be adopted for any other regional organization that is allowed to speak on behalf of its member states.\n\nWhile the EU is an observer, it is party to some 50 international UN agreements as the only non-state participant. It is a full participant on the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Forum on Forests and the Food and Agriculture Organization. It has also been a \"full participant\" at certain UN summits, such as the Rio and Kyoto summits on climate change, including hosting a summit. Furthermore, the EU delegation maintains close relations with the UN's aid bodies. In 2011 the EU was granted enhanced powers in the General Assembly; the right to speak in debates, to submit proposals and amendments, the right of reply, to raise points of order and to circulate documents. These rights were also made open to other international organizations who requested them, if their members have given them the right to speak on their behalf.\n\n\n"}

Every five years they hold the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names.\n\nThe question of standardizing geographical names was raised by the United Nations Cartographic Section of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in the late 1940s. After discussions in the 1950s and ECOSOC resolution 715A (XXVII) of 1959, the first meeting of a group of experts was convened in New York City in 1960. This group recommended that a UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names be held. In 1967 this took place in Geneva, with the confirmation that national standardization should be the basis of international standardization.\n\nThe remit of UNGEGN is to deal with the problems of domestic and international standardization of geographical names, and to offer suggestions and recommendations for (mainly linguistic) standardization. Being one of the seven expert groups of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, UNGEGN is mandated to follow up on the implementation of resolutions and to continue activities between the United Nations Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names held every five years. UNGEGN aims to emphasize the importance of the standardization of geographical names at the national and international levels, to show the benefits of this, and to assist countries in standardization of geographical names where it is lacking. Furthermore, UNGEGN facilitates and encourages the discussion of the results of work on national standardization and arising issues, the dissemination of best\npractices, and a wide user community awareness of nationally authorized geographical names.\n\nUNGEGN reports to the UN Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names held at five-yearly intervals. It is supported by a Secretariat provided by the United Nations Statistics Division, and its Bureau. UNGEGN meets formally on two occasions between Conferences and works on names standardization through Working Groups and Special task teams, as well as through Divisions. These so-called Divisions are groups of countries with common interests based on geography and/or language. To interact with other scientific organizations, UNGEGN has appointed a number of liaison officers.\n\nThe UNGEGN Bureau consists of a Chair, two Vice-Chairs and two Rapporteurs. The current Bureau is composed as follows:\n\n\nFormer chairpersons:\n\n\nUNGEGN is composed of experts from various linguistic/geographical divisions that have been established by the UN Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names. Countries decide for themselves the division(s) to which they wish to belong; some belong to more than one division. A division chair is selected within a division and he/she is encouraged to stimulate activities in the standardization of geographical names within the division, through technical meetings, correspondence, etc.\n\nCurrently, there are 24 divisions that guide the work of UNGEGN during and between its sessions:\n\n\nUnder the umbrella of UNGEGN, several Working Groups have been created to follow up topics and issues which cut across the Divisional structure of UNGEGN. In addition, UNGEGN has a Task Team for Africa and coordinates the work of countries in developing their Toponymic Guidelines.\n\nCurrently there are 9 UNGEGN Working Groups:\n\n\nThe former Working Group on Pronunciation has been disbanded in 2017.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names is a periodic international conference organised by the United Nations Statistical Commission, the central purpose of which is to facilitate the standardization of national geographical names. The purpose of the Conference is not to settle political disputes between states on the use (or non-use) of particular geographical names.\n\nThe conference takes place every five years at United Nations Headquarters in New York City. It can be conducted at a different location, if a country offers to host the conference and to pay the additional costs of hosting the conference away from UN HQ. Each country may send a delegation. Members of these delegations are mainly experts on geographical names from their respective countries.\n\nThe most recent conference, the tenth, was held in New York in July/August 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

URISA promotes the effective and ethical use of spatial information and technology for the understanding and management of urban and regional systems.\n\nURISA was formed in 1966, evolving from a loosely associated group of professionals with a common interest in urban planning information systems. The organization emanated from annual conferences held from 1963 through 1966, known then as the Annual Conference on Urban Planning Information Systems and Programs. URISA has since evolved into an international organization supporting professionals with interests in a variety of topics related to development and effective management of geographic information systems (GIS). URISA is currently headquartered in Des Plaines, Illinois, where professional staff handle the administrative functions of the association.\n\nURISA is the founding member of the GIS Certification Institute, which administers professional certification for the field. \n\nURISA promotes data sharing by government organizations, and has approved policy to reflect those values.\n\nURISA hosts a number of conferences each year including GIS-Pro: URISA’s Annual Conference for GIS Professionals; the GIS/CAMA Technologies Conference, co-sponsored by the International Association of Assessing Officers; the URISA/NENA Addressing Conference, co-sponsored by the National Emergency Number Association; a biennial GIS in Public Health Conference; Caribbean GIS Conference; and the URISA Leadership Academy, a five-day GIS leadership program.\n\nURISA supports more than two-dozen chapters, primarily across the United States and Canada, with recent expansion into the Caribbean and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe \"URISA Journal\" is a quarterly, peer-reviewed, scholarly publication of the organization. It has a history of open access. URISA additionally maintains a growing publications library. Through an annual competition URISA encourages students to submit a paper for a special section of the \"URISA Journal\".\n\nURISA also recognizes achievements in the industry through a variety of awards, including Exemplary Systems in Government Awards (ESIG) the URISA GIS Hall of Fame, and the Horwood Distinguished Service Award.\n\nURISA members are professionals in the spatial data industry working in local, regional, state/provincial, tribal and federal government, academia, the private sector, and non-profit organizations.\n\n\n"}
