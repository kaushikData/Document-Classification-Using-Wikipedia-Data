{"id": "13581836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13581836", "title": "Air Defense Identification Zone (North America)", "text": "Air Defense Identification Zone (North America)\n\nThe Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) is an area surrounding much of North America – namely airspace surrounding the United States and Canada – in which the ready identification, location, and control of civil aircraft over land or water is required in the interest of national security. This ADIZ is jointly administered by the civilian air traffic control authorities and the militaries of both nations, under the auspices of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) handles the requests of international aircraft and Transport Canada handles Canadian requests. Any aircraft flying in these zones without authorization may be identified as a threat and treated as an enemy aircraft, potentially leading to interception by fighter aircraft.\n\nAn aircraft entering an ADIZ is required to radio its planned course, destination, and any additional details about its trip through the ADIZ to a higher authority, typically an air traffic controller. The aircraft must also be equipped with a radar transponder.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the United States asserted control of coastal airspace in 1940, and this took on a sense of urgency after the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. However, by 1943 the Axis powers no longer posed a severe threat to the safety of North America. With the outbreak of the Korean War, the Air Force placed its forces on alert and uncovered major weaknesses in the coordination of domestic defense units. An air defense command and control structure was developed in 1950, creating five Air Defense Identification Zones around North America. If radio interrogation failed to identify an aircraft in the ADIZ, the Air Force launched interceptor aircraft to identify the intruder visually. The air defense system reached its peak in 1962, however with the deployment of the SS-6 ICBM in the USSR, strategic threats shifted overwhelmingly to ICBM attacks, and bomber intrusions were considered to be less of a threat.\n\nThe ADIZ was focused on aircraft approaching primarily from the Soviet Union, but on October 26, 1971, a Cuban aircraft landed in New Orleans after flying completely undetected through American airspace. Publicity and political pressure from Louisiana Congressman Felix Edward Hébert forced the Air Force to establish the Southeast Air Defense Sector and open a radar network along the Gulf coast. In the 1980s with the rise of the War on Drugs, this ADIZ took on a dual role of controlling drug smuggling from Latin America.\n\nThe role of the ADIZ diminished significantly in the 1990s with political changes in Russia and the reduction and attrition of Russian strategic aviation forces, but gained renewed importance during the following decade in the wake of the September 11 attacks, in which long-range aircraft on domestic flights were used against domestic targets – the renewed importance placed on the ADIZ was despite the fact that none of the aircraft involved in the September 11 attacks crossed the ADIZ.\n\nThe United States formally defines an ADIZ in the Code of Federal Regulations: 14 CFR Part 99. The ADIZ forms a transition zone in which aircraft come under positive identification and control by air traffic and defense authorities. With regards to applicability of the law, states \"This subpart prescribes rules for operating civil aircraft in a defense area, or into, within, or out of the United States through an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), designated in subpart B\".\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Navy's \"Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations\" states the ADIZ applies only to commercial aircraft intending to enter U.S. sovereign airspace, with a basis in international law of \"the right of a nation to establish reasonable conditions of entry into its territory\". The manual specifically instructs U.S. military aircraft to ignore the ADIZ of other states when operating in coastal areas:\n\nThe United States does not recognize the right of a coastal nation to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter national airspace nor does the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter U.S. airspace. Accordingly, U.S. military aircraft not intending to enter national airspace should not identify themselves or otherwise comply with ADIZ procedures established by other nations, unless the United States has specifically agreed to do so. \n\nA U.S. Air Force university dissertation states:\n\nThese regulations do not pertain to military aircraft, but to enter US airspace, without inducing the scrambling of fighter interceptors, these rules must be complied with and followed. The US does not claim sovereignty over these zones per se, but does closely monitor and request information of all objects entering the zone.\n\nIn 2008 United States Northern Command commander Victor E. Renuart, Jr. said that although \"we never let an unidentified aircraft come into our airspace\" in a \"post-9/11 world\" and \"determine who they are and what they’re doing,\" \"if it is a Russian aircraft on a training mission, we allow them to continue to do their job.\"\n\nThe joint US/Canadian ADIZ, which is almost exclusively over water, serves as a national defense boundary for aerial incursions. Any aircraft that wishes to fly in or through the boundary must file either a Defense Visual Flight Rules (DVFR) flight plan or an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan before crossing the ADIZ. The aircraft must have an operational radar transponder and maintain two-way radio contact while approaching and crossing the North American ADIZ.\n\nThe Federal regulation governing ADIZ areas also provides for an ADIZ around Guam. Though like Puerto Rico it is an unincorporated United States territory, the island is home to Andersen Air Force Base, which is one of two major U.S. Air Force strategic bomber bases in the Asia Pacific region, the other being Diego Garcia which is actually on British territory.\n\nThe Washington Air Defense Identification Zone (surrounds the National Capital Region, which is composed of counties of states in the immediate vicinity of the District of Columbia, plus the city of Baltimore) was created in 2003 though some sources refer to it as being created in response to the September 11th attacks. The reason for this confusion is that there are two other sets of flight restrictions over Washington, D.C. besides the DC ADIZ ( Washington, DC Metropolitan Area Flight Restricted Zone, FRZ, & Special Federal Aviation Regulation 94, SFAR 94 or just plain Special Flight Rules Area, a zone which envelopes general aviation airports centered around Ronald Reagan airport)\nestablished for the purpose . This ADIZ, however, shared none of the regulatory similarity with the border area ADIZes. This airspace was subsequently renamed the DC Flight Restricted Zone and Special Flight Rules Area to avoid confusion.\n"}

{"id": "27255787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27255787", "title": "City status in Ireland", "text": "City status in Ireland\n\nIn Ireland, the term \"city\" has somewhat differing meanings in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHistorically, city status in the United Kingdom, and before that in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a ceremonial designation. It carried more prestige than the alternative municipal titles \"borough\", \"town\" and \"township\", but gave no extra legal powers. This remains the case in Northern Ireland, which is still part of the United Kingdom. In the Republic of Ireland, \"city\" has an additional designation in local government.\n\nBefore the Partition of Ireland in 1920–22, the island formed a single jurisdiction in which \"city\" had a common history.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" s.v. \"city\" (published 1893), explains that in England, from the time of Henry VIII, the word was applied to towns with Church of England cathedrals. It goes on to say:\nThe history of the word in Ireland is somewhat parallel. Probably all or most of the places having bishops have been styled on some occasion \"civitas\"; but some of these are mere hamlets, and the term 'city' is currently applied only to a few of them which are ancient and important boroughs. Thom's Directory applies it to Dublin, Cork, Derry, Limerick ('City of the violated treaty'), Kilkenny, and Waterford; also to Armagh and Cashel, but not to Tuam or Galway (though the latter is often called 'the City of the Tribes'). Belfast was, in 1888, created a 'city' by Royal Letters Patent.\n\nIn most European languages, there is no distinction between \"city\" and \"town\", with the same word translating both English words; for example, \"ville\" in French, or \"Stadt\" in German.\n\nIn Modern Irish, \"city\" is translated \"cathair\" and \"town\" is translated \"baile\"; however, this is a recent convention; previously \"baile\" was applied to any settlement, while \"cathair\" meant a walled or stone fortress, monastery, or city. For example, Dublin, long the metropolis of the island, has been called \"Baile Átha Cliath\" since the fifteenth century, while its earliest city charter is from 1172. The Irish text of the Constitution of Ireland translates \"city of Dublin\" as \"cathair Bhaile Átha Chliath\", combining the modern sense of \"cathair\" with the historic sense of \"Baile\". Conversely, the original Irish names of such smaller settlements as Cahir, Cahirciveen, Caherdaniel, or Westport (\"Cathair na Mart\") use \"cathair\" in the older sense.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, the Latin \"civitas\" referred originally to the jurisdiction of a capital town, typically the territory of a single conquered tribe. Later it came to mean the capital town itself. When Christianity was organised in Gaul, each diocese was the territory of a tribe, and each bishop resided in the \"civitas\". Thus \"civitas\" came to mean the site of a cathedral. This usage carried over generally to Anglo-Norman \"cité\" and English \"city\" in England. William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" of 1765 cites Edward Coke's \"Institutes of the Lawes of England\" of 1634:\nA city is a town incorporated, which is or hath been the see of a bishop; and though the bishoprick be dissolved, as at Westminster, yet still it remaineth a city.\nSubsequent legal authorities disputed this assertion; pointing out that the City of Westminster gained its status not implicitly from its (former) cathedral but explicitly from letters patent issued by Henry VIII shortly after the Diocese was established.\n\nIn any case it was moot whether the association of \"city\" with dioceses applied to Ireland. A 1331 writ of Edward III is addressed, among others, to \"Civibus civitatis Dublin, —de Droghda, – de Waterford, de Cork, – de Limrik\" implying \"civitas\" status for Drogheda. Some credence to the episcopal connection was given by the 1835 Report of the Commissioners into Municipal Corporations in Ireland and the 1846 \"Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland\" (see below).\n\nWhereas the Normans moved many English sees from a rural location to a regional hub, the cathedrals of the established Church of Ireland remained at the often rural sites agreed at the twelfth-century Synod of Rathbreasail and Synod of Kells. The Roman Catholic church in Ireland had no cathedrals during the Protestant Ascendancy.\n\nDownpatrick is noted as \"the City of Down\" is a 1403 record, although no granting instrument is known. The Corporation was defunct by 1661, when Charles II initiated plans to revive it, which were not completed.\n\nAlthough the charter of Clogher did not describe it as a city, the borough constituency in the Irish House of Commons was officially called \"City of Clogher\". It was a pocket borough of the Bishop of Clogher, disestablished by the Acts of Union 1800.\n\nJohn Caillard Erck records of Old Leighlin, \"So flourishing indeed was this town in subsequent times, that it received the appellation of the city of Leighlin, and was inhabited by eighty-six burgesses during the prelacy of Richard Rocomb, who died in 1420.\"\n\nFor seven settlements in Ireland (listed below), the title \"city\" was historically conferred by the awarding of a royal charter which used the word \"city\" in the name of the body corporate charged with governing the settlement. (In fact, charters were for centuries written in Latin, with \"civitas\" denoting \"city\" and \"villa\" \"town\".) Armagh had no charter recognising it as a city but claimed the title by prescription; acts of the Parliament of Ireland in 1773 and 1791 refer to the \"city of Armagh\".\n\nThe label \"city\" carried prestige but was purely ceremonial and did not in practice affect the municipal government. However, a section of the Newtown Act of 1748 allowed for members of a Corporation to be non-resident of its municipality in the case of \"any town corporate or borough, not being a city\". This was enacted because there were too few Protestants in smaller towns to make up the numbers. The 1835 Report of the Commissioners on Municipal Corporations in Ireland questioned whether it was applicable in the case of Armagh and Tuam, both being episcopal sees and hence \"cities\" in Blackstone's definition. In fact, non-residents had served on both corporations.\n\nThere is one reference in James I's 1609 charter for Wexford to \"our said city of Wexford\", but the rest of the charter describes it as a town or borough.\n\nAfter the Acts of Union 1800, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and British law governed the award and removal of the title \"city\".\n\nThe Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 abolished both those corporations which were already \"de facto\" defunct and those which were most egregiously unrepresentative. The latter category included Armagh and Cashel. It was moot whether these \"ipso facto\" were no longer cities; some later sources continued to describe them as such.\n\nPrior to the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, eight Irish municipalities were counties corporate. This was distinct from being a city. Five of the eight were \"County of the City\", the other three being \"County of the Town\". The other cities —Derry, and until 1840 Cashel and Armagh— were not governed separately from their surrounding counties; however, the official name of County Londonderry was for long \"the City and County of Londonderry\".\n\nThe 1846 \"Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland\" uses the label \"city\" in a variety of ways. For Cork, Dublin, Kilkenny, Limerick, Derry, and Waterford, the definition at the start of the relevant article includes \"a city\". Armagh is defined as \"[a] post, market, and ancient town, a royal borough, the capital of a county, and the ecclesiastical metropolis of Ireland\"; however it is called a \"city\" throughout its article. Cashel is treated similarly to Armagh. For other episcopal seats, \"city\" is not used, or used in hedged descriptions like \"episcopal city\", \"ancient city\", or \"nominal city\". Of Kilfenora it says, \"It belongs to the same category as Emly, Clonfert, Kilmacduagh, Ardfert, Connor, Clogher, Kilmore, Ferns, and Achonry, in exhibiting a shrunk and ghastly caricature upon the practical notion of a 'city;' and nothing but its episcopal name and historical associations prevent it from being regarded as a mean and shabby hamlet.\" Of Elphin it says \"the general tone of at once masonry, manners, and business, is a hideous satire upon the idea of 'a city.'\" Of Downpatrick it says \"it displays a striking, and almost outré combination of unique and common place character, of ancient piles and modern edifices curiously mingling the features of city and village, of political grandeur and social littleness.\" There are passing references in other articles to \"the city of Tuam\", and \"the city of Killaloe\".\n\nBelfast in 1887 applied to be granted city status on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The Home Office objected to setting a precedent for granting city status to towns not episcopal sees. Thomas Sexton asked in the House of Commons:\nwith regard to the granting of the City Charter to Belfast. A Question was lately put in the House upon the subject, and ... [ W. H. Smith] replied ... that the Government did not intend to recommend any such grant in connection with Her Majesty's Jubilee. ... I will ask him for a reply upon the point ... I do not know that there is much difference between a town and a city; but some people prefer the title of city, and if there is any advantage in a place being called a city, I think the people of Belfast are entitled to have their choice. There are eight cities in Ireland, and Belfast is next to Dublin in point of importance; according to Thom's information, it is the first town of manufacturing importance. I believe there is a strong desire that the title of city should be given to the place. ... It seems absurd that Belfast should be shut out from any City Charter, while Armagh, with 10,000 of a population, is a city; and when Cashell, with a population of 4,000, enjoys the distinction also. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be able to say that, in consideration of the importance of the town, the Government will recommend the Crown to grant to it the title of city. Like civility, a Charter of this kind costs nothing; and, therefore, I think that this Charter might be promptly and gracefully conceded to the town.\n\nIn 1888, the request was granted by letters patent, setting a precedent for non-episcopal cities which was soon emulated by Dundee and Birmingham.\n\nThe title Lord Mayor is given to the mayor of a privileged subset of UK cities. In some cases, a lord mayor additionally has the style \"Right Honourable\". The Mayor of Dublin gained the title \"lord\" by a charter of 1641, but the Confederate Wars and their aftermath meant the form \"Lord Mayor\" was not used till 1665. The style \"Right Honourable\" was originally a consequence of the Lord Mayor's \"ex officio\" membership of the Privy Council of Ireland; it was later explicitly granted by the 1840 Act, and finally abolished by the Local Government Act 2001. The Lord Mayor of Belfast gained the title in 1892 —based on the precedent of Dundee— and the style \"Right Honourable\" in 1923, in recognition of Belfast's status as capital of the newly created Northern Ireland. The Lord Mayor of Cork gained the title in 1900, to mark Queen Victoria's visit to Ireland; the style \"Right Honourable\" has never applied. Armagh gained a lord mayor in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.\n\nAfter Belfast received its charter in 1888, no further towns in nine-county Ulster applied for city status until 1953, when Armagh began to argue for the restoration of the status lost in 1840. Its justification was that the Archbishop of Armagh was Primate of All Ireland. The council used the appellation \"city\" unofficially until 1994, when Charles, Prince of Wales, announced the status had been granted to mark the 1,550th anniversary of the traditional date of Armagh's foundation by Saint Patrick.\n\nLisburn and Ballymena entered a UK-wide competition for city status held to mark the millennium in 2000; neither was selected, being below the unofficial 200,000 population threshold. Controversy surrounded the decision-making process for the competition, and as a result the rules changed for a 2002 competition for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with Northern Ireland guaranteed one new city. This encouraged more applicants, with Lisburn and Ballymena being joined by Carrickfergus, Craigavon, Coleraine, and Newry. Surprisingly, Lisburn and Newry were both successful, prompting allegations of political expediency, since Lisburn is strongly Protestant and Newry strongly Catholic. Ballymena representatives were aggrieved, and there were claims that Lisburn, as a suburb of Belfast, ought to be ineligible. Sinn Féin members of Newry and Mourne District Council were opposed to Newry's city status because of the connection to the British monarchy; other councillors welcomed the award.\n\nNone of the new cities for the 2012 Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II were Northern Irish. Thus the five recognised cities in Northern Ireland are Armagh, Belfast, Derry, Lisburn, and Newry. The local government districts named after two of the new cities were granted a corresponding change of name: from \"Armagh District\" to \"Armagh City and District\", and from \"Lisburn Borough\" to \"Lisburn City\". just as the older cities had Belfast City Council and Derry City Council. Newry and Mourne district's name did not use the word \"city\". In 2014–2015, the number of districts was reduced from 26 to 11 by merging all except Belfast and Derry with neighbouring ones. The successor districts inherited city status where applicable: those linked to a charter (Belfast, Derry, Lisburn) by request of its council, and those not linked to a charter (Armagh, Newry) automatically. This is reflected in the names of Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, but not in that of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.\n\nThe Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 abolished the corporate counties of the city of Kilkenny and the towns of Galway and Drogheda (and Carrickfergus in Ulster). The Act redesignated the other corporate counties as county boroughs. After Partition, four of these were in the Irish Free State, which later became the Republic of Ireland. Galway was made a fifth county borough in 1985. The Local Government Act 2001 redesignates the five county boroughs as cities. These cities, like the county boroughs before them, are almost identical in power and function to the administrative counties. The five administrative cities are Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford.\n\nThe Local Government Reform Act 2014 merged Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council into Limerick City and County Council, and Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council into Waterford City and County Council, with effect from the 2014 local elections. Each of the two merged local government areas is termed a \"city and county\". The changes are \"without prejudice to the continued use of the description city in relation to Limerick and to Waterford\". Within each \"city and county\", the municipal district which contains the city is styled a \"metropolitan district\" ( in Irish). \n\nThe Constitution of Ireland adopted in 1937 prescribes that the Oireachtas must meet, and the President must reside, \"in or near the City of Dublin\"; the only occurrences of \"city\" in the Constitution. In fact Leinster House and Áras an Uachtaráin are within the municipal limits of the city. The formula \"in or near the City of Dublin\" had occurred in earlier statutes, including Ormonde's Articles of Peace of 1649 and the 1922 Constitution.\n\nGalway's status as a city was for long debatable. Its nickname was \"the city of the Tribes\", but in British times it was legally a town, and its county corporate was the \"county of the town of Galway\". Its 1484 charter grants its Corporation's head the title of Mayor, but so did the charters of Clonmel and Drogheda, as well as the charters extinguished in 1840 of Carrickfergus, Coleraine, Wexford, and Youghal, none of which claimed the title of \"city\".\n\nGalway was nevertheless intermittently described as a city; John Speed's 1610 map of \"Connaugh\" includes a plan of \"the Citie of Galway\". In \"The history of the town and county of the town of Galway\" (1820), James Hardiman generally describes it as a town. However, his account of the 1651 map commissioned by Clanricarde concludes that at the time Galway \"was universally acknowledged to be the most perfect city in the kingdom\". Robert Wilson Lynd in 1912 referred to \"Galway city – technically, it is only Galway town —\". The Local Government (Galway) Act, 1937, describes it as the \"Town of Galway\" and creates a municipal government called the \"Borough of Galway\". On the other hand, the Aran Islands (Transport) Act, 1936, regulates steamships travelling \"between the City of Galway and the Aran Islands\"; also, legislators debating the passage of the 1937 Act frequently referred to Galway as a \"city\".\n\nWhen the borough was made a county borough in 1985, the Borough Council became the \"City Council\" and it acquired its own \"City Manager\". This was not presented as the acquiring of city status; Minister for the Environment Liam Kavanagh said it was \"the extension of the Galway City boundary and for upgrading of that city to the status of county borough\".\n\nThe only city in the Republic which was not a county borough was Kilkenny. The original version of the 2001 Act would have reclassified as \"towns\" all \"boroughs\" which were not county boroughs, including Kilkenny. This drew objections from Kilkenny's borough councillors, and from TDs Phil Hogan and John J. McGuinness. Accordingly, a clause was added to the bill:\nThis section is without prejudice to the continued use of the description city in relation to Kilkenny, to the extent that that description was used before the establishment day and is not otherwise inconsistent with this Act.\nThe Act also states:\nSubject to this Act, royal charters and letters patent relating to local authorities shall continue to apply for ceremonial and related purposes in accordance with local civic tradition but shall otherwise cease to have effect.\nMinister of State Tom Kitt explained these provisions as follows:\nNew provisions to recognise the term \"city\" to describe Kilkenny in line with long-established historical and municipal practice were brought in. Kilkenny was reconstituted as a borough corporation under the Municipal Corporations Act, 1840, as were Clonmel, Drogheda and Sligo. Section 2 of the 1840 Act specifically provided that Kilkenny is a borough which is still the current legal position in local government law. Traditionally, however, Kilkenny had been referred to as a city and this has its roots in local usage, deriving from a 17th century charter. It has not been a city in terms of local government law for at least 160 years.\nAs I have indicated, the Bill as published specifically provides that local charters can continue for ceremonial or related purposes, thereby safeguarding local tradition and practice. There was, therefore, no difficulty in Kilkenny continuing with this long-established tradition. However, Kilkenny Corporation indicated that it was concerned that the existing provisions in the Bill would not maintain the status quo in addition to concerns with the other boroughs that the term \"town\" was some form of diminution of status. In view of these concerns the Minister [ Noel Dempsey ] indicated that he would include a provision in the Bill to specifically recognise the traditional usage of the term \"city\" to describe Kilkenny. For the first time ever in the Local Government Act the unique position of Kilkenny is being recognised in local government law.\nThe Minister honoured in full his commitment on Kilkenny and delivered on what the deputation from Kilkenny sought. It was never intended that Kilkenny would be a city such as Dublin or Cork. All Kilkenny wanted was to be allowed to continue to use the term \"city\" in recognition of its ancient tradition. The deputation expressed its satisfaction to the Minister on his proposal.\nIn 2002, Phil Hogan (a Fine Gael TD) asked for \"full city status\" for Kilkenny; in 2009 he said \"Kilkenny has lost its City status courtesy of Fianna Fáil\".\n\nThe Local Government Reform Act 2014 established new municipal districts throughout the state and to abolish all the boroughs, including Kilkenny. Whereas the municipal district encompassing other boroughs are styled \"the Borough District of Sligo [or Drogheda/Wexford/Clonmel]\", that encompassing Kilkenny is styled \"the Municipal District of Kilkenny City\".\n\nThe National Spatial Strategy (NSS) for 2002–2020 planned to manage urban sprawl by identifying certain urban centres outside Dublin as areas for concentrated growth. The NSS report calls the regional centres \"gateways\" and the sub-regional centres \"hubs\". It does not call them \"cities\", but among the features it lists for \"Gateways\" are \"City level range of theatres, arts and sports centres and public spaces/parks.\" and \"City-scale water and waste management services.\" It also gives a target population for a gateway of over 100,000, including the suburban hinterland.\n\nThe report describes Cork, Limerick/Shannon, Galway and Waterford, as \"existing gateways\" and identifies four \"new national level gateways\": Dundalk, Sligo, and two \"linked\" gateways\nLetterkenny/(Derry), and Athlone/Tullamore/Mullingar. The campaigns of Sligo and Dundalk for city status have referenced their status as regional gateways. The \"Midlands Gateway\", a polycentric zone based on Tullamore, Athlone, and Mullingar, has occasionally been described as constituting a new or future city. A 2008 study by Dublin Institute of Technology concluded that the growth in population of the designated gateways was far less than had been planned.\n\nLocal councillors and TDs from several towns have raised the possibility of gaining city status. Prior to the 2001 Act, these suggestions were a matter of simple prestige. Since the 2001 Act, the suggestions sometimes relate to the administrative functions of county-equivalent cities and sometimes to the ceremonial title. The Minister for the Environment, who is responsible for local government, has not entertained these suggestions, and has said \"A modernised legal framework and structures at both regional and local level are now in place ... I have no proposals for amending legislation, which would be necessary to establish new city councils.\"\n\nThe possibility of Drogheda gaining city status was raised in Dáil questions by Gay Mitchell in 2005, Michael Noonan in 2007 and by Fergus O'Dowd in 2007 and 2010. The Borough Council's draft development plan for 2011–17 does not mention city status, although the manager's summary of public submissions reported backing for city status for the greater Drogheda area, incorporating adjacent areas in Counties Louth and Meath. In 2010, a \"Drogheda City Status Campaign\" was launched, and in March 2012, Drogheda Borough Council passed a resolution, \"That the members of Drogheda Borough Council from this day forward give their consent and approval to the people of Drogheda referring to Drogheda as the City of Drogheda\".\n\nDundalk's development plan for 2003–09 stated \"Dundalk, in order to fulfil its potential as a regional growth centre, should, in the near future achieve City Status, to acknowledge its present role and to enable its future growth as a regional gateway.\" Michael Noonan asked a question in the Dáil in 2007. Dundalk's draft development plan for 2009–15 seeks to develop the \"Newry–Dundalk Twin City Region\" with Newry, which is nearby across the border. The county manager of County Louth made a summary of public submissions on the plan, which predicted Dundalk Institute of Technology being upgraded to university status would help to win city status.\n\nJohn Perry raised an adjournment debate in 1999 calling for Sligo to be declared a \"millennium city\", stating:\nWhile the Government will probably say Sligo can call itself a city, an official declaration by the Government to declare Sligo the millennium city will confer an official status on it. The word 'city' has a certain meaning for investors. ... The requirement for a town to be called a city is that it be a seat of government or a cathedral town. Sligo is sometimes called a town and sometimes a city. This leads to confusion and the region falls between both stools. An official declaration of Sligo as a millennium city would have major significance for the entire area. The word city has a certain meaning for investors. It presumes a certain level of services and a status towards which the world reacts very favourably. The Fitzpatrick report established Sligo as a future growth centre. Even officials of Sligo Corporation are confused because in certain instances Sligo is called a town and in others a city.\n\nDeclan Bree, mayor of the town in 2005, advocated \"Sligo gaining city status similar to Limerick, Galway and Waterford.\" The town council and county council held meetings to plan an expansion of the borough boundaries with a view to enhancing the prospects for such a change.\n\nThe main building of Sligo Borough Council is called \"City Hall\".\n\nMichael Kennedy, TD for Dublin North, stated in 2007 that \"Fingal County Council is planning to confer city status on our county town of Swords in the next 15 to 20 years as its population grows to 100,000.\" In May 2008, the Council published \"Your Swords, an Emerging City, Strategic Vision 2035\", with a vision of Swords as \"an emerging green city of 100,000 people.\"\n\nA campaign to have Tallaght given city status was launched in 2003 by Eamonn Maloney, a local member of South Dublin county council. It is supported by the Tallaght Area Committee, comprising 10 of the 26 county councillors. Advantages envisaged by the campaign's website include having a dedicated Industrial Development Authority branch office for attracting investment, and facilitating the upgrade of Institute of Technology, Tallaght to university status. When Charlie O'Connor asked about city status for \"Tallaght, Dublin 24\" in 2007, the minister had \"no plans to re-designate South Dublin County Council as a city council, or to establish Tallaght as a separate city authority\". O'Connor said later \"The only problem I can see is our close proximity to Dublin\". The head of the local chamber of commerce said in 2010, \"If Tallaght was anywhere else in the country, it would have been a city years ago. We already have the population, the hospital and the third-level institution. If we're missing something, someone needs to tell us, clarify what the criteria [are], and we'll get it.\"\n\nThis list includes places which have at some time had a legally recognised claim to the title \"city\". Informally the term may have been applied to other places or at other times.\n\nCities in Northern Ireland are denoted by a light blue background.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50190422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50190422", "title": "Eidolon (video game)", "text": "Eidolon (video game)\n\nEidolon is a first-person open world exploration video game with narrative and survival elements, developed and published by Ice Water Games. The game was released on August 1, 2014 for Microsoft Windows and macOS.\n\nThe player character travels through the wilderness and ruined cities of post-apocalyptic Western Washington, which is depicted using stylized, low-polygon graphics. While navigating this vast space, the player collects documents that reveal the stories of its previous inhabitants and the passing away of civilization; a key theme of the game is the potential for nature to outlast human activity. Although the player must obtain food and manage the risks of cold and injuries, these aspects of the gameplay were designed to be less challenging than in most survival games, to support a more relaxed mood and slower pace of exploration.\n\n\"Eidolon\" obtained a mixed reception. While reviewers mostly appreciated its distinctive graphical style (which drew comparisons with \"Proteus\") and its narrative, some criticised the gameplay as too slow-paced or repetitive.\n\n\"Eidolon\" simulates the exploration of an open world from a first-person perspective. The extensive world map encompasses multiple biomes including forests, mountains and the remains of ruined cities, and walking across it requires hours of real time. The graphics, which have been described as minimalist, feature stylized, polygonal objects, an absence of textures and a large draw distance. The game world's appearance is affected by varying weather and a day-night cycle. The game features a minimal HUD with small icons to indicate status effects such as hunger and illness, and most interaction is managed as part of the backpack interface.\n\nNavigation is a principal challenge for the player. The game initially provides no information about its geography or objectives, and although maps can be found within the game these do not indicate the protagonist's location. The player must also attend to the protagonist's survival, which involves obtaining food, staying warm and treating injuries. Failure to satisfy material needs can lead to sickness and starvation. However, a protagonist who reaches the point of death will be revived at a safe location with no loss of inventory items or any penalty beyond the time required to return to a previous location.\n\nSeveral objects may be found to assist navigation and survival: a fishing rod, compass, bow and binoculars. Unlike in many survival games, these tools are simply found and do not need to be crafted. The game can present items in multiple locations depending on how the player chooses to explore. In an article on Kotaku, Luke Plunkett discussed \"Eidolon\" as a development of the survival genre, noting that it was distinguished from earlier games in the genre by the easy and forgiving nature of the gameplay, as well as its \"peaceful\" atmosphere.\n\nNon-player characters do not appear directly, but documents and images that they have left behind can be collected. Discovering the characters' personal stories allows the player to piece together the history of the area and the reasons for its present abandonment. Documents are accompanied in the viewing interface by tags identifying associated characters and locations, and clicking a tag will indicate the direction of the nearest undiscovered document with the same tag.\n\n\"Eidolon\" takes place in approximately the year 2400, according to the game's website. The setting is a compressed and simplified representation of Western Washington, including the Puget Sound region and the Olympic Peninsula; the Kitsap Peninsula was added by a patch after release. Victoria, British Columbia is also accessible via a road bridge from Port Angeles. The player begins in a forest between Bellevue and Olympia. Gradual exploration reveals that the region is deserted and has largely reverted to wilderness, with its former cities reduced to overgrown ruins. Much of Seattle is underwater, while the other major cities are ringed by massive walls and littered with human skeletons.\n\nThe background to this desolation is revealed through documents and images that the player may collect in any order. It becomes clear that events were set in motion by the development of technology that increased human longevity. When an earthquake in 2031 flooded Seattle, it exposed deposits of a new mineral that was used to construct towering \"Beacons\" in cities around the world. Humans were nearly immortal while within range of a Beacon, but their biological dependence on the technology left them at risk of fatal withdrawal symptoms outside the cities. Responding to the massive movements of population and tension between supporters and opponents of the Beacons, many cities constructed walls, isolating themselves from each other and the rural population that continued to experience natural lifespans. This period also saw the rise to prominence of the Sennin, people with heritable mutations that granted innate immortality and superhuman abilities.\n\nGrowing conflicts and social breakdown culminated in \"the Fall\", a period around 2110 in which the destruction of Beacons by extremists left city-dwellers to die or flee to surviving cities, themselves diminishing in number and hostile towards refugees. Bellevue and Olympia fell at this time, while Victoria survived as a secluded police state for several decades longer. By the period in which the game is set, the rural communities in Western Washington that survived the Fall have disintegrated. In one series of letters, a Sennin named Triya reveals that she came to Washington long after the Fall in search of a cure for Beacon dependence for the world's few remaining cities; she eventually found this in Victoria, but its effectiveness is unknown.\n\n\"Eidolon\"'s primary creator, Kevin Maxon, began work on the game as a thesis project while studying game design at Western Washington University, and it was then developed over 20 months by Maxon's company Ice Water Games. Thematically, Maxon intended to contrast the transience of human civilization with the permanence of nature. This theme is reflected in the game's use of Walt Whitman's poem \"Eidolons\", which provided not only the title but quotations that appear when the protagonist sleeps. Maxon describes the game as \"post-human\" rather than \"post-apocalyptic\" because of the absence of human NPCs.\n\nThe game's design, influenced by academic debate on the relative priority of systems and stories in video games, was intended to separate its rule-based gameplay mechanics from the authored narrative of the backstory. The player character was left unspecified to avoid potential conflict between the character's goals and the player's. To allow the player to develop \"mid-sized\" goals between their overall exploration of the world and small-scale movement, the developers added the binoculars and the system of direction indicators linked to tags. The survival elements were designed to be minimal in order to allow relaxed exploration.\n\nThe graphics were first planned as two-dimensional but changed to three-dimensional to provide the experience of viewing a distant horizon. The lack of polygons and textures for in-game objects was originally intended to allow computers to render the game's expansive landscapes, but Maxon decided that this minimalist style was actually more attractive. Although there is no seasonal cycle in the game, shifts in the color palette over the course of each day were intended to suggest the passage of seasons from spring to winter. \n\nA pre-release trailer in December 2013 drew attention from gaming media including comparisons of the visual style to that of \"Proteus\". This early attention encouraged a Steam Greenlight campaign, after which \"Eidolon\" was released through Steam on August 1, 2014. The game is available for Windows and Mac, but the Ice Water Games website warns of compatibility problems under OSX with some recent video cards.\n\nAs of December 2016, Metacritic displays an aggregate review score for \"Eidolon\" of 64, representing \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nVideo game developer Jack de Quidt wrote a positive review for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, expressing his enjoyment of both the impressionistic graphics and the experience of navigation, \"treating an open world as a great spatial puzzle\". He especially praised the gradual pace of the game's revelations, concerning both the narrative and the details of the gameplay, and considered that spoilers could \"rob this wonderful, strange game of its power\".\n\nWriting for Kill Screen, Chris Priestman gave \"Eidolon\" a score of 62. Priestman praised the appearance of the game's \"routinely poetic expanse\" and noted his desire to \"compulsively snap screenshots\", while also noting that he encountered graphical glitches. He viewed the narrative as interesting from a philosophical and science-fictional viewpoint, finding an implied connection between the theme of immortality and the player character's own ability to survive seemingly lethal events. However, the review took a less favorable view of the mechanics of discovering documents, arguing that this was over-repetitive and detracted from the intrinsic pleasure of exploration in an overjustification effect.\n\nRadu Haulica's Softpedia review gave \"Eidolon\" three stars out of five (\"poor\"). In contrast to de Quidt, Haulica complained that discovering the narrative required excessive, tedious wandering, and also that the limited survival aspects provided insufficient additional reason for engagement. Haulica considered that although views of distant scenery could be effective, the minimal visual style and the \"very limited and drab color palette\" were generally unappealing.\n\n"}

{"id": "31783151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31783151", "title": "GIS and environmental governance", "text": "GIS and environmental governance\n\nGeographic information system (GIS) is a commonly used tool for environmental management, modelling and planning. As simply defined by Michael Goodchild, GIS is as ‘a computer system for handling geographic information in a digital form’. In recent years it has played an integral role in participatory, collaborative and open data philosophies. Social and technological evolutions have elevated ‘digital’ and ‘environmental’ agendas to the forefront of public policy, the global media and the private sector. \n\nGovernment departments routinely use digital spatial platforms to plan and model proposed changes to road networks, building design, greenbelt land, utility provision, crime prevention, energy production, waste management and security. Non-profit organizations also incorporate geospatial and web-mapping approaches into political campaigns to lobby governments, to protest against socially or environmentally harmful companies, and to generate public support. Private business, whether in land management, resource extraction, retail, manufacturing or social media for example, also incorporate GIS into overall profit-making strategies.\n\nCitizen science is part of the wider emphasis upon public involvement in expert fields across Western democracies. The term is 'often used to describe communities or networks of citizens who act as observers in some domain of science’. Although more narrowly used to describe the shift to specifically user-generated forms of knowledge creation, it has been routinely invoked in both the public participatory GIS and environmental governance literature at large. \nMuch of the citizen science literature is grounded in wildlife study. For example, Goodchild references the National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count (CBC) as a classic case of citizen science in action. Each year over the winter period, the American conservation organization encourages volunteer bird-watchers to gather information on the number of bird species in their local area. Once field data has been collected, each volunteer is able to submit their bird sightings into an online database, for the benefit of both scientific researchers and bird enthusiasts. The eBird project – enabling the general public to explore a range of map- and chart-based bird species datasets – is a result of these yearly mass volunteer events.\n\nOf particular interest is the Gulf Spill Bird Tracker; an interactive sightings map for ten species deemed at risk from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Gulf Coast bird watchers were encouraged (at the time when it was live) to submit their sightings of a range of at-danger birds (such as the brown pelican, roseate spoonbill and the Wilson's plover), to help aid the clean-up operation, and pin-point beaches most affected by the oil spill. The National Audubon Society has been deeply involved in the Gulf Oil Response since the disaster, and has a dedicated program to co-ordinate resources, liaise with local government, and deploy equipment post-spill. Their 6-month report brought together some of these key factors. Not only was the National Audubon Society’s citizen science initiative highlighted as the ‘backbone…for understanding the [immediate] impact of the disaster’, but also for long-term efforts to monitor the health of imperilled species in the Gulf Coast region. Moreover, their grassroots ethos has mobilized a vast number of Gulf volunteers to ‘urge elected officials and government agencies to hold polluters like BP accountable’, for the financial, environmental, economic and social costs associated with such disasters. This is perhaps the most obvious example of web-based mapping software (a more ‘citizen-friendly’ form of GIS) and environmental governance discourses colliding head on. The notion of volunteered, user-generated, citizen data is the guiding mantra for such projects, and the cornerstone of any wider attempts to lobby national governments, engage with local community groups, and generate scientific research.\n\nAnother example of citizen science and GIS in action is taken from inside the academy. University College London (UCL) and London 21 sustainability network's Mapping for Change initiative has encouraged voluntary groups, local authorities and development agencies to build map-based projects to support political, social and environmental aims. They even provide a noise mapping toolkit on the Mapping for Change website itself, designed to help local communities gather evidence of intrusive and unwanted environmental nuisances and hazards. The Royal Docks community in London has used such a toolkit to help present their concerns to the Greater London Authority Environment Committee over plans to expand London City Airport. Armed with sound meters, survey sheets and access to an online mapping platform, residents were able to monitor noise levels; from overhead planes and passing motor vehicles, to birdsong and ambient river sounds. Their data was then visualized in various formats to help advance their argument. Royal Docks’ residents are continually plagued by planes taking-off and landing at London City Airport, and plans to expand the number of flights a year by 50% (up to 120,000) were opposed by local communities on the basis that it would decrease their quality of life. \n\nGIS and citizen science go hand-in-hand. Web-based mapping platforms serve as useful tools for national conservation societies, local community groups and planning departments to compile tangible data on environmental issues. Voluntary, grassroots approaches can help compile lay knowledges that feed back into more formal political frameworks.\n\nAt a local level, GIS has been frequently used to engage stakeholders in the planning of environmentally ‘bad’ sites. Nuclear power stations, wind farms, landfill sites, and other energy facilities are often subject to NIMBY opposition for aesthetic, health and social reasons. This is despite of their capacity to produce 'good' economic factors or employment opportunities. GIS has thus found itself deployed alongside broader cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches to socio-political conflict. Environmental Justice (EJ) activists believe these decisions act to further embed racial and class divides. GIS provides an important angle to the EJ movement.\n\nBroadly, the EJ movement is a loose connection of social groups, stakeholders and activists who have sought to contest socio-political injustices. Commonly, this has been through a single motive; the equal distribution of environmental goods and bads. As Schlosberg contends, ‘the issue of distribution is always present and always key’ to the guiding EJ ethos. Yet, other demands are frequently put forward. Following Schlosberg, there are two further demands that constitute the EJ movement than a mere ‘[re-]distribution of environmental ills and benefits. The first is the ‘recognition of the diversity of participants and experiences in affected communities’. Thus, EJ demands that people affected by environmental injustices are appropriately noticed by others. A lack of recognition in local community discourses, ‘demonstrated by various forms of insults, degradation, and devaluation…’, marginalize those already least able to contest political decisions. The second is the notion of \"participatory justice\". According to Schlosberg; ‘[i]f you are not recognised, you do not participate.’ Thus, recognitional justice leads directly to participatory justice. In EJ terms, participation is about involving those outside the typical political/institutional order. Democratic and participatory decision-making procedures are both an element of, and a condition for, social justice. Simultaneously, institutionalised exclusion, social cultures of misrecognition, and current distributional patterns can be challenged.\n\nMaantay and Maroko's research is intended to help hazard management and disaster planning before and after a high magnitude flood event. By using a Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS) they were able to estimate the number of ‘vulnerable sub-populations’ in the densely populated New York City area. Their research broadly supports an EJ approach to natural disaster mitigation. By highlighting the importance of equality issues and the disproportionate exposure some people have to such events, they invoke the EJ movement’s notion of distributional justice. The lack of ‘strong social, financial, or political support structures’ are constituent factors in how people deal with large-scale disasters. The criticism of the US government’s response to the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, draw on such notions. The online publication set-up by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) entitled Understanding Katrina helps to ground this research in socio-political approaches to so-called ‘natural’ disasters.\n\nMaantay and Maroko believe that GIS can have an important role in these 'risk-framed' understandings. As New York is a ‘hyper-heterogeneous urban area’, traditional administrative population data is insufficient for flood zone/population risk research. A more fine-tuned analysis is possible if tax-level datasets (based on smaller, residential units) are used instead. Maantay and Maroko use Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain and tax-level datasets to determine the potential number of people at risk. A CEDS approach significantly increases the number of affected people within New York City. In using a different GIS method, Maantay and Maroko are able to better represent the impact of such flood events on minority populations. As such, their research supports all of Schlosberg's notions of distributional, recognitional and participatory justice. As noted by themselves; ‘the disadvantages suffered by racial and ethnic minority communities during and after disasters are due primarily to their low economic status and lack of political power’. Their research broadly supports the aims of the EJ movement.\n\nGIS has also had a role in formulating new urban landscapes. Planned cities - designed entirely from scratch - routinely use digital technologies to visualize and demonstrate urban layouts, building structures and transport arrangements. Although CAD/CAM technologies are often used to assist in the visualization, construction, and delivery of certain engineering features, GIS helps to realize distinctly spatial components of the city. Environmental narratives of a 'carbon-free' and sustainable future favour those in the GIS industry. 'The challenge of the 21st century' as ESRI would have it, 'is to arrest the progress of climate change'. Geospatial software has played its part in developing this narrative.\n\nMasdar City is a ‘sustainable, zero-carbon, zero-waste’ project currently under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Situated in the Abu Dhabi emirate, Masdar is described as 'an emerging global hub for renewable energy and clean technologies'. The Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company have funded and overseen the $18bn dollar project. No cars are allowed on its streets, energy is produced in part by renewable sources, building materials are ‘sustainable’ and water-use is controlled. GIS is being employed to plan, facilitate and test a plethora of environmental phenomena and technological processes.\n\nA dedicated GIS team is responsible for ‘managing the overall spatial information needs’ of the project, starting with the drawing of a common base map with which to support the city’s infrastructure. Without a spatial plan of Masdar’s operative mechanisms, the city will fail to deliver its grand ambition. In particular, GIS is being used to visualize, analyse and model \"land-use\" in the city. Masdar – unlike any other city – has to incorporate a wealth of energy-related facilities within its perimeter. As EJ activists are all too aware, the siting of such facilities can be a key area of conflict. Masdar’s water treatment and sewage plants, material recycling centre, solar power plant, geothermal test site, solar panel test field and concrete batching plant all need to be situated inside the city’s boundaries. As CH2M HILL’s Site Control and GIS Manager for the Masdar project confirms; ‘never have so many environmental facilities come together in one place’. GIS is the central tool with which to imagine – in a digital environment – different siting scenarios. In this case, GIS is seen to operate as a decision-making tool; informing the practitioners who work on the Masdar project.\n\nGIS is also being used to model some of Masdar’s key infrastructural features directly. Its involvement in simulating the citywide Personal Rapid Transport System (PRTS) is one such example. As common road vehicles are banned from the city, the ‘driverless’ transit system will transport people and freight across the 7km2 area. GIS is capable of modelling the system route, due to comprise 85 passenger stations and approximately 1,700 automated vehicles. By drawing spatial buffer zones around potential PRTS stops, passenger-distance maps can visualize residential areas that fall outside of ideal service requirements. GIS is an instrumental tool in visualizing such problems. A smooth, functioning PRTS is a central infrastructural aspect of Masdar’s grand vision, and engineering companies who specialize in GIS technologies have helped in realizing this digitally-orchestrated dream. Yet journalists in particular have been sceptical. As Bryan Walsh has argued; [wi]ll Masdar City ever really develop the authenticity of a real city?'. Or as Jonathan Glancey contends, will its 'ultra-modern aspects...prove to be a mirage'?\n\n‘Post-politics’ is a neologism for the consensual, participatory and techno-managerial approach to modern governance. Originally coined by Slavoj Zizek, and discussed by the likes of Jacques Rancière and Erik Swyngedouw, the post-political critique argues that life in the Western world is routinely characterized by the de-politicizing effects of a 'consensual police order'. A number of different techno-managerial ‘fixes’ have been sought by neoliberal governments in order to solve expressly environmental problems, rather than due political processes. As Swyngedouw has argued, such forces have ‘replaced debate, disagreement and dissensus with a series of technologies of governing that fuse around consensus, agreement, accountancy merits and technocratic environmental management’. Thus if the rise of the post-political order is due to the increasing reliance upon ‘technocratic environmental management’, as Swyngedouw has argued, then GIS – as a tool for neoliberal environmental governance – is implicit in such an order.\n\nFirstly, it serves to elucidate upon claims to a ‘post-political impasse’. This is best understood through what Ranciere calls \"the police\", \"the political\" and \"politics\". It is within these three terms that Ranciere carves out what he calls the true meaning of political action, and of what it is to exercise political right. As Panagia neatly summarizes; ‘politics is the practice of asserting one’s position that ruptures the logic of arche’. Politics is about rediscovering the art of debate, conflict and struggle, and not merely about re-organizing the administrative framework of existing political structures (namely, the state apparatus).\" The political\" – in Ranciere’s words – is for ‘[t]he one who is ‘unaccounted-for’, the one who has no speech to be heard’. Democracy does not work towards an ‘idealized-normative condition’ of equal rights, but is built upon the very ontological notion of such. \"Politics\" brings the political into the foreground; rendering that which was previously noise, legitimate speech. Much of what is thought to be politics in the contemporary world is actually subsumed within \"the police\". Policy is not politics is this sense, then. This is what Ranciere calls \"the partition of the sensible\", or the established order of things.\n\nThe post-politics of contemporary governance brings all that it can into this order. Those who were previously cast outside the police structure are now '‘responsible’ partners’ in a stakeholder-based arrangement. All views that were previously antagonistic and conflictual are now brought together in a more homely, consensual arena. No room is made for ‘irrational’ demands. As such, Ranciere says that, ‘[c]onsensus is the reduction of politics to the police’. Nowhere has this been more visible than within the apocalyptic climate narratives told \"ad infinitum\" by environmental practitioners, policy-makers and non-governmental organizations. Consensual politics has found its home in the environmental arena.\n\nIn short, GIS works as a tool for mediating and diffusing socio-environmental conflicts. It does so by working within Ranciere’s notion of the partition of the sensible. Whilst it may allow previously unheard voices to gain a voice (in environmental justice campaigns, foremostly), it still does not – as a tool of neoliberal governance – make room for those who are deemed ‘outside’, unruly or conflictual to have a voice. For example, Elwood laments the notionally ‘participatory’ flag-waving carried out by those involved in urban GIS-based projects. As she says, ‘the skills and financial and temporal costs of using GIS effectively bar many individuals, social groups and organizations from participation in research and decision-making where it is used’, denying those without the means to participate, from participation. GIS does not necessarily facilitate involvement for all.\n\nMoreover, GIS is limited in its ontological scope, reducing all things spatial to a \"calculable order\". As Leszczynski contends, GIS operates a ‘discourse populated by discrete objects of knowledge’; differentiating ‘between the binary of truth and error’. GIS is thus a central \"polic-ing\" tool for contemporary socio-environmental governance. It works to order space into discrete and ordered formats. As Jeremy Crampton points out, ‘the basic model of the world in GIScience texts is: points, lines, areas, surfaces and volumes’, ill-prepared to deal with non-discrete, continuous environmental phenomena. All that does not fit into this order is left aside. GIS thus excludes that which cannot be ‘structured accordingly’, excluding epistemologies that do not neatly fit into the formal computing framework; a formal framework synonymous with ‘the accountancy calculus of risk and the technologies of expert administration’. The apparatus of choice for the techno-enviro-managerialist, if Ranciere and Swyngedouw's analyses are to be put forward, and Elwood, Crampton and Leszczynski's criticism's are to be accepted, is GIS.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57722055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57722055", "title": "Geology of Nigeria", "text": "Geology of Nigeria\n\nThe geology of Nigeria formed beginning in the Archean and Proterozoic eons of the Precambrian. The country forms the Nigerian Province and more than half of its surface is igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock from the Precambrian. Between 2.9 billion and 500 million years ago, Nigeria was affected by three major orogeny mountain-building events and related igneous intrusions. Following the Pan-African orogeny, in the Cambrian at the time that multi-cellular life proliferated, Nigeria began to experience regional sedimentation and witnessed new igneous intrusions. By the Cretaceous period of the late Mesozoic, massive sedimentation was underway in different basins, due to a large marine transgression. By the Eocene, in the Cenozoic, the region returned to terrestrial conditions. \n\nNigeria has tremendous oil and natural gas resources housed in its thick sedimentary basins, as well as reserves of gold, lead, zinc, tantalite, columbite, coal and tin. \n\nThe oldest Precambrian rocks in Nigeria likely formed during the Archean or the Paleoproterozoic, forming the Beninian gneiss, in the Benin-Nigeria Orogen, formed during the Proterozoic Pan-African orogeny. The crystalline basement rock of the country is grouped as the Nigerian Province, a southern continuation of the central Hoggar reactivated basement. \n\nThe ancient rocks of the Nigerian Province are split up by thrust and shear zones. The Migmatite-Gneiss Complex covers half of Nigeria's surface area and encompasses Archean gray gneisses, with tonalite and granodiorite consistencies. Within this complex are occurrences of schist, migmatite, garnet, sillimanite, kyanite and staurolite, which together indicate high-grade metamorphism up to the level of amphibolite on the sequence of metamorphic facies. Granites are associated with charnockite bodies and granulite facies metamorphism. \n\nThe Migmatite-Gneiss Complex differs in the Ibadan area, in the southwest. Banded gneiss, schist and quartzite formed from the metamorphism of greywacke, shale and interbedded sandstones. Some amphibolite layers record the metamorphosed remains of a tholeiitic magma series. The early folding and metamorphism in the Ibadan area was followed by the emplacement of aplite schist and microgranodiorite dikes during the Liberian orogeny 2.75 billion years ago. More intense deformation followed 2.2 billion years ago during the Eburnean orogeny. \n\nMetazquartzites in the Ibadan area, likely from the Proterozoic, are overlain by pelite schist, intruded by mafic sills rich in magnesium. They are overlain by Neoproterozoic pelites, including phyllite and both muscovite and biotite schists, as well as quartzites that form strike ridges in several parts of Nigeria. \n\nYounger metasediments are found in the southwest and northwest in synclinorial schist belts. Compared to the surrounding migmatite-gneiss complexes, these low-grade metamorphic rocks have isoclinal folding and steeply dipping foliation. They have faulted and sheared boundaries with the surrounding rock. \n\nGeologists have interpreted these schist belts the remains of paleo-rift systems. The Pan-African orogeny in the late Proterozoic affected all of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic rocks in the region. Continent-continent collision and eastward subduction affected the southern Trans-Saharan mobile belt and emplaced granitoids throughout the Nigerian Province. In Nigeria, Pan-African orogeny related granite, syenite and diorite intrusions formed between 700 and 500 million years ago and are known as the Older Granites. \n\nIn the Cambrian, at the beginning of the Paleozoic, volcanic debris filled molasse grabens, forming dacite and shoshonite, as the Older Granites continued to emplace. In some cases, granite intrusions formed large batholiths and charnockite. The end of the Pan-African orogeny was also accompanied by the intrusion of basalt and dolerite dikes. \n\nIn the Mesozoic, during the Jurassic, ring complexes known as the Younger Granites intruded Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic basement rocks in the Jos Plateau, as well as in the Air region in Niger. The Younger Granites are primarily alkali-feldpsar granites, although the ring complexes also include rhyolite, gabbro and syenite. The ring dikes tend to be highly mineralized and enriched in niobium and tin. \n\nLarge sedimentary basins formed in southern Nigeria, divided by the Okitipupa Ridge. The basins did not begin to fill with sediment until the Albian age of the Cretaceous. In the southeast, poorly bedded sandy shale alternates with layers of sandstone and sandy limestone, containing ammonite, radiolarian, echinoid and gastropod fossils. Subsequently, some of these sedimentary rock layers experienced lead and zinc mineralization. \n\nThe arkose sandstone, limestone and shale of the 600 meter thick Odukpani Formation formed during the Cenomanian until the early Turonian, in the vicinity of modern day Calabar. Fish teeth, ammonites and echinoids date the Eze-Aku Formation to the Turonian, while the blue-gray shales and marl limestone of the Awgu Formation dates to the Coniacian. During the Santonian age of the Cretaceous, sea levels dropped. However, by the Campanian and the Maastrichtian, the Nkporo Formation records shale, mudstone, limestone and sandstones formed in an offshore environment. In other parts of Nigeria, the Owelli Sandstone, Enugu Shale and Asata Shale formed around the same time in shallow water environments. Other formations of similar age include the ammonite-bearing coals of Mamu Formation and the Nsukka Formation, both from the Maastrichtian.\n\nThe Maastrichtian age brought a large marine transgression to southwest Nigeria, depositing the Abeokuta Formation.\nThe Iullemeden Basin, also known as the Sokoto Basin spans Mali, western Niger, northwest Nigeria and northern Benin and began accumulating sediments in the Jurassic, followed by the Maastrichtian Rima Group, which records a brackish environment. \nApproximately one-tenth of the Chad Basin is situated in Nigeria. Albian Bima sandstone lie unconformably atop Precambrian basement rock, followed by the Turonian limestone and shale sequences of the Gongila Formation. Marine shales of the Fika Formation formed during the Senonian. The Maastrichtian brought a shift to an estuary environment, leading to the deposition of the Gombe Sandstones, which are intercalated with ironstone, siltstone and shales. \n\nHigh sea levels continued into the early Cenozoic. In the west, the Akinbo Formation and Ewekoro Formation both deposited in the Paleocene, while the Ino Formation took shape atop the Nsukka in the east, with layers of thick, clay shale. \nThe Sokoto Group in the Iullemeden Basin contains marine sediments. However, by the Eocene, sea levels retreated and afterward Nigeria mainly experienced terrestrial sedimentation. \n\nAround the end of the Cretaceous and the start of the Cenozoic, the sedimentary rocks in the Chad Basin were folded into anticlines and synclines. Erosion created an unconformity with younger rocks. Terrestrial sediments built up in the Paleocene Kerri Kerri Formation, followed by Pliocene lake sediments of the Chad Formation. \n\nUnconsolidated sediments 15 to 30 meters thick line the Niger and Benue rivers and are recharged from rainwater, along with the near surface, shallow aquifers of the Niger Delta Basin and the partially consolidated Benin Formation. In central and eastern Nigeria, regional occurrences of volcanic rock contain groundwater in fractures, less than five meters deep. \n\nMost of Nigeria's large sedimentary basins have intergranular flow, rainwater recharge and few water quality issues. Within the Chad Basin, the Chad Formation is unconfined in some locations, with artesian flow from some deeper layers and a water table depth of 10 to 15 meters. The Gombe Sandstone is comparatively low permeability and the deeper Kerri-Kerri Formation remains poorly studied. The water table in the Sokoto Group varies widely between 20 and 100 meters deep, unconfined near the surface and confined in lower layers of the Gwandu Formation. Within the Sokoto Group, the Wurno Formation has moderate yields and limited recharge, while the Gundumi Formation conglomerates are good aquifers, with artesian conditions, bounded by deeper clay layers. Other sedimentary aquifers include the Nupe Basin, Upper Benue Basin and Lower Benue Basin.\n\nPrecambrian crystalline basement rock supports regional aquifers in weathered zones, 10 to 25 meters thick, as well as in fractures. In particular, metasedimentary rocks often weather to be clay rich, forming aquitards. \n\nNigeria has extensive natural resources and is the largest crude oil producer in Africa and 20 billion barrels of reserves. As such, petroleum is central to economy of Nigeria, producing 80 percent of government revenues and 95 percent of export earnings. Additionally, Nigeria has 2.6 trillion cubic meters of natural gas and a high overall gas to oil ratio. Seventy percent of both oil and gas resources are onshore. \n\nThe country also has extensive mineral deposits, although most are under-exploited. According to the Geological Survey of Nigeria Agency, Nigeria has some 34 known major mineral deposits across the country. Exploration of solid minerals like tin, niobium, lead, zinc and gold, goes back for more than 90 years, but there has been a world-wide scale production of tin and niobium only.\n\nGold mines were active before World War II, extracting from crystalline basement rock in the northwest, but a combination of low gold prices and legal turmoil ended the industry. The Younger Granites of the Jos Plateau contain significant tin deposits, mined since before European colonization. However, in recent years, tin mining has been significantly curtailed by flooding in the mines and low tin prices, as well as water pollution from the mines. Tantalite and columbite are both associated with the tin ore in the plateau.\n\nThe states of Anambra, Benue, Plateau and Taraba have small-scale lead and zinc mining, from deposits that also have large quantities of cadmium, arsenic and antimony. Barite veins commonly contain lead and zinc in Plateau State and other parts of eastern Nigeria. Kawara State has iron ore in Agbaja Plateau and Itakpe Hills. \n\nNigeria also has other resources useful for energy and construction, including a poorly understood lignite belt in the south, kaolin, gypsum and feldspar. Coal mining provided much of the country's energy between 1915 and 1960, although the industry has been in a long-running decline, now providing energy only for small-scale kilns and smelters. \n"}
{"id": "2609030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2609030", "title": "Grand Harbour", "text": "Grand Harbour\n\nThe Grand Harbour (), also known as the Port of Valletta, is a natural harbour on the island of Malta. It has been substantially modified over the years with extensive docks, wharves, and fortifications.\n\nThe harbour mouth faces north east and is bounded to the north by Saint Elmo Point and further sheltered by an isolated breakwater and is bounded to the south by Ricasoli Point. Its north west shore is formed by the Sciberras peninsula, which is largely covered by the city of Valletta and its suburb Floriana. This peninsula also divides Grand Harbour from a second parallel natural harbour, Marsamxett Harbour. The main waterway of Grand Harbour continues inland almost to Marsa. The southeastern shore of the harbour is formed by a number of inlets and headlands, principally Rinella Creek, Kalkara Creek, Dockyard Creek, and French Creek, which are covered by Kalkara and the Three Cities: Cospicua, Vittoriosa, and Senglea. The harbour has been described as Malta's greatest geographic asset.\n\nWith its partner harbour of Marsamxett, Grand Harbour lies at the centre of gently rising ground. Development has grown up all around the twin harbours and up the slopes so that the whole bowl is effectively one large conurbation. Much of Malta's population lives within a three kilometer radius of Floriana. This is now one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. The harbours and the surrounding areas make up Malta's Northern and Southern Harbour Districts. Together, these districts contain 27 of 68 local councils. They have a population of 213,722 which make up over 47% of the total population of the Maltese islands.\n\nThe Maltese islands have a long history, mainly due to its strategic location and natural harbours, mainly the Grand Harbour as well as Marsamxett. The Grand Harbour has in fact been used since prehistoric times.\n\nMegalithic remains have been found on the shores of the Grand Harbour. The Kordin Temples, the earliest of which date back to around 3700 BC, overlooked the harbour from Corradino Heights. Another megalithic structure possibly existed underwater off Fort Saint Angelo, but this can no longer be seen. Punic and Roman remains were also found on the shores of the harbour.\n\nBy the 12th and 13th centuries, the \"Castrum Maris\" had been built in what is now Birgu. It might have been built instead of ancient buildings, possibly Phoenician or Roman temples, or an Arab fortress.\n\nIn 1283, the Battle of Malta was fought at the entrance of the Grand Harbour. Aragonese forces defeated a larger Angevin force and captured 10 galleys.\n\nThe Grand Harbour was the base for the Order of Saint John for 268 years, from 1530 to 1798. They settled in the city of Birgu and improved its fortifications, including rebuilding the \"Castrum Maris\" as Fort Saint Angelo. In July 1551, Barbary corsairs and Ottoman forces raided Malta. They landed at Marsamxett and marched upon the Grand Harbour, but did not attack as they found the town of Birgu too well fortified to attack. Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the Ottoman force later managed to sack Gozo and conquer Tripoli within the same campaign. After the attack, Fort Saint Elmo and Fort Saint Michael were built to better protect the harbour in any future attacks. The city of Senglea was also founded soon afterwards.\n\nLater on in the 1550s, a tornado struck the Grand Harbour, killing 600 people and destroying a shipping armada.\n\nThe area was the scene of much of the fighting in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565 when the Ottomans attempted to eject the Order of St John but were ultimately defeated. After the siege, the capital city of Valletta was built on the Sciberras peninsula on the north west shore of the harbour. Over the years, more fortifications and settlements were founded within the Grand Harbour, including Fort Ricasoli and the towns of Floriana and Cospicua.\nDuring the French occupation of Malta, the harbour area was blockaded by Maltese rebels on land and the Royal Navy at sea. The French eventually capitulated in September 1800 and Malta became a British protectorate, later a colony. During the British colonial rule, the harbour became a strategic base for the Royal Navy and the base of the Mediterranean Fleet.\nThe whole area was savagely bombed during the Second Siege of Malta during World War II, as the docks and military installations around the port became targets for Axis bombers. However collateral damage wrecked much of Valletta and The Three Cities, and caused large numbers of civilian casualties. \n\nMalta Dockyard is still active but with the departure of the British Military the harbour lost much of its military significance. A considerable part of Malta's commercial shipping is now handled by the new free port at Kalafrana, so the harbour is much quieter than it was in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe Grand Harbour, the backdrop to Malta's history, is set to experience a regeneration as in September 2007, the Maltese Government unveiled 20 proposed projects that would revamp the area while respecting its historic value.\n\nThe 20 proposals are these:\nCoordinates: \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19746798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19746798", "title": "Here (company)", "text": "Here (company)\n\nHERE Technologies is a company that provides mapping and location data and related services to individuals and companies. It is majority-owned by a consortium of German automotive companies (namely Audi, BMW, and Daimler), whilst other companies also own minority stakes. Its roots date back to U.S.-based Navteq in 1985, which was acquired by Finland-based Nokia in 2007. Here is currently based in Amsterdam.\n\nHERE captures location content such as road networks, buildings, parks and traffic patterns. It then sells or licenses that mapping content, along with navigation services and location solutions to other businesses such as Alpine, Garmin, BMW, Oracle and Amazon.com. In addition, HERE provides platform services to smartphones. It provides location services through its own HERE applications, and also for GIS and government clients and other providers, such as Microsoft Bing, Facebook and Yahoo! Maps. HERE has maps in nearly 200 countries, offers voice guided navigation in 94 countries, provides live traffic information in 33 countries and has indoor maps available for about 49,000 unique buildings in 45 countries. The company is also working on self-driving technology.\n\nHERE has built its mapping and location business by acquiring location technology and know-how: the company is a combination of what was formerly \"Navteq\" and \"Nokia Maps\".\n\n\"Navteq\" (styled \"NAVTEQ\"), was an American company founded in 1985 as Karlin & Collins, Inc., later known as Navigation Technologies Corporation and eventually as Navteq. At the time of its acquisition by Nokia, Navteq was the largest maker of automotive grade map data used in car navigation equipment.\n\nNokia Maps began in 2001 as Smart2Go, a generic 3D-map interface for access to tourist information on mobile terminals. It was developed by an EU consortium named TellMaris. Nokia gained the rights to the software when it acquired Berlin-based route planning software company Gate 5 in August 2006, which has become the cornerstone for the company's mapping business. It then made the Smart2Go application free to download.\n\nIn October 2007, Nokia acquired the Chicago-based company Navteq, which brought 25 years of experience in creating automotive grade map content, and a deep footprint in the automotive industry. Nokia ran Navteq's business along with their own Nokia Maps (later known as Ovi Maps, then again as Nokia Maps from 2011). The two divisions remained as separate entities of Nokia Corporation until Navteq was amalgamated into the core Nokia operations in 2011. The service was rebranded as H in 2012, bringing together mapping, location businesses, satellite navigation and other services under one brand.\n\nIn 2008, Nokia picked up geo social networking site Plazes and the following year it bought mobile applications developer Bit-Side, social location pioneer Plum, and social travel service Dopplr. In 2010, it acquired Metacarta a leading enterprise local search service used by security and military.\n\nIn April 2011, Nokia released a beta version of 3D maps that covered 20 cities in the world. By August 2011, the coverage has expanded to 23 cities, and in 2012, Nokia bought EarthMine, which specialises in street level 3D image capture.\n\nIn May 2011, \"Ovi Maps\" was renamed to \"Nokia Maps\" when Nokia streamlined its services offering.\n\nIn October 2011, Maps & Drive for Windows Phone 7 (Mango) was announced, which was available on Nokia Lumia phones (710, 800 and in 2012, the 900). However, major features such as off-line routing and text-to-speech navigation of street names, compared to the Symbian version, were absent. These features were eventually brought over to the Windows Phone platform in 2012.\n\nOn 13 November 2012, Nokia announced that it would rebrand its location offering as \"HERE\" to highlight its vision for the future of location-based services and its belief in the importance of mapping.\n\nIn June 2014, HERE announced that it had acquired Medio a Seattle-based start-up that specialized in predictive analytics.\n\nIn 2014, Windows Phone's low market share, as well as the end of Nokia's partnership with Microsoft, led to the company prioritizing Android and iOS development.\nHere launched the HERE beta app for Samsung Galaxy smartphones in August 2014. Later in October the app became available on all Android devices running on 4.1 Jelly Bean or higher.\n\nThe HERE app was re-launched for iOS 8 platform on 11 March 2015.\n\nOn 3 August 2015, HERE was sold to a consortium of German car makers Audi, BMW, and Mercedes. On 4 December 2015, the consortium completed the acquisition for 2.8 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars). As of December 2015 the company had 6500 employees.\n\nIn December 2016, Navinfo, Tencent and GIC Private Limited (the Singapore sovereign wealth fund) agreed to buy a 10% stake in HERE. But in September 2017, the offer of the three companies failed, as US authorities did not authorize the transaction.\n\nIn January 2017 it was reported that Intel was taking a 15% stake in the firm. In September 2017, Here and Pioneer Corporation have reached an agreement in which HERE would acquire approximately 3% of Pioneer’s stock at a value of €17.3 million. In parallel, at the same cost, Pioneer would acquire less than 1% of HERE.\n\nIn January 2018, Continental and Bosch acquired a 5% stake in HERE.\n\nIn November 2017, HERE announced it would acquire Advanced Telematic Systems for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe German consortium together hold a 74% stake in the company.\n\nThe 2016 Jaguar Cars XF and XJ models incorporate HERE drive guidance in their in-car infotainment systems. All of the features of the HERE suite are available to the driver, including maps, navigation, and social sharing using Glympse. This is all available on either eight, ten or 12.3-inch display screens within the car itself (screen size dependent on model). A hallmark feature of HERE Auto is the ability to plan the journey right from the Android or iOS app before entering the car, and seamless guidance to the final destination after parking the car. What sets HERE Auto apart from competitors such as Android Auto and CarPlay is its nature of being contextually aware, rather than just a screen mirroring solution. Country and region maps are also able to be downloaded directly to the flash-based storage of the HERE Auto system itself, much like the ability to store offline maps on devices using the Android/iOS HERE apps.\n\nHERE MapCare was first implemented with Volvo vehicles in 2009, and has since spread to at least 23 other manufacturers (such as Hyundai, Mazda and Mitsubishi) utilising HERE maps data in their infotainment systems. HERE map data is updated for around a period of three years from the date of purchase of the vehicle, and is performed at the time of service from the car dealer. There is also the option of updating maps data via USB memory stick or memory card.\n\nHERE maps data and technologies are also integrated in the technologies of other car and company companies. Some prominent examples are listed below:\n\nGarmin has been using HERE for its mapping system since the days its been branded as NAVTEQ. With its recent models of Garmin GPS navigation units, HERE has facilitated and used DAB to broadcast live traffic information free to users. This is done through the power cable of the GPS unit acting as an antenna, and provides enough data with low latency, allowing data to be updated in very fast intervals. This is in comparison to data charges stemming from using devices with a SIM card to provide this same level of detailed traffic information.\n\nMyFord Mobile from the Ford Motor Company has its location services powered by HERE mapping data, allowing users to find their parked cars remotely from the relevant iOS or Android app. Routes for driving are also able to be planned on the phone itself and sent to the car ready to be enacted. Charging station locations for electric vehicles already inherent in the HERE mapping database are also included in the calculation of routes to be driven.\n\nHERE also has a presence at major motor trade shows around the globe. For example, at the \"Mondial de l’Automobile 2014\" show in Paris, HERE had its maps in 50 of the 62 cars on show. HERE also attends other major trade shows such as CES in Las Vegas.\n\nHERE also conducts work on various new technologies to improve traffic, mapping and the experience of driving. Listed below are recent prominent examples of these:\n\nIn August 2015, HERE introduced a new traffic-jam warning system called Traffic Safety Warning. The system works in alerting the driver with a suitable time period to react to the fact that there is a traffic jam up ahead. Data is updated every minute and is yet another way in which data collected is used to the benefit and safety of drivers.\n\nIn June 2015, HERE published an interface specification named the Sensor Ingestion Interface Specification. This standard defines how sensor data gathered by vehicles on the road can be sent to the cloud to update maps on the fly. The premise of the technology is to allow for the collection of data to alert other cars on the road to traffic obstacles or accidents in the vicinity. HERE has called for leading car manufacturers from across the world to promote its specification and call for a standardised data format, thereby leading to all consumers receiving the same traffic data reporting.\n\nHERE also works in the field of automated vehicles, with the recent provision of its HD Map data for manufacturers in testing their vehicles. The highly accurate mapped data of private test tracks provides these cars with a highly accurate navigation system to complement data collected from on-board sensors. Much like existing map data is collected for consumer driving, the same LiDAR technology is used to map these private test tracks along with the roads that are used for public testing. HD Map data is also highly accurate, with accuracy to a level of 10 to 20 centimetres, and the collection of lane geometry is also part of the data collection task. HERE makes approximately 2.7 million changes to its global map database every day.\n\nAlso part of the field of autonomous vehicles and automated driving is the Live Roads technology. HERE is currently developing such a technology that will be able to alert drivers of conditions such as weather to alert other drivers of possible hazards, or to avoid a particular area whilst driving. An example is the aggregation of data from windshield wipers and slipping tyres to notify other drivers to avoid an ice-filled area. The company is also investigating Humanised Driving where data is collected on driving habits on roads, and provisioning this data to allow automated cars to follow how drivers behave (speed, traffic lights etc.) when driving on certain roads.\n\nHERE has also worked with in developing new technologies for intelligent speed guidance. Through the smart provision of traffic lights and management, traffic congestion and vehicle efficiency will be able to be improved.\n\nHERE WeGo, formerly Nokia Maps and HERE Maps, is a consumer mapping application that works on smartphones or through a web browser. It is currently available in 196 countries and its features include turn-by-turn walking navigation, offline availability, 3D landmarks and indoor Venue Maps for 100,000+ unique buildings in 87 countries. A favourite's list shows the top 25 most popular places in the vicinity looking at positive reviews, search queries and other user data. The application is also integrated with an augmented reality technology called LiveSight that lets users hold up their phone to reveal information about the buildings including contact information, hours and reviews in their line of sight from the phone camera display.\n\nIn November 2012, HERE announced the decision to open up its location platform to all operating systems so that anyone with any kind of device could access it. With an open platform Here broadens its reach and acquires more users, which in turn generates more data for its location cloud. Here developed a HERE Maps API for Android which is available to partners. Apps built with the HERE Android API will be able to interact with extruded 3D buildings, search for specific buildings and preview their routes in detail.\n\nIn November 2012, HERE created an HTML5-based web service for iOS. The free app provides iPhone users with maps in almost 200 countries as well as public transit, walking and driving directions. Voice guided navigation is available for walking directions. It also provides multiple map views including a satellite view, public transportation view and live traffic view. HERE Maps on iOS received lukewarm praise mostly because it was a web application and not a native one. Here Maps for iOS got multiple bad reviews from the start stating it was \"a mess\", \"a wreck\", \"unfinished\", \"buggy\" and \"rushed out HTML5-powered turkey\". It was pulled from the App Store in December 2013, after having not been updated for 10 months. The HERE web site was offered as replacement, however as of December 2014, Here noted that they plan to \"officially launch HERE for iOS in early 2015.\" HERE was re-launched as a true app designed for iOS application on 11 March 2015.\n\nHERE makes its location-based assets, such as offline maps, available for the Microsoft Windows platform through a dedicated Windows SDK\n\nBecause the suite runs on Windows, users can save their favourite destinations as live tiles to their start screen and the app will calculate routes based on current location. The suite is integrated so that users can access individual functions going from one app to the next without going back to the home screen. Favourites are saved to the cloud so that they can be accessed on all of the different applications.\n\nIn February 2013, Nokia announced that HERE Maps, HERE Drive and HERE Transit would be available on all Windows devices at the Windows Store.\n\nHERE Drive provides navigation designed for in car driving in 94 countries. Its features include visual and audio speed limit warnings, voice guided turn-by-turn navigation with spoken street names (optional) in more than 60 countries in 50 different languages and offline availability. The user interface is designed for drivers and map data includes 260 attributes such as turn restrictions, physical barriers and one-way streets. HERE Drive and HERE Drive+ have optional live traffic information where available, but both lack dynamic rerouting, which is restricted to everyday commuting in a few countries only and then does not come with voice guidance.\n\nHERE Transit has public transportation information for more than 700 cities in 50 countries. It combines bus, train, ferry, tram and walking information in one application.\n\nHERE City Lens is augmented reality (AR) software that gives dynamic information, through the phone’s camera display, about users' surroundings such as shops, restaurants, and points of interest, shown as virtual signs overlaid on or above buildings. A commercial Beta version was released in 2013.\n\nIt also has free of charge turn-by-turn voice guided navigation, Here Drive 3.0 (earlier \"Nokia Drive\"), which can also be used without internet connection using preloaded maps. It is also possible to de-clutter the surroundings: version 1.5 has a \"Sightline\" feature where users can narrow their view to just what is in the direct line of sight, making it easier to spot interesting places.\n\nHERE City Lens is powered by Bing Maps, and Nokia introduced Here Prime Place for listing. The newest release has 3D icons and the ability to disable places which are not within the camera's line of sight.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, HERE announced that it would discontinue support for its app for Windows 10 Mobile on 29 March 2016 due to its use of \"a workaround that will no longer be effective after June 30, 2016\", and that the existing Windows Phone 8 app will only receive critical updates after this date and no longer be actively developed.\n\nHere was available on Symbian platform under the previous names of Nokia Maps, and Ovi Maps. The latest, and the last, version 3.09 included:\n\n\nNokia stated that the Nokia 808 from 2012, would be the last Symbian phone. Symbian development has halted, therefore no new features for Nokia Maps are to be expected. Accenture is responsible for maintenance of Symbian and Nokia Maps until 2016.\n\nThe supported phones are:\n\n\nMaps for the Series 40 platform (such as early phones from the Nokia Asha series) were limited compared to other platforms. The maps were streamed online into the device or pre-downloaded with Nokia Suite. In some markets, the phones came with a SD card with preloaded local maps. They mostly did not have turn-by-turn navigation, and pedestrian routes were limited to length. As none of the Asha series phones had GPS, positioning was done by Cell ID of the cellular network or by using the Wi-Fi positioning system. An exception was the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition, which was an S40 phone with GPS and full turn by turn voice navigation.\n\nHERE is the default map software on Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish OS, Fire OS and Tizen.\nIt is available on Firefox OS.\n\nHERE Map Creator (http://mapcreator.here.com) is a service launched in November 2012 to allow users to update the HERE map. The service is available for more than 100 countries and in 47 languages. It can be accessed from their website mapcreator.here.com and dedicated HERE Map Creator Android and iPhone apps.\n\nUsers are able to add new roads (trails are included here), edit a road or remove it, add a new place, edit a place or remove it and finally add a house number, edit or remove it. In addition, users can edit road details such as speed limits, number of lanes, 1 or 2 way, type \"open road\", \"tunnel\" or \"bridge\", pavement type, etc. and also add local shops and businesses into various categories such as a grocery store, clothing store, types of restaurants (including cuisine and name of food joint), sports equipment store among several other categories and sub categories. and give various details about them including photos, contact nos., addresses, hours and days of operations in a week, payment info in the shops (whether they accept cash, cards, discount coupons or not). Users can also report map changes. Tutorial videos and instructions to carrying out the editing operations are available on their website.\n\nHERE provides mapping data and assistance to many customers in the enterprise sector. One of these services powered by HERE mapping data and geocoding is the FC.frameLOGIC fuel control system by frameLOGIC, which uses fuel probes installed in the vehicle fuel tank to detect discrepancies and ultimately from three to ten percent on their fuel expenditures. Another company making use of HERE data is MapMechanics, whose Truckstops VRS solution engages HERE real-time traffic and historical data patterns to plan ahead and factor in events such as transit strikes, to in turn re-route drivers. Sygic is another truck company that uses HERE map data for its Truck Navigation software, depending on its accuracy and reliability. Other pertinent examples of companies using HERE for their services are Aramex, TimoCom, we-do-IT, Amadeus, Maps4News and Baidu.\n\nIn July 2015, HERE launched HERE Traffic Analytics, which helps companies to plan for the effects of traffic on projects such as road construction. With the giant silo of data available, HERE has made current and retrospective data available for business customers to be constructed, tailored and extracted to the customers' requirements. Giving such granular control over the data allows for customers to use this data for the purposes they require, and the amount of detail and control needed for projects.\n\nThe HERE Mobile SDK was launched in February 2014, and in the time since has expanded to add more functionality for developers. There are many customers using HERE mapping data as the backbone for their mobile apps, and the SDK provides access to information such as average road speeds, traffic build-up, and maximum loads that can be transported on a particular road. There have been even more features and access added in each iteration of the SDK, with the latest 3.0 version launching in mid-2015. In the \"HERE Mobile SDK Starter Edition 3.0\", there are native Android and iOS APIs for raster tile map display, online points of interest search, geocoding/reverse geocoding and online pedestrian/car route calculation. \"HERE Mobile SDK Premium Edition 3.0\" extends the functionality to include vector maps, turn-by-turn guidance, truck routing, 3D venue maps and augmented reality. Offline Enterprise Maps (for truck attributes and congestion zones) and LiveSight pedestrian guidance are also provided in this latest version of the SDK. HERE Data Lens is another service launched by HERE whereby customers can visualise their usage of data on a map in a visual form. This pictorial representation provides for extended analysis of datasets and how they are being used.\n\nHERE draws on more than 80,000 data sources including a vehicle fleet, which collects data through panoramic cameras, position sensors and laser technology for 3D footprints. The cars have an array of cameras, which capture 360-degree street views and LIDAR sensors, which capture 1.3 billion data points every minute. Another bank of high-resolution cameras capture signs such as speed limits and street names. In November 2012, Nokia acquired Berkeley based company Earthmine to further bolster its 3D street level imagery processing capabilities. In addition, HERE relies on local source data and input from map users to generate constant daily map updates, such as real time traffic, turn by turn directions, public transportation routes and information about local business and attractions.\n\nBy 2013, four out of five cars globally with fully integrated in-dash navigation systems used Here data. HERE supplies map content for Alpine, BMW, Mercedes, Garmin, Hyundai, Pioneer, Volkswagen and Toyota among other car companies and enterprises.\n\nHERE also provides mapping data for popular apps to find and order taxis. Some of these apps are Easy Taxi, MetroView and Grab Taxi.\n\nHERE licenses its location platform to other major companies including Amazon, Bing, Yahoo!, Flickr, SAP and Oracle. Each partner uses the HERE location platform, which is available to any business or screen, to optimise experiences for its own users depending on the particular context. Amazon, for example, uses the HERE platform for maps and geocoding, in Amazon Maps. In 2012 the platform computed 11 billion traffic probes a month, 80 million geocoding requests daily, 24 million route requests a day and more than 1 billion search queries in a year.\n\nNokia threatened legal action against a small UK technology firm over its use of the word \"Here\". Lowdownapp, a digital personal assistant allows users to tell friends they have arrived at a location by pressing the \"Here\" button. In a letter seen by the BBC, Nokia gave London-based Lowdownapp a deadline of 10 February 2015, to rebrand the \"Here\" function of the apps. \"Our client has invested heavily in building and promoting the Here brand since launch,\". The firm said it had registered trademarks for the word when it related to computer software, such as apps. David Senior, chief executive of Lowdownapp, described the threat as a real-life David versus Goliath.\n\n\n"}

The Inuit named him \"Saumik,\" which means \"the left-handed one\".\n\nBorn in St. Catharines, Ontario, he studied art as a child with Arthur Lismer and was educated at the Ontario College of Art (1938–40), Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris (1947–48) and in Japan (1958–59) where he studied printmaking. He fought in World War II with the Toronto Scottish Regiment, receiving the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal. After the war, he went to the Eastern Arctic to paint and lived there for twelve years. He was a northern service officer and civil administrator of western Baffin Island. In 1962, he moved to New York and became associate director of design with Steuben Glass.\n\nMoving effortlessly and with great success between different activities, perhaps his biggest accomplishment was his work in the Eastern Arctic of Canada, developing Inuit art. In 1948, Houston traveled to a small Inuit community in Arctic Quebec, Inukjuak (then Port Harrison), to draw and paint images of the Inuit and the Arctic landscape. He traded his own drawings, done on the spot, for a small carving, by an Inuit hunter named Nayoumealuk, of a seated deer. Houston recognized its aesthetic appeal and returned to the Canadian Handicrafts Guild, in Montreal, with roughly a dozen small carvings, done mostly in steatite. The guild, which had tried as early as the 1920s to foster an Inuit-handicrafts market, was impressed with the carving; they were equally impressed by Houston. The guild secured a federal government grant of $1,100 and sent Houston back north in the summer of 1949 to make bulk purchases in various communities in the Eastern Arctic.\n\nWhen Houston returned to Montreal that fall, the guild mounted their first exhibition of Inuit carvings. According to collector Ian Lindsay, the first exhibition was a complete sell-out. The government put more resources into developing an art and handicrafts market in the Arctic, hiring Houston to live in Cape Dorset as the first \"roving crafts officer\", and tapping him to write promotional material for sales in the south. The guild's fall sales exhibitions became annual affairs, with lineups routinely stretching out the door and down the block on Peel Street. By the late 1950s, the Government had sponsored tours of Inuit art through Eastern and Western Europe, South America and the Middle East. After successfully launching Inuit sculpture, Houston introduced printmaking in 1957, which met with the same success.\n\nHouston lived in Cape Dorset with his wife Alma Houston and his two sons, Samuel and John Houston until 1962, when the couple split and he moved to New York City. He was writer and producer of the 1974 film based on his novel, \"The White Dawn\". In 1976, his 70-foot high acrylic and aluminum sculpture \"Aurora Borealis\" was installed in Calgary's new Glenbow Museum, where it is still on display. He died in New London, Connecticut, aged 83.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58950712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58950712", "title": "John Phokas", "text": "John Phokas\n\nJohn Phokas (or Phocas) was a 12th-century Byzantine pilgrim to the Holy Land. He wrote an account of his travels, the so-called \"Ekphrasis\" (or \"Concise Description\") \"of the Holy Places\", \"the most elegant of Palestinian pilgrimage accounts\". Doubt has recently arisen over whether Phokas was in fact the author of the \"Ekphrasis\", which has been re-attributed instead to John Doukas Kamateros.\n\nLittle biographical information about Phokas is available. One manuscript of the \"Ekphrasis\" contains a note stating that he was a priest and that his father, a certain Matthew, became a monk on Patmos. According to this marginal note, his trip to the Holy Land took place in either 1177 or 1195. He is known to have accompanied Emperor Manuel I (reigned 1143–80) on an expedition to the sea off Attaleia (now Antalya). He may be the same person as the Focas who, according to the \"Annales Herbipolenses\", was sent by Manuel in 1147 to guide the crusading army of King Conrad III of Germany from Nicaea to Iconium.\n\nPhokas's \"Ekphrasis\" is both concise and precise. He had a rather positive attitude towards the Crusaders. In some cases he provides unique information. He describes a fanatical Saracen sect called the \"Chasisioi\" (perhaps the Assassins). He calls the river Jordan \"the holiest among rivers\" and names three monasteries in the vicinity of site of the baptism of Jesus dedicated to Our Lady of Kalamon, John Chrysostom and John the Baptist. The latter was rebuilt, he says, by Manuel I. He also reports that Cana was nothing more than a \"kastellion\" (a small fortified settlement), that there were two monasteries (one Greek, one Latin) atop Mount Tabor, and that the site of ancient Jericho was covered in gardens and vineyards.\n\nBesides the Bible, Phokas also quotes from such ancient authors as Josephus Flavius and Achilles Tatius. The \"Ekphrasis\" may have been written against the pilgrimage account of Constantine Manasses, who returned from the Holy Land disillusioned and wondering why Christ lived there. In the \"Ekphrasis\", the beauty of the places is stressed repeatedly.\n"}
{"id": "653035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=653035", "title": "Kalambo Falls", "text": "Kalambo Falls\n\nThe Kalambo Falls on the Kalambo River is a single-drop waterfall on the border of Zambia and Tanzania at the southeast end of Lake Tanganyika. The falls are some of the tallest uninterrupted falls in Africa (after South Africa's Tugela Falls, Ethiopia's Jin Bahir Falls and others). Downstream of the falls is the Kalambo Gorge, which has a width of about 1 km and a depth of up to 300 m, running for about 5 km before opening out into the Lake Tanganyika rift valley.\n\nThe falls were first seen by non-Africans in approximately 1913. The expedition which mapped the falls and the area around it was in 1928 and lead by Enid Gordon-Gallien. Initially it was assumed that the height of falls exceeded 300 m, but measurements in the 1920s gave a more modest result, above 200 m. Later measurements, in 1956, gave a result of 221 m. After this several more measurements have been made, each with slightly different results. The width of the falls is 3.6–18 m.\n\nKalambo Falls is also considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Africa, with occupation spanning over 250,000 years.\n\nArchaeologically, Kalambo Falls is one of the most important sites in Africa. It has produced a sequence of past human activity stretching over more than two hundred and fifty thousand years, with evidence of continuous habitation since the Late Early Stone Age until modern times. It was first excavated in 1953 by John Desmond (J.D.) Clark who recognized archaeological activity around a small basin lake upstream of the falls. Excavations in 1953, 1956, 1959, and 1963 allowed Clark to make conclusions about the multiple different cultures inhabiting the area over thousands of years of time.\n\nJ.D. Clark's work incorporated both questions of the cultures who lived at the Kalambo Falls site as well as what their environment was like during times of occupation. Using plant (floral) and pollen analyses, Clark was able to conduct the process of paleoenvironmental reconstruction. By studying pollen that settled on the earth during different environmental settings, Clark was able to form a general idea of what ecological factors affected the Kalambo Falls region at different times. In order to do this, Clark used a tool for drawing out sediment cores in order to observe and analyse the different layers below the surface of the earth today. He separated these layers into 6 different spectra, labeled zones U through Z. The law of superposition is important to note when discussing sedimentary layers; this law states that more recent layers of soil dispersal will overlie older ones.\n\nZone U The bottom of Clark's core sample is the oldest layer. Pollen samples collected indicate that swamp vegetation and an abundance of grass grew on the Kalambo River. The tests also indicated that the surrounding woodland grew during dry and hot climates. Clark concludes that the ground-water levels must have been high in order for a swamp and fringing, or riparian forest, to grow along the waters edge during a period of reduced rainfall.\n\nZone V Pollen collected from the next zone indicate an identical environment with the swamp and woodland vegetation that was not affected by climate conditions, such as the drop of 3° Celsius (C) in the area.\n\nZone W Pollen of plants that grow in more open areas with more rainfall were taken from Zone W. This indicates an increase in rainfall to about 75–100 cm and a woodland with an open canopy to allow that rainfall to reach the ground below.\n\nZone X Clark indicates that the study of this zone was only on one sample drawn from the soil below, so the conclusions are not finite in his study. Plants indicated show a fringing forest that was poorly developed with a very open woodland. Within these woodland conditions, there seems to be an influence of evergreen elements that emerged.\n\nZone Y Clark was able to date this zone to approximately 27,000 to 30,000 years ago, because conditions were comparable to those dated in European soils from this time. Evidence of an increase in rainfall and a temperature drop of 4.1 °C with a fringing forest that was well developed with the return of swamp plants is indicated in the pollen collected.\n\nZone Z The final zone indicates a much poorer fringing forest and a reduced shift of vegetation growth at the time.\n\nThe Early Stone Age is described by Barham and Mitchell as the time period where the ancient ancestors of \"Homo sapiens sapiens\" first emerged, branching from the \"Australopithecus afarensis\", evolving into \"Homo habilis\" and then \"Homo erectus\" 2.6 million years ago to 280,000 years ago\".\" Archaeologists hypothesize that the technological progression over time can be examined in the morphological characteristics of tools that are associated with different eras of habitation. The earliest identified stone tools, made by \"Homo habilis\" are known as Oldowan tools, and they consist of the basic large pounding stones and small pebble flakes, known as Mode 1 technology. As time progressed and \"Homo habilis\" evolved into \"Homo erectus,\" so did the technology as more specialized stone tools were being developed, even tools that were used for making other tools, Mode 2 and 3 technologies.\n\nThese Late Acheulean stone tools, along with hearths and well-preserved organic objects were found at Kalambo Falls and documented by JD Clark. These organic artifacts collected included a wooden club and digging sticks as well as the dietary evidence for fruit consumption. Tools excavated from Kalambo Gorge have been analyzed and OSL dating of quartzite within the soil context to between 500,000 and 50,000 years ago, with amino acid racemization dating the oldest artifacts to 100,000 years ago.\n\nThe Middle Stone age, dated at 280,000 years ago to roughly 40,000 years ago, is the period where the final stages of hominid evolution brought what is known today as \"modern human behavior\".\n\nDuring this time, the Acheulean industry of Kalambo Falls was superseded by the Sangoan culture. This shift is considered by Clark as a result of an ecological shift to a cooler and wetter climate. It is at this time in the archaeological record that the large, Acheulean handaxe disappears and is replaced by the core axe and chopping tools characteristic of Sangoan technologies. Heavy woodworking tools and small, notched and denticulated tools, collected by Clark, were dated to have been made before 41,000 BC. This rapid change is predicted to be a result of population movement during this time period, as the \"Acheulean man\" who lived in open settlements were replaced by a culture associated with \"Homo rhodesiensis\" found at Broken Hill, the Sangoan culture. Evidence of Sangoan habitation has been collected from less open Rock Shelters and Cave areas, possibly due to the persisting, wetter climate.\n\nEvidence of fire technologies, such as hearths, charred logs, reddened clay, and stone heat spalls were also collected and found in association with charcoal remains. Radiocarbon dates of the scattered charcoal indicate people were using fire systematically there some 60,000 years ago.\n\nThe cool, wet climates of the region were similar to that of the Congo, and similar cultural practices have been identified at Kalambo Falls, known as Lupemban industries. Evidence suggests that the Sangoan tradition was replaced by the Lupemban industry around 250,000 years ago and continued through to 117,000 years ago. It is characterized by two-sided, or bifacial, stone tools like core axes and double-ended points that were possibly for hafting as spearheads. Geological studies by J.D. Clark indicate that the frequency of these tools is possibly due to factors that exemplified the amount of large pieces of breakable, or knappable, raw materials.\n\nThe Later Stone Age is the final age of the Paleolithic Era of Africa, and generally refers to more recent hunter/gatherer sites. Around 10,000 years ago Kalambo Falls was occupied by the Magosian culture which in turn gave way to Wilton activity.\n\nAround the fourth century AD, a more industrialized Bantu-speaking people began to farm and occupy the area. These Bantu-speaking people made ceramic vessels that have characteristics of East African pottery, which suggests a population movement from the Rift Valley. Burials from this period are characterized by Clark as shaft grave burials, which are similar to those of the earlier cultures of the East African Rift as opposed to the Kalambo region.\n\nThe Iron Age in Zambia is split into an earlier, regionally categorized period and a later period of materialistically differing traditions. Early assemblages of iron tools and pottery have been collected from the Kalambo Falls and are categorized as being from the Kalambo Group tradition. At Kalambo falls, Early Iron Age traditions are believed to have continued into the 11th century.\n\nIn 1971, Robert C. Soper studied different assemblages of Iron Age pottery in eastern and southern Africa and consolidated them into two major groups, known as Urewe and Kwale wares. He indicated that Kalambo and Mwabulambo pot traditions may also be included in these. David W. Phillipson used these conclusions to form a north to south chronology of artifacts and comprised many of the groups studied by Soper into one, Mwitu tradition. This tradition is exhibited by pots that range from the first millennium AD.\n\nThe Kalambo group was replaced by the Luangwa tradition, whose pottery is similar to the Early Iron Age Chondwe Group of the Central African Copperbelt. Luangwa Pottery is characteristic of necked pots and shallow bowls, with the most common comb-stamped decoration pressed in a horizontal pattern of delineated lines. There has yet to be found any evidence for an interface between this Luangwa tradition and the Early Iron Age tradition at Kalambo Falls, whereas sites at the Eastern Province of Zambia exhibit this interrelationship. Exact dates for this transition in the Kalambo area are inconclusive, but the tradition has continued through to the present.\n\nAttempts to date artifacts from Kalambo Falls have resulted in inconsistent results, ranging from 110,000 years ago with racemization to 182,000 ±10,000 to 76,000 ±10,000 years ago with applied uranium series dating. These studies underscore the difficulty in establishing a chronology for human habitation at the falls, which has led some archaeologists to disregard its significance in the African archaeological record.\n\nHowever, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) on quartz artifacts has recently improved understanding of the site's chronology. OSL works by sending signals through a crystalline material and collects data on how long ago the stone was exposed to light or heat.\n\nOSL results have led to the creation of a new chronology for the site, broken into six stages. Stage 1 ranges between approximately 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. Stage 2 ranges from 300,000 to 50,000 years ago. Stage 3 dates range from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago. Stage 4 deposits date to 1,500 to 500 years ago and Stage 5 follows after 490 years ago.\n\nAcheulean stone tools (Mode 2 and 3 technologies) were collected from stratigraphic layers corresponding to the first and second stages. More complex Mode 3 tools came from the first three stages and are also found in Stage 4, whose corresponding layers contain a mix of Stone and Iron Age artifacts.\n\nIn 1964, the archaeological site was gazetted as a national monument by Zambia's National Heritage Conservation Commission. It has since been protected under Zambia's 1989 National Heritage Conservation Act.\n\nIn 2009, Kalambo Falls was included on UNESCO list of tentative World Heritage Sites. Justifications for the inclusion are that the Kalambo Falls are the 2nd highest waterfalls in Africa, the evidence of one of the longest examples of human occupation in sub-Saharan Africa, and the collected stone tools are from one of the world's earliest tool industries, the Acheulean.\n\nAs of today, Kalambo Falls remains on the tentative list for recognition as a protected World Heritage site.\n\nToday, both human and animal populations traverse the Kalambo Falls area, which has a basin above the falls that attracts many of both populations as an important stopping place. On the Zambian border, the area is now a game preserve for the protection of many animals. The falls' cliff-face ledges provide nesting places and breeding sites for a marabou stork colony.\n\n"}
{"id": "18245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18245", "title": "Labyrinth", "text": "Labyrinth\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Labyrinth ( \"labúrinthos\") was an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos. Its function was to hold the Minotaur, the monster eventually killed by the hero Theseus. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.\n\nAlthough early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns, the single-path (unicursal) seven-course \"Classical\" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC, and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth – even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze. Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from Roman times until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal. Branching mazes were reintroduced only when hedge mazes became popular during the Renaissance.\n\nIn English, the term \"labyrinth\" is generally synonymous with \"maze\". As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two. In this specialized usage \"maze\" refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal \"labyrinth\" has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.\n\nUnicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on pottery or basketry, as body art, and in etchings on walls of caves or churches. The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic. Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private meditation, and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.\n\n\"Labyrinth\" is a word of pre-Greek origin, which the Greeks associated with the palace of Knossos in Crete, excavated by Arthur Evans early in the 20th century. The word appears in a Linear B inscription as da-pu-ri-to. As early as 1892 Maximilian Mayer suggested that \"labyrinthos\" might derive from \"labrys\", a Lydian word for \"double-bladed axe\". Evans suggested that the palace at Knossos was the original labyrinth, and since the double axe motif appears in the palace ruins,\nhe asserted that \"labyrinth\" could be understood to mean \"the house of the double axe\". This designation may not have been limited to Knossos, since the same symbols were discovered in other palaces in Crete. However Nlsson observes that in Crete the \"double axe\" is not a weapon and always accompanies goddesses or women and not a male god. \nBeekes finds the relation with \"labrys\" speculative, and suggests instead the relation with \"lavra\" (λαύρα), narrow street. The original Minoan word appears to refer to labyrinthine underground grottoes, such as seen at Gortyn. Pliny the Elder's four examples of labyrinths are all complex underground structures, and this appears to have been the standard Classical understanding of the word. It is also possible that the word labyrinth is derived from the Egyptian \"loperohunt\", meaning palace or temple by the lake. The Egyptian labyrinth near Lake Morris is described by Herodotus and Strabo. By the 4th century BC, Greek vase painters also represented the Labyrinth by the familiar \"Greek key\" patterns of endlessly running meanders.\n\nWhen the Bronze Age site at Knossos was excavated by explorer Arthur Evans, the complexity of the architecture prompted him to suggest that the palace had been the Labyrinth of Daedalus. Evans found various bull motifs, including an image of a man leaping over the horns of a bull, as well as depictions of a labrys carved into the walls. On the strength of a passage in the \"Iliad\", it has been suggested that the palace was the site of a dancing-ground made for Ariadne by the craftsman Daedalus,\nwhere young men and women, of the age of those sent to Crete as prey for the Minotaur, would dance together. By extension, in popular legend the palace is associated with the myth of the Minotaur.\n\nIn the 2000s, archaeologists explored other potential sites of the labyrinth. Oxford University geographer Nicholas Howarth believes that 'Evans's hypothesis that the palace of Knossos is also the Labyrinth must be treated sceptically.' Howarth and his team conducted a search of an underground complex known as the Skotino cave but concluded that it was formed naturally. Another contender is a series of underground tunnels at Gortyn, accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns. Unlike the Skotino cave, these caverns have smooth walls and columns, and appear to have been at least partially man-made. This site corresponds to an unusual labyrinth symbol on a 16th-century map of Crete contained in a book of maps in the library of Christ Church, Oxford. A map of the caves themselves was produced by the French in 1821. The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the Second World War. Howarth's investigation was shown on a documentary produced for the National Geographic Channel.\n\nMore generally, \"labyrinth\" might be applied to any extremely complicated maze-like structure. Herodotus, in Book II of his \"Histories\", describes as a \"labyrinth\" a building complex in Egypt, \"near the place called the City of Crocodiles,\" that he considered to surpass the pyramids:\nDuring the 19th century, the remains of this structure were discovered by Flinders Petrie at the foot of the pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara in the Faiyum Oasis. The Classical accounts of various authors (Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, among others) are not entirely consistent, perhaps due to degradation of the structure during Classical times. In origin, the structure was likely a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids.\n\nIn 1898, the \"Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities\" described the structure as \"the largest of all the temples of Egypt, the so-called Labyrinth, of which, however, only the foundation stones have been preserved.\"\n\nHerodotus' description of the Egyptian Labyrinth inspired some central scenes in Bolesław Prus' 1895 historical novel, \"Pharaoh\".\n\nPliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" (36.90) lists the legendary Smilis, reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus, together with the historical mid-sixth-century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth, which Andrew Stewart regards as \"evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple's location \"en limnais\" ['in the marsh'].\"\n\nAccording to Pliny, the tomb of the great Etruscan general Lars Porsena contained an underground maze. Pliny's description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable; Pliny, it seems clear, had not observed this structure himself, but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian Varro.\n\nA design essentially identical to the 7-course \"classical\" pattern appeared in Native American culture, the Tohono O'odham people labyrinth which features I'itoi, the \"Man in the Maze.\" The Tonoho O'odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical: it is radial in design, and the entrance is at the top, where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom (see below). The earliest appearances cannot be dated securely; the oldest is commonly dated to the 17th century.\n\nA prehistoric petroglyph on a riverbank in Goa shows the same pattern and has been dated to circa 2500 BC. Other examples have been found among cave art in northern India and on a dolmen shrine in the Nilgiri Mountains, but are difficult to date accurately. Early labyrinths in India typically follow the Classical pattern or a local variant of it; some have been described as plans of forts or cities.\n\nLabyrinths appear in Indian manuscripts and Tantric texts from the 17th century onward. They are often called \"Chakravyuha\" in reference to an impregnable battle formation described in the ancient Mahabharata epic. Lanka, the capital city of mythic Rāvana, is described as a labyrinth in the 1910 translation of Al-Beruni's \"India\" (c. 1030 AD) p. 306 (with a diagram on the following page).\n\nBy the White Sea, notably on the Solovetsky Islands, there have been preserved more than 30 stone labyrinths. The most remarkable monument is the Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island - a group of 13–14 stone labyrinths on 0.4 km area of one small island. These labyrinths are thought to be 2,000–3,000 years old.\n\nIn antiquity, the less complicated labyrinth pattern familiar from medieval examples was already developed. In Roman floor mosaics, the simple classical labyrinth is framed in the meander border pattern, squared off as the medium requires, but still recognisable. Often an image of the Minotaur appears in the center of these mosaic labyrinths. Roman meander patterns gradually developed in complexity towards the fourfold shape that is now familiarly known as the medieval form. The labyrinth retains its connection with death and a triumphant return: at Hadrumentum in North Africa (now Sousse), a Roman family tomb has a fourfold labyrinth mosaic floor with a dying minotaur in the center and a mosaic inscription: \"Enclosed here, he loses life\" (Kern 169; Kerényi fig.31).\n\nWhen the early humanist Benzo d'Alessandria visited Verona before 1310, he noted the \"\"Laberinthum\" which is now called the Arena\"; perhaps he was seeing the \"cubiculi\" beneath the arena's missing floor.\nThe full flowering of the medieval labyrinth came about from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic cathedrals, notably Chartres, Reims and Amiens in northern France. These labyrinths may have originated as symbolic allusion to the Holy City; and some modern thinkers have theorized that prayers and devotions may have accompanied the perambulation of their intricate paths. Although some books (in particular guidebooks) suggest that the mazes on cathedral floors served as substitutes for pilgrimage paths, the earliest attested use of the phrase \"chemin de Jerusalem\" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at Reims and Saint-Omer. The accompanying ritual, supposedly involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century. However, no contemporary evidence supports the idea that labyrinths had such a purpose for early Christians. The cathedral labyrinths are thought to be the inspiration for the many turf mazes in the UK, such as survive at Wing, Hilton, Alkborough, and Saffron Walden.\n\nOver the same general period, some 500 or more non-ecclesiastical labyrinths were constructed in Scandinavia. These labyrinths, generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as \"Troy Town.\" They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities: trapping malevolent trolls or winds in the labyrinth's coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition. There are also stone labyrinths on the Isles of Scilly, although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century.\n\nThere are examples of labyrinths in many disparate cultures. The symbol has appeared in various forms and media (petroglyphs, classic-form, medieval-form, pavement, turf, and basketry) at some time throughout most parts of the world, from Native North and South America to Australia, Java, India, and Nepal.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building, of both unicursal and multicursal patterns. In modern imagery, the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze, in which one may become lost.\n\nThe Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was entranced with the idea of the labyrinth, and used it extensively in his short stories (such as \"The House of Asterion\" in \"The Aleph\"). His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", Mark Z. Danielewski's \"House of Leaves\"). Additionally, Roger Zelazny's fantasy series, \"The Chronicles of Amber\", features a labyrinth, called \"the Pattern,\" which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. The avant-garde multi-screen film, \"In the Labyrinth\", presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. In Rick Riordan's series Percy Jackson & the Olympians, the events of the fourth novel \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\" predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed the heart of the West to settle beneath the United States. Australian author Sara Douglass incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series The Troy Game, in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. Lawrence Durrell's \"The Dark Labyrinth\" depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. A magical labyrinth, based on the original myth, appears in the third episode of \"The Librarians\" (\"And The Horns of a Dilemma\").\n\nThe labyrinth is also treated in contemporary fine arts. Examples include Piet Mondrian's \"Dam and Ocean\" (1915), Joan Miró's \"Labyrinth\" (1923), Pablo Picasso's \"Minotauromachia\" (1935), M. C. Escher's \"Relativity\" (1953), Friedensreich Hundertwasser's \"Labyrinth\" (1957), Jean Dubuffet's \"Logological Cabinet\" (1970), Richard Long's \"Connemara sculpture\" (1971), Joe Tilson's \"Earth Maze\" (1975), Richard Fleischner's \"Chain Link Maze\" (1978), István Orosz's \"Atlantis Anamorphosis\" (2000), Dmitry Rakov's \"Labyrinth\" (2003), and drawings by contemporary American artist Mo Morales employing what the artist calls \"Labyrinthine projection.\" The Italian painter Davide Tonato has dedicated many of his artistic works to the labyrinth theme.\n\nMark Wallinger has created a set of 270 enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every tube station in the London Underground, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Underground. The plaques were installed over a 16-month period in 2013 and 2014, and each is numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 Guinness World Record Tube Challenge.\n\nLabyrinths and mazes have been embraced by the video game industry, and countless video games include such a feature.\n\nPrehistoric labyrinths may have served as traps for malevolent spirits or as paths for ritual dances. Many Roman and Christian labyrinths appear at the entrances of buildings, suggesting that they may have served a similar apotropaic purpose. In their cross-cultural study of signs and symbols, \"Patterns that Connect\", Carl Schuster and Edmund Carpenter present various forms of the labyrinth and suggest various possible meanings, including not only a sacred path to the home of a sacred ancestor, but also, perhaps, a representation of the ancestor him/herself: .\"..many [New World] Indians who make the labyrinth regard it as a sacred symbol, a beneficial ancestor, a deity. In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints.\" Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster; in India, the demon Ravana has dominion over labyrinths, the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran Bataks, and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue.\n\nOne can think of labyrinths as symbolic of pilgrimage; people can walk the path, ascending toward salvation or enlightenment. Author Ben Radford conducted an investigation into some of the claims of spiritual and healing effects of labyrinths, reporting on his findings in his book Mysterious New Mexico.\n\nMany labyrinths have been constructed recently in churches, hospitals, and parks. These are often used for contemplation; walking among the turnings, one loses track of direction and of the outside world, and thus quiets the mind. The Labyrinth Society provides a locator for modern labyrinths all over the world.\n\nIn addition, the labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, as an image that suggests getting lost in a subterranean dungeon-like world. Octavio Paz titled his book on Mexican identity \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\", describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.\n\nLabyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words \"Sancta Eclesia\" at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.\n\nIn medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 C.E.. The most famous medieval labyrinth, with great influence on later practice, was created in Chartres Cathedral. The purpose of the labyrinths is not clear, though there are surviving descriptions of French clerics performing a ritual Easter dance along the path on Easter Sunday. Some books (guidebooks in particular) suggest that mazes on cathedral floors originated in the medieval period as alternatives to pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the earliest attested use of the phrase \"chemin de Jerusalem\" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at Reims and Saint-Omer. The accompanying ritual, depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century.\n\nThe use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically unicursal, labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles). For example, a labyrinth was set up on the floor of St Paul's Cathedral for a week in March 2000. Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or \"new age\" fads.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5533009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5533009", "title": "Landscape connectivity", "text": "Landscape connectivity\n\nLandscape connectivity in ecology is, broadly, \"the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches\". Alternatively, connectivity may be a continuous property of the landscape and independent of patches and paths. Connectivity includes both structural connectivity (the physical arrangements of disturbance and/or patches) and functional connectivity (the movement of individuals across contours of disturbance and/or among patches). The degree to which a landscape is connected determines the amount of dispersal there is among patches, which influences gene flow, local adaptation, extinction risk, colonization probability, and the potential for organisms to move as they cope with climate change.\n\nThe concept of “Landscape connectivity” was first introduced by Dr. Gray Merriam in 1984. Merriam noted that movement among habitat patches was not merely a function of an organism’s attributes, but also, a quality of the landscape elements through which it must move. To emphasize this fundamental interaction in determining a particular movement pathway, Merriam (1984), defined landscape connectivity as “the degree to which absolute isolation is prevented by landscape elements which allow organisms to move among habitat patches.” Nine years later, Merriam and colleagues, revised the definition to “the degree to which the landscape impedes or facilitates movement among resource patches. Although this definition has undoubtedly become the most accepted and cited meaning within the scientific literature, many authors have continued to create their own definitions. With et al (1997), presented their interpretation as “the functional relationship among habitat patches, owing to the spatial contagion of habitat and the movement responses of organisms to landscape structure.”, and Ament et al. (2014) defined it as “the degree to which regional landscapes, encompassing a variety of natural, semi-natural, and developed land cover types, are conducive to wildlife movement and to sustain ecological processes.” Thus, although there have been many definitions of landscape connectivity over the past 30 years, each new description emphasizes both a structural and a behavioural element to the landscape connectivity concept. The physical component is defined by the spatial and temporal configuration of the landscape elements (landform, landcover and land use types), and the behavioural component is defined by the behavioural responses, of organisms and/or processes, to the physical arrangement of the landscape elements.\n\nHabitat loss and habitat fragmentation have become ubiquitous in both natural and human modified landscapes, resulting in detrimental consequences for local species interactions and global biodiversity. Human development now modifies over 50% of the earth’s landscape, leaving only patches of isolated natural or semi-natural habitats for the millions of other species we share this planet with. Patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem functions are changing worldwide resulting in a loss of connectivity and ecological integrity for the entire global ecological network. Loss of connectivity can influence individuals, populations and communities through within species, between species, and between ecosystem interactions. These interactions affect ecological mechanisms such as nutrient and energy flows, predator-prey relationships, pollination, seed dispersal, demographic rescue, inbreeding avoidance, colonization of unoccupied habitat, altered species interactions, and spread of disease, . Accordingly, landscape connectivity facilitates the movement of biotic processes such as animal movement, plant propagation, and genetic exchange, as well as abiotic processes such as water, energy, and material movement within and between ecosystems.\n\nWithin their home range or territory most animals must move daily among multiple primary habitat patches to forage for food and obtain all the resources they need.\n\nSome species travel to different locations throughout the year to access the resources they need. These movements are usually predictable and are due to changes in the environmental conditions at the primary habitat site, or to facilitate access to breeding grounds. Migratory behaviour is seen in land animals, birds and marine species, and the routes they follow are usually the same year after year.\n\nIs the once in a lifetime movement of certain individuals from one population to another for the purpose of breeding. These exchanges maintain genetic and demographic diversity among populations.\n\nIs the unpredictable movement of individuals or populations to new locations of suitable habitat due to an environmental disturbance. Major disturbances such as fire, natural disasters, human development, and climate change can impact the quality and distribution of habitats and necessitate the movement of species to new locations of suitable habitat.\n\nMovement of species in areas that are typically used by humans. These include greenbelts, recreational trail systems, hedgerows, and golf courses.\n\nPreserving or creating landscape connectivity has become increasingly recognized as a key strategy to protect biodiversity, maintain viable ecosystems and wildlife populations, and facilitate the movement and adaptation of wildlife populations in the face of climate change. The degree to which landscapes are connected determines the overall amount of movement taking place within and between local populations. This connectivity has influences on gene flow, local adaptation, extinction risk, colonization probability, and the potential for organisms to move and adapt to climate change. With habitat loss and fragmentation increasingly deteriorating natural habitats, the sizes and isolation of the remaining habitat fragments are particularly critical to the long-term conservation of biodiversity. Thus, connectivity among these remaining fragments, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding matrix, and the permeability and structure of the habitat edges are all important for biodiversity conservation and affect the overall persistence, strength and integrity of the remaining ecological interactions.\n\nSince the definition of landscape connectivity has both a physical and a behavioural component, quantifying landscape connectivity is consequently organism-, process- and landscape-specific. According to (Wiens & Milne, 1989), the first step in the quantification process of landscape connectivity is defining the specific habitat or habitat network of the focal species, and in turn, describe the landscape elements from its point of view. The next step is to determine the scale of the landscape structure as perceived by the organism. This is defined as the scale at which the species responds to the array of landscape elements, through its fine-scale (grain), and large-scale (extent), movement behaviours. Lastly, how the species responds to the different elements of a landscape is determined. This comprises the species’ movement pattern based on behavioural reactions to the mortality risk of the landscape elements, including habitat barriers and edges.\n\nAlthough connectivity is an intuitive concept, there is no single consistently-used metric of connectivity. Theories of connectivity include consideration of both binary representations of connectivity through \"corridors\" and \"linkages\" and continuous representations of connectivity, which include the binary condition as a sub-set \n\nGenerally, connectivity metrics fall into three categories:\n\n\nTypically, the \"natural\" form of connectivity as an ecological property perceived by organisms is modeled as a continuous surface of permeability, which is the corollary to disturbance. This can be accomplished by most geographic information systems (GIS) able to model in grid/raster format. A critical component of this form of modeling is the recognition that connectivity and disturbance are perceived and responded to differently by different organisms and ecological processes. This variety in responses is one of the most challenging parts of attempting to represent connectivity in spatial modeling. Typically, the most accurate connectivity models are for single species/processes and are developed based on information about the species/process. There is little, and often no evidence that spatial models, including those described here, can represent connectivity for the many species or processes that occupy many natural landscapes. The disturbance-based models are used as the basis for the binary representations of connectivity as paths/corridor/linkages through landscapes described below.\n\nCircuitscape is an open source program that uses circuit theory to predict connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes for individual movement, gene flow, and conservation planning. Circuit theory offers several advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with low resistances assigned to habitats that are most permeable to movement or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to poor dispersal habitat or to movement barriers. Effective resistances, current densities, and voltages calculated across the landscapes can then be related to ecological processes, such as individual movement and gene flow.\n\nGraphab is a software application devoted to the modelling of landscape networks. It is composed of four main modules: graph building, including loading the initial landscape data and identification of the patches and the links; computation of the connectivity metrics from the graph; connection between the graph and exogenous point data set; visual and cartographical interface.\nGraphab runs on any computer supporting Java 1.6 or later (PC under Linux, Windows, Mac...). It is distributed free of charge for non-commercial use.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2298321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298321", "title": "Leaf area index", "text": "Leaf area index\n\nLeaf area index (LAI) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area (\"LAI = leaf area / ground area, m / m\") in broadleaf canopies. In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used:\n\nLAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to over 10 (dense conifer forests).\n\nLAI is used to predict photosynthetic primary production, evapotranspiration and as a reference tool for crop growth. As such, LAI plays an essential role in theoretical production ecology. An inverse exponential relation between LAI and light interception, which is linearly proportional to the primary production rate, has been established:\n\nwhere \"P\" designates the maximum primary production and formula_2 designates a crop-specific growth coefficient. This inverse exponential function is called the primary production function.\n\nLAI can be determined directly by taking a statistically significant sample of foliage from a plant canopy, measuring the leaf area per sample plot and dividing it by the plot land surface area. Indirect methods measure canopy geometry or light extinction and relate it to LAI.\n\nDirect methods can be easily applied on deciduous species by collecting leaves during leaf fall in traps of certain area distributed below the canopy. The area of the collected leaves can be measured using a leaf area meter or an image scanner and image analysis software (ImageJ) and mobile applications (Petiole, Easy Leaf Area). The measured leaf area can then be divided by the area of the traps to obtain LAI. Alternatively, leaf area can be measured on a sub-sample of the collected leaves and linked to the leaf dry mass (e.g. via Specific Leaf Area, SLA cm/g). That way it is not necessary to measure the area of all leaves one by one, but weigh the collected leaves after drying (at 60–80 °C for 48 h). Leaf dry mass multiplied by the specific leaf area is converted into leaf area.\nDirect methods in evergreen species are necessarily destructive. However, they are widely used in crops and pastures by harvesting the vegetation and measuring leaf area within a certain ground surface area. It is very difficult (and also unethical) to apply such destructive techniques in natural ecosystems, particularly in forests of evergreen tree species. Foresters have developed techniques that determine leaf area in evergreen forests through allometric relationships.\nDue to the difficulties and the limitations of the direct methods for estimating LAI, they are mostly used as reference for indirect methods that are easier and faster to apply.\n\nIndirect methods of estimating LAI \"in situ\" can be divided in two categories:\n\n\nDue to the subjectivity and labor involved with the first method, indirect non-contact measurements are typically preferred. Non-contact LAI tools, such as hemispherical photography, Hemiview Plant Canopy Analyser from Delta-T Devices, the CI-110 Plant Canopy Analyzer from CID Bio-Science, LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer from LI-COR Biosciences and the LP-80 LAI ceptometer from Decagon Devices, measure LAI in a non-destructive way. Hemispherical photography methods estimate LAI and other canopy structure attributes from analyzing upward-looking fisheye photographs taken beneath the plant canopy. The LAI-2200 calculates LAI and other canopy structure attributes from solar radiation measurements made with a wide-angle optical sensor. Measurements made above and below the canopy are used to determine canopy light interception at five angles, from which LAI is computed using a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies. The LP-80 calculates LAI by means of measuring the difference between light levels above the canopy and at ground level, and factoring in the leaf angle distribution, solar zenith angle, and plant extinction coefficient. Such indirect methods, where LAI is calculated based upon observations of other variables (canopy geometry, light interception, leaf length and width, etc.) are generally faster, amenable to automation, and thereby allow for a larger number of spatial samples to be obtained. For reasons of convenience when compared to the direct (destructive) methods, these tools are becoming more and more important.\n\nThe disadvantage of the direct method is that it is destructive, time consuming and expensive, especially if the study area is very large.\n\nThe disadvantage of the indirect method is that in some cases it can underestimate the value of LAI in very dense canopies, as it does not account for leaves that lie on each other, and essentially act as one leaf according to the theoretical LAI models. Ignorance of non-randomness within canopies may cause underestimation of LAI up to 25%, introducing path length distribution in the indirect method can improve the measuring accuracy of LAI.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "540156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540156", "title": "Lop Nur", "text": "Lop Nur\n\nLop Nur or Lop Nor (from a Mongolian name meaning \"Lop Lake\") is a former salt lake, now largely dried up, located between the Taklamakan and Kumtag deserts in the southeastern portion of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur town (), also known as Luozhong () of Ruoqiang County, which in its turn is part of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.\n\nThe lake system into which the Tarim River and Shule River empty is the last remnant of the historical post-glacial Tarim Lake, which once covered more than in the Tarim Basin. Lop Nur is hydrologically endorheic— it is landbound and there is no outlet. The lake measured in 1928, but has dried up due to construction of dams which blocked the flow of water feeding into the lake system, and only small seasonal lakes and marshes may form. The dried-up Lop Nur Basin is covered with a salt crust ranging from in thickness.\n\nLop Nur has been used as a nuclear testing site, and since the discovery of potash at the site in the mid-1990s it is also the location of a large-scale mining operation.\n\nThere are some restricted areas under military management and cultural relics protection points in the region, which are not open to the public.\n\nFrom around 1800 BC until the 9th century the lake supported a thriving Tocharian culture. Archaeologists have discovered the buried remains of settlements, as well as several of the Tarim mummies, along its ancient shoreline. Former water resources of the Tarim River and Lop Nur nurtured the kingdom of Loulan since the second century BC, an ancient civilization along the Silk Road, which skirted the lake-filled basin. Loulan became a client-state of the Chinese empire in 55 BC, renamed Shanshan. Marco Polo in his travels passed through the Lop Desert, and the famous explorers Ferdinand von Richthofen, Nikolai Przhevalsky, Sven Hedin and Aurel Stein visited and studied the area. It is also likely that Swedish soldier Johan Gustaf Renat had visited the area when he was helping the Zunghars to produce maps over the area in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe lake was given various names in ancient Chinese texts. In \"Shiji\" it was called Yan Ze (鹽澤, literally Salt Marsh), indicating its saline nature, and near which was located the ancient Loulan Kingdom. In \"Hanshu\" it was called Puchang Hai (蒲昌海, literally Sea of Abundant Reed) and was given a dimension of 300 to 400 \"li\" (roughly 120–160 km) in length and breadth, indicating it was once a lake of great size. These early texts also mentioned the belief, mistaken as it turns out, that the lake joins the Yellow River at Jishi through an underground channel as the source of the river.\nThe lake was referred to as the \"Wandering Lake\" in the early 20th century due to the Tarim River changing its course, causing its terminal lake to alter its location between the Lop Nur dried basin, the Kara-Koshun dried basin and the Taitema Lake basin. This shift of the terminal lake caused some confusion amongst the early explorers as to the exact location of Lop Nur. Imperial maps from the Qing Dynasty showed Lop Nur to be located in similar position to the present Lop Nur dried basin, but the Polish geographer Mikołaj Przewalski instead found the terminal lake at Kara-Koshun in 1867. Sven Hedin visited the area in 1900-1901 and suggested that the Tarim river periodically changed its course to and fro between its southbound and northbound direction, resulting in a shift in the position of the terminal lake. The change in the course of the river, which resulted in Lop Nur drying up, was also suggested by Hedin as the reason why ancient settlements such as Loulan had perished.\n\nIn 1921, due to human intervention, the terminal lake shifted its position back to Lop Nur. The lake measured 2400 km in area in 1930-31. In 1934 Sven Hedin went down the new Kuruk Darya ('Dry River') in a canoe. He found the delta to be a maze of channels and the new lake so shallow that it was difficult to navigate even in a canoe. In 1900 he had walked the dry Kuruk Darya in a caravan.\nIn 1952 the terminal lake then shifted to Taitema Lake when the Tarim River and Konque River were separated through human intervention, and Lop Nur dried out again by 1964. In 1972, the Great West Sea Reservoir (Daxihaizi, 大西海子) was built at Tikanlik, water supply to the lake was cut off, and all the lakes for the most part then dried out, with only small seasonal lakes forming in local depressions in Taitema. The loss of water to the lower Tarim River Valley also led to the deterioration and loss of poplar forests and tamarix shrubs that used to be extensively distributed along the lower Tarim River Valley forming the so-called 'Green Corridor'. In 2000, in an effort to prevent further deterioration of the ecosystem, water was diverted from Lake Bosten in an attempt to fill the Taitema Lake. The Taitema Lake however had shifted westwards during the past 40 years due in part to the spread of the desert. Another cause of the destabilization of the desert has been the cutting of poplars and willows for firewood; in response, a restoration project to reclaim the poplar forests was initiated.\n\nThe Kara-Koshun dried basin may be considered part of the greater Lop Nur.\n\nOn 17 June 1980, Chinese scientist Peng Jiamu disappeared while walking into Lop Nur in search of water. His body was never found, and his disappearance remains a mystery. 3 On June 1996, the Chinese explorer Yu Chunshun died while trying to walk across Lop Nur.\nChina established the Lop Nur Nuclear Test Base on 16 October 1959 with Soviet assistance in selection of the site, with its headquarters at Malan, about northwest of Qinggir. The first Chinese nuclear bomb test, codenamed \"596\", occurred at Lop Nur in 1964. The PRC detonated its first hydrogen bomb on 17 June 1967. Until 1996, 45 nuclear tests were conducted. These nuclear tests were conducted by dropping bombs from aircraft and towers, launching missiles, detonating weapons underground and in the atmosphere.\n\nIn 2009, Jun Takada, a Japanese scientist known for prominently opposing the tests as \"the Devil's conduct\", published the results of his computer simulation which suggests - based on deaths from Soviet tests - that 190,000 people could have died in China from nuclear-related illnesses. Enver Tohti, an exiled pro-Uyghur independence activist, claimed that cancer rates in the province of Xinjiang were 30 to 35% higher than the national average. On 29 July 1996, China conducted its 45th and final nuclear test at Lop Nor, and issued a formal moratorium on nuclear testing the following day, although further subcritical tests were suspected. In 2012, China announced plans to spend $1 million to clean up the Malan (, \"Mǎlán\") nuclear base in Lop Nor to create a red tourism site.\n\nLop Nur is home to the wild Bactrian camel, which is a separate species from the Bactrian camel. The camels have continued to breed naturally despite the nuclear testing. After China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, the camels were classified as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List. Since the cessation of nuclear testing at Lop Nur, human incursions into the area have caused a decline in the camel population. Wild Bactrian camels have been classified as critically endangered since 2002 and approximately half of the 1400 remaining wild Bactrian camels live on the former Lop Nur test base, which has been designated the Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve.\n\nA highway from Hami to Lop Nur (Xinjiang Provincial Hwy 235) was completed in 2006.\n\nThe Hami–Lop Nur Railway, which runs north to Hami, along the same route, opened to freight operations in November 2012. The railway is used to transport potassium-rich salt mined at the lake to the Lanzhou–Xinjiang Railway.\n\nGiven the extreme dryness and resulting thin population, remains of some buildings survived for a significant period of time. When ancient graves, some a few thousand years old, were opened the bodies were often found to be mummified and grave goods well preserved. The earliest sites are associated with an ancient people of Indo-European origin.\n\nLoulan or Kroran was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city already known in the 2nd century BCE[1] on the north-eastern edge of the Lop Desert. It was renamed Shanshan after Chinese took control of the kingdom in 1st century BCE. It was abandoned some time in the seventh century. Its location was discovered by Sven Hedin in 1899, who excavated some houses and found a wooden Kharosthi tablet and many Chinese manuscripts from the Western Jin Dynasty (265–420). Aurel Stein also excavated at the site in the beginning of the 20th century, while Chinese archaeologists explored the area in the latter part of the 20th century. A mummy called the \"Beauty of Loulan\" was found at a cemetery site on the bank of Töwän River.\n\nThe Xiaohe Tomb complex is located to the west of Lop Nur. This bronze-age burial site is an oblong sand dune, from which more than thirty well preserved mummies have been excavated. The entire Xiaohe Tomb complex contains about 330 tombs, about 160 of which have been violated by grave robbers. \nA local hunter guided the Swedish explorer and archeologist Folke Bergman to the site in 1934. An excavation project by the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute began in October 2003. A total of 167 tombs have been dug up since the end of 2002 and excavations have revealed hundreds of smaller tombs built in layers, as well as other precious artifacts. In 2006, a valuable archeological finding was uncovered: a boat-shaped coffin wrapped in ox hide, containing the mummified body of a young woman.\n\nIn 1979, some of the earliest of the Tarim mummies were discovered in burial sites at Qäwrighul (Gumugou), which is located to the west of Lop Nur, on the Könchi (Kongque) river. Forty-two graves, most of which dated from 2100-1500 BC, were found. There were two types of tomb at the site, belonging to two different time periods. The first type of burial featured shaft pit graves, some of which had poles at either end to mark east and west. Bodies were found extended, usually facing east, and sometimes were wrapped in wool weavings and wearing felt hats. Artifacts found included basketry, wheat grains, cattle and sheep/goat horns, bird bone necklaces and bracelets, nephrite beads, and fragments of copper (or bronze), although no pottery was discovered.\n\nThe second type of burial, from a later period, also consisted of shaft pit graves, surrounded by seven concentric circles of poles. Six male graves were found, in which the bodies were extended on their backs, and facing towards the east. Few artifacts were found, except for some traces of copper, or bronze.\n\nMiran is located to the south-west of Lop Nur. Buddhist monasteries were excavated here, and murals and sculptures showed artistic influences form India and Central Asia, with some showing influences from as far as Rome.\n\n\n"}

Robinson and others had begun to see the map as primarily a communication tool, and so developed a specific model for map communication, the map communication model (MCM)\". This model, according to Andrews (1988) \"can be grouped with the other major communication models of the time, such as the Shannon-Weaver and Lasswell models of communication. The map communication model led to a whole new body of research, methodologies and map design paradigms\" \n\nOne of the implications of this communication model according to Crampton (2001) \"endorsed an “epistemic break” that shifted our understandings of maps as communication systems to investigating them in terms of fields of power relations and exploring the “mapping environments in which knowledge is constructed”... This involved examining the social contexts in which maps were both produced and used, a departure from simply seeing maps as artifacts to be understood apart from this context\".\n\nA second implication of this model is the presumption inherited from positivism that it is possible to separate facts from values. As Harley stated: Maps are never value-free images; except in the narrowest Euclidean sense they are not in themselves either true or false. Both in the selectivity of their content and in their signs and styles of representation maps are a way of conceiving, articulating, and structuring the human world which is biased towards, promoted by, and exerts influence upon particular sets of social relations. By accepting such premises it becomes easier to see how appropriate they are to manipulation by the powerful in society.\n\nAlthough this was a postwar discovery, the Map Communication Model (MCM) has its roots in information theory developed in the telephone industry before the war began. Mathematician, inventor, and teacher Claude Shannon worked at Bell Labs after completing his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1940. Shannon applied mathematical theory to information and demonstrated that communication could be reduced to binary digits (bits) of positive and negative circuits. This information could be coded and transmitted across a noisy interface without losing any meaning. Once the information was received it was then decoded by the listener; the integrity of the information remained intact. In producing meaningful sounds that could be measured for quality, Shannon produced the beginning of information theory and digital communication through circuits of on and off switches.\n\nShannon developed his ideas more thoroughly in the 1940s at the same time that geographer and cartographer Arthur H. Robinson returned from the Second World War during which he had served as cartographer for the military. Robinson found that cartographers were significantly limited because artists could make more effective maps than geographers. Upon returning from the war, Robinson worked to remedy this problem at Ohio State University where he was a graduate student. His \"The Look of Maps\" emphasizes the importance of lettering, map design, map structure, color, and technique. \n\nInformation theory helped turn the map into a medium of communicating information. Although Robinson never articulated a map model that could govern the new scientific pursuit of maps, his role in the war led to an understanding of the practical need for maps based on science not art. Robinson opened the door for others to apply Shannon’s \"Mathematical Theory of Communication\" to the design of maps. British geographer Christopher Board developed the first MCM in 1967 but it was cumbersome and poorly measured a map’s information quality. The Czech Geographer Kolácný’s 1969 version made several key improvements to Board’s model. These versions of the MCM helped cartographers realize the problems that Robinson noted as a war cartographer and helped articulate the discipline in terms of science.\n\n"}

A Markov chain random field is still a single spatial Markov chain. The spatial Markov chain moves or jumps in a space and decides its state at any unobserved location through interactions with its nearest known neighbors in different directions. The data interaction process can be well explained as a local sequential Bayesian updating process within a neighborhood.

It was established as part of Victoria's sesquicentenary (150 year anniversary) in 1984, along with the Children's Museum and the Museum of Chinese Australian History.\n\nGenerally referred to as the \"Living Museum of the West\", or just \"the Living Museum\", it was established in 1984, specifically to address the perceived disadvantage of Melbourne's Western Region, which as well as being generally a working class, industrial area, was considered to lack many cultural facilities. The ecomuseum concept was adopted to focus on the environment, landscape and people and their culture, and to involve the community in recording and preserving their own stories.\n\nDescribed as \"Australia's first ecomuseum, the museum focusses on the stories of people of Melbourne's Western Region, extending from Footscray to Bacchus Marsh, and from Sunbury to Werribee. Initially intended to be a \"museum without walls\" and focussing on oral history recording and community participation, it did not have a tradition objects collection until more recently.\n\nThe Living Museum maintains a Resources Collection which includes over the collection of documents, tapes and artefacts which form the Resource Centre, as well as the personnel and facilities at the Museum itself. The collections include published books, reports and articles; maps, plans and drawings; a photographic archive; oral histories; and exhibition materials. It contains about 500 artefacts, 5000 archival records (primarily copies of documents and plans), 10,000 photographic images (both copies of historical photographs and contemporary photos documenting the region and museum activities). Its most significant core collection is the oral history recordings, which focusses on the \"themes of migration, work, environment, culture, heritage, industry, women in the community and the everyday stories of the people of Melbourne's West\".\n\nFrom its beginnings in Footscray, the Living Museum expanded its collection and staff to outgrow the small premises, and with assistance from Arts Victoria, which provided core funding from its establishment, it moved to a refurbished industrial site. The Living Museum is now housed in the former industrial buildings at Pipemakers Park Van Ness Avenue, Maribyrnong, which were refurbished under a $2 million Australian Bicentenary grant in 1987–88, and are owned by Parks Victoria, with a lease arrangement with the Living Museum. The venue includes a visitor and research centre with staff offices, and large exhibition space in converted bluestone industrial buildings. These have been used for a variety of exhibitions, concerts, performances and community events.\n\nThe Museum's Patron is former Victorian premier Joan Kirner.\n\nThe Living Museum of the West commenced operations in a small house in David Street Footscray, with a staff of 4 and a much larger number of people employed under job creation schemes, who undertook research, oral history recording and preparation of exhibitions.\n\nIn 2011 the Living Museum went into decline, having lost its recurrent core funding from Arts Victoria, and struggled to secure replacement income. For a time it was dominated by a group of local artists known as MREAM (Maribyrnong River Edge Art Movement, who wished to develop the Pipemakers Park as artists studios and exhibition space, but were subsequently outvoted in 2011.\n\nIn 2012 the Living Museum re-established the collection in the Visitor Centre in Pipemakers Park. The Museum is currently in the process of digitising the collection and presenting and publishing the archives on the internet. With a new and dynamic committee of management, that includes original and new members, the Living Museum continues to develop programs of exhibitions and events in the historic buildings along the Maribyrnong River.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1035744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1035744", "title": "Nordicity", "text": "Nordicity\n\nNordicity () is the degree of northernness. The concept was developed by Canadian geographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin in the 1960s based on previous work done in the Soviet Union. Hamelin's point was that northern territories – like northern Canada – cannot be identified based on a single criterion, but that there was a continuum based on a number of natural and human factors.\n\nHamelin developed an index he called \"Valeurs polaires\" (Polar values) or VAPO, where the North Pole had a VAPO of 1000. The nordicity index had 10 natural and human components:\n\nEach component was graded on the scale of 0–100 where 100 represented extreme nordicity, with the VAPO representing the sum of these ten components. Hamelin proposed that areas with a VAPO of more than 200 should be considered in \"the North\". He subdivided Canada into \"Extreme North\", \"Far North\", \"Middle North\", and \"Near North\" () based on their VAPO. Using the VAPO, most of Canada outside the Southern Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland, the Prairies, the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor, and most of the Maritimes exhibits some degree of nordicity. . At the other end, the \"Extreme North\" included the northern portion of Canada's Arctic Archipelago. The rest of the archipelago and tundra zone as well as parts of the boreal forest were included in the \"Far North\".\n\nThe term is used by the Canadian government that has a set system for measuring nordicity. This system is used for determining a number of regulations in fields such as environmental protection, infrastructure, and many others. Northern Canada, apropos, is normally divided into three areas. The \"Middle North\" covering the northern parts of most provinces, as well as parts of the territories is largely populated by those of European descent and has significant resource extraction if a low population. The \"Far North\" covers the northern part of the continent and the southern Arctic Archipelago. The \"Extreme North\" covers the northernmost islands and is largely uninhabitable. Other countries have their own systems of measuring nordicity.\n\nThe idea of nordicity and the changing conceptions of what is the north has also recently become a subject for historians.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a component of organic land care and organic sustainable landscaping which adapt the principles and methods of sustainable gardening and organic farming to the care of lawns and gardens.\n\nAlternatives include the use of beneficial insects and natural predators such as nematodes to prevent infestation of lawns with pests such as crane fly larvae and ants, and preventing fungal infections through physical maintenance such as effective mowing and raking. Other 'environmentally friendly' techniques for caring for a lawn include irrigation only when the lawn shows signs of drought stress and then watering deeply - minimizing needless water consumption. Using low volume sprinklers provides more penetration without runoff. Lawnmowers with a mulching function can useful in reducing fertilizer use by allowing clippings that are cut so minutely that they can settle into the grass inconspicuously to decompose into the soil.\n\nA primary element of organic lawn management is the use of compost and compost tea to reduce the need for fertilization and to encourage healthy soil that enables turf to resist pests. A second element is mowing tall (3\" - 4\") to suppress weeds and encourage deep grass roots, and leaving grass clippings on the lawn as fertilizer. Additionally, fertilize in the fall, not the spring. Organic lawns often benefits from slice seeding and aeration more frequently due to the importance of a strong root system.\n\nSynthetic (inorganic based) fertilizers are made in a chemical process that uses fossil fuel and contributes to global warming. They also greatly increase the amount of nitrogen entering the global nitrogen cycle which has a serious negative impact on the organization and functioning of the world's ecosystems, including accelerating the loss of biological diversity and decline of coastal marine ecosystems and fisheries. Nitrogen fertilizer releases NO, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere after application. Organic fertilizer nitrogen content is typically lower than synthetic fertilizer.\n\nOrganic lawns contribute to biodiversity, by definition, when they contain more than one or two grass species. Examples of additional lawn and grasslike species that can be encouraged in organic lawns include dozens of grass species (eight for ryegrass alone, sedges, mosses, clover, vetches, trefoils, yarrow, ground cover alternatives, and other mowable plants). Biodiversity increases the functioning and stress tolerance of ecosystems. Lack of biodiversity is a significant environmental issue brought up by the use of lawns with grassroots groups emerging to promote this method of lawn care. Certain low-growing grass species can also eliminate the need for mowing, thus also being environmentally friendly. Clover is often mixed with grasses for its ability to fix nitrogen into the soil and fertilize the lawn.\n\n"}

A distinctive Petén-style of Maya architecture and inscriptions arose. The archaeological sites La Sufricaya and Holmul are also located in this region.\n\nBy the first half of the 1st millennium BCE, the Petén and Mirador Basin of this region were already well-established with a number of monumental sites and cities of the Maya civilization. Significant Maya sites of this Preclassic era of Mesoamerican chronology include Nakbé, El Mirador, Naachtun, San Bartolo and Cival in the Mirador Basin.\n\nLater, Petén became the heartland of the Maya Classic Period (c. 200 – 900 CE). At its height around 750 it is estimated that the Petén Basin was home to several million people, being one of the most densely populated regions of the world at the time. Some areas are estimated to have had ca 2,000 people/km². Mesoamerican agriculture was very extensive, and there is some evidence suggesting that the land was depleted by unsustainable overfarming, resulting in a famine which was an important factor in the collapse of the Classic Maya states of this area. The population is estimated to have dropped by two-thirds between the mid 9th century and the mid 10th century.\n\nArchaeological sites preserve important remnants of the Classic Maya in Petén Basin, such as: \nTikal National Park is one of the only sites to be designated a World Heritage Site for both archaeological and biodiversity reasons. Many thousands of house mounds where worshipers and workers once lived were discovered at Tikal.\n\nAfter the Classic Period collapse the population of the area continued to drop dramatically, especially after the introduction of smallpox along with European explorers. The smallpox plague arrived around 1519 or 1520, preceding by several years the first Europeans to visit the region. Hernán Cortés led the first expedition to pass through the Petén Basin, in 1524 to 1525, and reported that the region mostly had small hamlets separated by thick forest, with Tayasal being the only sizable inhabited city they observed.\n\nAfter Cortés' expedition, the colonial Spanish largely tried to conquer Petén Basin, with several attempts mainly from Belize and Alta Verapaz, for generations until an expedition from Yucatán, Belize and Cobán in Alta Verapaz, succeeded in conquering the last independent Maya polities around 1697, such as Zacpeten (capital of the Kowoj Maya), the Itza Maya center of Tayasal, and other towns in the Lake Petén Itza region such as Quexil (modern Spanish name, in Maya: \"Ek'ixil\") and Yalain. (\"see:\" Spanish conquest of Yucatán).\n\nThe Spanish town of Flores was established atop the site of Tayasal, but this remained an isolated backwater through the colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain era and after Mexican independence. When Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera sent a small force to Flores to claim the region for Guatemala in the 1840s, the governments of Mexico and the Yucatán state decided the Petén Basin area was not worth the trouble of contesting.\n\n"}

Liquid brines near the surface have been proposed to explain this activity, or dry granular flows. On October 5, 2015, possible RSL were reported on Mount Sharp near the \"Curiosity\" rover.\n\nResearch indicates that in the past there was liquid water flowing on the surface of Mars, creating large areas similar to Earth's oceans. However, the question remains as to where the water has gone.\n\nThe \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft launched in 2005 designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The spacecraft is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The HiRISE camera onboard the MRO is at the forefront of the ongoing RSL studies as it helps chart the features with images of closely monitored sites typically taken every few weeks. The 2001 \"Mars Odyssey\" orbiter has been using spectrometers and a thermal imager for over 16 years to detect evidence of past or present water and ice. It has detected none at the RSL.\n\nDistinctive properties of recurring slope lineae (RSL) include slow incremental growth, formation on warm slopes in warm seasons, and annual fading and recurrence, showing a strong correlation with solar heating. RSL extend down slope from bedrock outcrops often following small gullies about wide, with lengths up to hundreds of meters, and some of the locations display more than 1,000 individual flows. RSL advance rates are highest at the beginning of each season, followed by much slower lengthening. RSL appear and lengthen in the late southern spring and summer from 48°S to 32°S latitudes that favor equator-facing slopes, which are times and places with peak surface temperatures from . Active RSL also occur in equatorial regions (0–15°S), most commonly in the Valles Marineris troughs.\n\nResearchers surveyed flow-marked slopes with the \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" CRISM and although there is no spectrographic evidence for actual water, the instrument has directly imaged perchlorate salts thought to be dissolved in water brines in the subsurface. This may indicate the water quickly evaporates upon reaching the surface, leaving only the salts. The cause of the surface darkening and lightening is poorly understood: a flow initiated by salty water (brine) could rearrange grains or change surface roughness in a way that darkens the appearance, but the way the features brighten again when temperatures drop is harder to explain. However, in November 2018, it was announced that CRISM had fabricated some additional pixels representing the minerals alunite, kieserite, serpentine and perchlorate. The instrument team found that some false positives were caused by a filtering step when the detector switches from a high luminosity area to shadows. Reportedly, 0.05% of the pixels were indicating perchlorate, now known to be a false high estimate by this instrument. Reduced content of salts on the slopes reduces the chances of the presence of brines.\n\nA number of different hypotheses for RSL formation have been proposed. The seasonality, latitude distribution, and brightness changes strongly indicate a volatile material —such as water or liquid — is involved. One hypothesis is that RSL could form by rapid heating of nocturnal frost. Another one proposes flows of carbon dioxide, but the settings in which the flows occur are too warm for carbon-dioxide frost (), and at some sites is too cold for pure water. Other hypotheses include dry granular flows, but no entirely dry process can explain seasonal flows that progressively grow over weeks and months. Cornice avalanches is another hypothesis. The idea is that wind collects snow or frost just past the peak of a mountain and then this becomes an avalanche after it warms up. Seasonal melting of shallow ice would explain the RSL observations, but it would be difficult to replenish such ice annually. However, as of 2015, direct observations of seasonal deposition of soluble salts strongly suggest that RSL involve brine (hydrated salts).\n\nThe leading hypothesis involves the flow of brines —very salty water. Salt deposits over much of Mars indicate that brine was abundant in Mars's past. Salinity lowers the freezing point of water to sustain a liquid flow. Less saline water would freeze at the observed temperatures. Thermal infrared data from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on board the \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" orbiter, have allowed the temperature conditions under which RSL form to be constrained. While a small number of RSL are visible at temperatures above the freezing point of water, most are not, and many appear at temperatures as low as . Some scientists think that under these cold conditions, a brine of iron(III) sulphate (Fe(SO)) or calcium chloride () is the most likely mode of RSL formation. Another team of scientists, using the CRISM instrument onboard MRO, reported that the evidence for hydrated salts is most consistent with the spectral absorption features of magnesium perchlorate (Mg(ClO)), magnesium chloride (MgCl(H2O)) and sodium perchlorate ().\n\nExperiments and calculations demonstrated that recurring slope lineae could be produced by the deliquescence and rehydration of hydrous chlorides and oxychlorine salts. However, under present Martian atmospheric conditions there is not enough water to complete this process.\n\nThese observations are the closest scientists have come to finding evidence of liquid water on the planet's surface today. Frozen water, however, has been detected near the surface in many middle to high-latitude regions. Purported droplets of brine also appeared on struts of the Phoenix Mars Lander in 2008.\n\nLiquid brine flows near the surface might explain this activity, but the exact source of the water and the mechanism behind its motion are not understood. A hypothesis proposes that the needed water could originate in the seasonal oscillations of near-surface adsorbed water provided by the atmosphere; perchlorates and other salts known to be present on the surface, are able to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment (hygroscopic salts), but the dryness of the Martian air is a challenge. Water vapor must be efficiently trapped over very small areas, and seasonal variation in the atmospheric column abundance of water vapor does not match the RSL activity over active locations.\n\nDeeper groundwater may exist and could reach the surface at springs or seeps, but this cannot explain the wide distribution of RSL, extending from the tops of ridges and peaks. Also, there are apparent RSL on equatorial dunes composed of permeable sand, unlikely to be a groundwater source.\n\nAn analysis of data from the \"Mars Odyssey\" neutron spectrometer revealed that the RSL sites do not contain any more water than found at anywhere else at similar latitudes. The authors concluded that RSL are not supplied by large, near-surface briny aquifers. It is still possible with this data that water vapor from deeply buried ice, from the atmosphere, or from small deeply buried aquifers.\n\nDry granular flow was proposed since the first observations of RSLs but this interpretation was ruled out because of the seasonality of the process. The first proposition of a seasonal triggering in a dry context was published in March 2017 using a Knudsen pump effect. The authors demonstrated that the RSLs stopped at an angle of 28° in Garni crater, in agreement with dry granular avalanche. In addition, the authors pointed out several limitations of the wet hypothesis, such the fact that the detection of water was only indirect (salt detection but not water). This theory pushed back the dry flow theory. \nResearch published in November 2017 concludes that the observations are best explained by dry flow processes, and remark that there is no actual spectrographic evidence for water. Their research shows RSL exist only on slopes steeper than 27 degrees, enough for dry grains to descend the way they do on faces of active dunes. The RSL do not flow onto shallower than 27 degree slopes, which is inconsistent with models for water. A 2016 report also cast doubt on possible sources of underground water at RSL sites, but the new research article acknowledged that hydrated salts could draw some humidity from the atmosphere and seasonal changes in hydration of salt-containing grains might result in some trigger mechanism for RSL grainflows, such as expansion, contraction, or release of some water, that would change the cohesion of grains and cause them to fall or \"flow\" downslope. Furthermore, neutron spectrometer data by the \"Mars Odyssey\" orbiter obtained over one decade, was published in December 2017, and shows no evidence of water (hydrogenated regolith) at the active sites, so its authors also support the hypotheses of either short-lived atmospheric water vapour deliquesence, or dry granular flows. Nevertheless, the footprint of this instrument (~100 km) is much larger than the RSls (~100m).\n\nThese features form on Sun-facing slopes at times of the year when the local temperatures reach above the melting point for ice. The streaks grow in spring, widen in late summer and then fade away in autumn. This is hard to model in any other way except as involving liquid water in some form, though the streaks themselves are thought to be a secondary effect and not a direct indication of dampness of the regolith. Although these features involve water in some form, the water could be either too cold or too salty for life. At present they are treated as potentially habitable, as \"Uncertain Regions, to be treated as Special Regions\".\n\nThe \"Special Regions\" assessment says of them:\n\nHere a \"Special Region\" is defined as a region on the Mars surface where Earth life could potentially survive.\n\nThey were first reported on 5 August 2011. They were already suspected as involving flowing brines back then, as all the other models involved water in some form. They were finally proven to involve water after detection of hydrated salts (brine) that change their hydration state rapidly through the season. This was reported on 28 September 2015. The brines were not detected directly, because the resolution of the spectrometer is not high enough for this, and also the brines probably flow in the morning. The spacecraft that observed them, the \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\", is in a slowly precessing Sun-synchronous orbit inclined at 93 degrees (orbital period 1 hr 52 minutes). Each time it crosses the Mars equator on the sunny side, South to North, the time is 3:00 pm, in the local solar time on the surface, all year round. This is the worst time of day to spot brines from orbit.\n\nAt the end of the press conference, the researchers gave a rough estimate of a total annual flow of at least 100,000 tons for the entire Valles Marineres region. In this calculation they assumed only 5% water in the solution and a film with a thickness of 10 mm which is about what is needed for the material to flow at all. They are amongst the most favoured candidate sites to support Earth bacteria brought by contaminated landers.\n\n\n"}

The centre for foreign trade during this time was Agadir, a city 10 km north of the mouth of the Sous river.\n\nThe Sus is inhabited by Berber-speaking peoples of Imesmoden and Iẓnagen; aside from some Darija-speaking tribes, the main inhabitants are the Susians, speakers of a distinct Berber language called Shilha language, \"Tacelḥit\".\n\n\n"}

Among the populated raised islands, only Mitiaro is not subdivided into tapere. The remaining southern Cook Islands, Manuae, Palmerston and Takutea are atolls and/or uninhabited, and therefore not subject to this type of traditional subdivision. The atolls of the northern Cook Islands are subdivided into \"motu\" (populated atoll islets), instead.\n\nA tapere is a subdivision of a district (the major island subdivision) or \"puna\", which is headed by a district chiefs or \"Pava\" (in the case of the Island of Mangaia). A tapere is normally headed by a \"mataiapo\" (a chief of a major lineage) or \"ariki\" (a High Chief, the titular head of a tribe). It is occupied by the \"matakeinanga\", the local group composed of the residential core of a major lineage, plus affines and other permissive members.\n\nMost of the tapere lands are subdivided among the minor lineages, each of which was headed by a \"rangatira\" or \"kōmono\", or by the mataiapo himself.\n\nBelow that level, there is the \"uanga\", the extended family, the residential core of which occupied a household.\n\nHistorically, taperes were almost always wedge-shaped - the boundaries beginning at defined points on the outer reef and running inland to enclose an ever narrowing strip of land until converging at a point in or near the center of the island. By this type of delineation, any one tapere included every category of soil type and land surface of the island, from the typically mountainous interior, where forest products were collected, through fertile valleys where the major food crops were grown, across the rocky coastal strip of elevated fossil coral (makatea), out to the lagoon and fringing reef.\n\nAitutaki is subdivided into eight districts with 19 tapere according to the constitution. The 16 minor islands, 12 of them motu, are outside of this subdivision scheme:\n\nIn the case of Atiu, the six villages correspond to the six tapere:\n\nMangaia is subdivided into six Districts (puna), which are further subdivided into 38 tapere.\nIn the Cook Islands Constitution however, the six districts are called tapere.\n\nMauke is subdivided into four districts. Vaimutu and Makatea are not further subdivided and correspond to one tapere each. Ngatiarua and Areora districts are subdivided into 6 and 3 tapere, respectively, totalling 11 tapere for the whole island:\n\n\nRarotonga is subdivided into five Survey Land Districts (not to be confused with the three traditional \"Vaka\" districts that served as local government units with Councils and Mayors from 1997 to February 2008), with a total of 54 Tapere (or sub-districts), more than any other Island of the Cooks Islands:\n\n"}

By using the timing information from multiple LMUs, U-TDOA calculates the mobile phone’s location, using a technique called multilateration.\n\nBecause U-TDOA is a network-based location technology, it does not require the mobile phone to have any special chip, hardware, or software in it. As a result, it can locate any type of mobile phone.\n\nSince U-TDOA requires physical access to the cellular network's cell towers (base transceiver stations or BTS), it is only available to the owner of the sensor network, which is typically the carrier. Therefore, the solution is generally not available when roaming.\n\nU-TDOA is uniquely suited for mission-critical safety and security applications:\n\nU-TDOA works with all mobile phones and is very accurate, typically identifying location within 50 meters.\n\nGPS relies on special chipsets in wireless devices to calculate location in relationship to orbiting satellites. GPS can also locate phones within 50 meters. However, not every wireless subscriber has a GPS-enabled phone. Also, GPS requires a clear view to multiple satellites in order to function, so GPS cannot locate a wireless caller who is indoors or surrounded by tall buildings. \n\nToday, in the United States, Sprint and Verizon use a form of GPS known as Assisted GPS while AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile use U-TDOA for their E9-1-1 solutions.\n\n\n"}
