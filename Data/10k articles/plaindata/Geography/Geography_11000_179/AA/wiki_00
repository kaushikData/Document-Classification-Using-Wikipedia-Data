These groups do not advocate independence from Nigeria, and focus on cultural unity of the so-called Hausa–Fulani community which forms the majority in the north of the nation. \n\nWithin even smaller regionalist circles, the term Arewa Republic is used as to describe a speculative future region, entity, or state that coincides with the pre-1967 Northern Region, Nigeria.\n"}

{"id": "1687684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1687684", "title": "Cape Peninsula", "text": "Cape Peninsula\n\nThe Cape Peninsula () is a generally rocky peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean at the south-western extremity of the African continent. At the southern end of the peninsula are Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope. On the northern end is Table Mountain, overlooking Cape Town, South Africa. The peninsula is 52 km long from Mouille point in the north to Cape Point in the south.\nThe Peninsula has been an island on and off for the past 5 million years, as sea levels fell and rose with the ice age and interglacial global warming cycles of, particularly, the Pleistocene. The last time that the Peninsula was an island was about 1.5 million years ago. Soon afterwards it was joined to the mainland by the emergence from the sea of the sandy area now known as the Cape Flats. The towns and villages of the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats now form part of the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality.\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope is sometimes given as the meeting point of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Thus the west coast of the Peninsula is invariably referred to as the \"Atlantic Coast\", but the eastern side is known as the \"False Bay Coast\". It is at Cape Point (or the Cape of Good Hope) that the ocean to the south is often said to be divided into the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Indian Ocean to the east. However, according to the International Hydrographic Organization agreement that defines the ocean boundaries, the meeting point is at Cape Agulhas, about 200 km (120 mi) to the southeast.\n\nSimilarly, Cape Point is not the fixed \"meeting point\" of the cold Benguela Current, running northwards along the west coast of Africa, and the warm Agulhas Current, running south from the equator along the east coast of Africa. In fact the south flowing Agulhas Current swings away from the African coastline between about East London and Port Elizabeth, from where it follows the edge of the Continental shelf roughly as far as the southern tip of the Agulhas Bank, 250 km (155 miles) south of Cape Agulhas. From there it is retroflexed (turned sharply round) in an easterly direction by the South Atlantic, South Indian and Southern Ocean currents, known as the \"West Wind Drift\", which flow eastwards round Antarctica. The Benguela Current, on the other hand, is an upwelling current which brings cold, mineral-rich water from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the surface along the west coast of Southern Africa. Having reached the surface it flows northwards as a result of the prevailing wind and Coriolis forces. The Benguela Current, therefore, effectively starts at Cape Point, and flows northwards from there, although further out to sea it is joined by surface water that has crossed the South Atlantic from South America as part of the South Atlantic Gyre. Thus the Benguela and Agulhas currents do not strictly \"meet\" anywhere, although eddies from the Agulhas current do from time to time round the Cape to join the Benguela Current.\n\nTable Mountain National Park, previously known as the Cape Peninsula National Park, was proclaimed on 29 May 1998, for the purpose of protecting the natural environment of the Table Mountain Chain, and in particular the rare fynbos vegetation. The park comprises a large part of the undeveloped area of the Cape Peninsula, and is managed by South African National Parks Board. The coastal waters surrounding the Cape Peninsula are proclaimed as a marine protected area since 2004, and include several no-take zones, and are part of the national park. The waters of this marine protected area are unusual in that they are parts of two fairly distinct marine bioregions, namely the Agulhas Bioregion and the South-western Cape Bioregion. The boundary is at Cape Point.\n\nThe Cape Peninsula has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape Fynbos. The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos, but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld and Afromontane forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain ranges of the Peninsula. On the sandy Cape Flats lowlands there are a few pockets of protected Cape Flats Sand Fynbos.\n\nThe Peninsula's vegetation types form part of the Cape Floral Region protected areas. These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain range - which are at least as many as occur in the whole of the United Kingdom. Many of these species, including a great many types of proteas, are endemic to these mountains and can be found nowhere else. The Disa uniflora, despite its restricted range within the Western Cape, is relatively common in the perennially wet areas (waterfalls, streamlets and seeps) on Table Mountain and the Back Table, but hardly anywhere else on the Cape Peninsula. It is a very showy orchid that blooms from January to March on the Table Mountain Sandstone regions of the mountain. Although they are quite widespread on the Back Table, the best (most certain, and close-up) place to view these beautiful blooms is in the \"Aqueduct\" off the Smuts Track, halfway between Skeleton Gorge and Maclear's Beacon.\n\nRemnant patches of indigenous forest persist in the wetter ravines. However, much of the indigenous forest was felled by the early European settlers for fuel for the lime kilns needed during the construction of the Castle. The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of Devil's Peak, Table Mountain and the Back Table where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klaassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch \"bosch\" means forest; and \"boomen\" means trees) . Hout Bay (in Dutch \"hout\" means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests. In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes all the way from the Constantiaberg to the front of Devil’s Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous Afromontane forests have not survived, or never existed.\n\nFynbos is a fire adapted vegetation, and evidence suggests that in the absence of regular fires all but the drier fynbos would become dominated by trees. Regular fires have dominated fynbos for at least the past 12 000 years largely as a result of human activity. In 1495 Vasco da Gama named the South African coastline \"Terra de Fume\" because of the smoke he saw from numerous fires. This was originally probably to maintain a productive stock of edible bulbs (especially watsonians) and to facilitate hunting, and later, after the arrival of pastoralists, to provide fresh grazing after the rains. Thus the plants that make up fynbos today are those that have been subjected to a variety of fire regimes over a very long period time, and their preservation now requires regular burning. The frequency of the fires obviously determines precisely which mix of plants will dominate any particular region, but intervals of 10–15 years between fires are considered to promote the proliferation of the larger Protea species, a rare local colony of which, the \"Aulax umbellata\" (Family: Proteaceae), was wiped out on the Peninsula by more frequent fires, as have been the silky-haired pincushion, \"Leucospermum vestitum\", the red sugarbush, \"Protea grandiceps\" and Burchell's sugarbush, \"Protea burchellii\", although a stand of a dozen or so plants has recently been \"rediscovered\" in the saddle between Table Mountain and Devil's Peak. Some bulbs may similarly have become extinct as a result of a too rapid sequence of fires. The fires that occur on the mountains today are still largely due to unregulated human activity. Fire frequency is therefore a matter of chance rather than conservation.\n\nDespite intensive conservation efforts the Table Mountain range has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world. The non-urban areas of the Cape Peninsula (mainly on the mountains and mountain slopes) have suffered particularly under a massive onslaught of invasive alien plants for well over a century, with perhaps the worst invader being the cluster pine, partly because it was planted in extensive commercial plantations along the eastern slopes of the mountains, north of Muizenberg. Considerable efforts have been made to control the rapid spread of these invasive alien trees. Other invasive plants include black wattle, blackwood, Port Jackson and rooikrans (All Australian members of the acacia family), as well as several \"Hakea\" species and bramble.\n\nThe most common mammal on the mountain was the \"dassie\" (the South African name, from Afrikaans, pronounced \"dussy\"), or rock hyrax. Between about 2000 and 2004 (no one is certain about the exact year or years) their numbers suddenly plummeted for unknown reasons. They used to cluster around the restaurant at the upper cable station, near areas where tourists discarded or (inadvisably supplied) food. The population crash of the dassies was in all probability responsible for the decline in the Verreaux's eagle population on the Peninsula, which is believed to have consisted of 3 breeding pairs during the period 1950 to 1990, with only 2 pairs, maximally, ever having been reported to fledge a chick each in any given year. With the commencement of formal monitoring in 1993, two breeding pairs were recorded on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain in 2004: one below the upper cable station at the western end of Table Mountain, in Blinkwater Ravine, the other on the cliffs below Noordhoek Peak. The nest near the cable station was abandoned in 2006, leaving only the Noordhoek pair, which continued to fledge chicks reasonably regularly till 2013, at which point one member of the pair disappeared. From 2013 till January 2017 only a single Verreaux's Eagle, presumed to be a female, remained on the Peninsula. She continued to maintain the nest under Noordhoek Peak, but seemed unable to attract a mate. But in early 2017 a pair of eagles was seen by at least 7 independent observers during the course of 10 days (27 January - 5 February). It remains to be seen whether they will breed later in the year. Dassies are an important part the Verreaux's eagle's prey on the Peninsula. (See Foot note)\n\nTable Mountain is also home to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of amphibian that is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the \"rooikat\" (caracal) and the \"vaalboskat\" (also called the vaalkat or Southern African wildcat) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, booted eagle (in summer), African harrier-hawk, peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 three pairs of African fish eagles were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.\n\nUp until the late 1990s baboons occurred on all the mountains of the Peninsula, including the Back Table immediately behind Table Mountain. Since then they have abandoned Table Mountain and the Back Table, and only occur on the Constantiaberg, and the mountains to the south. They have also abandoned the tops of many of the mountains, in favour of the lower slopes, particularly when these were covered in pine plantations which seemed to provide them with more, or higher quality food than the fynbos on the mountain tops. However these new haunts are also within easy reach of Cape Town's suburbs, which brings them into conflict with humans and dogs, and the risk of traffic accidents. In 2014 there were a dozen troops on the Peninsula, varying in size from 7 to over 100 individuals, scattered on the mountains from the Constantiaberg to Cape Point. The baboon troops are the subject of intense research into their movements (both of individuals and of the troops), their physiology, genetics, social interactions and habits. In addition, their sleeping sites are noted each evening, so that monitors armed with paint ball guns can stay with the troop all day, to ward them off from wandering into the suburbs. From when this initiative was started in 2009 the number of baboons on the Peninsula has increased from 350 to 450, and the number of baboons killed or injured by residents has decreased.\n\nHimalayan tahrs, fugitive descendants of tahrs that escaped from Groote Schuur Zoo near the University of Cape Town, in 1936, used to be common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain. As an exotic species, they were almost eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the South African National Parks to make way for the reintroduction of indigenous klipspringers. Until recently there were also small numbers of fallow deer of European origin and sambar deer from southeast Asia. These were mainly in the Rhodes Memorial area but during the 1960s they could be found as far afield as Signal Hill. These animals may still be seen occasionally despite efforts to eliminate or relocate them.\n\nOn the lower slopes of Devil's Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes has been used in recent years as part of the Quagga Project. The quaggas used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to extinction during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the quagga, after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.\n\nThe Cape Peninsula is underlain by the oldest rocks in the area, the Malmesbury Group, and the granite intrusions of the \"Peninsula pluton\".\n\nThe Malmesbury Group has been dated from between 830 and 980 Mya, and was deformed during the Saldanian orogenic cycle, both before and during the granite intrusions of 630 to 500 Mya, and there are minor intrusions which precede the granite. The base of this group has not been exposed. The basal rocks were eroded to a relatively featureless peneplain with exposed granites covering most of the peninsula south of Lion's Head and Devil's Peak. The \"Sea-Point contact zone\", described by Charles Darwin is a well known region of metamorphic rocks formed by the (originally very hot) granite intrusion into the Malmesbury rocks.\n\nThese rocks were later unconformably covered by the Cape Supergroup. The Cape Supergroup is divided into eight formations, the three oldest of which are present on the Peninsula. The lowest present is the reddish \"Graafwater formation\" which consist of shales and sandstone. The Graafwater Formation can be clearly seen in the cutting on the second hairpin bend as the Ou Kaapse Weg (road) goes up the slope from Westlake on to the Silvermine plateau. In the cutting one can also see the abrupt and obvious transition into the Table Mountain Sandstone (or, as it is currently known, the Peninsula Formation Sandstone) above it. Looking up the slope from below to the first hairpin bend, the granite basement on which the Graafwater formation rests is visible. And in the cutting at the first hairpin bend, the ocher-colored, gritty clay into which the granite weathers is clearly displayed. The relatively thin Graafwater layer (no more than about 60–70 m thick on the Cape Peninsula) is overlain by the prominent Peninsula Formation, which consist mainly of hard, erosion resistant, quartzitic sandstone, which form the high, prominent, almost vertical cliffs of the Cape Peninsula. At the very top of Table Mountain, at Maclear's Beacon, is a small remnant of the \"Pakhuis Diamictites\", better represented in the Cederberg Mountains, 200 km to the north of Cape Town.\n"}

It is bordered by the city boroughs of Devín from the west, Devínska Nová Ves from the north, Dúbravka from the east and Karlova Ves from the south. Its highest mountain is Devínska Kobyla at 514 m (1,686 ft) AMSL, it is also the highest point in Bratislava. The hills are mostly forested with deciduous trees and most of the area is protected by numerous nature reserves, including two geologically important areas: \"Sandberg\" containing sands and sandstones from the Cenozoic Paratethys ocean and \"Jezuitské Lesy\" containing rare granitic pegmatite bearing niobium-tantalum oxide minerals.\n\nDevín Carpathians are famous for its castles, most notably the Bratislava Castle and the ruins of Devín Castle. The mountains feature numerous cultural monuments, caves, tramping huts, an open-air geology museum and a chemical waste dump. Military structures in the mountains include an abandoned rocket base and preserved artillery fortifications from the time of Austria-Hungary. Featuring a dense network of forest trails, Devín Carpathians together with Bratislava Forest Park are frequented by citizens of the city and provide their main venue for hiking, mountain cycling, cross-country skiing and dog walking. \n\nThe boundary of Devín Carpathians consists of the Slovak-Austrian border in the middle of the Morava and Danube rivers from the west, the road connecting Devínska Nová Ves and Dúbravka from the north, the road connecting Dúbravka with the crossing at Patrónka from the north-west and east, and Mlynská dolina from the south. The mountain range is located entirely within the administrative boundaries of Bratislava.\n\nDevín Carpathians are divided into four geomorphological areas, separated by a series of faults:\n\n\nDevín Carpathians consist of Paleozoic era landforms (south-eastern part), Mesozoic era landforms, Cenozoic era landforms, the latter including Quaternary period landforms. \n\nThere are 5 caves in Devín Carpathians: Abrázna cave, J06041401 cave, J06041402 cave, Medzivrstvová cave (original name \"Zlepencová jaskyňa\") and Štokeravská vápenka cave (original name \"Stockerau\"). Abrázna cave is a 10 meters long karst cave. Abrázna cave was created as a result of coastal modelling by a prehistoric Cenozoic sea and like all of the others, it is inaccessible to the public. It is supposedly the westernmost cave in Slovakia, although actually it is rather the J06041401 cave. None of the caves are open to the public.\n\nNotable rivers originating in the Devín Carpathians include Čierny potok and Mokrý jarok (also called \"Mokrý potok\"), the latter is a short stream originating at the Devínska Kobyla mountain, draining its south-eastern part. It flows into the Danube near the quarry at Devínska cesta Street, near island Sihoť.\n\n\nFlora and fauna is similar to that of the Little Carpathians, yet the area of Devínska Kobyla represents the edge of the thermophilic dry vegetation of the pannonian plane. According to the phytogeorgraphical division of J. Futák (1964, 1972), Devínska Kobyla is grouped together with the neighboring Hundsheimer Berge in Austria, consisting of an area of xerothermic pannonian flora (Eupannonicum).\n\nMuch of the area is densely forested with mostly pine-oak or oak-hornbeam trees. Humans have been shaping the environment in this area for centuries and anthropic changes included cutting and burning forests, creating meadows, establishing vineyards and orchards, grazing animals and planting new trees. Today, the area of Devín Carpathians contains a mixture of stony and grassy forest steppe, shrublands and dense forests. Some areas are more often visited and continually being changed over the course of centuries, other areas are relatively intact. There are numerous endemic species living inside the protected areas. The mountains are rich in mushroom diversity as the small area of Devínska Kobyla alone contains at least 234 species of identified mushrooms.\n\nLocal flora contains approximately 1,100 species of plants, 25 species are protected in Slovakia. The area is notable for its \"Viola\" hybrids.

{"id": "57078824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57078824", "title": "Earth section paths", "text": "Earth section paths\n\nEarth section paths are paths on the earth defined by the intersection of a reference ellipsoid and a plane. Common examples of earth sections include the great ellipse and normal sections. This page provides a unifying approach to all earth sections and their associated geodetic problems.\n\nThe indirect problem for earth sections is: given two points, formula_1 and formula_2 on the surface of the reference ellipsoid, find the length, formula_3, of the short arc of a spheroid section from formula_1 to formula_2 and also find the departure and arrival (true north referenced) azimuths of that curve, formula_6 and formula_7. Let formula_8 have geodetic latitude formula_9 and longitude formula_10 (k=1,2). This problem is best solved using analytic geometry in ECEF coordinates.\nLet formula_11 and formula_12 be the ECEF coordinates of the two points, computed using the geodetic to ECEF transformations discussed here.\n\nTo define the section plane select any third point formula_13 not on the line from formula_14 to formula_15. Choosing formula_13 to be on the surface normal at formula_1 will define the normal section at formula_1. If formula_13 is the origin then the earth section is the great ellipse. (The origin would be co-linear with 2 antipodal points so a different point must be used in that case). Since there are infinitely many choices for formula_13, the above problem is really a class of problems (one for each plane). Let formula_13 be given. To put the equation of the plane into the standard form, formula_22, where formula_23, requires the components of a unit vector, formula_24, normal to the section plane. These components may be computed as follows: The vector from formula_13 to formula_14 has components formula_27, and the vector from formula_14 to formula_15 has components formula_30. Therefore, formula_31 = formula_32×formula_33), where formula_34 is the unit vector in the direction of formula_35. The orientation convention used here is that formula_31 points to the left of the path. If this is not the case then redefine formula_37 = -formula_37. Finally, the parameter d for the plane may be computed using the dot product of formula_31 with a vector from the origin to any point on the plane, such as formula_14, i.e. d = formula_41. The equation of the plane (in vector form) is thus formula_31 ⋅ formula_43 = d, where formula_43 is the position vector of (x, y, z).\n\nA unit vector pointing up at any point on the ellipsoid is: formula_45=formula_46, a unit vector pointing north is formula_47=formula_48, and east is formula_49=formula_50. A vector tangent to the path is:\nformula_51 so the east component of formula_52 is formula_53, and the north component is formula_54. Therefore, the azimuth may be obtained from a two-argument arctangent function, formula_55=formula_56. Use this method at both formula_1 and formula_2 to get formula_6 and formula_7.\n\nThe (non-trivial) intersection of a plane and ellipsoid is an ellipse. Therefore, the arc length, formula_3, on the section path from formula_1 to formula_2 is an elliptic integral that may be computed to any desired accuracy using a truncated series. Before this can be done the ellipse must be defined and the limits of integration computed.\nLet the ellipsoid given by formula_64, and let formula_65.\nIf p=0 then the section is a horizontal circle of radius formula_66, which has no solution if formula_67.\n\nIf p>0 then Gilbertson showed that the ECEF coordinates of the center of the ellipse is formula_68, where formula_69,\n\nthe semi-major axis is formula_70, in the direction formula_71, and\nthe semi-minor axis is formula_72, in the direction formula_73, which has no solution if formula_74.\n\nThe polar form relative to center for the equation of an ellipse is formula_75, where formula_76, relates to the ellipse eccentricity, not the spheroid eccentricity (see ellipse). Let P be a point on the ellipse and formula_77, then the vector from formula_78 to formula_43 has components formula_80. Using an argument similar to the one for azimuth above, let formula_81, then formula_82, and formula_83, and formula_84. In this way we obtain the central angles formula_85 and formula_86 corresponding to formula_1 and formula_2 respectively. Care must be taken to ensure that 0 ≤ formula_89 ≤ formula_90 ≤ formula_91. Then the arc length along the ellipse is given by formula_3 =formula_93 Substituting formula_94 above into this formula, performing the indicated operations, using one more term than Gilbertson's expression and regrouping, results in \nformula_95, where\nAlternatively, expansions for the Meridian arc may be used here by replacing the spheroid eccentricity with the section ellipse eccentricity.\n\nThe direct problem is given formula_97, the distance, formula_98, and departure azimuth, formula_6, find formula_100 and the arrival azimuth, formula_7.\nConstruct the tangent vector at formula_97, formula_103, where formula_104 and formula_105 are unit vectors pointing north and east (respectively) at formula_97. Pick a vector, formula_37, to define the section plane, paying attention to orientation. Observe that formula_37 must not be in span{formula_109} (otherwise the plane would be tangent to the earth at formula_97, so no path would result). The normal vector formula_31 = formula_32×formula_113), together with formula_97 defines the plane.\nThis is a 2-d problem in span{formula_116}, which will be solved with the help of the arc length formula above. The basic approach is to use Newton-Raphson iteration to arrive at formula_100. The basis of the estimate is that the position vector of any point on the section ellipse may be expressed in terms of the position vector of the center and the central angle as \nformula_118.\nTo get an initial estimate of formula_119, let formula_120, formula_121=Central_Angleformula_122 (see the arc length section above),\nformula_123, formula_124.\n\nNow initialize formula_125 = formula_126, and iterate the following steps:\nexit when formula_128\n\nNo more than three iterations are usually necessary, although nearly antipodal cases can be problematic.\nFinally, let formula_129, and formula_100 = ECEF_to_Geoformula_131 using Bowring’s 1985 algorithm, or the algorithm here.\n\nAlternatively, inversion of the arc length series may be used to avoid iterations.\n\nAzimuth may be obtained by the same method as the indirect problem: formula_132=formula_133, where the subscript 2 indicates evaluation of the associated quantity at formula_2.\n\nLet formula_13 be the origin, so that formula_136 = the position vector of formula_14. The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.\n\nThe normal section at formula_1 is determined by letting formula_136 = formula_140 (the surface normal at formula_1). The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.\n\nThe mean normal section from formula_1 to formula_2 is determined by letting formula_136 = formula_145. This is a good approximation to the geodesic from formula_1 to formula_2 for aviation or sailing.\n\nA class of sections may be imagined by rotating formula_140 about the chord connecting formula_1 and formula_150 All of these may be solved with the single approach above.\n\nLet two section planes be given: formula_151⋅formula_43 = formula_153, and formula_154⋅formula_43 = formula_156. Assuming that the two planes are not parallel, the line of intersection is on both planes. Hence orthogonal to both normals, i.e. in the direction of formula_157.\n\nSince formula_151 and formula_154 are not colinear formula_151, formula_154, formula_162 is a basis for formula_163. Therefore, there exist constants formula_164 and formula_165 such that the line of intersection of the 2 planes is given by formula_43 = formula_167 + formula_168 + tformula_162, where t is an independent parameter.\n\nSince this line is on both section planes, it satisfies both: \nformula_164 + formula_165(formula_151·formula_154) = formula_153, and \nformula_164(formula_151·formula_154) + formula_165 = formula_156.\n\nSolving these equations for formula_180 and formula_181 gives \nformula_164 [1 - (formula_183 ] = formula_153 - formula_156(formula_151·formula_154), and \nformula_165 [1 - (formula_183 ] = formula_156 - formula_153(formula_151·formula_154).\n\nDefine the “dihedral angle”, formula_55, by formula_195 = formula_196·formula_197.\nThen formula_164 = formula_199 , and formula_165 = formula_201.\n\nOn the intersection line we have formula_43 = formula_13 + tformula_162, where formula_13 = formula_167 + formula_168.\nHence: formula_208 = formula_209 + tformula_210, formula_211 = formula_212 + tformula_213, and formula_214 = formula_215 + tformula_216, where\nformula_209= formula_218 + formula_219, formula_212 = formula_221 + formula_222, and formula_215 = formula_224 +formula_225.\nand formula_226=(formula_227,formula_228,formula_229), for i=1,2,3.\n\nTo find the intersection of this line with the earth, plug the line equations into formula_64, to get\nformula_231, where formula_232 = formula_233, \nformula_234 = formula_235,\nformula_236 = formula_237.\n\nTherefore, the line intersects the earth at formula_238. If formula_239, then there is no intersection. If formula_240, then the line is tangent to the earth at formula_241 (i.e. the sections intersect at that single point).\n\nObserve that formula_242 since formula_151 and formula_154are not colinear. Plugging t into\nformula_43 = formula_13 + tformula_162, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections.\n\non a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; formula_248, formula_249, and setting formula_250, so that formula_251. Then solve for formula_252 such that formula_240.\n\nSince formula_254, and formula_255, we must have formula_256. Plugging t into formula_43 = formula_258, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections. Alternatively, just set formula_259.\n\non a earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; formula_248, formula_249, and setting formula_262, where formula_263 is the longitude to be solved for such that formula_240.\n\nAlternatively, just set formula_265.\n"}

{"id": "904807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904807", "title": "Frederick Cook", "text": "Frederick Cook\n\nFrederick Albert Cook (June 10, 1865 – August 5, 1940) was an American explorer, physician, and ethnographer, noted for his claim of having reached the North Pole on April 21, 1908. This was nearly a year before Robert Peary, who reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts were disputed for several years. His expedition did discover Meighen Island, the only discovery of an island in the American Arctic by a United States expedition.\n\nIn December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the University of Copenhagen ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching Mount McKinley's summit has also been discredited.\n\nCook's birthplace is often listed as Callicoon, New York, but he was actually born in Hortonville, New York. His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting the phonetic version of their surname. He attended Columbia University and received his doctorate from New York University Medical School in 1890. Cook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters and divorced in 1923.\n\nCook was the surgeon on Robert Peary's Arctic expedition of 1891–1892, and on the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–1899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship—the —was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent scurvy, Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.\n\nIn 1897, Cook twice visited Tierra del Fuego, where he met Anglican missionary Thomas Bridges. They studied the Ona and Yahgan, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades, during which time he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.\n\nIn 1903, he led an expedition to Mount McKinley during which he circumnavigated the Denali range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's McKinley ascent was also fraudulent.\n\nContrary to Hudson Stuck in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier, 19 miles away.\n\nIn late 1909, Ed Barrill, Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit denying that they had reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he was paid by Peary supporters to do so. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.) Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what became called Fake Peak, featured in Cook's \"summit\" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.\n\nClimber Bradford Washburn has gathered data, repeated the climbs, and taken new photos to evaluate Cook's 1906 claim. Between 1956 and 1995, Washburn and Brian Okonek identified the locations of most of the photographs Cook took during his 1906 Denali foray and took new photos at the same spots. In 1997 Bryce identified the locations of the remaining photographs, including Cook's \"summit\" photograph; none were taken anywhere near the summit. Washburn showed that none of Cook's 1906 photos were taken past the \"Gateway\" (north end of the Great Gorge), 12 horizontal bee-line miles from Denali and 3 miles below its top.\n\nAn expedition by the Mazama Club in 1910 reported that Cook's map departed abruptly from the landscape at a point when the summit was still 10 miles distant. Critics of Cook's claims have compared Cook's map of his alleged 1906 route with the landscape of the last 10 miles. Cook's descriptions of the summit ridge are variously claimed to bear no resemblance to the mountain and to have been verified by many subsequent climbers. However, in the 1970s, climber Hans Waale found a route which fit Cook's narrative and descriptions. Three decades later, in 2005 and 2006, this route was successfully climbed by a group of Russian mountaineers.\n\nNo evidence of Cook's purported journey between the \"Gateway\" and the summit has been found. His claim to have reached the summit is not supported by his photos' vistas, his two sketch maps' markers, and peak-numberings for points attained, nor by his compass bearings, barometer readings, route-map or camp trash. However, samples of all such evidence have been found short of the Gateway.\n\nAfter the Mount Denali expedition, Cook returned to the Arctic in 1907. He planned to attempt to reach the North Pole, although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left Annoatok, a small settlement in the north of Greenland, in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 22, 1908, after traveling north from Axel Heiberg Island, taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to Jones Sound, spending the open water season and part of the winter on Devon Island. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing Nares Strait to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.\n\nCook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian Pierre Berton (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.\n\nThere are striking similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in Jules Verne's novel \"The Adventures of Captain Hatteras\". For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of Jones Sound in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization. For details, see Osczevski (2003).\n\nCook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as football coach Fielding H. Yost (as related in Fred Russell's 1943 book, \"I'll Go Quietly\").\nCook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with Harry Whitney, an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey 700 miles south to Upernavik. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the USA on Peary's ship \"Roosevelt\" in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.\n\nOn December 21, 1909, a commission at the University of Copenhagen, after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole. (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the National Geographic Society, which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)\n\nCook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some. These have an incorrect solar diameter. Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge. Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.\n\nThe Peary expedition's people (primarily Matthew Henson, who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had only traveled a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown Meighen Island, which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed. A genuine Cook discovery, Meighen Island, is the only island discovered by a United States expedition in the American arctic. For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).\n\nThe conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during his South Pole expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.\n\nAt the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: \"I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.\"\n\nCook's reputation never recovered. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the National Geographic Society, which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. Researching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to see how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and set them against the period of the Gilded Age. He believes that Cook, as a physician and ethnographer, cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook \"genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration-mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge-and that of the world-for its own sake.\" However, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain support for continued expeditions.\n\nIn 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in Fort Worth. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and was put on trial. Joining him in the trial was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.\n\nAmong other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician Joseph Weldon Bailey, who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud, and, in November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.\n\nCook was imprisoned until 1930. Roald Amundsen, who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the \"Belgica\", visited him several times. Cook was pardoned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.\n\n\n\n"}

The North Kyangsong Province gneiss samples indicated ages to 2.12 billion years ago and in 1985, the Sangni Metamorphic Supergroup and the Sangni Revolution were proposed as names for the gneiss-schist and gneiss formation.

The western edge of the Machyollong Zone is known as the Iwon Mobile Belt and contains extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks. \n\nThe late Proterozoic Sangwon Synthem is widespread in the Pyongnam Basin and other, smaller basins in North Korea and experienced deformation during orogenies in the Mesozoic. \n\nThe Late Ordovician Miru Series was identified beginning in 1971 as the Koksan Series and subsequently renamed after 1975. The 170 meter thick limestone and siltstone centered around the P'yongnam Basin has extensive crinoid, coral and gastropod fossils. Paleogeography researchers have suggested that corals formed in the Miru Sea—a branch of the South Yangtze Sea. The discovery of Ordovician fossils meant that the previous Koksan Series was revised to be younger, encompassing Silurian slate, limestone and siltstone in the Singye-Koksan area up to 280 meters thick. It includes trilobite and Rugosa fossils. \n\nFor years, geologists in the Korean Peninsula were puzzled about the early Paleozoic fossils found in the early Mesozoic Taedong Synthem (limestone pebbles in the Kyomipo Conglomerate). However, in 1991, Kang and Pak inferred an origin from the Koksan Series. \nMarine fossils are also widespread in the Imjin Group, first recognized in 1962 in the Kaesong-Kumchon-Cholwon area. The three kilometer thick unit is subdivided into the Anhyop, Puapsan and Saknyong Series and is widespread throughout the Imjinang Fold Belt in central North Korea. The Anhyop Series represents one kilometer of schist, limestone, phyllite and sandstone. The 1.1 kilometer Puapsan Series and one kilometer Saknyong Series are both very similar, although the Saknyong also has siltstone and volcanic rocks. North Korean geologists have identified the Imjin Group as a continental rift basin, correlated with similar rocks on the Shandong Peninsula across the Yellow Sea in China. Many of the rocks have experienced low-grade metamorphism and volcanic sequences are comparatively thick. \n\nAt the base of the Taedong Synthem is the P'yong'an Supergroup, which lies disconformably atop older Paleozoic rocks. In the Pyongyang Coalfield it is divided into the 650 meter sandstone, shale and conglomerate of the Nogam Formation, the 500 meter Kobangsan Formation, 350 meter coal-bearing Sadong Formation and 250 meter chert-bearing Hongjom Formation, all typically assigned to an Upper Permian shallow marine environment. \n\nDuring the Mesozoic, the region experienced the Songnim Orogeny, named for overturned, overthrusted Choson and P'yong'an synthem rocks near Songnim, north of Pyongyang. This event is associated with the 240 to 190 million year old Triassic and Jurassic Hyesan Complex pluton. \n\nTaebo, a place north of Pyongyang is the namesake of the Taebo orogeny, a period of tectonic activity that emplaced the Taebo Granite around 180 million years ago. The orogeny, which is evidenced in the Okchon Supergroup, is likely related to the separation of Japan from Asia. \n\nNorth of Pyongyang, Precambrian basement rocks are unconformably overlain by a Jurassic limestone conglomerate ascending to layers of siltstone and mudstone. The Upper Jurassic Shinuiju Formation northwest of Shinuiju has sandstone, conglomerate and mudstone up to two kilometers thick. Offshore drilling in the West Korea Bay Basin indicates these rocks are the onshore extension of offshore units. It is subdivided into fluvial rocks and Upper Jurassic black shale, limestone, conglomerate and sandstone formed in a lake environment. \n\nLongstanding terrestrial conditions prevailed through much of the Cenozoic, until the recent geological past, when the a marine regression flooded the area around the peninsula. Very few Cenozoic sediments are known from either Korea, likely as a result of erosion due to uplift of the peninsula. Submarine normal faults along the eastern coastline may have driven crustal tilting. \nThe 350 meter thick Bongsan Coalfield in Hwanghae Province on the west coast preserves and coal-bearing layers dating to the Eocene. Further to the north, in the West Korea Bay Basin Eocene and Oligocene sedimentary rocks up to three kilometers thick unconformably overlie Mesozoic rocks, formed in lakes and coal swamps during the Paleogene. \n"}
{"id": "180930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180930", "title": "Geology of the Appalachians", "text": "Geology of the Appalachians\n\nThe geology of the Appalachians dates back to more than 480 million years ago. A look at rocks exposed in today's Appalachian Mountains reveals elongate belts of folded and thrust faulted marine sedimentary rocks, volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient ocean floor - strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision. The birth of the Appalachian ranges marks the first of several mountain building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent Pangaea with the Appalachians and neighboring Little Atlas (now in Morocco) near the center. These mountain ranges likely once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before they were eroded.\n\nDuring the earliest Paleozoic Era, the continent that would later become North America straddled the equator. The Appalachian region was a passive plate margin, not unlike today's Atlantic Coastal Plain Province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallow seas. Thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock were deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated.\n\nDuring the middle Ordovician Period (about 440-480 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the creation of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born.\n\nAlong the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands.\n\nThis was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians. Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years (Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghenian orogenies). Continent after continent was thrust and sutured onto the North American craton as the Pangean supercontinent began to take shape. Microplates, smaller bits of crust, too small to be called continents, were swept in, one by one, to be welded to the growing mass.\n\nBy about 300 million years ago (Pennsylvanian Period) Africa was approaching the North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the Ozark-Ouachita region and through the Marathon Mountains area of Texas. Continent vs. continent collision raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to a lofty mountain range on the scale of the present-day Himalaya. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic Era (Permian Period) when Africa (Gondwana) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the core.\n\nPangea began to break up about 220 million years ago, in the Early Mesozoic Era (Late Triassic Period). As Pangea rifted apart a new passive tectonic margin was born and the forces that created the Appalachian, Ouachita, and Marathon Mountains were stilled. Weathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away.\n\nBy the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain. It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic Era that the distinctive topography of the present formed. Uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures. The ridges of the Appalachian Mountain core represent erosion-resistant rock that remained after the rock above and beside it was eroded away.\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains span across five geologic provinces (as defined by the USGS): the Appalachian Basin, the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Piedmont Province, the Adirondack Province, and the New England Province.\n\nThe Appalachian Basin is a foreland basin containing Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of Early Cambrian through Early Permian age. From north to south, the Appalachian Basin Province crosses New York, Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, West Virginia, western Maryland, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, northwestern Georgia, and northeastern Alabama. The northern end of the Appalachian Basin extends offshore into Lakes Erie and Ontario as far as the United States–Canada border. The Appalachian Basin province covers an area of about . The province is long from northeast to southwest and between wide from northwest to southeast.\n\nThe northwestern flank of the basin is a broad homocline that dips gently southeastward off the Cincinnati Arch. A complexly thrust faulted and folded terrane (Appalachian Fold and Thrust Belt or Eastern Overthrust Belt), formed at the end of the Paleozoic by the Alleghenian orogeny, characterizes the eastern flank of the basin. Metamorphic and igneous rocks of the Blue Ridge Thrust Belt that bounds the eastern part of the Appalachian Basin Province were thrust westward more than over lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.\n\nThe Appalachian Basin is one of the most important coal producing regions in the US and one of the biggest in the world. Appalachian Basin bituminous coal has been mined throughout the last three centuries. Currently, the coal primarily is used within the eastern U.S. for electrical power generation, but some of it is suitable for metallurgical uses. Economically important coal beds were deposited primarily during Pennsylvanian time in a southeastward-thickening foreland basin. Coal and associated rocks form a clastic wedge that\nthickens from north to south, from Pennsylvania into southeast West Virginia and southwestern Virginia.\n\nThe Appalachian Basin has had a long history of oil and gas production. Discovery of oil in 1859 in the Drake Well, Venango County, Pennsylvania, marked the beginning of the oil and gas industry in the Appalachian Basin. The discovery well opened a prolific trend of oil and gas fields, producing from Upper Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs, that extends from southern New York, across western Pennsylvania, central West Virginia, and eastern Ohio, to eastern Kentucky.\n\nA second major trend of oil and gas production in the Appalachian Basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in Lower Silurian Clinton sandstone reservoirs in Knox County, Ohio. By the late 1880s and early 1900s, the trend extended both north and south across east-central Ohio and included several counties in western New York where gas was discovered in Lower Silurian Medina Group sandstones. About 1900, large oil reserves were discovered in Silurian and Devonian carbonate reservoirs in east-central Kentucky. Important gas discoveries from the Lower Devonian Oriskany Sandstone in Cambridge County, Ohio, in 1924, Schuyler County, New York, in 1930, and Kanawha County, West Virginia, in 1936 opened a major gas-producing trend across parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia.\n\nAnother drilling boom in the Appalachian Basin occurred in the 1960s in Morrow County, Ohio, where oil was discovered in the Upper Cambrian part of the Knox Dolomite.\n\nThe Blue Ridge, Piedmont, Adirondack, and New England Provinces are collectively known as the Crystalline Appalachians, because they consist of Precambrian and Cambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks.\n\nThe Blue Ridge Thrust Belt Province underlies parts of eight states from central Alabama to southern Pennsylvania. Along its western margin, the Blue Ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the Appalachian basin, so that a broad segment of Paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles, buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets. At the surface, the Blue Ridge consists of a mountainous to hilly region, the main component of which are the Blue Ridge Mountains that extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Surface rocks consist mainly of a core of moderate-to high-rank crystalline metamorphic or igneous rocks, which, because of their superior resistance to weathering and erosion, commonly rise above the adjacent areas of low-grade metamorphic and sedimentary rock. The province is bounded on the north and west by the Paleozoic strata of the Appalachian Basin Province and on the south by Cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is bounded on the east by metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the Piedmont Province.\n\nThe Adirondack and New England Provinces include sedimentary, metasedimentary, and plutonic igneous rocks, mainly of Cambrian and Ordovician age, similar lithologically to rocks in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont Provinces to the south. The uplifted, nearly circular Adirondack Mountains consist of a core of ancient Precambrian rocks that are surrounded by upturned Cambrian and Ordovician sedimentary rocks.\n\n"}

{"id": "3210667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3210667", "title": "Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda", "text": "Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda\n\nHamilton Harbour is a natural harbour in Bermuda which serves as the port for the capital, the City of Hamilton. It is an arm of the Great Sound, and forms a tapering wedge shape of water between Paget Parish and the peninsula which forms Pembroke Parish, and upon which the capital sits.\n\nThe approaches to the harbour are protected by a chain of islands (notably Hinson's, Marshall's, Long, and Hawkins), and by the small Salt Kettle Peninsula. Another island sits inside the Harbour itself, White's Island. The eastern end of the Harbour, the narrow corner of an isosceles triangle, is a small mangrove grown bay used for mooring smaller pleasure boats.\n\nThe name \"Hamilton Harbour\" is taken from the City of Hamilton, itself named for the Governor of Bermuda at the time of its 1793 founding, Sir Henry Hamilton. Prior to this, the harbour was known as \"Paget's Port\", taking its name from the parish of Paget to its south (the parish having been named for William Paget, 4th Baron Paget de Beaudesert).\n\nAlthough superior in many ways to St. George's Harbour at the east of the archipelago, no easy route of access to Hamilton Harbour for large vessels, from the open ocean through the reefline which surrounded Bermuda, was known until \"the narrows\" was located by a Royal Naval hydrographer who spent twelve years charting Bermuda's reefs following US independence. The reason for the Royal Navy's effort was its development of Bermuda as a major naval base, to replace the bases lost along the US Atlantic Seaboard when those colonies seceded. Although it initially began operating out of Convict Bay in St. George's Harbour, the Navy began buying up land at the West End of Bermuda with a view to establishing what would become the Royal Naval Dockyard. It also bought up most of the smaller islands in the Great Sound, including those in Hamilton Harbour. Its plans for the development of the base were stymied, however, 'til it could discover a route by which its warships could reach the Great Sound. When it discovered this, allowing naval operations to begin to be transferred to the West End, it also opened the Great Sound and Hamilton Harbour for access by merchant shipping, accelerating the development of the port of Hamilton, and of the central parishes, to the point that by 1815 Hamilton was clearly a more important town than St. George's, and the capital of Bermuda was relocated there.\nHamilton has remained Bermuda's primary port ever since. Despite dredging of the narrow channels into St. George's Harbour, the largest merchant vessels which visit the island are unable to enter it (many cruise ship operators have preferred in recent decades not to enter it, as Hamilton was seen as a more lucrative destination). The port of Hamilton includes Bermuda's primary freight docks and cruise ship docks along Front Street in Hamilton, as well as yacht marinas in Hamilton, Pembroke, and Paget. Although very large vessels, such as the ships delivering cars and other motor vehicles from factories in Asia, call at Hamilton, recent years have seen an increase in the size of the cruise ships which visit Bermuda to the point that none can fit through the channel into Hamilton Harbour (in past, only the very largest ocean liners, like the QE2 and the Canberra, were unable to enter, being forced to use an anchorage beyond the Great Sound). Today, most cruise ships must moor at the former Royal Naval Dockyard, their passengers using tenders and ferries to reach Hamilton. Despite the suggestion of removing White's Island in order to widen the accessway into Hamilton Harbour, current plans of the Corporation of Hamilton (the municipal government of the City of Hamilton), call for the redevelopment of its docklands for other uses. Even the freight docks may be relocated, though the Corporation of Hamilton earns considerable revenue from them. Even as the commercial applications of the port of Hamilton have dwindled, the use of the Harbour for marinas and pleasure craft has increased in recent years, with both the Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club and the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club having greatly expanded their marinas, and with a new, commercially-operated marina having been developed on Pitt's Bay Road.\n\n"}

{"id": "1090611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090611", "title": "Irish grid reference system", "text": "Irish grid reference system\n\nThe Irish grid reference system is a system of geographic grid references used for paper mapping in Ireland (both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). The Irish grid partially overlaps the British grid, and uses a similar co-ordinate system but with a meridian more suited to its westerly location.\n\nIn general, neither Ireland nor Great Britain uses latitude or longitude in describing internal geographic locations. Instead grid reference systems are used for mapping.\n\nThe national grid referencing system was devised by the Ordnance Survey, and is heavily used in their survey data, and in maps (whether published by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland or commercial map producers) based on those surveys. Additionally grid references are commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books or government planning documents.\nIn 2001, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland jointly implemented a new coordinate system for Ireland called Irish Transverse Mercator, or ITM, a location-specific optimisation of UTM], which runs in parallel with the existing Irish grid system. In both systems, the true origin is at 53° 30' N, 8° W — a point in Lough Ree, close to the western (Co. Roscommon) shore, whose grid reference is N 000 500. This system is used for high accuracy professional digital mapping and surveying.\n\nThe area of Ireland is divided into 25 squares, measuring , each identified by a single letter. The squares are numbered A to Z with I being omitted. Seven of the squares do not actually cover any land in Ireland: A, E, K, P, U, Y and Z.\n\nWithin each square, eastings and northings from the origin (south west corner) of the square are given numerically. For example, G0305 means 'square G, east, north'. A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a square) through to five (for a ) square; the most common usage is the \"six figure grid reference\", employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a square.\n\nCoordinates may also be given relative to the origin of the entire grid (in the format easting, northing). For example, the location of the Spire of Dublin on O'Connell Street may be given as 315904, 234671 as well as O1590434671. Coordinates in this format must never be truncated, because, for example, 31590, 23467 is also a valid location.\n\n"}

There is a core group of ten endemics that have evolved on the remote island in the eastern Indian Ocean for thousands of years, attended by a suite of regular migrants, opportunists and occasional visitors. Some 200 km from the nearest land, Java, Christmas Island was not occupied by humans until the late 19th century. It is now an Australian territory. The natural vegetation of most of the 140 km² island is rainforest, to which the endemic landbirds are adapted, while the seabirds have taken advantage of a breeding location which had no major natural predators.\n\nAfter over a century of human exploitation of the phosphate deposits covering much of the island, two thirds of the rainforest cover remains and is now protected as a national park. However, gaps where the forest has been cleared, and the introduction of exotic fauna, continue to destabilise the island’s biological diversity. The endemic Abbott's booby is threatened when nesting by wind turbulence caused by past forest clearance. However, the biggest immediate threat is the introduction and spread of yellow crazy ants, through both direct predation and ecosystem collapse. This has led to all the island’s endemic bird species and subspecies being classified as Critically Endangered.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of species recorded from Christmas Island continues to increase as birders, especially from Australia, attracted by the island’s endemics, record a variety of vagrants previously unnoticed.

Such systems are composed of an integrated array of time synchronised navigation sensors and imaging sensors mounted on a mobile platform. The primary output from such systems include GIS data, digital maps, and georeferenced images and video.\n\nThe development of direct reading georeferencing technologies opened the way for mobile mapping systems. GPS and Inertial Navigation Systems, have allowed rapid and accurate determination of position and attitude of remote sensing equipment, effectively leading to direct mapping of features of interest without the need for complex post-processing of observed data.\n\nTraditional techniques of geo-referencing aerial photography, ground profiling radar, or Lidar are prohibitively expensive, particularly in inaccessible areas, or where the type of data collected makes interpretation of individual features difficult. Image direct georeferencing, simplifies the mapping control for large scale mapping tasks.\n\nMobile mapping systems allow rapid collection of data to allow accurate assessment of conditions on the ground.\n\nInternet, and mobile device users, are increasingly utilising geo-spatial information, either in the form of mapping, or geo-referenced imaging. Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have adapted both aerial photographs and satellite images to develop online mapping systems. \"Street View\" type images are also an increasing market.\n\nLocation aware PDA systems rely on geo-referenced features collated from mobile mapping sources.\n\nGPS combined with digital camera systems allow rapid update of road maps.\nThe same system can be utilised to carry out efficient road condition surveys, and facilities management.

He is noted for his contributions to the exploration of Australia, particularly the Snowy Mountains and Tasmania as well as climbing and naming the highest mountain on the continent – Mount Kosciuszko (2,228 m).\nStrzelecki was born in 1797, in Glausche, Kingdom of Prussia (today the town is called Głuszyna, part of Nowe Miasto, Poznań, Poland), the third child of Franciszek Strzelecki, a Polish nobleman (szlachcic) leasing land, and his wife, Anna Raczyńska. In Australia, Strzelecki was called a \"Count\", though there is no proof that he actually approved or used such a title himself. \n\nStrzelecki served shortly in the Prussian Army in the 6th Regiment of Thuringischen Uhlans, at the time known as Polish Regiment because so many Poles served on the staff. However, the stiff Prussian drill did not agree with his character and he submitted his resignation and returned home. There are some suggestions that he deserted the Regiment but in the official history of the Regiment the name Strzelecki does not appear. Not long after, he became a tutor at the manor of local nobility. He fell in love with his young student, a girl of 15, Adyna Turno, but was rejected as a suitor by her father, Adam Turno. There are stories that Strzelecki attempted unsuccessfully to elope with Adyna, but biographers find this unlikely. Adyna and Strzelecki exchanged letters over 40 years but they never married. Strzelecki, provided with funds by his family, travelled in Austria and Italy. He eventually came under the notice of Prince Sapieha, who placed him in charge of a large estate in the Russian-occupied part of Poland. Strzelecki was then about 26 years of age and carried out his duties very successfully. Some years later the prince died, and a dispute arose between his son and heir, Eustace, and Strzelecki. Eustace refused to pay Strzelecki the prince's bequest – a huge sum of money and a considerable estate – accusing him of bad faith and prevarication. After four years the dispute was settled. Strzelecki left Poland about 1829 and stayed some time in France, from where he travelled to Africa.\n\nOn 8 June 1834, he sailed from Liverpool to New York. He travelled widely in North and South America, Cuba, Tahiti and the South Sea Islands, and went to New Zealand probably about the beginning of 1839.\n\nHe arrived at Sydney on 25 April 1839. He visited the estate of his friend James Macarthur at Camden. He wrote about meeting the German vintners that the Macarthurs had brought to Australia from the Rheingau region. He wrote: \"I had gone with my host to look at the farm, the fields, and the vineyard, — contiguous to which last stood in a row six neat cottages, surrounded with kitchen gardens, and inhabited by six families of German vine-dressers, who emigrated two years ago to New South Wales, either driven there by necessity, or seduced by the hope of finding, beyond the sea, fortune, peace, and happiness, – perhaps justice and liberty. The German salutation which I gave to the group that stood nearest, was like some signal-bell, which instantly set the whole colony in motion. Fathers, mothers, and children came running from all sides to see, to salute, and to talk to the gentleman who came from Germany. They took me for their fellow-countryman, and were happy, questioning me about Germany, the Rhine, and their native town. I was far from undeceiving them.\" At the request of the Governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps, he made a geological and mineralogical survey of the Gippsland region in present-day eastern Victoria, where he made many discoveries. He discovered gold in 1839, but Gipps feared the effects of gold on the colony and persuaded Strzelecki to keep his discovery secret.\n\nLater in 1839 Strzelecki set out on an expedition into the Australian Alps and explored the Snowy Mountains with James Macarthur, James Riley and two Aboriginal guides: Charlie Tarra and Jackey. In 1840 he climbed the highest peak on mainland Australia and named it Mount Kosciuszko, to honour Tadeusz Kościuszko, one of the national heroes of Poland and a hero of the American Revolutionary War. On Victorian maps (but never on New South Wales maps) the name Mount Kosciusko was erroneously connected to the neighbouring peak, at present known as Mount Townsend and causing later many confusions, including the recent incorrect information on swapping the names of the mountains.\n\nFrom there Strzelecki made a journey through Gippsland. After passing the La Trobe River it was found necessary to abandon the horses and all the specimens that had been collected and try to reach Western Port. For 22 days they were on the edge of starvation and were ultimately saved by the knowledge and hunting ability of their guide Charlie, who caught native animals for them to eat. The party, practically exhausted, arrived at Western Port on 12 May 1840 and reached Melbourne on 28 May.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1842, based in Launceston, Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land), Strzelecki explored nearly every part of the island, usually on foot with three men and two pack horses. The Lieutenant-Governor, Sir John Franklin, and his wife, Lady Jane, afforded him every help in his scientific endeavours.\n\nStrzelecki left Tasmania on 29 September 1842 by steamer and arrived in Sydney on 2 October. He was collecting specimens in northern New South Wales towards the end of that year, and on 22 April 1843, he left Sydney after having travelled through New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, examining the geology along the way. He went to England after visiting China, the East Indies and Egypt. In 1845 he published his \"Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land\" which was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in May 1846.\n\nIn 1845 he became a naturalised British subject.\n\nTowards the end of 1846, the Great Irish Famine was underway and the British Relief Association formed with the sum of £500,000 subscribed for the relief of the sufferers. Strzelecki was appointed an agent of the Association to superintend the distribution of supplies in County Sligo, County Mayo and County Donegal. He devoted himself to his task with success, though he was for a time incapacitated by famine fever. In 1847 and 1848 he continued his work in Dublin as sole agent for the Association. In recognition of his services, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1848. He helped impoverished Irish families to seek new lives in Australia. It has been estimated that the various works in which he was involved saved 200,000 Irish lives. (There is a commemorative plaque dedicated to him on Sackville Place, Dublin). He was also active in helping injured soldiers during the Crimean War, being personally acquainted with Florence Nightingale.\n\nStrzelecki arrived back to London in 1849, where he was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was awarded its gold medal for \"exploration in the south eastern portion of Australia\". The Society still displays his huge geological map of New South Wales and Tasmania for public viewing. He was also made a fellow of the Royal Society, having gained widespread recognition as an explorer as well as a philanthropist.\n\nStrzelecki died of liver cancer in London in 1873 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. In 1997 his remains were transferred to the crypt of merit of St. Wojciech Church in his hometown of Poznań, Poland.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Oxford, appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1869.\n\nIn 1983 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post.\n\nIn Australia\n\nIn Canada\n\n\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "86772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86772", "title": "Réunion", "text": "Réunion\n\nRéunion (, ; previously \"Île Bourbon\") is an overseas department and region of France and an island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and southwest of Mauritius. , it had a population of 865,826. It has the highest per capita GDP in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe island has been inhabited since the 16th century, when people from France and Madagascar settled there. Slavery was abolished on 20 December 1848 (a date celebrated yearly on the island), after which indentured workers were brought from South India, among other places. The island became an overseas department of France in 1946.\n\nAs in France, the official language is French. In addition, the majority of the region's population speaks Réunion Creole.\n\nAdministratively, Réunion is one of the overseas departments of France. Like the other four overseas departments, it is also one of the 18 regions of France, with the modified status of overseas region, and an integral part of the republic with the same status as Metropolitan France. Réunion is an outermost region of the European Union and, as an overseas department of France, part of the Eurozone.\n\nNot much is known of Réunion's history prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the early 16th century. Arab traders were familiar with it by the name \"Dina Morgabin\". The island is possibly featured on a map from 1153 AD by Al Sharif el-Edrisi. The island might also have been visited by Swahili or Austronesian (Ancient Indonesian–Malaysian) sailors on their journey to the west from the Malay Archipelago to Madagascar.\n\nThe first European discovery of the area was made around 1507 by Portuguese explorer Diogo Fernandes Pereira, but the specifics are unclear. The uninhabited island might have been first sighted by the expedition led by Dom Pedro Mascarenhas, who gave his name to the island group around Réunion, the Mascarenes. Réunion itself was dubbed \"Santa Apolónia\" after a favourite saint, which suggests that the date of the Portuguese discovery could have been 9 February, her saint day. Diogo Lopes de Sequeira is said to have landed on the islands of Réunion and Rodrigues in 1509.\n\nBy the early 1600s, nominal Portuguese rule had left Santa Apolónia virtually untouched. The island was then occupied by France and administered from Port Louis, Mauritius. Although the first French claims date from 1638, when François Cauche and Salomon Goubert visited in June 1638, the island was officially claimed by Jacques Pronis of France in 1642, when he deported a dozen French mutineers to the island from Madagascar. The convicts were returned to France several years later, and in 1649, the island was named Île Bourbon after the French royal House of Bourbon. Colonisation started in 1665, when the French East India Company sent the first settlers.\n\"Île de la Réunion\" was the name given to the island in 1793 by a decree of the Convention Nationale (the elected revolutionary constituent assembly) with the fall of the House of Bourbon in France, and the name commemorates the union of revolutionaries from Marseille with the National Guard in Paris, which took place on 10 August 1792. In 1801, the island was renamed \"Île Bonaparte\", after First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. During the Napoleonic Wars, the island was invaded by a Royal Navy squadron led by Commodore Josias Rowley in 1810, who used the old name of \"Bourbon\". When it was restored to France by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the island retained the name of \"Bourbon\" until the fall of the restored Bourbons during the French Revolution of 1848, when the island was once again given the name \"Île de la Réunion\".\n\nFrom the 17th to 19th centuries, French colonisation, supplemented by importing Africans, Chinese and Indians as workers, contributed to ethnic diversity in the population. From 1690, most of the non-Europeans were enslaved. The colony abolished slavery on 20 December 1848. Afterwards, many of the foreign workers came as indentured workers. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 reduced the importance of the island as a stopover on the East Indies trade route.\nDuring the Second World War, Réunion was under the authority of the Vichy regime until 30 November 1942, when Free French forces took over the island with the destroyer \"Léopard\".\n\nRéunion became a \"département d'outre-mer\" (overseas département) of France on 19 March 1946. INSEE assigned to Réunion the department code 974, and the region code 04 when regional councils were created in 1982 in France, including in existing overseas departments which also became overseas regions.\n\nOver about two decades in the late 20th century (1963–1982), 1,630 children from Réunion were relocated to rural areas of metropolitan France, particularly to Creuse, ostensibly for education and work opportunities. That program was led by influential Gaullist politician Michel Debré, who was an MP for Réunion at the time. Many of these children were abused or disadvantaged by the families with whom they were placed. Known as the Children of Creuse, they and their fate came to light in 2002 when one of them, Jean-Jacques Martial, filed suit against the French state for kidnapping and deportation of a minor. Other similar lawsuits were filed over the following years, but all were dismissed by French courts and finally by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Réunion was hit by a crippling epidemic of chikungunya, a disease spread by mosquitoes. According to the BBC News, 255,000 people on Réunion had contracted the disease as of 26 April 2006. The neighbouring islands of Mauritius and Madagascar also suffered epidemics of this disease during the same year. A few cases also appeared in mainland France, carried by people travelling by airline. The French government of Dominique de Villepin sent an emergency aid package worth €36 million and deployed about 500 troops in an effort to eradicate mosquitoes on the island.\n\nRéunion sends seven deputies to the French National Assembly and three senators to the Senate.\n\nAdministratively, Réunion is divided into 24 \"communes\" (municipalities) grouped into four \"arrondissements\". It is also subdivided into 49 cantons, meaningful only for electoral purposes at the departmental or regional level. It is a French overseas department, hence a French overseas region. The low number of \"communes\", compared with French metropolitan departments of similar size and population, is unique: most of its \"communes\" encompass several localities, sometimes separated by significant distances.\n\nThe \"communes\" voluntarily grouped themselves into five intercommunalities for cooperating in some domains, apart from the four\" arrondissements\" to which they belong for purposes of applying national laws and executive regulation. After some changes in the composition, name and status of intercommunalities, all of them operate with the status of agglomeration communities, and apply their own local taxation (in addition to national, regional, departmental, and municipal taxes) and have an autonomous budget decided by the assembly representing all member communes. This budget is also partly funded by the state, the region, the department, and the European Union for some development and investment programs. Every \"commune\" in Réunion is now a member of an intercommunality with its own taxation, to which member communes have delegated their authority in various areas.\n\nAlthough diplomacy, military, and French government matters are handled by Paris, Réunion is a member of La Francophonie, the Indian Ocean Commission, the International Trade Union Confederation, the Universal Postal Union, the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the World Federation of Trade Unions in its own right.\n\nThe island is long; wide; and covers . It is above a hotspot in the Earth's crust. The Piton de la Fournaise, a shield volcano on the eastern end of Réunion Island, rises more than above sea level and is sometimes called a sister to Hawaiian volcanoes because of the similarity of climate and volcanic nature. It has erupted more than 100 times since 1640, and is under constant monitoring, most recently erupting on 14 July 2017. During another eruption in April 2007, the lava flow was estimated at per day. The hotspot that fuels Piton de la Fournaise also created the islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues.\n\nThe Piton des Neiges volcano, the highest point on the island at above sea level, is northwest of the Piton de la Fournaise. Collapsed calderas and canyons are south west of the mountain. While the Piton de la Fournaise is one of Earth's most active volcanoes, the Piton des Neiges is extinct. Its name means \"peak of snows\" in French, but snowfall on the summit of the mountain is rare. The slopes of both volcanoes are heavily forested. Cultivated land and cities like the capital city of Saint-Denis are concentrated on the surrounding coastal lowlands. Offshore, part of the west coast is characterised by a coral reef system. Réunion also has three calderas: the Cirque de Salazie, the Cirque de Cilaos and the Cirque de Mafate. The last is accessible only on foot or by helicopter.\n\nThe climate in Réunion is tropical, but temperature moderates with elevation. The weather is cool and dry from May to November, but hot and rainy from November to April. Precipitation levels vary greatly within the island, with the east being much wetter than the west. More than 6m of rain a year fall on some parts of the east and less than 1m a year falls on the west coast. Réunion holds the world records for the most rainfall in 12-, 24-, 72- and 96-hour periods.\n\nRéunion hosts many tropical and unique beaches. They are often equipped with barbecues, amenities, and parking spaces. Hermitage Beach is the most extensive and best preserved lagoon in Réunion Island and a popular snorkelling location. It is a white sand beach lined with casuarina trees under which the locals often organise picnics. La Plage des Brisants is a well-known surfing spot, with many athletic and leisurely activities taking place. Each November, a film festival is also organised in La Plage des Brisants. Movies are projected on a large screen in front of a crowd. Beaches at Boucan are surrounded by a stretch of restaurants that particularly cater to tourists. L’Etang-Salé on the west coast is a particularly unique beach as it is covered in black sand consisting of tiny fragments of basalt. This occurs when lava contacts water, it cools rapidly and shatters into sand and fragmented debris of various size. Much of the debris is small enough to be considered sand. Grand Anse is a tropical white-sand beach lined with coconut trees in the south of Réunion, with a rock pool built for swimmers, a pétanque playground, and a picnic area.\n\nSince 2010, Réunion is home to a UNESCO World Heritage Site that covers about 40% of the island's area and coincides with the central zone of the Réunion National Park.\n\nRéunion is home to a variety of birds such as the white-tailed tropicbird (). Its largest land animal is the panther chameleon, \"Furcifer pardalis.\" Much of the west coast is ringed by coral reef which harbours, among other animals, sea urchins, conger eels, and parrot fish. Sea turtles and dolphins also inhabit the coastal waters. Humpback whales migrate north to the island from the Antarctic waters annually during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June–September) to breed and feed, and can be routinely observed from the shores of Réunion during this season. At least 19 species formerly endemic to Réunion have become extinct following human colonisation. For example, the Réunion giant tortoise became extinct after being slaughtered in vast numbers by sailors and settlers of the island.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2017, 23 shark attacks occurred in the waters of Réunion, of which nine were fatal. In July 2013, the Prefect of Réunion Michel Lalande announced a ban on swimming, surfing, and bodyboarding off more than half of the coast. Lalande also said 45 bull sharks and 45 tiger sharks would be culled, in addition to the 20 already killed as part of scientific research into the illness ciguatera.\n\nMigrations of humpback whales contributed to a boom of whale watching industries on Réunion, and watching rules have been governed by the and .\n\nThe first members of the \"Bourbon\" group of garden roses originated on this island (then still Île Bourbon, hence the name) from a spontaneous hybridisation between Damask roses and \"Rosa chinensis\", which had been brought there by the colonists. The first Bourbon roses were discovered on the island in 1817.\n\nEthnic groups present include people of African, Indian, European, Malagasy and Chinese origin. Local names for these are Yabs, Cafres, Malbars and Chinois. All of the ethnic groups comprising the island are immigrant populations that have come to Réunion from Europe, Asia and Africa over the centuries. There are no indigenous people on the island, as it was originally deserted. These populations have mixed from the earliest days of the island's colonial history (the first settlers married women from Madagascar and of Indo-Portuguese heritage), resulting in a majority population of mixed race and of \"Creole\" culture.\n\nHow many people of each ethnicity live in Réunion is not known exactly, since the French census does not ask questions about ethnic origin, which applies in Réunion because it is a part of the 1958 constitution, and also because of the extent of racial mixing on the island. According to estimates, Whites (\"petits blancs\" and \"gros blancs\") make up roughly one quarter of the population, Malbars make up more than 25% of the population and people of Chinese ancestry form roughly 3%. The percentages for mixed race people and those of Afro-Malagasy origins vary widely in estimates. Also, some people of Vietnamese ancestry live on the island, though they are very few in number.\n\nTamils are the largest group among the Indian community. The island's community of Muslims from north western India, particularly Gujarat, and elsewhere is commonly referred to as \"zarabes\".\nCreoles (a name given to those born on the island, regardless of ethnic origins) make up the majority of the population. Groups that are not Creole include people recently arrived from Metropolitan France (known as \"zoreilles\") and those from Mayotte and the Comoros.\n\nThe predominant religion is Christianity, notably Roman Catholicism, with a single (Latin Rite) jurisdiction, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Denis-de-La Réunion. Religious Intelligence estimates Christians to be 84.9% of the population, followed by Hindus (6.7%) and Muslims (2.2%). Chinese folk religion and Buddhism are also represented, among others.\n\nMost large towns have a Hindu temple and a mosque.\n\nRéunionese culture is a blend (\"métissage\") of European, African, Indian, Chinese and insular traditions. The most widely spoken language, Réunion Creole, derives from French.\n\nFrench is the only official language of Réunion. Although not official, Réunion Creole is the native language of a large part of the population and is spoken alongside French. Creole is used informally and orally in some administration offices whereas the official language of any administration office as well as education is French.\n\nBecause of the diverse population, other languages are also spoken such as Comorian language varieties (especially Shimaore), Malagasy by recent immigrants from Mayotte and Madagascar, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese by members of the Chinese community, but fewer people speak these languages as younger generations start to converse in French and Réunion Creole. There are significant number of speakers of Indian languages mostly Tamil, Gujarati and Urdu. Arabic is taught in mosques and spoken by a small community of Muslims. English is a compulsory second language as part of the French school curriculum, but as in mainland France, English fluency is rare. German and Spanish are offered as a third language. Cantonese, Arabic, Tamil is also taught as an optional language in some schools.\n\nThere are two music genres which originated in Réunion: sega, which originated earlier and is also traditional in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles and maloya, which originated in the 19th century and is only found in Réunion.\n\nMoringue is a popular combat/dance sport similar to capoeira.\n\nThere are several famous Réunionese sportsmen and women like the handballer Jackson Richardson, as well as the karateka Lucie Ignace.\n\nProfessional footballers include Dimitri Payet, Florent Sinama Pongolle and Guillaume Hoarau. Laurent Robert and ex-Hibernian and Celtic player Didier Agathe have also featured in movies. Agathe appeared in A Shot at Glory, whilst Robert was in \"Goal!\".\n\nRéunion has a number of contributions to worldwide professional surfing. It has been home to notable pro surfers including Jeremy Flores, Johanne Defay and Justine Mauvin. Famous break St Leu has been host to several world surfing championship competitions.\n\nSince 1992, Réunion has hosted a number of ultramarathons under the umbrella name of the Grand Raid. As of 2018, four different races compose the Grand Raid: the Diagonale des Fous, The Trail de Bourbon, the Mascareignes, and the Zembrocal Trail.\n\nRéunion has a local public television channel, Réunion 1ère, which now forms part of France Télévision, and also receives France 2, France 3, France 4, France 5 and France 24 from metropolitan France, as well as France Ô, which shows programming from all of the overseas departments and territories. There are also two local private channels, Télé Kréol and Antenne Réunion.\n\nIt has a local public radio station, formerly Radio Réunion, but now known as Réunion 1ère, like its television counterpart. It also receives the Radio France networks France Inter, France Musique and France Culture. The first private local radio station, Radio Freedom, was introduced in 1981. They broadcast daily content about weather and local services.\n\nTwo main newspapers:\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the GDP of Réunion was estimated at 19.2 billion euros (US$21.3 bn) and the GDP per capita was 22,400 euros (US$24,800). Sugar was traditionally the chief agricultural product and export. Tourism is now an important source of income. The island's remote location combined with its stable political alignment with Europe makes it a key location for satellite receiving stations and naval navigation.\n\nGDP sector composition in 2013 (contribution of each sector to the total gross value added):\nUnemployment is a major problem on Réunion, although the situation has improved markedly since the beginning of the 2000s: the unemployment rate, which stood above 30% from the early 1980s to the early 2000s, declined to 24.1% in 2007, then rebounded to 29.6% in 2011 due to the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession, but has since 2011 again declined, reaching 22.4% in 2016, its lowest level in 40 years. In 2014, 40% of the population lived below the poverty line (defined by INSEE as 60% of Metropolitan France's median income; in 2014 the poverty line for a family of 2 parents and 2 young children was €2,064 (US$ 2,743) per month).\n\nRum distillation is a sugar-based process that contributes to the island's economy. A \"Product of France\", it is shipped to Europe for bottling, then shipped to consumers around the world.\n\nIn 2005–2006, Réunion experienced an epidemic of chikungunya, a viral disease similar to dengue fever brought in from East Africa, which infected almost a third of the population because of its transmission through mosquitoes. The epidemic has since been eradicated. See the History section for more details.\n\nRoland Garros Airport serves the island, handling flights to mainland France, India, Madagascar, Mauritius, Tanzania, Comoros, Seychelles, South Africa, China and Thailand. Pierrefonds Airport, a smaller airport, has some flights to Mauritius and Madagascar.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Telogis sold software as a service (SaaS) which incorporated location information into applications for fleet owners as well as geospatial software development toolkits.\n\nIn 2016 Telogis was aquired by Verizon Connect.\n\nTelogis was founded in 2001 by Howard Jelinek, Newth Morris and Ralph Mason, as a trunked radio hardware and software provider. Former Novell Inc. Chairman and CEO Jack Messman is chairman of the board of directors. The company was started with investments from its founders, and by 2012 the privately held company had approximately $69 million in revenue. \n\n\"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Don Clark stated of the company's technology that, \"Telogis exploited the evolution of software-as-a-service–placing data from vehicles in the cloud ... so that companies that own vehicle fleets can track their cars and trucks without the need to set up their own servers for the purpose.\" In July 2010 Telogis acquired the assets of Remote Dynamics, then in February, 2011 Telogis acquired the assets of Intergis, a provider of routing, mobile resource and fleet management software for approximately 2,000 small to mid-sized business fleets. In July 2012 Telogis acquired Navtrak. The acquisition resulted in Telogis Navigation, commercial navigation software that gives professional drivers built-in feedback systems to provide up-to-date road network information.\n\nThe company's first outside venture capital was announced in October 2013, with $93 million from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In February 2011 private investors provided $2.9 million. Additional funding was received from GM Ventures in 2014.\n\nOn June 21, 2016, it was announced that Telogis will merge with Verizon via an acquisition. \n\nOn March 6, 2018, a press release announced that Telogis would be rebranded along with sister companies–Fleetmatics and Verizon Telematics–as Verizon Connect.\n\nTelogis software collects location-based data from embedded and installed hardware in vehicles, as well as from mobile devices. It works on over 40 different hardware platforms from 12 different manufacturers and collects an important array of data. Telogis also provides a software development kit for users to create location-based mobile and desktop applications. One of the primary functions of Telogis's software is to provide United States Federal Government mandated hours of service commercial driver activity logs.\n\nTelogis provides a built-in telematics option for several OEMs including Ford, GM, Volvo, Mack, Hino, Isuzu (United States based trucks), and Manitowoc. This allows fleet owners to opt for factory-installed telematics hardware when purchasing selected new cars and trucks. The advantages include immediate over-the-air activation when adding new vehicles to their fleet management system and additional data points such as DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) quality, water in the diesel and extra DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) across the body, powertrain and chassis. For off-highway vehicles, Telogis also works with John Deere.\n\nIn addition to the OEM built-in options, selected Freightliner trucks offer a pre-wired option that makes it simpler to add the required hardware for tracking trucks.\n\nIn October 2013 the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that trucking companies were using Telogis to monitor their drivers, using the data they received to either reward or discipline their drivers. This has led some employees to become concerned about privacy issues. Councilman Lewis Rotella of Niagara Falls, New York, stated that, \"It’s almost like big brother’s watching you ... You have to put some trust into the employees doing the job,\" in response to a 2006 contract placing Telogis devices in Niagara city vehicles. He stated further that he believed that such devices can be used to ensure safety, but should not be used for \"surreptitiously trailing employees\". Rotella also admitted to using the devices himself in his private business to monitor safety. Stephen Roy, president of Mack Trucks, another Telogis partner, also stated that the software would be used by Mack to help manage workflow and not to track the minute-by-minute decisions of its employees.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31121074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31121074", "title": "Tyrol", "text": "Tyrol\n\nTyrol (; historically the Tyrole; ; ) is a historical region in the Alps; in northern Italy and western Austria. The area was to Habsburg times the former County of Tyrol. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1919 divided the area into two parts:\n\nWith the founding of the European region Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino the area has its own legal entity since 2011 in the form of a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation.\n\nAccording to , the name \"Tyrol\" derives from a root word meaning \"terrain\" (i.e. area, ground or soil; compare and Old Irish: \"tir\"); first from the village of Tirol, and its castle; from which the County of Tyrol grew. According to Karl Finsterwalder, the name \"Tyrol\" derives from , a late-Roman fort and travellers' hostel in Zirl, Tyrol. There seems to be no scholarly consensus.\n\nTyrol has an area of 26,673 km. The region consists of the State of Tyrol, the Province of South Tyrol and the Province of Trento. In addition to the region belong the municipalities Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livinallongo del Col di Lana, Colle Santa Lucia and Pedemonte from the Region of Veneto and Valvestino and Magasa from the Region of Lombardy. The largest cities in Tyrol are Innsbruck, Trento and Bolzano.\n\nThe whole region of Tyrol is located in the Alps. Tyrol is bordered to the north by the state of Bavaria and to the east by the states of Carinthia and Salzburg. West of Tyrol lies the state of Vorarlberg and the canton of Grisons. On the southern side of Tyrol, the land is bordered by the regions of Veneto and Lombardy.\n\nImportant rivers in Tyrol are the Adige, Inn and Drau. The region is characterized by many valleys. Some of these valleys are still difficult to reach today. The most important valleys are the Inn Valley and Adige Valley. A large part of the population lives in these two valleys and also the five largest cities of Tyrol (Innsbruck, Bolzano, Trento, Merano and Rovereto) lie in these valleys. For centuries, the region has been known for transit trade. The most important trade route across the Alps, namely the Brenner Route, traverses the whole of Tyrol and is regarded as a connecting link between the Italian and German speaking areas.\n\nAs the Tyrolean region is located in the Alps, the landscape is heavily influenced by the mountains. The highest mountains in Tyrol include:\nAcross Tyrol, on the border between North and South Tyrol, runs the main chain of the Alps. The main chain of the Alps geographically divides the Alps into a southern and northern half.\n\nMunicipalities of Tyrol with over 10,000 inhabitants:\n\nAustria: 1 January 2017 \nItaly: 31 December 2016\n\nTyrol can be subdivided into 5 different language groups. In addition to the majority languages such as German and Italian, languages such as Ladin, Cimbrian and Mócheno are also spoken. The last three languages are recognized as minority languages. These language groups are mostly located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region and are thus promoted and protected by the region.\nThe Ladin language is also spoken outside the region in Souramont (Province of Belluno). Ladin is considered a Rhaeto-Romance language.\nThe Cimbrian language is also used in various linguistic islands (Sette Comuni) outside the region of Trentino-South Tyrol. The Cimbrian language is considered an upper-Bavarian dialect.\n\nIn state of Tyrol, the German language is used by a large majority. As in many other regions in German-speaking countries, Tyrol also has its own German-language dialect. The Tyrolean dialect comes from the Bavarian dialect.\nIn South Tyrol, the Tyrolean dialect was mixed with a few individual Italian words. Due to the difficult accessibility of the valleys in earlier years, many other valleys developed a slightly differentiated dialect compared to the Tyrolean. The Italian language group in South Tyrol mostly uses the Italian standard language and does not speak any dialect.\nThe Ladin language also has no uniform language, so every valley also has a slight difference in Ladinia.\nThe majority in Trentino speaks its own Italian dialect. This dialect has slightly Venetian features, mixed with words from the German-Bavarian dialect.\n\nAlthough the details of the arms of Tyrol have changed over the centuries, one feature has remained more-or-less constant: \"argent\", an eagle displayed \"gules\", armed (and sometimes crowned) \"or\". Since 1983, the Province of South Tyrol has its own coat of arms. It is very similar to the coat of arms of the State of Tyrol. The Province wanted to emphasize the historical commonality of the countries. The Province of Trento received its coat of arms in 1340 and refers to the prince-bishopric of Trento. The former County of Tyrol had a uniform coat of arms, which was slightly changed over the centuries.\n\nThe earliest archaeological records of human settlement in Tyrol have been found in the Tischofer Cave. They date from the Palaeolithic, about 28,000-27,000 BP. The same cave has also yielded evidence of human occupation during the Bronze Age (very roughly, 4000-3000 BP (2000–1000 BC)).\n\nIn 1991, the mummified remains of a man who had died around 3300-3100 BC were discovered in a glacier in the Ötztal Alps, in Tyrol. Researchers have called him Ötzi (and also other names, including \"The Iceman\"). He lived during the Chalcolithic or Copper Age, after man had learned how to exploit copper but before man had learned how to make bronze. His body and belongings were very well-preserved, and have been subjected to detailed scientific study. They are preserved in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, Bolzano, South Tyrol, Italy.\n\nThere is evidence that Tyrol was a centre for copper mining in the 4th millennium BC; for example, at Brixlegg. There is also evidence of the Urnfield culture (roughly 1300–750 BC).\n\nEvidence of the La Tène culture (roughly 450–100 BC, during the Iron Age) has also been found; as has evidence of the Fritzens-Sanzeno culture from about the same period. Towards the end of that time, Tyrol began to be noted in Roman written records. The inhabitants may have been Illyrians, in the process of being displaced by Celts (perhaps themselves displaced from Noricum by Slavs). There are also indications that Adriatic Veneti may have been present in the south of the region. The Romans called them Rhaetians; although it is not clear whether that then meant a specific tribe or confederation of tribes, or was a broader term for the inhabitants of the area. They made wine barrels (an idea which the Romans took from them), and had their own alphabet.\n\nIn 15 BC, Tyrol was conquered by Roman forces commanded by Drusus and Tiberius. The Romans established Raetia and Noricum as provinces of the Roman Empire. Raetia included Vinschgau, Burggrafenamt, Eisacktal, Wipptal, Oberinntal and parts of the Unterinntal. Noricum included Pustertal, Defereggen and parts of the Unterinntal to the right of the Ziller and the Inn. Bolzano and the extreme south of Tyrol belonged to the province of Venetia et Histria.\n\nThe inhabitants adopted vulgar Latin, and combined it with their own languages. The result was Romansh, which is still spoken today and is one of the official languages of Switzerland.\n\nThe Romans constructed metalled roads guarded by forts through Tyrol to connect the Italian peninsula and the lands beyond; notably the Via Claudia Augusta and the . The Romans did not seem to find Tyrol an attractive area in which to build new towns, because there are few of them. One town they did build was Aguntum, near modern Lienz.\n\nIn late antiquity (from AD 476), Tyrol belonged to the Ostrogoths, and it was included in the Ostrogothic Kingdom. In 534, the Ostrogoths lost Merrano, Val Venosta and Passer to the Franks. The Ostrogothic Kingdom collapsed in 553, after being overrun by from the north and Lombards from the south. The Lombards established the Duchy of Tridentum (or, Trent; roughly corresponding to modern Trentino) in south Tyrol. Slavic peoples, who had recently taken Carinthia from the Bajuvarians, settled in east Tyrol.\n\nMost of Tyrol came under the control of the Duchy of Bavaria (created ). The southern parts, including Bolzano, Salorno, and the right bank of the Adige (including Eppan and Kaltern) remained under the Lombards. Tyrol was christianised through the bishoprics of Brixen and Triento. The frontier remained the same though Carolingian and Ottonian times. The area was subject to \"Stammensgerechte\" (Ancient Germanic laws), such as \"Lex Romana Curiensis\" (see Raetia Curiensis), \"Lex Alamannorum\", \"Lex Baiuvariorum\" and \"Leges Langobardorum\".\nIn 1027, Emperor Conrad II, in order to secure the important route through the Brenner Pass, allotted the left bank of the Adige (from Lana to Mezzocorona) to the Duchy of Bavaria. During the 12th century, the local nobility went further: they built Tyrol Castle in the modern \"comune\" of Tirol in South Tyrol, near modern Merano; and around 1140, established the County of Tyrol as a state within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Counts of Tyrol were at first \"Vogt\" (underlords) subject to the Bishoprics of Brixen and Triento; but they had other ideas. They expanded their holdings at those bishoprics' expense. They displaced competing nobles like the , and declared their independence from the Duchy of Bavaria; though not without dispute. In 1228, they conceded the to the House of Wittelsbach, rulers of Bavaria; as a result, that area remains part of Bavaria to this day.\n\nIn 1253, rulership of the County passed by inheritance to the Meinhardiner family. In 1335, the last male heir to the Meinhardiner lands, Henry of Bohemia, died. His daughter, Margaret, thereupon became Countess of Tyrol; but her title was in doubt because of different laws in different lands as to what a woman could or could not inherit. She navigated her way between the competing claims of the Houses of Wittelsbach, Luxembourg and Habsburg by, in 1342, marrying Louis of Wittelsbach. Louis died in 1361. Margaret died in 1369, and bequeathed Tyrol to Rudolf of Habsburg. The various dynastic squabbles were resolved that same year by the , under which (for suitable compensation) the Wittelsbachs agreed to relinquish their claims to Tyrol in favour of the Habsburgs.\n\nWhen the Habsburgs took control of Tyrol, it had roughly its modern size. However, the Unterinntal downstream from Schwaz still belonged to Bavaria; the Zillertal and Brixental to Salzburg; Brixen and the Pustertal were episcopal territories, or part of the County of Gorizia. Therefore, the Montafon and the Unterengadin were Tyrolean.\n\nTyrol was of great strategic importance to the Habsburgs. It controlled several important Alpine passes. It connected their landholdings in Further Austria. In 1406, as the Habsburg lands were split up by inheritance, Tyrol once again became a separate entity (a \"Landstand\"), in which the greater landowners had the right to be consulted (\"Mitspracherecht\"). During a confusing succession of events, in 1420 Frederick IV, Duke of Austria moved the capital of Tyrol from Meran to Innsbruck, and Meran lost its earlier importance.\n\nThe Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino was founded in 1998. The aim is to strengthen cooperation between the separated countries. In several areas, such as mobility, agriculture, education and culture will be tried to promote exchange and to raise the awareness of the cultural and historical heritage of the region of Tyrol in the minds of the population. Cross-border projects will be initiated to improve the relationship between the different language groups.\nTo represent common ideas and values in Europe, the Euroregion has a joint office in Brussels since 1995. The headquarters of the office is in Bolzano. Joint decisions are taken by organized three diet (in German: \"Dreier-Landtag\"), which have been held since 1991 mostly every two to three years with the state Diets of Trento (provincial council of Trentino), Bolzano (provincial council of South Tyrol) and Innsbruck (state council of Tyrol (State)). In 2011, the region was institutionalized and since then has its own legal entity.\n\nPolitical parties in the Italian part of Tyrol (provinces of Bolzano and Trento) include:\n\nThe Austrian part of Tyrol shares the Austrian party system:\n\nThe multiplicity of parties is due to the fact that Tyrol lies in two different nation states and thus are politically independent of each other. Another reason for the large number of parties is the great independence of the two Provinces of Bolzano and Trento. By the second statute of autonomy in 1972, the province of Bolzano acquired much of the region's competences and since then has been mostly independent of the province of Trento. The second autonomy statute enabled the linguistic minorities to be better protected. \nThe regional council of Trentino-South Tyrol, which consists of the two provincial councils of Bolzano and Trento, has less influence and competences. Thus, many parties determine their focus within the provinces. Other parties in Trentino-South Tyrol, especially in South Tyrol, were founded on the example of Austrian parties and have many similarities with the parties in Austria.\n\nIn the economic sector statistics are shown, which are based largely on numbers and data of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino. It lacks individual communities that are outside the Euroregion. As there are no 10,000 inhabitants living in these communities, the statistics hardly distort the territory of Tyrol and the remaining 1.8 million inhabitants.\n\nTyrol had a total GDP of 67.6 billion euros in 2014. Divided into individual countries, the State of Tyrol generated 28.8 billion euros, the Province of South Tyrol 20.6 billion euros and the Province of Trentino 18.2 billion euros. In GDP per capita (2015), that means 39,300 euros/capita in the State of Tyrol, 42,400 euros/capita in South Tyrol and 35,500 euros/capita in Trentino. The unemployment rate in the State of Tyrol is 3.2% (2014), in South Tyrol 3.4% (2017) and in Trentino 4.6% (2017) .\nThe Tyrol region is one of the wealthiest regions in Europe and, in terms of GDP/capita, is above the EU average, which amounted to 28,900 euros/capita in 2015.\nThe Region of Trentino-South Tyrol is, in terms of GDP/capita, the wealthiest region in Italy with 37,813 euros/capita in 2015. \n\nAgriculture and forestry occupy a special position in Tyrol. The many small and medium-sized farms have shaped the landscape and culture in Tyrol for many centuries. In order to be competitive with larger farms outside Tyrol, there is a strong cooperative system in Tyrol.\nSouth of Tyrol, in the Region of Trentino-South Tyrol, the cultivation of apples and wine plays an important role. So every tenth apple in Europe comes from South Tyrol. Known wines in Trentino-South Tyrol are the Vernatsch, the Lagrein, the Gewürztraminer and the Weißburgunder. \nLivestock, grazing and forestry are important at higher elevations and in more northerly areas. Mainly cattle, sheep, goats and pigs are kept. Accordingly, the production of milk and Tyrolean Speck in the farms is very important. Horses also play an increasingly important role in livestock, for equestrian sports and farm holidays. The Haflinger horses are known in the Tyrolean region and originate from Hafling, near Merano. \n\nThe first industrialization reached Tyrol late in the 19th century. Most of these were small businesses that were important only in the local area. A second wave of industrialization took place at the beginning of the 20th century. Particularly affected at that time was the city of Bolzano with the Italianization policy under the fascism in the 20s. \n\nIn 2011, approximately 10% of the workplaces in all parts of the country were active in the manufacturing sector. Thus lies Tyrol in the EU average at 10.3% (2011). Important branches of industry in Tyrol are the food industry, wood processing and mechanical engineering.\nThe industry in Tyrol consists mostly of small and medium-sized companies. The craft still plays a special role throughout the region. A large part of these craft businesses are still partially small-structured and family businesses. From an economic point of view, the energy sector is important in the secondary sector. Much of the electricity produced is generated by hydropower.\n\nThe most important sector in Tyrol is the tertiary sector. Especially tourism has a special position in this region. Due to the connection of the areas by the railway in the 19th century, many villages in Tyrol developed into popular tourism locations. The construction of the Brenner motorway in the 1960s gave region in the 20th century a renewed upswing in the tourism branch. Today, Merano, Kitzbühel, Cortina or Riva del Garda are among the most important tourism destinations in the Alpine region. In 2013, the Euroregion counted over 80 million overnight stays in the Tyrolean region (to compare - Province of Rome in 2011: 25.8 million overnight stays). \n\nAlso important for Tyrol is the trade. Among other things, the Exhibition of Bolzano has been a meeting point for Italian and German economy already for centuries. As a transit route country, more than 2.25 million trucks (2017) drove over the Brenner Pass . This means that two times more trucks travel on the Brenner Route than in all four Alpine crossing roads in Switzerland together. \n\nTyrol is known as a transit route. The most important route between northern and southern Europe, the Brenner route, traverses the entire region. At 1370 m above the Adriatic, the Brenner Pass is the lowest pass crossing of the main chain of the Alps.\nDue to the linguistic diversity and the climatic transition from temperate climate (alpine climate) to mediterranean climate, the area is regarded as a bridge between the Italian and German speaking countries.\n\nThe most important airport in Tyrol is Innsbruck Airport. With over one million passengers, it is the third largest airport in Austria. Other airports in the region are in Bolzano and Trento. These do not offer regular scheduled flights and the Bolzano Airport currently offers charter flights. There are other small airfields in Toblach, Kufstein, St. Johann in Tirol, Reutte and Cortina. The airfield in Cortina was closed in 1976 due to a crash.\n\nHighways in Tyrol are the Brenner motorway and the Inntal motorway. The Brenner motorway runs from Innsbruck (in Austria A13) to Modena (in Italy A22). Together with the Inntal motorway from Innsbruck to Kufstein is the part of the European route E45. The dual carriageway from Merano to Bolzano (MeBo) ends in Bolzano South in the Brenner motorway. Important road section in Trentino, next to the Brenner motorway, is the SS 47 (Strada Statale 47), which connects via Sugana Valley Trento with Padova. A large part of this route is dual-lane and flows into the Brenner state road (SS 12).\nDue to the Alps, there are many mountain passes that connect valleys. The most important pass roads for transit trade are the Reschen Pass and Brenner Pass. Popular pass roads include the Stelvio Pass, Arlberg Pass, Karer Pass, Mendel Pass and the Gardena Pass. The Provinces of Trento and Bolzano have been responsible for the preservation and management of the state roads in their provinces since 1998. \n\nThe most important railway line in Tyrol is the Brenner Line via the Brenner Pass. The Brenner Railway was opened in 1867 and runs from Innsbruck to Verona via the cities of Bolzano and Trento. Together with the Lower Inn Valley Railway in North Tyrol, this section of the route is part of the important European railway axis Berlin-Palermo, which connects northern Europe with southern Europe across the Alps. With the construction of the Brenner Base Tunnel and its completion in 2027, transit traffic on the rail will be promoted and relocated. After completion, the Brenner Base Tunnel, together with the Innsbruck bypass, will be the longest railway tunnel in the world at 64 km and will reduce the travel time between Bolzano and Innsbruck from 2 hours to 45 minutes. \n\nFurther important railway lines in Tyrol are the Arlberg railway, Zillertal railway, Salzburg-Tyrol railway, Pustertal railway with continuation of the Drautal railway, the railway line Bolzano-Merano and the continuation of the Vinschgau railway, the Trento–Malè–Mezzana railway and the Valsugana railway, which leads from Trento to Venice over the Sugana Valley. Cross-border connections are offered only a few. The ÖBB travels over the Brenner Pass on the Eurocity trains and several regional trains connect South Tyrol with North Tyrol an East Tyrol. The Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino has set itself the goal of promoting and expanding cross-border connections. The aim is to shift traffic through the Alps to sustainable means of transport, thus protecting the Alpine environment. \n\nMany villages and communities are difficult to reach because of the large differences in altitude, so the region sets much on ropeway concepts. Although most of the cable cars are located in ski resorts, they are also used for the local public transport. Known cable cars in Tyrol are the Ritten cable car in Bolzano, the Sardagna cable car in Trento and the Nordkette cable car in Innsbruck. Also funicular railways are being built to cope with the differences in altitude more quickly. Famous funiculars are among others the Hungerburgbahn in Innsbruck and the Mendel funicular in Kaltern.\n\nLocal public transport is usually offered with intercity buses or city buses. The city of Innsbruck has its own tram network. Another tram is located in Ritten. The cities of Bolzano, Merano and Trento formerly had their own tram network, but these were displaced and replaced by the city buses and private transport in the 50s and 60s.\n\nThe Tyrolean culture has been cultivated for several centuries and passed on to future generations. The state border between South and North Tyrol is more a political border and is considered less as a cultural border. Many traditions are cultivated throughout the Tyrolean region and show little differences. In all cultural areas such as food, dress or customs there are many similarities. Nevertheless, the individual language groups, especially the minority languages, try to maintain and promote their own linguistic identity.\n\nThe Tyrolean cuisine has similarities with the Austrian cuisine and is characterized by its alpine influence. Also the historical influence of the former K.U.K. Monarchy can be found in the Tyrolean dishes. These include dishes such as goulash, Kaiserschmarrn and apple strudel which are consumed in large parts of the Danube monarchy and today still in Tyrol. Since the region is still relatively strong agricultural and peasant today, also many peasant dishes are offered on the farms. Schlutzkrapfen, boiled dumplings or cold cuts with bacon (in German: \"Speck\") is eaten on the farms. \n\nThe Tyrolean dishes show only slight differences throughout Tyrol. Due to the Mediterranean conditions in the southern part of Tyrol, a lot of wine is grown and is therefore also an important part of the Tyrolean dish, especially in South Tyrol and Trentino. Famous wines from this area are the Gewürztraminer, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay. Furthermore, a lot of apples are grown in the Region of Trentino-South Tyrol. In this region also a food culture is cultivated with a mixture of Italian and Tyrolean specialties. \n\nThe Tyrolean Rifles were a militia organised in case of an attack on crown land, which required Tyrol to defend its territory. The militia consisted mostly of citizens and peasants who were responsible only for the defence of their own land and were not obliged to go to war on behalf of the Habsburg Monarchy. They were authorised by an order signed by Emperor Maximilian I in 1511 that remained valid until 1918. The Tyrolean Rifles became known in 1809 when Tyrolese peasants rose up and fought against the French-Bavarian occupation under Napoleon. The ensuing four Battles of Bergisel were led by Andreas Hofer. The Rifles were also used in World War I in 1915 on the Dolomite front.\nAfter the separation of Tyrol and the downfall of the monarchy, the companies also lost their task of defending their country. Nevertheless, they remained as a non-governmental organization.\nToday, the Rifles are responsible as an organization for the preservation of the Tyrolean culture and are always present at important political events in Tyrol. \n\nMany Tyrolean customs were created centuries ago and are passed on by the population for the next generations. Typical in the Alpine region are the many individual customs in the valleys. Due to the seclusion of the valleys, the locals developed their own customs. Many customs have been created by legends and narratives, others by the close connection to the church. There are also traditions that are cultivated everywhere in the Tyrolean region and do not differ from other valleys and villages. These customs give local people an identity and thus feel the community more connected. \nTyrol is traditionally a winter sports country. Many athletes, such as Gustav Thoeni, Benjamin Raich, Carolina Kostner, Gregor Schlierenzauer, Toni Sailer and Armin Zoeggeler have already won overall World Cups and medals at World Championships and Olympic Games.\nEven in summer sports, several athletes from Tyrol were and still are among the best in the world. In water jumping Tania Cagnotto and Klaus Dibiasi won several medals. In cycling, Francesco Moser won the Giro d'Italia. Andreas Seppi played against the best tennis players in the world for many years. In bouldering Anna Stöhr was one of the best in the world.\nMany Tyrolean mountaineers such as Reinhold Messner and Hans Kammerlander influenced the alpinism.\n\nThe FC Wacker Innsbruck is one of the most traditional and successful clubs in Austria. Since the club was founded in 1915 and several name changes, the football club has won ten times the Austrian Championship and seven times the Austrian Cup. In 1987, it reached the semi-finals of the UEFA CUP. In 1970, the team defeated Real Madrid in Madrid. Currently (2018) Wacker Innsbruck plays in the \"Erste Liga\" (second highest category of Austria).\n\nIn the Region of Trentino-South Tyrol, the FC Südtirol and AC Trento are the two most important clubs. Both teams participated in the Italian Serie C (third highest league in Italy) for several seasons. The AC Trento has a long history until 1921. FC Südtirol was founded in 1995. AC Trento are currently (2018) playing in the Italian Serie D (fourth highest league in Italy) and FC Südtirol in Serie C. Thus, the FC Südtirol is the only professional football club in the region.\n\nIce hockey is a very popular sport in Tyrol. Important clubs are the HC Bolzano and the HC Innsbruck. Both teams play in the EBEL. The HC Innsbruck, formerly EV Innsbruck, won the Austrian championship seven times. With 19 won Italian championships, the HC Bolzano is the record champion in Italy. The club celebrated the biggest international successes by winning the Alpenliga, the EBEL and the Six Nations Tournament with Jaromír Jágr. The Italian ice hockey league consists mostly of South Tyrolean teams. 5 of the 8 Italian teams in the Alps Hockey League come from South Tyrol (HC Neumarkt-Egna, HC Pustertal, Ritten Sport, HC Gardena and WSV Sterzing Broncos). In this league three more Tyrolean teams play (SG Cortina, HC Fassa and EC Kitzbühel).\n\nIn 2005, the Ice Hockey World Championship was held in Innsbruck and Vienna. The 1994 Ice Hockey World Championship took place in Bolzano, Canazei and Milan.\n\nIn volleyball, Trentino Volley is one of the best teams in the world. Three times the Champions league title, four times the club world championship title and four times the Italian championship title could win the club from Trento. Founded in 2000, the club quickly established itself at the top of the league. In 2011, Trentino Volley won the CEV Champions League ahead of its own fans at the PalaOnda in Bolzano. \n\nHypo Tirol Innsbruck conquered the Austrian title 10 times. Of the last 13 seasons, the team won 10 times the Austrian championship. Since the season 2017/18 the club plays in the German volleyball league under the name \"Hypo Tirol Alpenvolleys Haching\". The club went into cooperation with the German team TSV Unterhaching. \n\nIn Tyrol, the Olympic Winter Games have been organized three times so far. In 1964 and 1976 they were held in Innsbruck and 1956 in Cortina.\nMost of the big annual sporting events in Tyrol take place in winter. The Alpine Skiing World Cup is held in Kitzbühel, Val Gardena, Cortina and Madonna di Campiglio. These races are classics in the Ski World Cup and have a long tradition.\nA famous biathlon location is in Antholz. There were often held the Biathlon World Championships. Several Nordic Combined World Championships were organized in Val di Fiemme. Part of the Four Hills Tournament is the Bergisel Ski Jump in Innsbruck. A stage of the Tour de Ski is also located in Toblach.\n\nSome summer sports events are also held in Tyrol. The Tour of the Alps take place every year in Tyrol. The tour was launched by the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino. It is the successor of the Giro del Trentino, which has been around for over 40 years. In 2017, the UCI Downhill World Championships took place in Val di Sole, near Trento. The BOclassic in Bolzano takes place on New Year's Eve and is one of the best occupied New Year's Eve races in the world. Every year, an ATP World Series tennis tournament is organized in Kitzbühel.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was situated on the West Siberian Plain, and at its maximum extent the lake's surface area was more than 750,000 km which is more than twice that of the present-day Caspian Sea.\n\nIt is theorized that although drainage to the Arctic Ocean basin (e.g. by the Ob and Yenisei Rivers) was prevented, the lake would eventually overflow to the Mediterranean Sea through a circuitous route that would include the Aral Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea. This would have resulted in water from the Selenga River and Lake Baikal draining over a course of some , considerably longer than any river's course today.\n\nSee Mangerud et al. (2004) for diagrams and descriptions of the lake as well as postulated drainage patterns.\n\n\n"}
