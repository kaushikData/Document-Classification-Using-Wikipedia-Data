From near Bournemouth International Airport it follows the western side of the Avon valley, joining the route of the A31 road heading north-east for to cross the valley, before turning left at Ringwood in Hampshire where it joins the original, single carriageway route to the east of the river. \n\nHeading northward up the east side of the Avon, it crosses to the west again near the town of Fordingbridge. After crossing into Wiltshire near Downton, it meets the A354 road at a roundabout near Britford on the southern outskirts of Salisbury, before joining the route of the A36 road as it bypasses the city centre to dual carriageway standard. It then joins the A30 road at St. Mark's Roundabout, before separating in a north-easterly direction to follow the entire length of the River Bourne. It has a grade-separated junction with the main A303 road and then passes through the town of Tidworth. From there the road travels north to Collingbourne Ducis, where it twists through the village around the church to a mini-roundabout. It turns right to continue northwards alongside the Bourne through another narrow stretch at Collingbourne Kingston to another mini-roundabout before again heading north. \n\nNear Burbage the continued route north to Swindon is designated A346, the A338 turning off to the right at a roundabout and heading east then north-east and crossing the border into Berkshire. It passes through the town of Hungerford, where it meets the A4 road (to Marlborough and Newbury). It meets the M4 motorway at junction 14, passes through the village of Great Shefford and crosses into Oxfordshire. It goes through Wantage where it meets the A417 road, and past the villages of Grove, East Hanney and Frilford. It terminates at its junction with the A420 road near Bessels Leigh, south-west of Oxford.\n\nThe section of the A338 south of the A31 to the west of the Avon consists mostly of a relatively newly built road. Part is constructed along the trackbed of the former Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway which closed in 1935. Originally, the A338 went from Ringwood to Christchurch on the east side of the valley, along what is now the B3347.\n\nThe Bournemouth Town Centre section of the A338 Wessex Way is carried on viaducts across the Bourne Valley. On 21 January 2010 Bournemouth Borough Council imposed a 40 mph speed limit on this section of A338 dual carriageway (between Bournemouth West Roundabout and St Paul's Roundabout) in an attempt to reduce the accident rate of 198 accidents in four years. The experimental speed limit was run for six months and provoked fierce opposition from the town's residents, with a protest group on Facebook gaining thousands of members who argued that other options such as improving the slip-road lengths should have been trialled before lowering the speed limit.\n\nIn February 2011 it was announced that £20m of funding for repair works on the stretch south of the junction with the A31 was turned down by the government. Dorset County Council had planned to start work in September 2010, but had to await funding following a Spending Review. As a result of the funding request being unsuccessful, ad hoc work will now be carried out over a number of years instead of a period of about 6 months as originally planned. Dorset and Bournemouth councils are expected to meet the cost of the ad hoc work at around £1m per year.\n\nThe section of A338 between the A31 dual carriageway at Ringwood and Salisbury's A36 Churchill Way is built on a substandard single carriageway alignment with multiple sharp bends as the road follows the line of the River Avon. This section of the road has a poor safety record; it is heavily trafficked and the resulting risky overtaking is responsible for a number of head-on collisions.\n\nFollowing four fatal head-on collision accidents in 2008 alone, local residents have renewed their calls for the road to be upgraded to dual carriageway to provide a safe overtaking facility and deal with the capacity problems.\n\nThe A338 figures in Thomas Hardy's 'Jude the Obscure', chapter 3. The point where the road crests the downs before beginning the steep drop into Wantage ('Alfredston') is the spot where young Jude stands one evening and looks out for the first time on Oxford ('Christminster').\n\n"}

As described in 2013 by Mike Lofgren, a former Republican U.S. congressional aide, the deep state is “a hybrid association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process.” <ref name=\"Lofgren_2/21/2014\"></ref> The term is often used in a critical sense \"vis-à-vis\" the general electorate to refer to the lack of influence popular democracy has on these institutions and the decisions they make as a shadow government. An April 2017 poll documented that 48% of Americans thought there was a “deep state”.\n\nThe term was originally coined in a somewhat pejorative sense to refer to similar relatively invisible state apparatus in Turkey and post-Soviet Russia, where the Turkish military colluded with drug traffickers.\nWith respect to the United States, the concept has been discussed in numerous published works by Marc Ambinder, David W. Brown, Peter Dale Scott, Mike Lofgren, , Michael Tomasky and Michael Wolff.\n\nWhile definitions vary, the term gained popularity among various groups, primarily supporters of Donald Trump, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in opposition to establishment Republican and Democratic candidates. Following Trump's inauguration, the term was widely adopted among Republicans alleging that there exists a deep-state conspiracy to delegitimize the presidency and thwart its policy goals.\n\nAccording to the journalist Robert Worth, \"The expression \"deep state\" had originated in Turkey in the 1990s, where the military colluded with drug traffickers and hit men to wage a dirty war against Kurdish insurgents\".\n\nIn \"The Concealment of the State\", Professor Jason Royce Lindsey argues that even without a conspiratorial agenda, the term \"deep state\" is useful for understanding aspects of the national security establishment in developed countries, with emphasis on the United States. Lindsey writes that the deep state draws power from the national security and intelligence communities, a realm where secrecy is a source of power. Alfred W. McCoy states that the increase in the power of the U.S. intelligence community since the September 11 attacks \"has built a fourth branch of the U.S. government\" that is \"in many ways autonomous from the executive, and increasingly so.\"\n\nIn the journal \"Foreign Affairs\", UCLA Law professor Jon D. Michaels discusses Trump and the deep state, and argues that the concept's relevance is quite limited in the United States. He states that it is a more useful perspective in the study of developing governments such as Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey, \"where shadowy elites in the military and government ministries have been known to countermand or simply defy democratic directives.\"\n\nAccording to David Gergen, quoted in \"Time\" magazine, the term has been appropriated by Steve Bannon and \"Breitbart News\" and other supporters of the Trump Administration in order to delegitimize the critics of the current presidency. The 'deep state' theory has been dismissed by authors for \"The New York Times\" and \"New York Observer\". University of Miami Professor Joseph Uscinski says, \"The concept has always been very popular among conspiracy theorists, whether they call it a deep state or something else.\"\n\nFormer NSA leaker Edward Snowden has used the term generally to refer to the influence of civil servants over elected officials: \"the deep state is not just the intelligence agencies, it is really a way of referring to the career bureaucracy of government. These are officials who sit in powerful positions, who don't leave when presidents do, who watch presidents come and go...they influence policy, they influence presidents.\"\n\nIn an opinion piece by linguist Geoffrey Nunberg, he said the \"deep state\" is an \"elastic label — depending on the occasion\" and its \"story conforms to the intricate grammar of those conspiracy narratives.\" He also contrasted the change in the \"twin bogeys of conservative rhetoric\", from bureaucratic \"meddlesome bunglers\" of \"big government\" to \"conniving ideologues\" who \"orchestrates complex schemes\".\n\nThe term \"deep state\" has been associated with the \"military–industrial complex\" by several of the authors on the subject. Potential risks from the military-industrial complex were raised in President Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1961 farewell address: \"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\" Mike Lofgren has claimed the military-industrial complex is the private part of the deep state. However, Marc Ambinder has suggested that a myth about the \"deep state\" is that it functions as one entity; in reality, he states, \"the deep state contains multitudes, and they are often at odds with one another.\"\n\nTufts University professor Michael J. Glennon claimed that President Barack Obama did not succeed in resisting and/or changing what he calls the \"double government\"; the defense and national security network. Mike Lofgren felt Obama was pushed into the Afghanistan \"surge\" in 2009. Another major campaign promise Obama made was the closure of Guantanamo Bay Prison Camp, which he was unable to accomplish. This has been attributed indirectly to the influence of a deep state.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supporters use the term to refer to allegations that intelligence officers and executive branch officials guide policy through leaking or other internal means. According to a July 2017 report by the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \"the Trump administration was being hit by national security leaks 'on a nearly daily basis' and at a far higher rate than its predecessors encountered\".\n\nThe term has also been used in comments on the \"deep state\"-like influence allegedly wielded by career military officers such as H. R. McMaster, John Kelly and James Mattis in the Trump administration.\n\nTrump and Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, have both made allegations about a deep state which they believe is interfering with the president's agenda. In 2018, describing the deep state as an \"entrenched bureaucracy,\" Trump accused the United States Department of Justice \"of being part of the 'deep state'\" in a statement advocating the prosecution of Huma Abedin. Some Trump allies and right-wing media outlets have alleged that former president Barack Obama is coordinating a deep state resistance to Trump. While the belief in a deep state is popular among Trump supporters, critics maintain that it has no basis in reality, arguing that the sources of the leaks frustrating the Trump administration lack the organizational depth of deep states in other countries, and that use of the term in the U.S. could undermine confidence in vital institutions and be used to justify suppressing dissent.\n\nIn an article for \"The New York Review of Books\", Michael Tomalsky quoted Newt Gingrich as using the term in the context of the Robert Mueller investigation in July 2018, quoting Gingrich stating: \"[Mueller is] … the tip of the deep state spear aimed at destroying or at a minimum undermining and crippling the Trump presidency\". Gingrich then added to the statement that: \"The brazen redefinition of Mueller's task tells you how arrogant the deep state is and how confident it is it can get away with anything\".\n\nProfessor of international relations at Harvard University, Stephen Walt, has written: \"There's no secret conspiracy or deep state running U.S. foreign policy; to the extent that there is a bipartisan foreign-policy elite, it is hiding in plain sight.\"<ref name=\"Walt_9/7/2018\"></ref>\n\nOn September 5, 2018, the New York Times published an anonymous Op-Ed titled \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\" written by a \"senior official in the Trump Administration.\" In the essay the official was critical of President Trump and claimed to be one of \"many senior officials\" working against the Trump Administration. He stated \"that many of the senior officials in [Trump's] own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\" This was referred by some (including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy) to be the deep state at work. However, there was some doubt as to the actual importance of the anonymous author with some estimating hundreds or thousands of possible positions could be considered \"senior officials\" and the inherent paradox of exposing the existence of such a group. \n\nAccording to a poll of Americans in April 2017, about half (48%) thought there was a \"deep state\" (meaning \"military, intelligence and government officials who try to secretly manipulate government\"), while about a third (35%) of all participants thought it was a conspiracy theory and the remainder (17%) had no opinion. Of those who believe a \"deep state\" exists, more than half (58%) said it was a major problem, a net of 28% of those surveyed.\n\nA March 2018 poll found most respondents (63%) were unfamiliar with the term \"deep state\", but a majority believe that a deep state likely exists in the United States when described as \"a group of unelected government and military officials who secretly manipulate or direct national policy\". Three-fourths (74%) of the respondents say that they believe this type of group definitely (27%) or probably (47%) exists in the federal government.\n\n"}
{"id": "16865366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16865366", "title": "Deer park (England)", "text": "Deer park (England)\n\nIn medieval and Early Modern England, a deer park was an enclosed area containing deer. It was bounded by a ditch and bank with a wooden park pale on top of the bank, or by a stone or brick wall. The ditch was on the inside increasing the effective height. Some parks had deer \"leaps\", where there was an external ramp and the inner ditch was constructed on a grander scale, thus allowing deer to enter the park but preventing them from leaving.\n\nSome deer parks were established in the Anglo-Saxon era and are mentioned in Anglo-Saxon Charters; these were often called hays.\n\nAfter the Norman conquest of England in 1066 William the Conqueror seized existing game reserves. Deer parks flourished and proliferated under the Normans, forming a forerunner of the deer parks that became popular among England's landed gentry. The Domesday Book of 1086 records thirty-six of them.\n\nInitially the Norman kings maintained an exclusive right to keep and hunt deer and established forest law for this purpose. In due course they also allowed members of the nobility and senior clergy to maintain deer parks. At their peak at the turn of the 14th century, deer parks may have covered 2% of the land area of England.\n\nJames I was an enthusiast for hunting but it became less fashionable and popular after the Civil War. The number of deer parks then declined, contemporary books documenting other more profitable uses for such an estate. During the 18th century many deer parks were landscaped, where deer then became optional within larger country parks, several of which were created or enlarged from wealth from trade and colonization in the British Empire. These later mostly gave way to profitable agriculture dependent on crop prices, with large parts of the workforce having been attracted elsewhere following increasing industrialization. This created pressure to sell off parts or divide such estates while rural population growth pushed up poor law rates (particularly outdoor relief and the Labour Rate) and urban poverty led to the introduction of lump sum capital taxation such as inheritance tax and a shift in power away from the aristocracy.\n\nDeer parks are notable landscape features in their own right. However, where they have survived into the 20th century, the lack of ploughing or development has often preserved other features within the park, including barrows (tumuli), Roman roads and abandoned villages.\n\nTo establish a deer park a royal licence was required, known as a \"licence to empark\"—especially if the park was in or near a royal forest. Because of their cost and exclusivity, deer parks became status symbols. Deer were almost all kept within exclusive reserves with the larger ones often used as aristocratic playgrounds, for hunting, often with deer being driven into nets; and, there was no legitimate market for venison without an established provenance. Thus the ability to eat venison or give it to others was also a status symbol. Consequently, many deer parks were maintained for the supply of venison, rather than hunting the deer. Small deer parks which functioned primarily as household larders were attached to many smaller manors, such as at Umberleigh in Devon. Owners would grant to their friends or to others to whom they owed a favour, a signed warrant for a specified number of deer, usually one only, specified as buck or doe, which the recipient would present to the park keeper who would select and kill one and hand the carcass to the grantee. The Lisle Papers dating from the 1530s contains many such letters from prospective grantees requesting such gifts from the park of Honor Grenville, the lady of the manor of Umberleigh in Devon, and also contains reports to her from her bailiff listing grants of venison made from her park during the past year. Such grants acted as common features of the mediaeval social machinery.\n\nKing Henry VIII appointed Sir William Denys (1470–1533) an Esquire of the Body at some date before 5 June 1511. It was perhaps at the very time of William's appointment to that position at court that the King promised him the honour of a licence to empark 500 acres of his manor of Dyrham in Gloucestershire, which is to say to enclose the land with a wall or hedgebank and to establish a captive herd of deer within, with exclusive hunting rights. This grant is witnessed by a charter on parchment, to which is affixed a rare example of a perfect great seal of Henry VIII, now hanging in a frame beneath the main staircase of Dyrham Park. It clearly was handed down with the deeds of the manor on the termination of the Denys era at Dyrham. The charter is of exceptional interest as it is signed as witnesses by men of the greatest importance in the state, who were at the King's side at that moment, at the Palace of Westminster. The text of the document, translated from Latin is as follows:\n\nHenry by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland sends greetings to his archbishops, bishops, abbotts, priors, dukes, marquises, earls, barons, judges, sheriffs, reeves, ministers and all our bailiffs and faithful subjects. Let it be known that we, motivated by our especial grace and certain knowledge of him, have granted for us and our heirs to our faithful servant William Denys, esquire of the Royal Body, to him, his heirs and assigns, the right to empark 500 acres of land, meadow, pasture and wood together with appurtenance at \"Le Worthy\" within the manor of \"Dereham\" in the county of Gloucestershire and enclose them with fences and hedges in order to make a park there. Also that they may have free warren in all their demesne lands within the said manor. No other person may enter this park or warren to hunt or catch anything which might belong to that park or warren without permission from William, his heirs or assigns under penalty of £10, provided that the land is not within our forest.\n\nWitnessed by:\n\nGiven by our hand at Westminster on the 5th day of June in the 3rd year of our reign. (1511)\n\nFrom the size of the present park it appears that only about 250 acres were ultimately enclosed. The grant of emparkment was separate from and in addition to the grant of free warren in his demesne lands. This latter allowed him to hunt exclusively on his unemparked other untenanted lands which were managed by his own staff. High dry-stone walls, typical of Gloucestershire, still survive around parts of the present parkland, which is still stocked with a herd of fallow deer. The park was thus an area in which Denys's deer would be at his own disposal and would be safe from being hunted or otherwise taken by any other person, including his neighbours and the king himself. The king when on royal progress throughout his kingdom was accompanied by an enormous entourage which needed daily feeding and entertainment, both of which functions were achieved by holding driven game shoots, in which an area of ground several miles in area would be surrounded and any deer within would be driven towards a specified exit where the king and his favoured courtiers would be awaiting with bows and arrows to kill them. Thus several dozen if not hundreds of deer could be killed in a single day, to the impoverishment of the local countryside for several months if not years into the future. Thus any landowner with a licensed park, even if within the circuit of such a drive, would be immune from the entry of such beaters into his park, and his deer would remain untouched.\n\nEarly historical records are replete with instances of noblemen breaking into each other's parks and killing deer therein, often as a result of a local territorial dispute or vendetta or merely from high spirits. The penalties inflicted by royal justice were severe in such instances. For example, in 1523 Sir William St Loe (d. 1556) of Sutton Court, Chew Magna, Somerset, together with 16 others, armed with bows and arrows, crossbows and swords, broke into Banwell Park in Somerset, attached to Banwell Abbey, a residence belonging to Bishop of Bath and Wells William Barlow, and killed 4 bucks and other deer. In the following August he made a similar raid and killed more than 20 deer, the heads of which he stuck on the boundary palings. He was ordered to appear before a magistrate, but the record of his punishment if any has not survived. However, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries a short while later, in 1552 Sir William obtained for himself from the crown the office of Keeper of Banwell Park.\n\nDeer parks could vary in size from a circumference of many miles down to what amounted to little more than a deer paddock. The landscape within a deer park was manipulated to produce a habitat that was both suitable for the deer and also provided space for hunting. \"Tree dotted lawns, tree clumps and compact woods\" provided \"launds\" (pasture) over which the deer were hunted and wooded cover for the deer to avoid human contact. The landscape was intended to be visually attractive as well as functional.\n\nW. G. Hoskins remarked that \"the reconstruction of medieval parks and their boundaries is one of the many useful tasks awaiting the field-worker with patience and a good local knowledge\". Most deer parks were bounded by significant earthworks topped by a park pale, typically of cleft oak stakes. These boundaries typically have a curving, rounded plan, possibly to economise on the materials and work involved in fencing and ditching.\n\nA few deer parks in areas with plentiful building stone had stone walls instead of a park pale. Examples include Barnsdale in Yorkshire and Burghley on the Cambridgeshire/Lincolnshire border.\n\nBoundary earthworks have survived \"in considerable numbers and a good state of preservation\". Even where the bank and ditch do not survive, their former course can sometimes still be traced in modern field boundaries. The boundaries of early deer parks often formed parish boundaries. Where the deer park reverted to agriculture, the newly established field system was often rectilinear, clearly contrasting with the system outside the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Portuguese and English historians settled and popularized the term later on.\n\nIn the nineteenth century began to spread a version of the biography of Prince Henry whereby he would have installed his court in Sagres in 1418, shortly after the capture of Ceuta by the Portuguese. There would be formed around him the best of \"science and navigation\" and building a shipyard and a palace with the first observatory in Portugal. \nThey even wrote that Sagres represented modern refounding \"the systematic study of applied science\" in Christendom\". Others nuanced that, more than a nautical school in the modern concept of the word, Sagres was a meeting place for sailors and scientists to exchange information and techniques, designing maps, shipbuilding and organize expeditions.\n\nThe diverse religious status (Jews, Muslims, Christians) of the members of the alleged Sagres school, and even the ability to remotely connect them with the Templars given the fact that Prince Henry was the commander of the Order of Christ, have increased the romantic halo that sometimes appears.\nAccording to the critical view, the Portuguese learned navigation in a practical way, on the decks of the ships, and not being able to find archaeological and documentary support for the \"Escola de Sagres\", they consider it a myth of Portuguese history. \nThe \"majorcan school\" influence on the Portuguese \"navigation know how\" is asserted by Julio Rey Pastor who says in his book \"La Cartografía Mallorquina\" (citing João de Barros and Pacheco Pereira).. \"..That Jehuda Cresques (c. 1415) acted as founder and director of the Escola de Sagres, was known to historians for over a century, with doubts on which \"mestre Jacome\" from Majorca corresponded to the \"mestre Jacome\" contracted by Prince Henry, (although he was the only cartographer with that name). But it's unforgivable some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infant, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sens, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable Peter the Ceremonious and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN.. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of Pacheco Pereira...:\n\nAnd he continues.. It's unforgivable as well, that those scholars, could dare to write on the subject without reading João de Barros, which clearly states: \"..mándou vir da ilha de Mallorca um mestre Jacome, hornera mui douto na arte de navegar, que fasia e instrumentos náuticos e que Ihe custou muito pelo trazer a este reino para ensinar sua sciencia aos officiaes portuguezes d'aquella mester..\"\n\nJoão Gonçalves Zarco arrived at Porto Santo (1419) and Madeira (1420), and on the other part Diogo de Silves found the island of Santa Maria at Azores (1427). In 1434 Gil Eanes doubled Cape Bojador, the westernmost point of Africa. This meant a period of twelve years to navigate across two hundred miles that separate the Cape Não from Cape Bojador. From this point, the \" Dark Sea \" was feared by Arab geographers for the difficulty of the return trip, sailing against the prevailing winds. This problem could be sorted out at the end, by means of high sea sailing, returning by a route far away from the coast. This breakthrough was achieved in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. The suitable vessel was the Caravel, used for fishing and characterized for its robustness and shallowness, with a tonnage from 50 to 160 tonnes, with 1, 2 or 3 masts with triangular Latin sails.\n\n\n"}

In addition, the high porosity of the soil makes a fellfield a difficult place for plants to grow. Fellfields often have typical patterns of rocks: lines of rocks that have been pushed out of the soil, and slid into a low region.\n\nIn botany the term \"fellfield\" describes an ecoregion, ecosystem, habitat, or plant community. The term frequently used is alpine fellfield. Fellfield is usually applied to an alpine tundra region of high altitude mountains, or high latitude islands, and the alpine plants there.\n\nFellfields are typically populated by cushion plants: perennials that grow close to the ground. Cushion plants are well-adapted to the dryness and short growing season of a fellfield. Cushion plants often have hairy foliage and long taproots, to gather and retain moisture. Examples of cushion plants include the lupines and buckwheats.\n\n\nSome geologists find it is controversial to share the term for biology and geomorphology applications.\n\n"}
{"id": "39715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39715", "title": "Fertile Crescent", "text": "Fertile Crescent\n\nThe Fertile Crescent is a crescent-shaped region in the Middle East where agriculture and early human civilizations such as Sumer flourished. Technological advances in the region include the development of writing, glass, the wheel, agriculture, and the use of irrigation.\nIt has been called the \"cradle of civilization\".\n\nThe Fertile Crescent lies in parts of Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan as well as the southeastern fringe of Turkey and the western fringes of Iran. Some authors include Cyprus and parts of Egypt.\n\nThe term \"Fertile Crescent\" was popularized by archaeologist James Henry Breasted in \"Outlines of European History\" (1914) and \"Ancient Times, A History of the Early World\" (1916).<ref name=\"Breasted 1914/1916\"></ref> Breasted wrote:This fertile crescent is approximately a semicircle, with the open side toward the south, having the west end at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean, the center directly north of Arabia, and the east end at the north end of the Persian Gulf (see map, p. 100). It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.This great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent. It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look down—a bay not of water but of sandy waste, some across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some height—too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut cañons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands—a struggle which is still going on—for the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay. There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.\n\nIn current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as the surrounding portions of Turkey and Iran. Water sources include the Jordan River. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the Syrian Desert to the south. Around the outer boundary are the Anatolian highlands to the north, the Sahara Desert to the west and the Iranian Plateau to the east.\n\nAs crucial as rivers and marshlands were to the rise of civilization in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the \"bridge\" between Africa and Eurasia, which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of biodiversity than either Europe or North Africa, where climate changes during the Ice Age led to repeated extinction events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The Saharan pump theory posits that this Middle Eastern land-bridge was extremely important to the modern distribution of Old World flora and fauna, including the spread of humanity.\n\nThe area has borne the brunt of the tectonic divergence between the African and Arabian plates and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.\n\nThe Fertile Crescent had many diverse climates, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many \"r\" type annual plants, which produce more edible seeds than \"K\" type perennial plants. The region's dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops important in early agriculture (i.e., wild progenitors to emmer wheat, einkorn, barley, flax, chick pea, pea, lentil, bitter vetch), and four of the five most important species of domesticated animals—cows, goats, sheep, and pigs; the fifth species, the horse, lived nearby. The Fertile Crescent flora comprises a high percentage of plants that can self-pollinate, but may also be cross-pollinated. These plants, called \"selfers\", were one of the geographical advantages of the area because they did not depend on other plants for reproduction.\n\nAs well as possessing many sites with the skeletal and cultural remains of both pre-modern and early modern humans (e.g., at Tabun and Es Skhul caves in Israel), later Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, and Epipalaeolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers (the Natufians); the Fertile Crescent is most famous for its sites related to the origins of agriculture. The western zone around the Jordan and upper Euphrates rivers gave rise to the first known Neolithic farming settlements (referred to as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), which date to around 9,000 BCE (and includes sites such as Göbekli Tepe and Jericho).\n\nThis region, alongside Mesopotamia (which lies to the east of the Fertile Crescent, between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates), also saw the emergence of early complex societies during the succeeding Bronze Age. There is also early evidence from the region for writing and the formation of hierarchical statelevel societies. This has earned the region the nickname \"The cradle of civilization\".\n\nIt is in this region where the first libraries appeared, some 5,000 years ago. The oldest known library was found in northern Syria, in the ruins of Ebla, a major commercial center that was destroyed around 1650 BCE.\n\nBoth the Tigris and Euphrates start in the Taurus Mountains of what is modern-day Turkey. Farmers in southern Mesopotamia had to protect their fields from flooding each year, except northern Mesopotamia which had just enough rain to make some farming possible. To protect against flooding, they made levees.\n\nSince the Bronze Age, the region's natural fertility has been greatly extended by irrigation works, upon which much of its agricultural production continues to depend. The last two millennia have seen repeated cycles of decline and recovery as past works have fallen into disrepair through the replacement of states, to be replaced under their successors. Another ongoing problem has been salination — gradual concentration of salt and other minerals in soils with a long history of irrigation.\n\nPrehistoric seedless figs were discovered at Gilgal I in the Jordan Valley, suggesting that fig trees were being planted some 11,400 years ago. Cereals were already grown in Syria as long as 9,000 years ago. Small cats (\"Felis silvestris\") also were domesticated in this region.\n\nLinguistically, the Fertile Crescent was a region of great diversity. Historically, Semitic languages generally prevailed in the lowlands, whilst in the mountainous areas to the east and north a number of generally unrelated languages were found including Elamite, Kassite, and Hurro-Urartian. The precise affiliation of these, and their date of arrival, remain topics of scholarly discussion. However, given lack of textual evidence for the earliest era of prehistory, this debate is unlikely to be resolved in the near future.\n\nThe evidence which does exist suggests that by the third millennium BCE and into the second, several language groups already existed in the region. These included:\n\nLinks between Hurro-Urartian and Hattic and the indigenous languages of the Caucasus have frequently been suggested, but are not generally accepted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10878", "title": "Flanders", "text": "Flanders\n\nFlanders ( , , ) is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium and one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. However, there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history, and sometimes involving neighbouring countries. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although the Brussels Capital Region has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees the community aspects of Flanders life in Brussels such as (Flemish) culture and education.\n\nFlanders, despite not being the biggest part of Belgium by area, is the area with the largest population (68.5%). 7,876,873 out of 11,491,346 Belgian inhabitants live in Flanders or the bilingual city of Brussels. Not including Brussels, there are five modern Flemish provinces.\n\nIn medieval contexts, the original \"County of Flanders\" stretched around AD 900 from the Strait of Dover to the Scheldt estuary and expanded from there. This county also still corresponds roughly with the modern-day Belgian provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders, along with neighbouring parts of France and the Netherlands. Although this original meaning is still relevant, during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace to use the term \"Flanders\" to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, stretching all the way to the River Meuse, as well as cultural movements such as Flemish art. In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms the Belgian part of this area was made into two political entities: the \"Flemish Community\" () and the \"Flemish Region\" (). These entities were merged, although geographically the Flemish Community, which has a broader cultural mandate, covers Brussels, whereas the Flemish Region does not.\n\nFlanders, by every definition, has figured prominently in European history since the Middle Ages. In this period, cities such as Ghent, Bruges, and later Antwerp made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, trading, and weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century industrial revolution but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking Wallonia. In the second half of the 20th century, however, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders and Brussels are significantly more wealthy than Wallonia and in general one of the wealthiest regions in Europe and the world.\n\nGeographically, Flanders is mainly flat, and has a small section of coast on the North Sea. Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated, with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer (1,200 per square mile). It touches France to the west near the coast, and borders the Netherlands to the north and east, and Wallonia to the south. The Brussels Capital Region is an officially bilingual enclave within the Flemish Region. Flanders has exclaves of its own: Voeren in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and Baarle-Hertog in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands.\n\nThe term \"Flanders\" has several main modern meanings:\n\n\nThe significance of the County of Flanders and its counts eroded through time, but the designation remained in a very broad sense. In the Early modern period, the term Flanders was associated with the southern part of the Low Countries: the Southern Netherlands. During the 19th and 20th centuries, it became increasingly commonplace to refer to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium as \"Flanders\". The linguistic limit between French and Dutch was recorded in the early '60's, from Kortrijk to Maastricht. Now, Flanders extends over the northern part of Belgium, including Belgian Limburg (corresponding closely to the medieval County of Loon), and the Dutch-speaking Belgian parts of the medieval Duchy of Brabant.\n\nThe ambiguity between this wider area and that of the County (or the Belgian parts thereof), still remains. In most present-day contexts however, in general the term Flanders is taken to refer to either the political, social, cultural, and linguistic community (and the corresponding official institution, the Flemish Community), or the geographical area, one of the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the Flemish Region.\n\nIn the history of art and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and Netherlandish are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"Early Netherlandish painting\", and it is not uncommon to see Mosan art categorized as Flemish art. In music the \"Franco-Flemish School\" is also known as the \"Dutch School\".\n\nWithin this Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, French has never ceased to be spoken by some citizens and Jewish groups have been speaking Yiddish in Antwerp for centuries. Today, Flanders' minority residents include 170 nationalities — the largest groups speaking French, English, Berber, Turkish, Arabic, Spanish, Italian and Polish.\n\nWhen Julius Caesar conquered the area he described it as the less economically developed and more warlike part of \"Gallia Belgica\". His informants told him that especially in the east, the tribes claimed ancestral connections and kinship with the \"Germanic\" peoples then east of the Rhine. Under the Roman empire the whole of \"Gallia Belgica\" became an administrative province. The future counties of Flanders and Brabant remained part of this province connected to what is now France, but in the east modern Limburg became part of the Rhine frontier province of \"Germania Inferior\" connected to what is now the Netherlands and Germany. \"Gallia Belgica\" and \"Germania Inferior\" were the two most northerly continental provinces of the Roman empire.\n\nIn the future county of Flanders, the main Belgic tribe in early Roman times was the Menapii, but also on the coast were the Marsacii and Morini. In the central part of modern Belgium were the Nervii and in the east were the Tungri. The Tungri especially were understood to have links to Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Another notable Germanic group were the Toxandrians who appear to have lived in the Kempen region, in the northern parts of both the Nervian and Tungrian provinces, probably stretching into the modern Netherlands. The Roman provinces of the Menapii, Nervii and Tungri therefore corresponded roughly with the medieval counties of Flanders, Brabant and Loon, and the modern Flemish provinces of East and West Flanders (Menapii), Brabant and Antwerp (Nervii), and Belgian Limburg (Tungri). Brabant appears to have been home to relatively unpopulated forest area, the Silva Carbonaria, forming a natural boundary between northeast and southwest Belgium.\n\nLinguistically, the tribes in this area were under Celtic influence in the south, and Germanic influence in the east, but there is disagreement about what language was spoken locally, which may even have been an intermediate \"Nordwestblock\" language related to both. By the first century BC Germanic languages had become prevalent.\n\nThe County of Flanders was a feudal fief in West Francia. The first certain Count in the comital family, Baldwin I of Flanders, is first reported in a document of 862 when he eloped with a daughter of his king Charles the Bald. The region developed as a medieval economic power with a large degree of political autonomy. While its trading cities remained strong, it was weakened and divided when districts fell under direct French royal rule in the late 12th century. The remaining parts of Flanders came under the rule of the counts of neighbouring imperial Hainaut under Baldwin V of Hainaut in 1191.\n\nDuring the late Middle Ages Flanders' trading towns (notably Ghent, Bruges and Ypres) made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Ghent, Bruges, Ypres and the Franc of Bruges formed the Four Members, a form of parliament that exercised considerable power in Flanders.\n\nIncreasingly powerful from the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban communes were instrumental in defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300–1302), finally defeating the French in the Battle of the Golden Spurs (11 July 1302), near Kortrijk. Two years later, the uprising was defeated and Flanders remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, however, owing to widespread European population decline following the Black Death of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to Worstead and North Walsham in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woolen industry.\n\nThe County of Flanders started to take control of the neighbouring County of Brabant during the life of Louis II, Count of Flanders (1330-1384), who fought his sister-in-law Joanna, Duchess of Brabant for control of it.\n\nThe entire area, straddling the ancient boundary of France and the Holy Roman Empire, later passed to Philip the Bold in 1384, the Duke of Burgundy, with his capital in Brussels. The titles were eventually more clearly united under his grandson Philip the Good (1396 – 1467). This large Duchy passed in to the Habsburg dynasty, and in 1556 to the kings of Spain. Western and southern districts of Flanders were confirmed under French rule under successive treaties of 1659 (Artois), 1668, and 1678.\n\nThe County of Loon, approximately the modern Flemish province of Limburg, remained independent under the lordship of the Archbishop of Liège until the French Revolution, but surrounded by the Burgundians, and under their influence.\n\nIn 1500, Charles V was born in Ghent. He inherited the Seventeen Provinces (1506), Spain (1516) with its colonies and in 1519 was elected Holy Roman Emperor. The Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, issued by Charles V, established the Low Countries as the Seventeen Provinces (or Spanish Netherlands in its broad sense) as an entity separate from the Holy Roman Empire and from France. In 1556 Charles V abdicated due to ill health (he suffered from crippling gout). Spain and the Seventeen Provinces went to his son, king Philip II of Spain.\n\nOver the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps by 1560. Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Americas.\"\nMeanwhile, Protestantism had reached the Low Countries. Among the wealthy traders of Antwerp, the Lutheran beliefs of the German Hanseatic traders found appeal, perhaps partly for economic reasons. The spread of Protestantism in this city was aided by the presence of an Augustinian cloister (founded 1514) in the St. Andries quarter. Luther, an Augustinian himself, had taught some of the monks, and his works were in print by 1518. The first Lutheran martyrs came from Antwerp. The Reformation resulted in consecutive but overlapping waves of reform: a Lutheran, followed by a militant Anabaptist, then a Mennonite, and finally a Calvinistic movement. These movements existed independently of each other.\n\nPhilip II, a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the Counter-Reformation, suppressed Calvinism in Flanders, Brabant and Holland (what is now approximately Belgian Limburg was part of the Bishopric of Liège and was Catholic \"de facto\"). In 1566, the wave of iconoclasm known as the \"Beeldenstorm\" was a prelude to religious war between Catholics and Protestants, especially the Anabaptists. The \"Beeldenstorm\" started in what is now French Flanders, with open-air sermons () that spread through the Low Countries, first to Antwerp and Ghent, and from there further east and north. In total it lasted not even a month.\n\nSubsequently, Philip II sent the Duke of Alba to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the southern part of the Provinces, who signed the Union of Atrecht, which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the Union of Utrecht and settled in 1581 the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, but before the revolt could be completely defeated, a war between England and Spain had broken out, forcing Philip's Spanish troops to halt their advance. Meanwhile, the Spanish armies had already conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. On 17 August 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Eighty Years' War for the (from now on) Southern Netherlands. The United Provinces (the Northern Netherlands) fought on until 1648 – the Peace of Westphalia.\nWhile Spain was at war with England, the rebels from the north, strengthened by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to Philip II's Spanish troops. They managed to conquer a considerable part of Brabant (the later Noord-Brabant of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary (Zeelandic Flanders), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front line at the end of this war stabilized and became the current border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to close off the river Scheldt, effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes.\n\nFirst the fall of Antwerp to the Spanish and later also the closing of the Scheldt were causes of a considerable emigration of Antverpians. Many of the Calvinist merchants of Antwerp and also of other Flemish cities left Flanders and emigrated to the north. A large number of them settled in Amsterdam, which was at the time a smaller port, of significance only in the Baltic trade. In the following years Amsterdam was rapidly transformed into one of the world's most important ports. Because of the contribution of the Flemish exiles to this transformation, the exodus is sometimes described as \"creating a new Antwerp\"\".\n\nFlanders and Brabant, due to these events, went into a period of relative decline from the time of the Thirty Years War. In the Northern Netherlands however, the mass emigration from Flanders and Brabant became an important driving force behind the Dutch Golden Age.\n\nAlthough arts remained at a relatively impressive level for another century with Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) and Anthony van Dyck, Flanders experienced a loss of its former economic and intellectual power under Spanish, Austrian, and French rule, with heavy taxation and rigid imperial political control compounding the effects of industrial stagnation and Spanish-Dutch and Franco-Austrian conflict. The Southern Netherlands suffered severely under the War of the Spanish Succession, but under the reign of Empress Maria-Theresia these lands economically flourished again. Influenced by the Enlightenment, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II was the first sovereign who had been in the Southern Netherlands since King Philip II of Spain left them in 1559.\n\nIn 1794 the French Republican Army started using Antwerp as the northernmost naval port of France, which country officially annexed Flanders the following year as the \"départements\" of Lys, Escaut, Deux-Nèthes, Meuse-Inférieure and Dyle. Obligatory (French) army service for all men aged 16–25 was one of the main reasons for the people's uprising against the French in 1798, known as the \"Boerenkrijg\" (\"Peasants' War\"), with the heaviest fighting in the Campine area.\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo in Waterloo, Brabant, sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands – Belgium minus the East Cantons and Luxembourg – was given by the Congress of Vienna (1815) to the United Netherlands (Dutch: \"Verenigde Nederlanden\"), the state that briefly existed under Sovereign Prince William I of Orange Nassau, the latter King William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, after the French Empire was driven out of the Dutch territories. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was born. The Protestant King of the Netherlands, William I rapidly started the industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. The political system that was set up however, slowly but surely failed to forge a true union between the northern and the southern parts of the Kingdom. The southern bourgeoisie mainly was Roman Catholic, in contrast to the mainly Protestant north; large parts of the southern bourgeoisie also primarily spoke French rather than Dutch.\n\nIn 1815 the Dutch Senate was reinstated (Dutch: \"Eerste Kamer der Staaten Generaal\"). The nobility, mainly coming from the south, became more and more estranged from their northern colleagues. Resentment grew both between the Roman Catholics from the south and the Protestants from the north and among the powerful liberal bourgeoisie from the south and their more moderate colleagues from the north. On 25 August 1830 (after the showing of the opera 'La Muette de Portici' of Daniel Auber in Brussels) the Belgian Revolution sparked off and became a fact. On 4 October 1830, the Provisional Government (Dutch: \"Voorlopig Bewind\") proclaimed the independence, which was later confirmed by the National Congress that issued a new Liberal Constitution and declared the new state a Constitutional Monarchy, under the House of Saxe-Coburg. Flanders now became part of the Kingdom of Belgium, which was recognized by the major European Powers on 20 January 1831. The de facto dissidence was finally recognized by the United Kingdom of the Netherlands on 19 April 1839.\n\nIn 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the splitting up of the two countries. Belgium was confirmed as an independent state by the Treaty of London of 1839, but deprived of the eastern half of Limburg (now Dutch Limburg), and the Eastern half of Luxembourg (now the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). Sovereignty over Zeelandic Flanders, south of the Westerscheldt river delta, was left with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was allowed to levy a toll on all traffic to Antwerp harbour until 1863.\n\nThe Belgian Revolution was not well supported in Flanders and even on 4 October 1830, when the Belgian independence was eventually declared, Flemish authorities refused to take orders from the new Belgian government in Brussels. Only after Flanders was subdued with the aid of a large French military force one month later, under the leadership of the Count de Pontécoulant, did Flanders become a true part of Belgium.\n\nThe French-speaking bourgeoisie showed very little respect for the Dutch-speaking part of the population. French became the only official language in Belgium and all secondary and higher education in the Dutch language was abolished. \n\nIn 1834, all people even remotely suspected of being \"Flemish minded\" or calling for the reunification of the Netherlands were prosecuted and their houses looted and burnt. Flanders, until then a very prosperous European region, was not considered worthwhile for investment and scholarship. A study in 1918 demonstrated that in the first 88 years of its existence, 80% of the Belgian GNP was invested in Wallonia. This led to a widespread poverty in Flanders, forcing roughly 300.000 Flemish to emigrate to Wallonia to start working there in the heavy industry.\n\nAll of these events led to a silent uprising in Flanders against the French-speaking domination. But it was not until 1878 that Dutch was allowed to be used for official purposes in Flanders (see language legislation in Belgium), although French remained the only official language in Belgium.\n\nIn 1873, Dutch became the official language in public secondary schools. In 1898 Dutch and French were declared equal languages in laws and Royal orders. In 1930 the first Flemish university was opened.\n\nThe first official translation of the Belgian constitution in Dutch was not published until 1967.\nFlanders (and Belgium as a whole) saw some of the greatest loss of life on the Western Front of the First World War, in particular from the three battles of Ypres.\n\nFlemish feeling of identity and consciousness grew through the events and experiences of war. The occupying German authorities took several Flemish-friendly measures. More importantly, the experiences of many Dutch-speaking soldiers on the front led by French-speaking officers catalysed Flemish emancipation. The French-speaking officers often gave orders in French only, followed by \"et pour les Flamands, la même chose!\", meaning \"and for the Flemish, the same thing!\" (which did not help the Flemish conscripts, who were mostly uneducated farmers and workers unable to have understood what had been said in French).\nThe resulting suffering is still remembered by Flemish organizations during the yearly Yser pilgrimage in Diksmuide at the monument of the Yser Tower.\n\nDuring the interbellum and World War II, several right-wing fascist and/or national-socialistic parties emerged in Belgium. Since these parties were promised more rights for the Flemings by the German government during World War II, many of them collaborated with the Nazi regime. After the war, collaborators (or people who were \"Zwart\", \"Black\" during the war) were prosecuted and punished, among them many Flemish Nationalists whose main political goal had been the emancipation of Flanders. As a result, up until this day Flemish Nationalism is often associated with right-wing and sometimes fascist ideologies.\n\nAfter World War II, the differences between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgians became clear in a number of conflicts, such as the Royal Question, the question whether King Leopold III should return (which most Flemings supported but not the Walloons) and the use of Dutch in the Catholic University of Leuven. As a result, several state reforms took place in the second half of the 20th century, which transformed the unitary Belgium into a federal state with communities, regions and language areas. This resulted also in the establishment of a Flemish Parliament and Government. During the 1970s, all major political parties split into a Dutch and French-speaking party.\n\nSeveral Flemish parties still advocate for more Flemish autonomy, some even for Flemish independence (see Partition of Belgium), whereas the French-speakers would like to keep the current state as it is. Recent governments (such as Verhofstadt I Government) have transferred certain federal competences to the regional governments.\n\nOn 13 December 2006, a spoof news broadcast by the Belgian Francophone public broadcasting station RTBF declared that Flanders had decided to declare independence from Belgium.\n\nThe 2007 federal elections showed more support for Flemish autonomy, marking the start of the 2007–2011 Belgian political crisis. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy gained votes as well as seats in the Belgian federal parliament. This was especially the case for Christian Democratic and Flemish and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) (who had participated on a shared electoral list). The trend continued during the 2009 regional elections, where CD&V and N-VA were the clear winners in Flanders, and N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the 2010 federal elections, followed by the longest-ever government formation after which the Di Rupo I Government was formed excluding N-VA. Eight parties agreed on a sixth state reform which aim to solve the disputes between Flemings and French-speakers. The 2012 provincial and municipal elections however continued the trend of N-VA becoming the biggest party in Flanders.\n\nHowever, sociological studies show no parallel between the rise of nationalist parties and popular support for their agenda. Instead, a recent study revealed a majority in favour of returning regional competences to the federal level.\n\nBoth the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region are constitutional institutions of the Kingdom of Belgium, exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of state reforms. In practice, the Flemish Community and Region together form a single body, with its own parliament and government, as the Community legally absorbed the competences of the Region. The parliament is a directly elected legislative body composed of 124 representatives. The government consists of up to a maximum of eleven members and is presided by a Minister-President, currently Geert Bourgeois (New Flemish Alliance) leading a coalition of his party (N-VA) with Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD&V) and Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten (Open VLD).\n\nThe area of the Flemish Community is represented on the maps above, including the area of the Brussels-Capital Region (hatched on the relevant map). Roughly, the Flemish Community exercises competences originally oriented towards the individuals of the Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education, and the use of the language. Extensions to personal matters less directly associated with language comprise sports, health policy (curative and preventive medicine), and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc.)\n\nThe area of the Flemish Region is represented on the maps above. It has a population of more than 6 million (excluding the Dutch-speaking community in the Brussels Region, grey on the map for it is not a part of the Flemish Region). Roughly, the Flemish Region is responsible for territorial issues in a broad sense, including economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. It supervises the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.\n\nThe number of Dutch-speaking Flemish people in the Capital Region is estimated to be between 11% and 15% (official figures do not exist as there is no language census and no official subnationality). According to a survey conducted by the Université catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual, even if they do not have Dutch as their first language. They are governed by the Brussels Region for economics affairs and by the Flemish Community for educational and cultural issues.\nAs mentioned above, Flemish institutions such as the Flemish Parliament and Government, represent the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region. The region and the community thus \"de facto\" share the same parliament and the same government. All these institutions are based in Brussels. Nevertheless, both types of subdivisions (the Community and the Region) still exist legally and the distinction between both is important for the people living in Brussels. Members of the Flemish Parliament who were elected in the Brussels Region cannot vote on affairs belonging to the competences of the Flemish Region.\n\nThe official language for all Flemish institutions is Dutch. French enjoys a limited official recognition in a dozen municipalities along the borders with French-speaking Wallonia, and a large recognition in the bilingual Brussels Region. French is widely known in Flanders, with 59% claiming to know French according to a survey conducted by the Université catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve and published in June 2006.\n\nHistorically, the political parties reflected the pillarisation (\"verzuiling\") in Flemish society. The traditional political parties of the three pillars are Christian-Democratic and Flemish (CD&V), the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld) and the Socialist Party – Differently (sp.a).\n\nHowever, during the last half century, many new political parties were founded in Flanders. One of the first was the nationalist People's Union, of which the right nationalist Flemish Block (now Flemish Interest) split off, and which later dissolved into the now-defunct Spirit or Social Liberal Party, moderate nationalism rather left of the spectrum, on the one hand, and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), more conservative but independentist, on the other hand. Other parties are the leftist alternative/ecological Green party; the short-lived anarchistic libertarian spark ROSSEM and more recently the conservative-right liberal List Dedecker, founded by Jean-Marie Dedecker, and the socialist Workers' Party.\n\nParticularly the Flemish Block/Flemish Interest has seen electoral success roughly around the turn of the century, and the New Flemish Alliance during the last few elections, becoming even the largest party in the 2010 federal elections.\n\nFor some inhabitants, Flanders is more than just a geographical area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement even call it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, but most people (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even \"very proud\", while some 25% are not proud and 8% is \"very not proud\". Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them staying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in services, the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers - both housewives and house husbands.\n\nIn 2012, the Flemish government drafted a \"Charter for Flanders\" (\"Handvest voor Vlaanderen\") of which the first article says \"Vlaanderen is een deelstaat van de federale Staat België en maakt deel uit van de Europese Unie.\" (\"Flanders is a component state of the federal State of Belgium and is part of the European Union\"). Although interpreted by many Flemish nationalists as a statement, this phrase is merely a quotation from the Belgian constitution and has no further legal value whatsoever.\n\nFlanders shares its borders with Wallonia in the south, Brussels being an enclave within the Flemish Region. The rest of the border is shared with the Netherlands (Zeelandic Flanders in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg) in the north and east, and with France (French Flanders in Hauts-de-France) and the North Sea in the west. Voeren is an exclave of Flanders between Wallonia and the Netherlands, while Baarle-Hertog in Flanders forms a complicated series of enclaves and exclaves with Baarle-Nassau in the Netherlands. Germany, although bordering Wallonia and close to Voeren in Limburg, does not share a border with Flanders. The German-speaking Community of Belgium, also close to Voeren, does not border Flanders either. (The commune of Plombières, majority French speaking, lies between them.)\n\nFlanders is a highly urbanised area, lying completely within the Blue Banana. Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges and Leuven are the largest cities of the Flemish Region. Antwerp has a population of more than 500,000 citizens and is the largest city, Ghent has a population of 250,000 citizens, followed by Bruges with 120,000 citizens and Leuven counts almost 100,000 citizens.\n\nBrussels is a part of Flanders as far as community matters are concerned, but does not belong to the Flemish Region.\n\nFlanders has two main geographical regions: the coastal Yser basin plain in the north-west and a central plain. The first consists mainly of sand dunes and clayey alluvial soils in the polders. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by dikes or, a little further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. With similar soils along the lowermost Scheldt basin starts the central plain, a smooth, slowly rising fertile area irrigated by many waterways that reaches an average height of about five metres (16.4 ft) above sea level with wide valleys of its rivers upstream as well as the Campine region to the east having sandy soils at altitudes around thirty metres. Near its southern edges close to Wallonia one can find slightly rougher land richer of calcium with low hills reaching up to and small valleys, and at the eastern border with the Netherlands, in the Meuse basin, there are marl caves (\"mergelgrotten\"). Its exclave around Voeren between the Dutch border and the Walloon province of Liège attains a maximum altitude of above sea level.\n\nThe present-day Flemish Region covers and is divided into five provinces, 22 arrondissements and 308 cities or municipalities.\n\nThe province of Flemish Brabant is the most recent one, being formed in 1995 after the splitting of the province of Brabant.\n\nMost municipalities are made up of several former municipalities, now called \"deelgemeenten\". The largest municipality (both in terms of population and area) is Antwerp, having more than half a million inhabitants. Its nine \"deelgemeenten\" have a special status and are called districts, which have an elected council and a college. While any municipality with more than 100,000 inhabitants can establish districts, only Antwerp did this so far. The smallest municipality (also both in terms of population and area) is Herstappe (Limburg).\nThe Flemish Community covers both the Flemish Region and, together with the French Community, the Brussels-Capital Region. Brussels, an enclave within the province of Flemish Brabant, is not divided into any province nor is it part of any. It coincides with the Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital and includes 19 municipalities.\n\nThe Flemish Government has its own local institutions in the Brussels-Capital Region, being the \"Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie\" (VGC), and its municipal antennae (\"Gemeenschapscentra\", community centres for the Flemish community in Brussels). These institutions are independent from the educational, cultural and social institutions that depend directly on the Flemish Government. They exert, among others, all those cultural competences that outside Brussels fall under the provinces.\n\nThe climate is maritime temperate, with significant precipitation in all seasons (Köppen climate classification: \"Cfb\"; the average temperature is in January, and in July; the average precipitation is 65 millimetres (2.6 in) in January, and 78 millimetres (3.1 in) in July).\n\nTotal GDP of the Flemish Region in 2004 was €165,847 billion (Eurostat figures). Per capita GDP at purchasing power parity was 23% above the EU average. Flemish productivity per capita is about 13% higher than that in Wallonia, and wages are about 7% higher than in Wallonia.\n\nFlanders was one of the first continental European areas to undergo the Industrial Revolution, in the 19th century. Initially, the modernization relied heavily on food processing and textile. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846–50). After World War II, Antwerp and Ghent experienced a fast expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. Flanders also attracted a large majority of foreign investments in Belgium. The 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession. The steel industry remained in relatively good shape. In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of Belgium continued to shift further to Flanders and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond area. Nowadays, the Flemish economy is mainly service-oriented.\n\nBelgium is a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, which evolved into the present-day European Union. In 1999, the euro, the single European currency, was introduced in Flanders. It replaced the Belgian franc in 2002.\n\nThe Flemish economy is strongly export-oriented, in particular of high value-added goods. The main imports are food products, machinery, rough diamonds, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, clothing and accessories, and textiles. The main exports are automobiles, food and food products, iron and steel, finished diamonds, textiles, plastics, petroleum products, and non-ferrous metals. Since 1922, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market within a customs and currency union—the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union. Its main trading partners are Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and Spain.\n\nAntwerp is the number one diamond market in the world, diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based BASF plant is the largest BASF-base outside Germany, and accounts on its own for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities in Antwerp include car manufacturing, telecommunications, photographic products.\n\nFlanders is home to several science and technology institutes, such as IMEC, VITO, Flanders DC and Flanders DRIVE.\n\nFlanders has developed an extensive transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways and highways. The Port of Antwerp is the second-largest in Europe, after Rotterdam. Other ports are Bruges-Zeebrugge, Ghent and Ostend, of which Bruges and Ostend are located at the .\n\nWhereas railways are managed by the federal National Railway Company of Belgium, other public transport (De Lijn) and roads are managed by the Flemish region.\n\nThe main airport is Brussels Airport, the only other civilian airport with scheduled services in Flanders is Antwerp International Airport, but there are two other ones with cargo or charter flights: Ostend-Bruges International Airport and Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport, both in West Flanders.\n\nThe highest population density is found in the area circumscribed by the Brussels-Antwerp-Ghent-Leuven agglomerations that surround Mechelen and is known as the Flemish Diamond, in other important urban centres as Bruges, Roeselare and Kortrijk to the west, and notable centres Turnhout and Hasselt to the east. On 1 January 2015, the Flemish Region had a population of 6,444,127 and about 15% of the 1,175,173 people in the Brussels Region are also considered Flemish.\n\nThe (Belgian) \"laicist\", or secularist, constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the various governments in general respect this right in practice. Since independence, Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong freethought movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics, since the 20th century in Flanders mainly via the Christian trade union ACV and the Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V). According to the \"2001 Survey and Study of Religion\", about 47 percent of the Belgian population identify themselves as belonging to the Catholic Church, while Islam is the second-largest religion at 3.5 percent. A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered more religious than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious, and 36% believed that God created the world.\n\nJews have been present in Flanders for a long time, in particular in Antwerp. More recently, Muslims have immigrated to Flanders, now forming the largest minority religion with about 3.9% in the Flemish Region and 25% in Brussels. The largest Muslim group is Moroccan in origin, while the second largest is Turkish in origin.\n\nEducation is compulsory from the ages of six to 18, but most Flemings continue to study until around 23. Among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 1999, Flanders had the third-highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in postsecondary education. Flanders also scores very high in international comparative studies on education. Its secondary school students consistently rank among the top three for mathematics and science. However, the success is not evenly spread: ethnic minority youth score consistently lower, and the difference is larger than in most comparable countries.\n\nMirroring the historical political conflicts between the freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they must be able to prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation . The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.\n\nDuring the school year 2003–2004, 68.30% of the total population of children between the ages of six and 18 went to subsidized private schools (both religious schools or 'methodical pedagogies' schools).\n\nThe big freedom given to schools results in a constant competition to be the \"best\" school. The schools get certain reputations amongst parents and employers. So it's important for schools to be the best school since the subsidies depend on the number of pupils. This competition has been pinpointed as one of the main reasons for the high overall quality of the Flemish education. However, the importance of a school's reputation also makes schools more eager to expel pupils that don't perform well. Resulting in the ethnic differences and the well-known waterfall system: pupils start high in the perceived hierarchy, and then drop towards more professional oriented directions or \"easier\" schools when they can't handle the pressure any longer.\n\nHealthcare is a federal matter, but the Flemish Government is responsible for care, health education and preventive care.\n\nAt first sight, \"Flemish culture\" is defined by the Dutch language and its gourmandic mentality, as compared to the more Calvinistic Dutch culture. Dutch and Flemish paintings enjoyed more equal international admiration.\n\nThe standard language in Flanders is Dutch; spelling and grammar are regulated by a single authority, the Dutch Language Union (\"Nederlandse Taalunie\"), comprising a committee of ministers of the Flemish and Dutch governments, their advisory council of appointed experts, a controlling commission of 22 parliamentarians, and a secretariate. The term Flemish can be applied to the Dutch spoken in Flanders; it shows many regional and local variations.\n\nThe biggest difference between Belgian Dutch and Dutch used in the Netherlands is in the pronunciation of words. The Dutch spoken in the north of the Netherlands is typically described as being \"sharper\", while Belgian Dutch is \"softer\". In Belgian Dutch, there are also fewer vowels pronounced as diphthongs. When it comes to spelling, Belgian Dutch language purists historically avoided writing words using a French spelling, or searched for specific translations of words derived from French, while the Dutch prefer to stick with French spelling, as it differentiates Dutch more from the neighbouring German. For example, the Dutch word \"punaise\" (English: \"Drawing pin\") is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word \"duimspijker\" (literally: \"thumb spike\") as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch. Other proposals by purists were sometimes accepted, and sometimes reverted again in later spelling revisions. As language purists were quite often professionally involved in language (e.g. as a teacher), these unofficial purist translations are found more often in Belgian Dutch texts.\n\nThe earliest example of literature in non-standardized dialects in the current area of Flanders is Hendrik van Veldeke's \"Eneas Romance\", the first courtly romance in a Germanic language (12th century). With a writer of Hendrik Conscience's stature, Flemish literature rose ahead of French literature in Belgium's early history. Guido Gezelle not only explicitly referred to his writings as Flemish but used it in many of his poems, and strongly defended it:\nOriginal \n<poem>\n\"Gij zegt dat ’t vlaamsch te niet zal gaan:\"\n\"’t en zal!\"\n\"dat ’t waalsch gezwets zal boven slaan:'\n\"’t en zal!\"\n\"Dat hopen, dat begeren wij:\"\n\"dat zeggen en dat zweren wij:\"\n\"zoo lange als wij ons weren, wij:\"\n\"’t en zal, ’t en zal,\"\n\"’t en zal!\"\n</poem>\n\nTranslation . For explanations, continue along\n\"It shan't!\"\n\"This we hope, for this we hanker:\"\n\"this we say and this we vow:\"\n\"as long as we fight back, we:\"\n\"It shan't, It shan't,\"\n\"It shan't!\"\n</poem>\nThe distinction between Dutch and Flemish literature, often perceived politically, is also made on intrinsic grounds by some experts such as Kris Humbeeck, professor of Literature at the University of Antwerp. Nevertheless, most Dutch-language literature read (and appreciated to varying degrees) in Flanders is the same as that in the Netherlands.\n\nInfluential Flemish writers include Ernest Claes, Stijn Streuvels and Felix Timmermans. Their novels mostly describe rural life in Flanders in the 19th century and at beginning of the 20th. Widely read by the older generations, they are considered somewhat old-fashioned by present-day critics. Some famous Flemish writers of the early 20th century wrote in French, including Nobel Prize winners (1911) Maurice Maeterlinck and Emile Verhaeren. They were followed by a younger generation, including Paul van Ostaijen and Gaston Burssens, who \"activated\" the Flemish Movement. Still widely read and translated into other languages (including English) are the novels of authors such as Willem Elsschot, Louis Paul Boon and Hugo Claus. The recent crop of writers includes the novelists Tom Lanoye and Herman Brusselmans, and poets such as the married couple Herman de Coninck and Kristien Hemmerechts.\n\nAt the creation of the Belgian state, French was the only official language. Historically Flanders was a Dutch-speaking region. For a long period, French was used as a second language and, like elsewhere in Europe, commonly spoken among the aristocracy. There is still a French-speaking minority in Flanders, especially in the municipalities with language facilities, along the language border and the Brussels periphery (Vlaamse Rand), though many of them are French-speakers that migrated to Flanders in recent decades.\n\nIn French Flanders, French is the only official language and now the native language of the majority of the population, but there is still a minority of Dutch-speakers living there. French is also the primary language in the officially bilingual Brussels Capital Region, (see Francization of Brussels).\n\nMany Flemings are also able to speak French, children in Flanders generally get their first French lessons in the 5th primary year (normally around 10 years). But the current lack of French outside the educational context makes it hard to maintain a decent level of French. As such, the proficiency of French is declining. Flemish pupils are also obligated to follow English lessons as their third language. Normally from the second secondary year (around 14 years old), but the ubiquity of English in movies, music, IT and even advertisements makes it easier to learn and maintain the English language. This makes the Flemish people very proficient in English (in Europe, only Sweden and Malta have a better knowledge of English as a second language).\n\nThe public radio and television broadcaster in Flanders is VRT, which operates the TV channels één, Canvas, Ketnet, OP12 and (together with the Netherlands) BVN. Flemish provinces each have up to two TV channels as well. Commercial television broadcasters include vtm and Vier (VT4). Popular TV series are for example \"Thuis\" and \"F.C. De Kampioenen\".\n\nThe five most successful Flemish films were \"Loft\" (2008; 1,186,071 visitors), \"Koko Flanel\" (1990; 1,082,000 tickets sold), \"Hector\" (1987; 933,000 tickets sold), \"Daens\" (1993; 848,000 tickets sold) and \"De Zaak Alzheimer\" (2003; 750,000 tickets sold). The first and last ones were directed by Erik Van Looy, and an American remake is being made of both of them, respectively \"The Loft\" (2012) and \"The Memory of a Killer\". The other three ones were directed by Stijn Coninx.\n\nNewspapers are grouped under three main publishers: De Persgroep with \"Het Laatste Nieuws\", the most popular newspaper in Flanders, \"De Morgen\" and \"De Tijd\". Then Corelio with \"\", the oldest extant Flemish newspaper, \"Het Nieuwsblad\" and \"De Standaard\". Lastly, Concentra publishes \"Gazet van Antwerpen\" and \"Het Belang van Limburg\".\n\nMagazines include \"Knack\" and \"HUMO\".\n\nAssociation football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in both parts of Belgium, together with cycling, tennis, swimming and judo.\n\nIn cycling, the Tour of Flanders is considered one of the five \"Monuments\". Other \"Flanders Classics\" races include \"Dwars door Vlaanderen\" and Gent–Wevelgem. Eddy Merckx is widely regarded as the greatest cyclist of all time, with five victories in the Tour de France and numerous other cycling records. His hour speed record (set in 1972) stood for 12 years.\n\nJean-Marie Pfaff, a former Belgian goalkeeper, is considered one of the greatest in the history of football (soccer).\n\nKim Clijsters (as well as the French-speaking Belgian Justine Henin) was Player of the Year twice in the Women's Tennis Association as she was ranked the number one female tennis player.\n\nKim Gevaert and Tia Hellebaut are notable track and field stars from Flanders.\n\nThe 1920 Summer Olympics were held in Antwerp. Jacques Rogge has been president of the International Olympic Committee since 2001.\n\nThe Flemish government agency for sports is Bloso.\n\nFlanders is known for its music festivals, like the annual Rock Werchter, Tomorrowland and Pukkelpop. The Gentse Feesten are another very large yearly event.\n\nThe best-selling Flemish group or artist is the (Flemish-Dutch) group 2 Unlimited, followed by (Italian-born) Rocco Granata, Technotronic, Helmut Lotti and Vaya Con Dios.\n\nThe weekly charts of best-selling singles is the Ultratop 50. \"Kvraagetaan\" by the Fixkes holds the current record for longest time at #1 on the chart.\n"}

In an editorial, Daniel C. Edelson, vice president for education at National Geographic, said, \"The National Geographic Society's concern for geo-literacy comes from our mission. We see geo-literacy as providing the tools that will enable communities to protect natural and cultural resources, reduce violent conflict, and improve the quality of life worldwide. However, having a geo-literate populace is also critical for maintaining economic competitiveness, quality of life, and national security in our modern, interconnected world.\", and have released various media to help explain it to the general public. In addition, the National Geographic Society set up the Fund for Geo-literacy, in which donations help fund the printing of materials for education, professional development for the educators, and programs to help build awareness of the importance of geo-literacy.\n\nAccording to Edelson, the 3 components of geo-literacy are:\n\n\"Kid World Citizen\", a site which provides \"multicultural, educational activities to teach...kids about the world\", and who, listed the following \"age-appropriate lessons to increase geo-literacy in primary school students\":\n\n\nIn 2012, InTeGrate (\"a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues\") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.\n\nIn 2002, Robert E. Nolan of the Education Resources Information Center published a research report/journal article entitled \"Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live\", which included \"a test of physical and geopolitical geography...completed by 321 adults\". The years of formal education and age were correlated with geographic literacy, and informal learning, such as travel, reading, media, was used as the primary source of geographic knowledge for those with higher educational attainment. A notable finding was that women, regardless of education level, scored significantly lower than men.\"\n\nIn 2001, the Arizona Geographic Alliance launched a project called \"The GeoLiteracy Project\" that integrated geography education into reading and writing instruction. In this case, their term \"GeoLiteracy\" referred to the integration of geography and traditional language arts literacy. \n\nIn 1997, Linda Ferguson and Eva LaMar established an educational project they called \"The Geo-Literacy Project\". LaMar describes geo-literacy as \"the use of visual learning and communication tools to build an in-depth understanding -- or literacy -- of geography, geology, and local history.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "59006922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59006922", "title": "Geology of Panama", "text": "Geology of Panama\n\nThe geology of Panama includes the complex tectonic interplay between the Pacific, Cocos and Nazca plates, the Caribbean Plate and the Panama Microplate.\n\nThe Cocos and Nazca plates formed in the Miocene. The Panama Microplate is made of oceanic crust basalt, similar to the basalt plateau at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea. The isthmus formed due to convergent tectonics of the eastern Pacific subduction zone, which created a magmatic arc extending from southern North America.\n\nThe center of the isthmus, from Arenal volcano in Costa Rica to El Valle volcano in Panama was uplifted during the subduction of the unusually thick Cocos Ridge oceanic crust, which also produced the four kilometer high Talamanca Range. The western edge of the Caribbean Plate—the Central American volcanic arc—also collided in the Neogene and was compressed as the South American Plate moved northward. The El Valle volcano is the easternmost stratovolcano in Central America. Dacite and andesite flows from five to 10 million years ago are the oldest rocks, followed by a period of quiet 3.4 million years ago and newer dacite domes and pyroclastic flows between 900,000 and 200,000 years ago. The volcano was the result of crust subduction.\n\nThe combination of these forces produced the Isthmus of Panama and resulted in different sea surface salinity between the Pacific and Atlantic since 4.2 million years ago. It also resulted in massive interchange of species between North and South America and brought global changes in climate and ocean circulation.\nThe Bocas del Toro Archipelago on the western Caribbean coast records local stratigraphy through this period, with Pliocene to Pleistocene coral-reef carbonates overlying Miocene basalt and siliclastic shale.\n\nIn the remote southeastern province of Darien, crystalline basement rock of the San Blas Complex forms massifs in the northeast and southwest, dating to the Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene. These rocks and others in the north such as rhyolite, dacite, basaltic andesite, granodiorite and quartz diorite indicate that the region was a separate magmatic arc until 20 million years ago. In the south, pre-collision basement rocks include radiolarian chert, pillow basalt and diabase.

Some of the Laboratory's influential programs included SYMAP, SYMVU, GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT. The Laboratory's Odyssey project created a geographic information system that served as a milestone in the development of integrated mapping systems. The Laboratory influenced numerous computer graphic, mapping and architectural systems such as Intergraph, Computervision, and Esri.\n\nIn 1963, during a training session held at Northwestern University, Chicago architect Howard T. Fisher encountered computer maps on urban planning and civil engineering produced by Edgar Horwood's group at the University of Washington. Fisher conceived a computer mapping software program, SYMAP (Synergistic Mapping), to produce conformant, proximal, and contour maps on a line printer. Fisher applied for a Ford Foundation grant to explore thematic mapping based on early SYMAP outputs, which was awarded in 1965. In association with Harvard providing facilities in Robinson Hall in Harvard Yard as part of the Graduate School of Design, the Ford Foundation provided $294,000 over three years to seed the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics. Working with programmer Betty Benson, Fisher completed SYMAP for distribution in 1966. Also under Fisher's direction, SYMVU and GRID programs were developed. A 1968 reorganisation followed Fisher reaching Harvard's mandatory retirement age and led to renaming as the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis. From 1972, the Laboratory was based in Graduate School's newly built Gund Hall.\n\nThe Laboratory's original and continuing goals were:\n\nSYMAP's ability to print cheap, albeit low quality, maps using readily available technology led to rapid adoption in the late 1960s. SYMVU software, developed in 1969 to illustrate surface displays, was another popular product. GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT products further explored the raster versus vector approach to mapping. The Laboratory gained a reputation for solid output leading to several commercially successful projects and significant budgetary independence for a research institute. Some struggles with restructuring Geographic Base Files - Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF-DIME files, an early vector and polygonal data structure) for the Census Bureau's Urban Atlas in 1975 inspired the Laboratory to develop an integrated suite of programs beneath by a common user interface and common data manipulation software. In 1978 this suite became the Odyssey project. The Odyssey project's aim was to produce a vector GIS that provided spatial analysis of many different forms within a single system.\n\nAs of 1980, in addition to early Odyssey modules, the Laboratory sold the following programs for display and analysis of spatial data\n\nThe 1982 release of Odyssey included seven programs for geographical analysis: Like most of the Laboratory's software, it was written in FORTRAN and operated on several platforms. The POLYPS and PRISM modules could draw maps on a variety of vector display devices.\n\nThe Laboratory distributed software, and later data, at cost, thus encouraging experimentation. The Laboratory conducted correspondence courses, hosted numerous conferences, and worked on environmental planning and architectural projects with the Harvard Graduate School of Design. From 1978 to 1983, the Laboratory hosted a popular annual Harvard Computer Graphics Week. Geoffrey Dutton, a Research Associate at the Laboratory from 1969 through 1984, created the first holographic thematic map, \"America Graph Fleeting\" in 1978. This rotating strip of 3,000 holograms depicted an animated sequence of 3d maps showing US population growth from 1790 to 1970, generated by the Laboratory's ASPEX program. Dutton also contributed the program DOT.MAP to the Laboratory's family of distributed software (1977). In 1977 James Dougenik, Duane Niemeyer, and Nicholas Chrisman developed contiguous area cartograms. Bruce Donald, working at the Laboratory from 1978 to 1984, wrote BUILDER, a program for computer-aided architecture. BUILDER produced plan and shaded perspectives that popularised computer-aided-design in architecture. Donald also wrote the CALYPSO module for the commercial Odyssey project and worked on the GLIB/LINGUIST table-driven language system in collaboration with Nick Chrisman and Jim Dougenik, which was based on automata theory and dynamic scoping. GLIB/LINGUIST provided an English-like user interface for Odyssey, BUILDER, and other HLCG software.\n\nThe early period of the Laboratory saw staff numbers grow to approximately 40 in 1970, but shrink to half a dozen by 1972 as grants expired. The Odyssey project grew the Laboratory from about 12 people in 1977 to forty people by 1981. The Laboratory shrank significantly back to approximately half a dozen people from 1982 until its closure in June 1991.\n\nFrom 1979 the Laboratory was encouraged to develop external software sales and entered into licensing agreements for this purpose, most notably with Synercom and ISSCO Corporation (sold to Computer Associates in 1987) for Odyssey. However, the licensing agreements had weak to non-existent technology exploitation and non-compete clauses, so potential purchasers were frustrated in attempting to license from a competitor often preferentially positioning its proprietary software. Potential purchasers often redeveloped Odyssey functions rather than wait for licenses. Meanwhile, having carved out the potential commercial interests, from 1981 the Harvard Graduate School of Design sought less commercial work and an increased focus on research, though with reduced budgets. \"But the timing of this burgeoning commercialism of the Lab's activities collided with the moment in history when Harvard's President Derek Bok set out to clarify the blurred lines between academic research and development on the one hand, and more clearly defined commercial activities on the other.\" Financial strain and the lack of commercial inspiration for projects led to the dispersal of many team members from 1981. Despite some further research during the late 1980s, the Laboratory closed in 1991.\n\nOdyssey became the template for subsequent GIS software, cited as an inspiration by numerous commercial efforts in mapping and architecture, such as M&S Computing (later Intergraph), Computervision, and Geodat. The Laboratory was an enormous influence on the commercial Environmental Systems Research Institute, Esri, founded in 1969 by Jack Dangermond, a landscape architect graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Design who had worked as a research assistant at the Laboratory during 1968 and 1969. Scott Morehouse, the development lead for the Odyssey project, worked at the lab from 1977 to 1981. When revenues from Odyssey did not meet expectations, his team's resources started to dwindle, and Morehouse left to join Jack at Esri to build a next-generation GIS platform that was to be ArcInfo. Scott's intimate knowledge of the Odyssey geoprocessing model and code base, combined with Jack's insights into how to put the 'IS' in 'GIS' evolved the Laboratory's GIS prototype processors into a system that could effectively and interactively manage, process, edit, and display vector geodata and its scalar attributes that addressed evolving market needs for more robust GIS capabilities.\n"}

He was the tutor of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in England.\n\nElder was a native of Caithness. He passed twelve years of his life at the universities of St. Andrews, Aberdeen, and Glasgow, and appears to have entered the ministry. He went to England soon after the death of James V of Scotland in 1542. At Mary's accession Elder turned Roman Catholic, as is apparent from a letter addressed to Robert Stewart, bishop-elect of Caithness. He sent with it verses and adages written with the hand of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, the bishop's nephew, Elder then being with Darnley, who was not yet nine years of age, at Temple Newsam, Yorkshire. He refers to Darnley's noble parents as his patrons.\n\nThis John Elder seems to be the Scot described by Nicholas Throckmorton at the coronation of Francis II of France(or was it more surely ARTHUR LALLART). Throckmorton wrote on 19 September 1559 that Elder had described the policy of Edmund Bonner Bishop of London and Cardinal Pole in the time of Mary I of England to Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. He added that Elder was \"as great a praticer, and as dangerous for the matters of England, as any that I know.\" Throckmorton advised Elizabeth to have Elder's English acquaintance watched.\n\nIn 1561, Elder told one of the servants of the Earl of Lennox that he had shown Darnley's juvenile handwriting to Mary, Queen of Scots. The servant, possibly Thomas Bishop, was distrustful of him and thought he had the wit to be a spy, \"he haitht wytt to playe the aspye where he listitht.\" He joined Lord Darnley and his wife Mary, Queen of Scots in August 1565, travelling from Flanders, according to a letter of the Earl of Bedford\n\nHe presented to Henry VIII, or Edward VI a 'plot' or map of the realm of Scotland, being a description of all the chief towns, castles, and abbeys in each county and shire, with the situation of the principal isles. In an accompanying letter to Henry, Elder is very severe on David Beaton, denouncing him as the pestiferous cardinal, and his bishops as blind and ignorant; in the subscription he styles himself clerk and a 'redshank,' meaning by the latter designation, it is supposed, 'a roughfooted Scot or highlander.' Presumably for this writing, \"John Elder, Redshank Scott\" was given a reward of £5 on 12 August 1547.\n\nAnother surviving letter by Elder is addressed to Mr. Secretary Paget, dated from Newcastle upon Tyne, 6 October 1545. This gives an account of the operations of the army under the command of the Earl of Hertford in the invasion of Scotland between 8 and 23 September 1545, minutely detailing their daily proceedings, with a list of the towns, villages and steadings burnt each day. He mentions that the Governor of Scotland, Regent Arran, was sick with 'colic & stone', physicians checked his water, and he could not ride.\n\nAs a New Years gift to Lord Robert Stewart, Bishop of Caithness, Elder wrote a description of the wedding of Mary I of England and Philip II of Spain. This was printed in 1555 as, \"The copie of a letter sent in to Scotlande of the arivall and landynge, and most noble marryage of ... Philippe, prynce of Spaine to the ... Princes Marye quene of England solemnisated in the citie of Winchester.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "19918814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19918814", "title": "Landscape photography", "text": "Landscape photography\n\nLandscape photography shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes.\n\nLandscape photography is done for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most common is to recall a personal observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when traveling. Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the elements, some as an escape from the artificial world.\n\nMany landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of nature, devoid of human influence—instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad and may include rural or urban settings, industrial areas or nature photography.\n\nNotable landscape photographers include Ansel Adams, Mark Gray, Galen Rowell, and Edward Weston.\n\nSome of the most important and celebrated landscape photographers have been motivated by an appreciation of the beauty of the natural environment and a desire to see it preserved. The work of William Henry Jackson in the mid-19th century was instrumental in convincing Congress in 1872 to create Yellowstone, the first national park in the United States. Photography produced by Philip Hyde for the Sierra Club found extensive use in promoting the preservation of natural places in the Western United States during the 20th century. Renowned landscape photographer Ansel Adams received both a Conservation Service Award and a Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of the influence of his work on the preservation of wilderness and fostering of environmental consciousness.\n\nLandscape photography commonly involves daylight photography of natural features of land, sky and waters, at a distance—though some landscapes may involve subjects in a scenic setting nearby, even close-up, and sometimes at night.\n\nPhotography of artificial scenery, such as farm fields, orchards, gardens and architecture, may be considered \"landscape\" photography as well. Even the presence of man-made structures (buildings, roads and bridges, etc.) or art (such as sculpture) may be considered \"landscape\" if presented in artistic settings or appearing (or photographed) in artistic style.\n\nFurther, landscape photography is typically of relatively stationary subjects—arguably a form of \"still life.\" This tends to simplify the task, as opposed to photography of kinetic or live subjects. However, landscape photography often overlaps the activity of wildlife photography and the two terms are used somewhat interchangeably; both wildlife and landscapes may be elements of the same picture or body of work.\n\nLandscape photography typically requires relatively simple photographic equipment, though more sophisticated equipment can give a wider range of possibilities to the art. An artist's eye for the subject can yield attractive and impressive results even with modest equipment.\n\nAny ordinary (or sophisticated) camera -- film camera or digital camera—can be readily used for common landscape photography. Higher-resolution and larger-format digital cameras (or larger-format film cameras) permit a greater amount of detail and a wider range of artistic presentation.\n\nHowever, a larger-format camera yields a more limited depth of field (range of the scene that is in focus) for a given aperture value, requiring greater care in focusing (see: \"Shutter Speed and Aperture\", below).\n\nA camera with \"panorama\" function or frame can permit very wide images suitable for capturing a panoramic view.\n\nFor \"wide open spaces,\" a wide-angle lens is generally the preferred lens, allowing a broad angle of view. However, medium-range to telephoto lenses can achieve satisfying imagery, as well, and can enable the capture of detailed scenery of smaller areas at greater distances. Telephoto lenses can also facilitate limited ranges of focus, to enable the photographer to emphasize a specific area, at a fairly specific distance, in sharp focus, with the foreground and background blurred (see: depth of field). A big difference between a wide-angles lens and a telephoto lens is the compression of the landscape; the wider the angle the more distance will appear between the foreground and background elements; however, a telephoto lens will make the same elements appear closer to each other. Other lenses that can help include the fisheye lens for extremely wide angles and dramatic effect, and the macro/micro lens for extreme close-up work. While variable-range zoom lenses are widely used, some landscape photographers prefer fixed-range prime lenses to provide higher clarity and quality in the image.\n\nThe sensitivity to light, of the medium—the film or the digital camera sensor—is important in landscape photography, especially where great detail is required. In bright daylight, a \"slow film\" (low-ISO film), or low-ISO digital camera sensor sensitivity setting (typically ISO 100, or perhaps 200), is generally preferred, allowing maximum precision and evenness of image.\n\nHowever, if there is movement in the scene, and the scene is in lower light—as with cloudy days, twilight, night, or in shaded areas—a higher ISO (up to the limits of the film or camera sensor, depending upon the shortage of light) may be desirable, to ensure that fast shutter speeds can be used to \"freeze\" the motion.\n\nNormally, landscape photography—being focused primarily on natural beauty—tends to be done with only naturally occurring ambient light.\n\nIn some cases, however, artificial light is recommended or unavoidable. Careful use of flash, continuous artificial lighting or reflective surfaces (e.g.: reflectors) for \"fill\" in shadowy areas is often used in close-up landscape photography (e.g.: garden spaces, small areas of dark forests, etc.).\n\nHowever, given the broad expanses of open space that tend to dominate in landscape photography, artificial lighting is typically ineffective, or even destructive (causing the foreground to be wildly over-lit, and the background to become overly dark).\n\nLight at dawn or dusk, or just before or after those times (especially at sunrise, or during the \"golden hour\" just before sunset), is often considered the best for capturing detail, showing scenes in the best colors of light, or otherwise generating impressive and attractive images.\n\nWith cameras that allow a variety of shutter speeds and lens apertures, landscape photographers tend to prefer settings that allow all of the viewed area to be in sharp focus. This typically requires a small aperture (a high f-stop), which creates only a small hole for the light to come into the camera from the lens, ensuring that as much of the field of view is in focus as possible (see: depth of field).\n\nWith a small aperture, however, a slower shutter speed (longer exposure) may be required to compensate for the limited amount of light squeezing in through the small aperture. This can be a problem if there are kinetic elements in the picture, such as moving animals (especially birds), people or vehicles. It can also be a problem if the environment is kinetic (in motion), such as wind blowing and shaking all the trees and plants in the scene, or if water is flowing. Slow shutter speeds can also be a problem if the photographer is in motion (such as shooting a scene from a moving vehicle).\n\nConsequently, some compromise between shutter speed and aperture may be necessary, or advisable. To some extent, a higher-ISO film or digital camera setting can compensate without the need to alter shutter speed or aperture. However, higher ISO settings (\"fast film\") can result in grainy pictures and poor capture of details, especially at a distance.\n\nIn some cases, a slow shutter speed is desired to show movement of the subjects, particularly moving water or the effects of wind.\n\nFilters can serve a wide range of purposes in landscape photography.\n\nFor instance, a polarizing filter can darken the sky, while allowing surface features to be shown in relatively sharper clarity. Polarizing filters also help with cutting glare from water reducing reflections, snow and ice—even facilitating greater transparency of water and ice.\n\nNeutral density filters are darkened with a neutral (colorless) gray tint which reduces the amount of light entering the camera lens. These filters are used to lengthen shutter speeds without the need to alter aperture or film/sensor sensitivity, or alternatively, to use large apertures without exceeding the maximum shutter speed of a camera. A variation of this filter, termed the graduated neutral density filter or simply 'ND grad', transitions from dark, neutral gray on one side to clear on the opposite side. Photographers use these filters to lower natural contrasts by reducing light transmission from the brightest portion of the subject landscape, while letting light from the darker portion of the landscape enter the lens unobstructed.\n\nUV-Zero haze filters reduce \"purple fringing\" caused by ultraviolet light, especially in digital situations. They are also recommended by some professional photographers as protection for the vulnerable lens, especially when outdoors or in dynamic situations.\n\nColor filters can create other effects, or compensate for the appearance of unnatural lighting due to camera characteristics.\n\nIn order to mitigate shaking associated with hand-holding a camera, landscape photography oftentimes requires a firm camera footing which affords the potential for sharper imagery. Tripods are specifically designed for stabilizing cameras and are widely regarded as essential equipment for landscape photography. However, any firm surface unaffected by vibration, wind or human contact may offer similar benefits. The use of a timer, remote control or cable release allows the shutter to be tripped without the introduction of vibration that might result from manually depressing the shutter button.\n\nSome modern, high-quality cameras also provide image stabilization, which compensates for vibration by moving inner workings of the camera, or electronically correcting the photograph.\n\nBecause landscape photography is normally outdoors photography, protection from the elements can be helpful. Shooting from inside a sheltering structure or stationary vehicle (engine off, occupants stationary) can be helpful. Use of an umbrella or other shield to keep camera and photographer dry can also be helpful. A waterproof container for the camera, with drying agent inside (e.g.: dry cloth) may be advised, and experts advise that the camera should be shielded from blowing dust, snow, and rain, and extremely harsh direct sunlight.\n\n"}

The franchises were reallocated several times and now, except for two in Scotland, all the franchises are owned by ITV plc, and are branded as ITV or UTV. The network contains a variety of programming, such as entertainment, dramas, documentaries, news, films and sport. A timeshift channel, ITV +1, is available on Freeview, Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media.\n\nAfter 1964, the fourth push-button channel selector on British televisions was traditionally labelled \"ITV2\", in the expectation that the second commercial channel would be awarded to ITV in the near future. In the event, Channel 4 claimed the button when it launched in 1982. It was not until 1998 that ITV launched its first new digital channel, known as ITV2. This combines more repeated and new entertainment and films as well as behind the scenes and imported programmes for the modern world. It is available on all digital services and broadcasts 24 hours a day. A timeshift channel, ITV2 +1, is available on Freeview, Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media. Before 2 August 2011, ITV2 +1 was only available on Freeview between 19:00 and 06:00, as it was forced to timeshare with CITV, and, in Scotland, TeleG (until it closed).\n\nITV2 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV2. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel.\n\nITV plc's third channel was launched on 1 November 2004 as ITV3. It was initially thought that ITV3 would continue alongside Plus, broadcasting only on Freeview and cable, but at a last minute deal made it available on Sky, replacing Plus on all platforms (except Freeview). It usually shows murder mysteries, classic dramas and movies. ITV3 is also available on all digital services and is available between 06:00 and 03:00, with teleshopping taking up the early hours of the day. A timeshift channel, ITV3 +1, is available on Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media.\n\nITV3 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV3. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel.\n\nITV4 is a digital channel based targeted at men. It began broadcasting on 1 November 2005. It broadcasts for the same amount of time as ITV3. It usually shows sport events, archival programming, and, similarly to ITV3, movies. A timeshift channel, ITV4 +1, is available on Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media.\n\nITV4 HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel of ITV4. It is available on Sky and Virgin Media as a pay-TV channel.\n\nITVBe is a lifestyle television channel from ITV plc, which launched on 8 October 2014. The channel broadcasts programmes previously broadcast on ITV2 such as \"The Real Housewives\" franchise and scripted reality show \"The Only Way Is Essex\". The channel is available free-to-air on Freeview, Sky and Virgin Media. A high-definition simulcast and timeshift channel, ITVBe HD and ITVBe +1, are also available.\n\nThe CITV channel is aimed at children under 12 years old, and broadcasts daily between 06:00 and 21:00. The channel launched on 11 March 2006 at 09:25 with \"Holly & Stephen's Saturday Showdown\", on Freeview, Virgin Media and TalkTalk TV. It then launched on Sky on 8 May 2006 at 06:00, with other platforms to follow. The channel replaced the ITV News Channel on Freeview. In February 2008 it was moved to a space originally held by ABC1, allowing ITV4 to go 24/7 on Freeview; however, this means that it can no longer be received in Wales via Freeview because the channel would interfere with S4C if available in Wales. On 9 January 2012, a change in the FEC mode on the multiplex allowed CITV to broadcast in Wales on Freeview.\n\nITV Box Office is a pay-per-view sports channel from ITV plc, which launched on 4 February 2017. The channel broadcasts live events such as boxing and is available on Sky, Virgin Media and online.\n\nITV HD is the simulcast high-definition television channel created by ITV. It was first trialled primarily to show the 2006 World Cup games to which ITV had the rights. It also showed looping previews, it began scheduled broadcasting on 9 June 2006 and ended on 30 November 2006. The full version was released as a simulcast on 17 July 2008 on all platforms.\n\nSTV launched their HD service in June 2010. STV HD broadcasts in Central and Northern Scotland on Virgin Media and Freeview. The channel was made available on the Sky and Freesat EPGs in April 2014.\n\nUTV HD was launched in Northern Ireland in October 2010 exclusively to Virgin Media. It was later added to Freeview on 24 October 2012 after the completion of the digital switchover in the region.\n\nJML Store is a UK television shopping channel, in partnership with JML Direct Limited, and programming block on ITV. Dubbed the \"chatmercial\", The Store combines the format of a chatshow with home TV shopping in front of a studio audience.\n\nThe channel was first launched in November 2011 as \"The Zone\" exclusively on the Freeview platform, but was not available in Wales until 9 January 2012. On Tuesday 1 October, ITV rebranded the channel as \"The Store\", which also launched as a 24-hour channel on Freesat and Sky on the same day. The Freeview channel varies from the satellite feed, as it only broadcasts between 6 pm and 6 am, and airs the live casino programme \"Jackpot247\" daily, between 10 pm and 3 am. On 1 August 2014, it was rebranded as \"JML Store\" on all platforms, except Freeview.\n\nThe ITV network as a whole has owned other spin-off channels. Some were as joint ventures with other broadcasters; others were not.\n\nITV Encore was a drama television channel from ITV plc launched on 9 June 2014. Unlike ITV's other channels it was available exclusively on Sky and Now TV, as part of their subscription packages. A high-definition simulcast and timeshift channel, ITV Encore HD and ITV Encore +1, was also available on Sky. Following an over-reliance on repeated content and less than stellar ratings, the channel closed on 1 May 2018 as part of ITV's plans to turn the channel into a box-set brand. \nITV Play was a 24/7 participation television channel in the United Kingdom. It launched on 19 April 2006 on Freeview, and was also available on Sky Digital. It was embroiled in a scandal involving overpriced premium-rate phone lines, by which ITV plc pulled the channel off air until further notice. The channel's closure was announced on 13 March 2007, and it closed on 15 March 2007. The channel was replaced by ITV2 +1 on Freeview. The brand \"ITV Play\" continued during late night quiz show slots on the ITV Network until December 2007.\n\nWhile ITV plc had intended the make profits from the ITV Play brand, only the late night slots on ITV1 and ITV2 made money.\n\nThe ITV News Channel launched on 1 August 2000 under the name ITN News Channel. Carlton Television and Granada Television bought equal shares from ITN in the network and rebranded it ITV News Channel in September 2002. In April 2004 ITV bought NTL's 35 per cent share and took full control over the channel. The channel was closed on 23 December 2005 due to poor ratings and the launch of ITV4. It was replaced by ITV4 and CITV.\n\nThe ITV Sport Channel, originally broadcasting UEFA Champions League football and ATP Masters Series tennis under the brand ONsport, was ITV's sports channel. It closed with (and indeed was responsible for) the collapse of ITV Digital. Lasting for just one football season; the ITV Sport Channel launched on Saturday 11 August 2001 with Man City v Watford in the First Division, and closed on Sunday 12 May 2002 with the Division 2 Play-off Final between Brentford and Stoke. There were two spinoff channels, ITV Sport Plus and ITV Sport Select, the latter used to show the on-demand Premier League football matches from Sky Sports. Whilst football was the mainstay of the channel, it showed the ATP Masters Series, British basketball and European Cup rugby union. Previously to the ITV Digital rebrand, the ITV Sport bouquet included ONsport 1 and ONsport 2, which were subject to rebrands themselves after ITV bought up the rights to the tennis Masters Series. Before then, the channel had been branded as Champions on 28, and Champions on 99.\n\nThis pay-per-view service on ITV Digital was formerly called ONrequest, which launched with ONdigital. It gave access to films, sport events and exclusive footage. It closed prior to the collapse of the platform due to ITV's financial difficulties and poor uptake.\n\nOriginally \"Granada Good Life\", Granada Breeze was another GSB owned venture. This was a lifestyle channel aimed at female viewers and showed programmes on lifestyle, cookery, health and US daytime television such as \"Judge Joe Brown\". Cuts to the channel saw original programming drop in favour of US imports, which greatly impacted the channel’s ratings. It closed in January 2002 on Sky and ITV Digital due to poor viewing figures, but continued until April 2002 to honour contracts with NTL and Telewest.\n\nOwned by Granada Sky Broadcasting, a 50-50 joint venture between Granada plc and BSkyB, Granada Plus was a general entertainment channel aimed at older audiences and ran from archived material. The channel, initially launched as \"Granada Plus\", was later known as \"G Plus\" and finally simply \"Plus\". It continued to broadcast until 1 November 2004, when ITV sealed a deal to buy out Sky's stakes in GSB to close down the channel in order for ITV's new channel, ITV3, to take Plus' low EPG position on Sky Digital. The channel was replaced on digital satellite and cable platforms, but a closedown slide continued to be available as late as 2010 on analogue cable. The closedown slide has since become inaccessible to places where analogue cable is no longer supported, as the digital switchover occurred.\n\nMen & Motors was a men's lifestyle television channel in the UK. It was the last remaining station operated by Granada Sky Broadcasting after Plus became the third GSB channel to be closed down, being replaced by ITV3. A joint venture set up by Granada plc (now part of ITV plc) and BSkyB in 1996. Although ITV plc is now the sole owner of GSB, Sky will receive 49.5 per cent of any proceeds (net of liabilities) if Men & Motors is sold.\n\nThe channel was previously available on Freeview but was removed to make way for ITV Play which was then removed to make way for ITV2 +1, but was still available on Sky Digital and Virgin Media. While it was still broadcasting, it was available from 11:00 to 04:00 every day with ITV Nightscreen taking up the hours of 04:00 to 06:00 and a mixture of teleshopping and animated captions between 06:00 and 11:00.\n\nMen & Motors was removed from Virgin Media on 25 March 2010, and closed on 1 April 2010 on Sky Digital and Freesat, making way for ITV HD.\n\nThe last of the original GSB channels, Granada Talk TV focused primarily on chat shows. Due to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in the early hours of 31 August 1997, it ceased broadcasting on 31 August 1997.\n\nThis channel was owned by Carlton Communications showing classic cinema. It closed in 2003 due to poor viewing figures.\n\nOriginally this was the Carlton Food Network, owned by Carlton Communications, showing cooking programmes. This was the first Carlton channel to be launched when it started on cable on 1 September 1996. The channel itself went bust in late 2001 due to financial difficulties. It was never replaced on the ITV Digital platform (but the closure stated that Carlton Cinema would replace this and fill in the gap)\n\nThis was owned by Carlton Communications showing children's television. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures. This channel, like Carlton World, was replaced by a timeshare of the now-defunct Discovery Kids and Discovery Wings on the ONdigital platform.\n\nThis was a channel owned by Carlton Communications showing general entertainment programming. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures; however, it relaunched again in 2002 (for cable television only), suddenly it plunged into extreme risk as Carlton heard rumours about itself merging with Granada to form a single ITV (save for the Granada name). It struggled to keep going, but it failed and shattered, which meant it closed in 2003, due to the rumours of merging. Its slot was used to provide extra hours for Carlton Food Network. The channel had originally been broadcast as SelecTV since June 1995 as a cable exclusive but changed to Carlton Select in early 1997 and started on OnDigital when that platform went on air in late 1998.\n\nThis was a channel owned by Carlton Communications showing factual programming. The channel itself went bust in 2000 due to poor viewing figures. It was replaced by a timeshare of the now-defunct Discovery Kids and Discovery Wings on the ONdigital platform.\n\nShop! was a home shopping channel which was a joint venture between Granada and Littlewoods. It ran from 1999–2002 and was replaced on Freeview by QVC.\n\nWellbeing was a health and beauty focused channel, a joint venture between Granada and Boots which lasted just nine months on air in 2001.\n\nThis was a pan-European cable and satellite channel launched in 1987 by all of the ITV companies except Thames Television (who was a shareholder in the SES Astra satellite operator instead), with the assistance of BBC Worldwide (then Enterprises) and of a few other third parties, such as the independent music television producer Music Box. This channel aimed to beam a selection of the best of British television from both past and present (from both the BBC and ITV) to those living in mainland Europe. It was aimed both at foreign viewers and British expatriates, along with the syndicated ITN World News and a few other programmes coming from other European countries (such as Holland). However, the channel ran into severe financial difficulties almost from the start, with rights problems involving Equity demanding full payment of royalties for its archive programming, and poor viewing figures, advertising revenue and profits. The channel eventually had to scrap much of its BBC and ITV output, and after failing to achieve its expectations in 1988 the channel's British shareholders sold the entirety of its shares to the Italian consortium Beta Television, who changed its programming output completely, although it continued carrying the ITN World News and being based in London. In 1993, it was bought by the American broadcaster NBC, relaunching it as NBC Super Channel, later renaming it NBC Europe. It finally closed in 1998. (The BBC launched its own satellite service immediately after the failure of Super Channel, BBC TV Europe (later BBC World Service Television and BBC World).)\n\n\"The Guardian\" newspaper speculated that the failure of Super Channel might have been a historical precedent to the bad luck that ITV has generally had with cable and satellite television.\n\nA joint venture between Scottish Television and BSkyB, this was a general entertainment channel for the Scottish market. It closed after 18 months on air due to poor viewing figures.\n\nOwned by SMG plc (now known as STV Group plc), this was the Scottish equivalent to ITV2. The channel simulcasted the vast majority of ITV2 programmes, albeit covering the ITV2 DOG with its own. It closed due to poor viewership.\n\nFormerly TV You, owned by UTV plc, this was the Northern Irish equivalent to ITV2. It closed due to poor viewership, and the failure to attract \"any\" advertising during its existence.\n\nUTV Ireland was a general entertainment channel available in Ireland. The channel was launched on 1 January 2015 and broadcast programmes from ITV Studios Global Entertainment such as \"Emmerdale\" and \"Coronation Street\", often simulcast with the main ITV network. The channel was owned by ITV plc since February 2016, following the sale of UTV Media's television assets. In July 2016, ITV announced the sale of UTV Ireland to Virgin Media Ireland, owners of TV3. The channel was replaced by be3 on 9 January 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20942", "title": "Malthusian catastrophe", "text": "Malthusian catastrophe\n\nA Malthusian catastrophe (also known as Malthusian check, Malthusian spectre or Malthusian crunch) is a prediction that population growth will outpace agricultural production – that there will be too many people and not enough food.\n\nIn 1779, Thomas Malthus wrote:\n\nNotwithstanding the apocalyptic image conveyed by this particular paragraph, Malthus himself did not subscribe to the notion that mankind was fated for a \"catastrophe\" due to population overshooting resources. Rather, he believed that population growth was generally restricted by available resources:\n\nMalthus proposed two kinds of population checks: preventive and positive.\n\nA preventive check is a conscious decision to delay marriage or abstain from procreation based on a lack of resources. This type of check is unique to humanity, because it requires foresight. Malthus argued that man is incapable of ignoring the consequences of uncontrolled population growth, and would intentionally avoid contributing to it. According to Malthus, a positive check is any event or circumstance that shortens the human life span. The primary examples of this are war, plague and famine. However, poor health and economic conditions are also considered instances of positive checks.\n\nAfter World War II, mechanized agriculture produced a dramatic increase in productivity of agriculture and the Green Revolution greatly increased crop yields, expanding the world's food supply while lowering food prices. In response, the growth rate of the world's population accelerated rapidly, resulting in predictions by Paul R. Ehrlich, Simon Hopkins, and many others of an imminent Malthusian catastrophe. However, populations of most developed countries grew slowly enough to be outpaced by gains in productivity.\n\nBy the early 21st century, many technologically developed countries had passed through the demographic transition, a complex social development encompassing a drop in total fertility rates in response to various fertility factors, including lower infant mortality, increased urbanization, and a wider availability of effective birth control.\n\nOn the assumption that the demographic transition is now spreading from the developed countries to less developed countries, the United Nations Population Fund estimates that human population may peak in the late 21st century rather than continue to grow until it has exhausted available resources.\n\nHistorians have estimated the total human population back to 10,000 BC. The figure on the right shows the trend of total population from 1800 to 2005, and from there in three projections out to 2100 (low, medium, and high). The United Nations population projections out to 2100 (the red, orange, and green lines) show a possible peak in the world's population occurring by 2040 in the first scenario, and by 2100 in the second scenario, and never ending growth in the third.\n\nThe graph of annual growth rates (at the top of the page) does not appear exactly as one would expect for long-term exponential growth. For exponential growth it should be a straight line at constant height, whereas in fact the graph from 1800 to 2005 is dominated by an enormous hump that began about 1920, peaked in the mid-1960s, and has been steadily eroding away for the last 40 years. The sharp fluctuation between 1959 and 1960 was due to the combined effects of the Great Leap Forward and a natural disaster in China. Also visible on this graph are the effects of the Great Depression, the two world wars, and possibly also the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nShort-term trends, even on the scale of decades or centuries, cannot prove or disprove the existence of mechanisms promoting a Malthusian catastrophe over longer periods. However, due to the prosperity of a major fraction of the human population at the beginning of the 21st century, and the debatability of the predictions for ecological collapse made by Paul R. Ehrlich in the 1960s and 1970s, some people, such as economist Julian L. Simon, question its inevitability.\n\nA 2004 study by a group of prominent economists and ecologists, including Kenneth Arrow and Paul Ehrlich suggests that the central concerns regarding sustainability have shifted from population growth to the consumption/savings ratio, due to shifts in population growth rates since the 1970s. Empirical estimates show that public policy (taxes or the establishment of more complete property rights) can promote more efficient consumption and investment that are sustainable in an ecological sense; that is, given the current (relatively low) population growth rate, the Malthusian catastrophe can be avoided by either a shift in consumer preferences or public policy that induces a similar shift.\n\nA 2002 study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that world food production will be in excess of the needs of the human population by the year 2030; however, that source also states that hundreds of millions will remain hungry (presumably due to economic realities and political issues).\n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels argued that Malthus failed to recognize a crucial difference between humans and other species. In capitalist societies, as Engels put it, scientific and technological \"progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population\". Marx argued, even more broadly, that the growth of both a human population \"in toto\" and the \"relative surplus population\" within it, occurred in direct proportion to accumulation.\n\nHenry George criticized Malthus's view that population growth was a cause of poverty, arguing that poverty was caused by the concentration of ownership of land and natural resources. George noted that humans are distinct from other species, because unlike most species humans can use their minds to leverage the reproductive forces of nature to their advantage. He wrote, \"Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens.\" \n\nEster Boserup suggested that population levels determined agricultural methods, rather than agricultural methods determining population.\n\nJulian Simon was another economist who argued that there could be no global Malthusian catastrophe, because of two factors: (1) the existence of new knowledge, and educated people to take advantage of it, and (2) \"economic freedom\", that is, the ability of the world to increase production when there is a profitable opportunity to do so.\n\nD.E.C. Eversley observed that Malthus appeared unaware of the extent of industrialization, and either ignored or discredited the possibility that it could improve living conditions of the poorer classes.\n\nIn contrast to these criticisms, some individuals, such as Joseph Tainter, argue that science has diminishing marginal returns and that scientific progress is becoming more difficult, harder to achieve, and more costly.\n\n\n"}

As was tradition for Spanish ships of the day, she bore a female saint's name, Santa Clara. However, she was commonly referred to by her nickname, \"La Niña,\" which was probably a pun on the name of her owner, Juan Niño of Moguer. She was a standard caravel-type vessel.\n\nThe other ships of the Columbus expedition were the caravel-type and the carrack-type . \"Niña\" was by far Columbus' favorite. She was originally lateen sail rigged \"caravela latina\", but she was re-rigged as \"caravela redonda\" at Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands, with square sails for better ocean performance. There is no authentic documentation on the specifics of \"Niña\"s design, although Michele de Cuneo, who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, mentioned that \"Niña\" was \"\"about\" 60 toneladas\" (60 tons), which may indicate a medium-sized caravel of around in length on deck. Often said to have had three masts, there is some evidence she may have had four masts.\n\n\"Niña\", like \"Pinta\" and \"Santa María\", was a smaller trade ship built to sail the Mediterranean sea, not the open ocean. It was greatly surpassed in size by ships like of the Hanseatic League, built in 1462, in length, and the English carrack , built during the period 1420–1439, weighing between 1,400 and 2,750 tons, and long, in both weight and length.\n\nOn Columbus' first expedition, \"Niña\" carried 26 men, captained by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón. They left Palos de la Frontera on 3 August 1492, stopping at the Canary Islands on 12 August 1492, and continued westward. Landfall was made in the Bahamas at dawn on 12 October 1492.\n\nOn 14 February 1493, in the east of the Azores, a storm threatened to capsize \"Niña\", and at Columbus' instigation, he and the crew took a series of vows to perform certain acts including religious pilgrimages upon their return to Spain. \"Niña\" reached Lisbon, Portugal, on 4 March 1493, and arrived in Palos de la Frontera on 15 March 1493. On the first voyage to America, the crew of \"Niña\" slept on the deck but adopted the use of hammocks after seeing Native Americans utilizing them.\n\nIn September 1493, \"Niña\" joined a grand fleet of 17 ships for the second voyage to Hispaniola, becoming the flagship for an exploration of Cuba. She was the only ship to survive the 1495 hurricane, returning quickly to Spain in 1496.\n\n\"Niña\" was then chartered for an unauthorized voyage to Rome. She was captured by a pirate corsair when leaving the port of Cagliari and brought to Cape Pula, Sardinia. The Captain, Alonso Medel, escaped with a few men. He stole a boat, rowed back to \"Niña\", and made sail, returning to Cádiz.\n\nIn 1498, she returned to Hispaniola as advance guard of Columbus' Third Voyage. She was lying in wait at Santo Domingo in 1500. In 1501, she made a trading voyage to the Pearl Coast on the island of Cubagua, Venezuela, and no further log of her is found in historic archives.\n\n\"Niña\" logged at least under Columbus' command.\n\nA replica of \"Niña\" was built by the Spanish government for the Columbian Naval Review of 1893. Along with replicas of \"Santa María\" and \"Pinta\" she participated in the review.\n\nA replica of \"Niña\" (based upon theory; there are no known contemporary likenesses of any of the three ships) now sails around the world.\n\nThe 4-masted replica \"Niña\" was built 1988-1991 by engineer and naval researcher John Patrick Sarsfield, British naval historian Jonathan Morton Nance, and a group of master shipbuilders in Bahia, Brazil who were still using design and construction techniques dating back to the 15th century. They built it from heavy, teredo-resistant Brazilian hardwoods using only adzes, axes, hand saws, and chisels. The sails were designed by Nance using square main sails and two aft lateen sails as were used by ships of this size at the end of the 15th century. The crew of \"Niña\" say that it can make about , which is quicker than older designs of the era. The replica weighs 75 tons.\n\nIn 1991, the replica sailed to Costa Rica to take part in the filming of \"\", and \"Niña\" has visited hundreds of North America ports to give the public a chance to see and tour the ship. The vessel continues to visit ports across the Eastern to mid-United States along with its sister replica ship, \"Pinta\". The replicas of \"Niña\" and \"Pinta\" were built in Valença, Brazil using the same methods as the 15th century Portuguese.\n\nOther replicas are located in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States and in Andalusia, Spain (at El Puerto de Santa María and at the Wharf of the Caravels in Palos de la Frontera).\n\nThe historic San Francisco restaurant Bernstein's Fish Grotto was designed to look like \"Niña\".\n\n\n"}

The hotel was located in Orlando, Florida on the corner of Orange Avenue and Central Avenue. Harry Beeman of Beeman Chewing Gum purchased the hotel in 1889 and added two additional stories. The second floor was a favorite spot to view hangings at the Orange County Jail. In the spring of 1922 the Turner Construction Company constructed an eight-story addition to the north of the 1885 5-story wing right next to the Beacham Theatre. The San Juan hotel addition included restaurants, a barber shop, a laundromat, a pharmacy, as well as an office for Braxton Beacham. The hotel first suffered hard times in the 1960s, and on September 7 1975 The San Juan Hotel closed. But the 1976 It was opened again by a businessman but it didn't have enough clientele to stay open so it closed again in 1977. In October 1978 The San Juan reopened as the Grand Central Hotel, a hotel for gay clientele. But turns The San Juan was planning to be demolished holes were cut in the upper floors in preparation for demolition. But around 5 or 6 AM on the morning of January 2 1979 The top 3 stories of the 1885 5-story wing were on fire, There was a water leak which flooded down into the shops on the 1st floor as well, The 1922 8-story wing suffered only smoke and water damage. It is unknown to this day what started the fire. The San Juan Hotel was demolished in August 1980. The Orlando Historic Preservation Board were powerless to save it. On October 1980, the Orlando Historic Preservation board created the Downtown Orlando Historic District.\n\nTunnels connected the Beacham Theatre to the addition to the San Juan and Angebilt Hotels.\n"}

{"id": "1565634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1565634", "title": "Talik", "text": "Talik\n\nA talik is a layer of year-round unfrozen ground that lies in permafrost areas. In regions of continuous permafrost, taliks often occur underneath shallow thermokarst lakes and rivers, where the deep water does not freeze in winter, and thus the soil underneath will not freeze either. Sometimes closed, open and through talik are distinguished. These terms refer to whether the talik is completely surrounded by permafrost, is open to the top (e.g. a thermokarst lake), or open to both top and unfrozen layers beneath the permafrost, respectively.\n\nDue to climate fluctuation or change, some permafrost regions may develop an unfrozen layer between the seasonally thawing/freezing active layer and the permafrost. The layer is called supra-permafrost (above the permafrost) talik; it is different from traditional taliks, which are usually associated with water bodies, in that supra-permafrost talik occurs because the ground that thawed in the summer does not completely refreeze in the winter. Calculations show that climate warming would induce supra-permafrost taliks in intermediately cold regions (in very cold regions, warming simply induces a deeper summer thaw without forming the talik layer; while in warm, shallow permafrost regions, permafrost quickly disappears). This type of taliks has recently been observed in Russia. With time and continued increase in air temperature or snow depth, this talik layer will become thicker and thicker and the deep permafrost layer would eventually disappear. Findings from a scientific study suggest occurrence of open taliks within areas of fault zones and those influenced by large rivers.\n\n"}

A traveling tutorship directed his attention to geography, and he visited many parts of Europe in the pursuit of this study, but especially the Mediterranean lands, including North Africa (Atlas lands), e.g. the Tunisian Sahara (1886), Morocco and Algeria (1888). The “Mediterranean region,” an example in the study of regional geography, is a conception the world owes to Fischer: his thesis for the rank of \"Privatdozent\" in the University of Bonn (1876) was entitled \"Beiträge zur physischen Geographie der Mittelmeerländer\" (Contributions to the physical geography of the lands of the Mediterranean), and his most important publications are a collection of \"Mittelmeerbilder\" (Mediterranean pictures) and his work on the Mediterranean peninsulas of Europe in Alfred Kirchhoff's \"Allgemeine Länderkunde\".\n\nHe held professorships of geography at the University of Kiel (1879-1883) and at University of Marburg from 1883 until his death.

A virtual globe provides the user with the ability to freely move around in the virtual environment by changing the viewing angle and position. Compared to a conventional globe, virtual globes have the additional capability of representing many different views on the surface of the Earth. These views may be of geographical features, man-made features such as roads and buildings, or abstract representations of demographic quantities such as population.\n\nOn November 20, 1997, Microsoft released an \"offline\" virtual globe in the form of \"Encarta Virtual Globe 98\", followed by Cosmi's 3D World Atlas in 1999. The first widely publicized \"online\" virtual globes were NASA World Wind (released in mid-2004) and Google Earth (mid-2005). NOAA released its virtual globe, Science On A Sphere (SOS) Explorer, in September 2015.\n\nVirtual globes may be used for study or navigation (by connecting to a GPS device) and their design varies considerably according to their purpose. Those wishing to portray a visually accurate representation of the Earth often use satellite image servers and are capable not only of rotation but also zooming and sometimes horizon tilting. Very often such virtual globes aim to provide as true a representation of the World as is possible with worldwide coverage up to a very detailed level. When this is the case the interface often has the option of providing simplified graphical overlays to highlight man-made features since these are not necessarily obvious from a photographic aerial view. The other issue raised by such detail available is that of security with some governments having raised concerns about the ease of access to detailed views of sensitive locations such as airports and military bases.\n\nAnother type of virtual globe exists whose aim is not the accurate representation of the planet but instead a simplified graphical depiction. Most early computerized atlases were of this type and, while displaying less detail, these simplified interfaces are still widespread since they are faster to use because of the reduced graphics content and the speed with which the user can understand the display.\n\nAs more and more high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial photography become accessible for free, many of the latest online virtual globes are built to fetch and display these images. They include:\n\n\nAs well as the availability of satellite imagery, online public domain factual databases such as the CIA World Factbook have been incorporated into virtual globes.\n\nAlthough by default the World Wind download only comes with public domain imagery from the USGS and Landsat 7, Community members have made available high resolution imagery for New Zealand and New York, here and additional countries, as well as Microsoft's Virtual Earth data (for non-commercial purposes)\n\nGoogle Earth, NASA World Wind and Norkart Virtual Globe save a cache of downloaded imagery to the user's hard disk, enabling them to be used offline to view previously viewed areas. However, Google Earth cannot be activated without logging into its server the first time it is used.\n\nThe Google Earth's cache size is limited to 2000 MB whereas World Wind has no limit on cache size. In Norkart Virtual Globe the disk cache can be set by the user.\n\nIn addition to downloaded images, NASA World Wind also comes with the complete 500 m Blue Marble imagery and global placenames including countries, capitals, counties, cities, towns and historical references that are available from install.\n\nWorld Wind is also capable of displaying MODIS imagery from the JPL Aqua and Terra satellites. An add-on allows for near-real-time MODIS imagery.\n\nGoogle Earth and Virtual Earth 3D are both capable of displaying many more urban areas in high-resolution thanks to their private image sources. Both companies also hire chartered flights over major cities of the U.S. to take aerial images.\n\nScience On A Sphere (SOS) Explorer is the desktop version of NOAA's Science On A Sphere which is installed in 130+ museums around the world. It includes environmental datasets, NASA blue marble imagery, and was developed using the Unity 3D game engine. Focusing on Earth science education, it supports videos, tours, web content, satellite imagery, and KML.\n\nMarble (KDE) is designed for use in lightweight environments without 3D hardware acceleration and is capable of not only being used as a standalone application, but also as a component in other applications, such as in a \"World Clock\" Plasma (KDE) and for geolocation in the photo management software digiKam.\n\n3D Weather Globe & Atlas comes with complete 1 km Blue Marble imagery, 40,000 locations database, countries and time zones overlays. Application requires Internet connection only for online features: satellite cloud cover and real-time weather and forecast data.\n\nWorldwide Telescope data support includes raster and vector types, the latter including up to 700,000 points in a single layer..\n\nosgEarth uses a .earth XML map description to configure both web map services and local data sources. osgEarth developers are able to use ReadyMap.org free data services that hosts a 15m global basemap derived from the GLCF Landsat imagery, 90M SRTM elevation dataset derived from CGIAR SRTM, and world-wide street vector overlay from OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe use of virtual globe software was widely popularized by (and may have been first described in) Neal Stephenson's famous science fiction novel \"Snow Crash\". In the metaverse in Snow Crash there is a piece of software called Earth made by the Central Intelligence Corporation. The CIC uses their virtual globe as a user interface for keeping track of all their geospatial data, including maps, architectural plans, weather data, and data from real-time satellite surveillance.\n\nVirtual globes (along with all hypermedia and virtual reality software) are distant descendants of the Aspen Movie Map project, which pioneered the concept of using computers to simulate distant physical environments (though the Movie Map's scope was limited to the city of Aspen, Colorado).\n\nMany of the functions of virtual globes were envisioned by Buckminster Fuller who in 1962 envisioned the creation of a Geoscope that would be a giant globe connected by computers to various databases. This would be used as an educational tool to display large scale global patterns related to topics such as economics, geology, natural resource use, etc.\n\n\n\n"}

Many scholars believe that the image of Yomi was derived from ancient Japanese tombs in which corpses were left for some time to decompose.\n\nThe kanji that are sometimes used to transcribe \"Yomi\" actually refer to the mythological Chinese realm of the dead called Diyu or Huángquán (黄泉, lit. \"Yellow Springs\"), which appears in Chinese texts as early as the eighth century BCE. This dark and vaguely defined realm was believed to be located beneath the earth, but it was not until the Han Dynasty that the Chinese had a clearly articulated conception of an underworld below in contrast with a heavenly realm above. The characters are \"jukujikun\", i.e. were used without regard to the actual meaning of the word Yomi, which is unknown. With regard to Japanese mythology, Yomi is generally taken by commentators to lie beneath the earth and is part of a triad of locations discussed in Kojiki: , , and or . Yomi has also often been associated with the mythological realm of , also known as .\n\nYomi is ruled over by Izanami no Mikoto, the Grand Deity of Yomi (\"Yomo-tsu-Ōkami\" 黄泉大神). According to Kojiki, the entrance to Yomi lies in Izumo province and was sealed off by Izanagi upon his flight from Yomi, at which time he permanently blocked the entrance by placing a massive boulder (\"Chigaeshi no ōkami\" 道反の大神) at the base of the slope that leads to Yomi (\"Yomotsu Hirasaka\" 黄泉平坂 or 黄泉比良坂). Upon his return to Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, Izanagi noted that Yomi is a \"polluted land\" (\"kegareki kuni\"). This opinion reflects the traditional Shinto association between death and pollution. Later Susanoo takes this position over.\n\nSome Japanese Christian texts use 黄泉 to refer to what is called Hell in the English versions. For example, Revelation 6:8,\n\n"}

Among the various other geographic features believed of Diyu, the capital city has been thought to be named Youdu. It is generally conceived as being similar to a typical Chinese capital city, such as Chang'an, but surrounded with and pervaded with darkness.\n\n\"You\" (幽) in Chinese means \"dark\". \"Du\" (都) means \"capital\". Thus, Youdu is the Dark Capital (Yang 2005: 236). Among other meanings, \"You\" can mean \"hidden\", \"secluded\", and is in particular used to indicate the underworld.\n\nYoudu is located under the earth, in the Region of Darkness, also known as Diyu, or the Yellow Springs. The general ruler of this realm is Houtu, but there are many other functionaries which have been believed to inhabit this region, and with the more important individuals being located in Youdu, as the capital city and seat of government.\n\nYoudu has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes differences exist according to the religious affiliation of the text, for example whether more Buddhist, folk-oriented, or secular. Being located in the darkness underground is the most common feature. Generally, lighting is provided by torches and candles. Youdu may be the best-lit area of Diyu.\n\nYoudu is the home or official residence of various deities, and also the location of their official offices or palaces. The souls of the dead are their fellow inhabitants and subjects. There are also many subordinate demons which serve to carry out the commands of the judges. Many of these are concerned with punishing or processing the souls of the dead for reincarnation. The sovereign deity is generally considered to be King Yama. Beneath him in rank ten other kings serve as judges of the souls of the dead.\n\nVarious creatures also inhabit Youdu, including a creature that can determine truth from falsehood.\n\nYoudu is generally conceived of as similar to a typical historical Chinese capital city, such as Chang'an. Thus, it has a city wall, palaces, a hall of justice, and various residences for the ghosts of the dead. Especially, important is the housing for the official records, which allow the various judges to determine proper punishments or occasionally to allow someone who dies before their officially allotted time has expired to be returned to life. Especially important in this regard are the place of King Yama and the Ten Courts of Justice.\n\nYoudu is a major scene of action in various myths, as well as literary works derived from the myths, legends, or religious descriptions or depictions. In the novel \"Journey to the West\", Sun Wukong visits it repeatedly.\n\n\n"}
