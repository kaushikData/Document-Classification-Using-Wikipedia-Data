The A498 descends from a 277 m (909 ft.) summit at Pen-y-Gwryd and runs south west through the village of Beddgelert and the Aberglaslyn Pass, where it overlaps the A4085. The A498 then passes through Tremadog, overlapping the A487 for a short length before passing under the Cambrian Coast railway and terminating at Penamser on the A497 about a mile west of Porthmadog. At its northern end, the road forms a link via the A4086 with the A5 at Capel Curig, forming a useful holiday route to the Beddgelert/Porthmadog area. At the junctions, the A4086 to Llanberis is the minor road at Pen-y-Gwryd, while the A498 is the minor road at Beddgelert. At Pont Aberglaslyn, the A4085 is the minor road diverging to Penrhyndeudraeth and at Tremadog, the A498 is the major road. The junction west of Tremadog is a roundabout and at Penamser, the A498 is the minor road. \n\nThere is a steep descent of Nantgwynant and some 1¾ miles of this is on a substandard, narrow twisting alignment, where larger vehicles have difficulty in passing. There are further substandard sections in the Aberglaslyn Pass and towards Tremadog and coaches have had difficulty passing in this section. The road passes through Beddgelert by way of a sharp right angled bend over a river bridge, not recommended for articulated vehicles. In the Aberglaslyn Pass the trackbed of the Welsh Highland Railway, now being reconstructed, can be seen on the opposite side of the Afon Glaslyn. At its west end, the route crosses the new A487 Porthmadog Bypass at a roundabout west of Tremadog. \n\nIn late 2008 the Bryn-y-felin road bridge was rebuilt over the Welsh Highland Railway as part of Gwynedd Council's WHR Bridges policy. Unfortunately the bridge was rebuilt without a footpath and of such narrow dimensions that any vehicles wider than a standard car find it difficult to pass.\n\nThe road was created from early toll roads. There was some improvement in the 1960s/70s in Nantgwynant and south of the Aberglaslyn Pass. Just south of the Goat Hotel in Beddgelert is an arched railway overbridge (with height and width restrictions) built by the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway but never used.\n"}

It is a rare example of savannas formed due to edaphic factors, i.e. the growth of trees is restricted not by climate but by a shallow layer of clay. This impervious hardpan clay layer restricts the growth of roots and magnifies both seasonal flooding and seasonal drought. These factors combined with regular exposure to the uninterrupted tropical sun make the savannas a hostile environment for most plants and animals.\n\nAlthough the edaphic layer is distinct, the Aripo savannas is ecologically similar to other tropical hypersesonal savannas, such as those found within Gran Sabana in Venezuela or Cerrado in Brazil. In fact, some of the dominant grassland species are shared between all three savannas.\n\nThe savannas are home to many rare plants, including at least two endemic species: \"Rhynchospora aripoensis\" and \"Xyris grisebachii\". They also provides a habitat for several rare and threatened animals. In the past, the area has been exposed to considerable disturbance due to human activity, but the savannas along with the associated Marsh and Palm forests are now protected within the 1,788 hectare Aripo Savannas Environmentally Sensitive Area.\n"}

The Keia district contains at least two ancient burial caves, Kauvava and Piri Te Umeume, which were accessed by diagonal descents through boulder-strewn roof collapses from the top of the \"makatea\", the limestone cliffs that form a concentric ring around the central basalt core of the island (Anton and Steadman 2003:133, 136). Gill, an early source for the mythology of Mangaia, noted a cave in Keia named Auraka, with one of its two entrances named Kauvava (1876a:71–79). However, according to Anton and Steadman (page 136), Gill's \"description of the physical features of this cave does not match that of the cave currently known as Kauvava\". Gill describes Auraka as a cave which is the 'last resting-place of the dead' (Gill 1876b:202, 243).\n\nIn a few sources on the Internet, Auraka is erroneously described as a Polynesian god of death; these sources also claim that Auraka translates as 'all-devouring'. However, the word 'auraka' in Cook Islands Māori is a prohibitive adverb, with the approximate meaning 'do not'; it does not mean 'all-devouring'. The idea that Auraka is an all-devouring god of death appears to be a false assumption deriving from a misreading of Gill, where 'all-devouring' is his translation of the word 'maumau' in a line from a Mangaian song of mourning. The line that Gill translates as \"From all-devouring Auraka\" is \"O Rākā maumau e!\" (1846b:243). Gill comments on the same page that this is a reference to \"Auraka, the last resting-place of the dead\", and he makes no suggestion that Auraka is a god of death rather than a burial cave. 'All-devouring' is certainly possible as a poetic translation of 'maumau', the basic sense of which is 'to be wasteful'; in the song, it is clear that 'maumau' (and therefore 'all-devouring') is a poetic description, rather than a translation of the name.\n\n"}

Based out of Washington, DC, EESI seeks to be a catalyst moving society away from environmentally damaging fossil fuels and toward a clean energy future. The organization was established in 1984 by a bipartisan and bicameral group of members of the United States Congress who were concerned with global environmental and energy problems.\n\nEESI works to advance policy solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ground-level air pollution; improve public health, energy security, and economic development opportunities; and increase use of renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nThe group seeks to advance its mission through policymaker education, coalition building, and policy development.\n\nEESI grew out of the Environmental Study Conference, a bipartisan and bicameral Congressional caucas originally launched in 1975 by former Congressman Richard (Dick) Ottinger, John Heinz, and Gilbert Gude. Because the Conference was unable to support its work entirely on Congressional funds and rules prohibited the receipt of outside financial support, in 1984 the leadership of the Study Conference launched an independent non-profit, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) to continue the Conference's mission to provide information and policy resources to Congress on energy and environmental issues. EESI was established as a separate and distinct 501(c)(3) non-profit, overseen by an independent board of directors, which included several Members of Congress.\n\nThe founders of the Institute were: Anthony C. Beilenson (D-CA), George Brown, Jr. (D-CA), Bob Edgar (D-PA), Joseph L. Fisher (D-VA), S. William Green (R-NY), Gilbert Gude (R-MD), John Heinz (R-PA), James M. Jeffords (R-VT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Paul N. McCloskey, Jr. (R-CA), Richard L. Ottinger (D-NY), Claudine Schneider (R-RI), John F. Seiberling (D-OH), Vin Weber (R-MN), Howard Wolpe (D-MI), Louis Stokes (D-OH), Augustus Hawkins (D-CA), John Chafee (R-RI), Slade Gorton (R-WA), Gary Hart (D-CO)\n\nFederal Policy\n\nEESI supports policy changes and strategies that will allow the United States and other countries to mitigate climate change, while also reaping the environmental, economic, national security, and public health benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. In practice, this means encouraging federal policymakers to enact legislation and policies promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency and the phasing out of harmful climate pollutants. EESI promotes policies that have bipartisan appeal in a wide range of areas, including buildings, climate change, communities, energy efficiency, industry, public health, renewable energy, rural issues, and transportation.\n\nOn-Bill Financing\n\nIn addition to its federal policy work, EESI launched a community-focused energy efficiency program in 2014, following several years of work on a pilot program in South Carolina (starting in 2010). The On-Bill Financing Project is an ongoing initiative aimed at helping families reduce energy use, cut energy bills, and improve home comfort through an innovative financing approach known as on-bill financing. Participating organizations provide their customers with loans for home energy upgrades, such as better insulation or more energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. These loans are then repaid through a monthly charge on the customer's utility bill. When the program is properly designed, the savings resulting from the energy efficiency upgrades outweigh the cost of the loan, and the customer saves money every month.\n\nEESI's on-bill financing initiative has expanded into a national effort to significantly improve the energy efficiency of homes served by rural electric cooperatives and public power utilities. Because the approach involves no money down (and can be designed to be cash-flow positive), it can work for low-income families that are unable to take advantage of rebates or other efficiency incentives.\n\nBriefings\n\nEESI holds between 25 and 30 Congressional briefings every year to inform Congressional staffers, the federal policymaking community, and the public at large about energy and environmental issues.\n\nThese briefings bring experts from government, industry, and civil society to Capitol Hill for bipartisan discussions on cutting-edge research, success stories, lessons learned, and stakeholder feedback.\n\nBriefing topics have included resilience, national security issues, water issues, energy efficiency, solar power, wind power, geothermal power, hydropower, fuel cells and hydrogen energy, biofuels and biomass, clean energy financing, deploying electric vehicles, mass transit, walkable cities, climate change impacts, short-lived climate pollutants, transmission and the power grid, district energy, and microgrids.\n\nEESI briefings are free, held on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and most are open to the public. In 2013, EESI began livestreaming most of its briefings.\n\nPublications\n\nEESI periodically publishes web articles, issue briefs, and fact sheets on environmental and energy issues and related legislation. Additionally, EESI distributes two weekly newsletters: \"Climate Change News\" (CCN), featuring the main climate-related science, business, and policy stories of the week; and \"Sustainable Bioenergy, Farms, and Forests\" (SBFF), focusing on policy developments in bioenergy and sustainable land use.\n\nAll EESI publications and newsletters are distributed free of charge.\n\n"}

{"id": "1350964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1350964", "title": "Gau (territory)", "text": "Gau (territory)\n\nGau ( , or \"goa\" ) is a Germanic term for a region within a country, often a former or actual province. It was used in medieval times, when it can be seen as roughly corresponding to an English shire. The administrative use of the term was revived as a subdivision during the period of Nazi Germany in 1933–1945. It still appears today in regional names, such as the Rheingau or Allgäu.\n\nThe Germanic word is reflected in Gothic \"gawi\" (neuter; genitive \"gaujis\") and early Old High German \"gewi, gowi\" (neuter) and in some compound names still \"-gawi\" as in Gothic (e.g. \"Durgawi\" \"Canton of Thurgau\", \"Alpagawi\" \"Allgäu\"), later \"gâi, gôi\", and after loss of the stem suffix \"gaw, gao\", and with motion to the feminine as \"gawa\" besides \"gowo\" (from \"gowio\"). Old Saxon shows further truncation to \"gâ, gô\". As a gloss of Latin \"pagus\", a \"gau\" is analogous with a \"pays\" of the Kingdom of France.\n\nOld English, by contrast, has only traces of the word, which was ousted by \"scire\" from an early time, in names such as \"Noxga gā, Ohtga gā\" and perhaps in \"gōman, ġēman\" \"yeoman\", which would then correspond to the Old High German \"gaumann\", although the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" prefers connection of \"yeoman\" to \"young\".\n\nIn the Carolingian Empire, a \"Gau\" was a subdivision of the realm, further divided into Hundreds. The Frankish \"gowe\" thus appears to correspond roughly to the \"civitas\" in other barbarian kingdoms (Visigoths, Burgundians, or the Italian Kingdom of the Lombards). After the end of the Migration Period, the Hundred (\"centena\" or \"hunaria\", Old High German \"huntari\") had become a term for an administrative unit or jurisdiction, independent of the figure hundred. The Frankish usage contrasts with Tacitus' \"Germania\", where a \"pagus\" was a subdivision of a tribal territory or \"civitas\", corresponding to the Hundred, i.e. areas liable to provide a hundred men under arms, or containing roughly a hundred homesteads each, further divided into \"vici\" (villages or farmsteads). Charlemagne, by his capitulary legislation, adopted the \"comitatus\" subdivision and appointed local rulers as deputies of the central Imperial authority.\n\nIn the German-speaking lands east of East Francia, the ' formed the unit of administration of the realm during the 9th and 10th centuries and ruled by a \"Gaugraf\" (\"gau count\"). Similar to many shires in England, during the Middle Ages, many such ' came to be known as counties or \"Grafschaften\", the territory of a \"Graf\" (count) within the Holy Roman Empire. Such a count or \"\" would originally have been an appointed governor, but the position generally became an hereditary vassal princedom, or fief in most of continental Europe.\n\nThe term \"Gau\" was revived in German historical research in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was erroneously considered an ancient administration structure of Germanic peoples. It was adopted in the 1920s as the name given to the regional associations of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Each \"Gau\" denoted an administrative region, created by a party statute dated May 22, 1926. Each \"Gau\" was headed by a \"Gauleiter\". The original 33 \"Gaue\" were generally coterminous with the \"Reichstag\" election districts of the Weimar Republic, based on the constituent states (\"Länder\") and the provinces of Prussia. Following the suppression of the political institutions of the \"Länder\" in the course of the Nazi \"Gleichschaltung\" process and the implementation of \"Reichsstatthalter\" (Reich Deputies) in 1933, the \"Gaue\" became the \"de facto\" administrative regions of the government and each individual \"Gauleiter\" had considerable power within his territory.\n\nWith the beginning of the annexation of neighbouring territories by Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, a new unit of civil administration, the \"Reichsgau\", was established. After the successful invasion of France in 1940, Germany re-annexed Alsace-Lorraine. The former \"département\" of Moselle was incorporated into the \"Gau\" of Saar-Palatinate, while Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin became part of the Gau Baden. Similarly, the formerly independent state of Luxembourg was annexed to Koblenz-Trier, and the Belgian territories of Eupen and Malmedy were incorporated into Cologne-Aachen.\n\nGerman-speaking territories annexed to Germany from 1938 were generally organised into \"Reichsgaue\". Unlike the pre-existing \"Gaue\", the new \"Reichsgaue\" formally combined the spheres of both party and state administration.\n\nFollowing the annexation of Austria in 1938, the country, briefly renamed \"Ostmark\" between 1938 and 1942, was sub-divided into seven \"Reichsgaue\". These had boundaries broadly the same as the former Austrian \"Länder\" (states), with the Tyrol and Vorarlberg being merged as \"Tyrol-Vorarlberg\", Burgenland being divided between Styria and \"Lower Danube\" (\"Niederdonau\", the renamed Lower Austria). Upper Austria was also renamed \"Upper Danube\" (\"Oberdonau\"), thus eliminating the name of \"Austria\" (\"Österreich\" in German) from the official map. A small number of boundary changes also took place, the most significant of which was the massive expansion of Vienna's official territory, at the expense of \"Lower Danube\".\n\nNorthern and eastern territory annexed from the dismembered Czechoslovakia were mainly organised as the \"Reichsgau\" of Sudetenland, with territory to the south annexed to the \"Reichsgaue\" of Lower and Upper Danube.\n\nFollowing the Axis invasion of Poland in 1939, territories of the Pomeranian and Poznań voivodeships as well as the western half of Łódź voivodeship were reannexed to Germany as the Reichsgaue of Danzig-Westpreussen (which also incorporated the former Free City of Danzig) and Wartheland. Other parts of Nazi-occupied Poland were incorporated to bordering gaus of East Prussia and Upper Silesia i.e. Zichenau (region); and Silesian voivodeship with the counties of Oświęcim, Biała respectively.\n\nThe medieval term \"Gau\" (sometimes \"Gäu\"; \"gouw\" in Dutch) has survived as (second, more generic) component of the names of certain regions – some named after a river – in Germany, Austria, Alsace, Switzerland, Belgium, South Tyrol, and the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Jurydyki claimed exemption from the town's jurisdiction, and exerted municipal rights separate from the local laws usually for their owners' financial benefit. \n\nJurydyki were popular already in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of the 16 century, ruled by the ecclesiastic and secular lords and seigneurs eager to break up the legal unity of the town to accommodate favoured colonies of craftsmen not subjected to guild regulations. The Jurydyki were often perceived as a menace withholding municipal taxes and services under the jurisdiction (hence the name) of powerful and wealthy townsmen who founded and owned them. Formed as a separate unit of territorial division between 14th and 16th centuries, the jurydyka-type settlements were a way in which the Roman Catholic Church and the Polish nobility avoided the terms of the royal town charters. Most notably, the Jurydyki were exempted from the specific trade laws allowing only selected merchants and craftsmen to take part in the markets held in the cities. In many Polish cities the Jurydyki were eventually incorporated into the towns as their boroughs. This was the case of Warsaw, which in early 18th century was surrounded by no less than 14 such entities, some of them with as many as 5,000 inhabitants. All of them are now neighbourhoods of Warsaw. \n"}

{"id": "314732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314732", "title": "Roman province", "text": "Roman province\n\nIn Ancient Rome, a province (Latin: \"provincia\", pl. \"provinciae\") was the basic and, until the Tetrarchy (from 293 AD), the largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The word \"province\" in Modern English has its origins in the Latin term used by the Romans.\n\nProvinces were generally governed by politicians of senatorial rank, usually former consuls or former praetors. A later exception was the province of Egypt, incorporated by Augustus after the death of Cleopatra; it was ruled by a governor of only equestrian rank, perhaps as a discouragement to senatorial ambition. This exception was unique, but not contrary to Roman law, as Egypt was considered Augustus' personal property, following the tradition of the kings of the earlier Hellenistic period.\n\nThe Latin term \"provincia\" also had a more general meaning of \"jurisdiction\".\n\nThe Latin word \"provincia\" originally meant any task or set of responsibilities assigned by the Roman senate to an individual who held \"imperium\" (\"right of command\"), which was often a military command within a specified theater of operations. Under the Roman Republic, the magistrates were elected to office for a period of one year, and those serving outside the city of Rome, such as consuls acting as generals on a military campaign, were assigned a particular \"provincia\", the scope of authority within which they exercised their command.\n\nThe territory of a people who were defeated in war might be brought under various forms of treaty, in some cases entailing complete subjection \"(deditio)\". The formal annexation of a territory created a province, in the modern sense of an administrative unit that is geographically defined. Republican-period provinces were administered in one-year terms by the consuls and praetors who had held office the previous year and who were invested with \"imperium\".\n\nRome started expanding beyond Italy during the First Punic War. The first permanent provinces to be annexed were Sicily \"(Sicilia)\" in 241 BC and Sardinia \"(Corsica et Sardinia)\" in 237 BC. Militarized expansionism kept increasing the number of these administrative provinces, until there were no longer enough qualified individuals to fill the posts. \n\nThe terms of provincial governors often had to be extended for multiple years \"(prorogatio)\", and on occasion the Senate awarded \"imperium\" even to private citizens \"(privati)\", most notably Pompey the Great. Prorogation undermined the republican constitutional principle of annual elected magistracies, and the amassing of disproportionate wealth and military power by a few men through their provincial commands was a major factor in the transition from a republic to imperial autocracy.\n\n\nGallia Cisalpina (in northern Italy) was a province in the sense of an area of military command, but was never a province in the sense of an administrative unit. During Rome's expansion in the Italian peninsula, the Romans assigned some areas as provinces in the sense of areas of military command assigned to consuls or praetors (not proconsuls or propraetors as in the case of administrative provinces) due to risks of rebellions or invasions. This was applied to Liguria because there was a series of rebellions, Bruttium and to (Calabria) because of perceived risks of rebellion. \n\nIn the early days of the Roman presence in Gallia Cisalpina, the issue was rebellion. Later, the issue was risk of invasions by warlike peoples east of Italy. The city of Aquileia was founded to protect northern Italy from invasions. Gaius Julius Caesar granted the inhabitants of this region Roman citizenship and incorporated the region into Italy.\n\nIn the so-called Augustan Settlement of 27 BC which established the Roman Empire, the governance of the provinces was regulated. Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, having emerged from the Roman civil wars as the undisputed victor and master of the Roman state, officially laid down his powers, and in theory restored the authority of the Roman Senate. Octavian himself assumed the title \"Augustus\" and was given to govern, in addition to Egypt, the strategically important provinces of Gaul, Hispania and Syria (including Cilicia and Cyprus). \n\nUnder Augustus, Roman provinces were classified as either public or imperial, meaning that their governors were appointed by either the Senate or by the emperor. Generally, the older provinces that existed under the Republic were public. Public provinces were, as before under the Republic, governed by a proconsul, who was chosen by lot among the ranks of senators who were ex-consuls or ex-praetors, depending on the province assigned. \n\nThe major imperial provinces were under a \"legatus Augusti pro praetore\", also a senator of consular or praetorian rank. Egypt and some smaller provinces where no legions were based were ruled by a \"procurator\" (\"praefectus\" in Egypt), whom the emperor selected from non-senators of equestrian rank. \n\nThe status of a province could change from time to time. In AD 68, of a total 36 provinces, 11 were public and 25 imperial. Of the latter, 15 were under \"legati\" and 10 under \"procuratores\" or \"praefecti\".\n\nDuring the Principate, the number and size of provinces also changed, either through conquest or through the division of existing provinces. The larger or more heavily garrisoned provinces (for example Syria and Moesia) were subdivided into smaller provinces to prevent any single governor from holding too much power.\n\n\nEpirus (in western Greece and southern Albania), it was placed under Achaia in 27 BC except for its northernmost part, which remained part of Macedonia.\n\nEmperor Diocletian introduced a radical reform known as the Tetrarchy (284–305), with a western and an eastern \"Augustus\" or senior emperor, each seconded by a junior emperor (and designated successor) styled \"Caesar\", and each of these four defending and administering a quarter of the Empire. In the 290s, Diocletian divided the Empire anew into almost a hundred provinces, including Italy. Their governors were hierarchically ranked, from the proconsuls of Africa proconsularis and Asia through those governed by \"consulares\" and \"correctores\" to the \"praesides\". These last were the only ones recruited from the equestrian class. The provinces in turn were grouped into (originally twelve) dioceses, headed usually by a \"vicarius\", who oversaw their affairs. Only the proconsuls and the urban prefect of Rome (and later Constantinople) were exempt from this, and were directly subordinated to the tetrarchs.\n\nAlthough the Caesars were soon eliminated from the picture, the four administrative resorts were restored in 318 by Emperor Constantine I, in the form of praetorian prefectures, whose holders generally rotated frequently, as in the usual magistracies but without a colleague. Constantine also created a new capital, known after him as Constantinople, which was sometimes called 'New Rome' because it became the permanent seat of the government. In Italy itself, Rome had not been the imperial residence for some time and 286 Diocletian formally moved the seat of government to Mediolanum (modern Milan), while taking up residence himself in Nicomedia. During the 4th century, the administrative structure was modified several times, including repeated experiments with Eastern-Western co-emperors. Provinces and dioceses were split to form new ones, the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum was abolished and reformed. In the end, with the rise of Odoacer in 476 and the death of Julius Nepos in 480, administration of the effectively reduced Empire was permanently unified in Constantinople.\n\nDetailed information on the arrangements during this period is contained in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\" (Record of Offices), a document dating from the early 5th century. Most data is drawn from this authentic imperial source, as the names of the areas governed and titles of the governors are given there. There are however debates about the source of some data recorded in the ', and it seems clear that some of its own sources are earlier than others. It is interesting to compare this with the list of military territories under the \"duces\", in charge of border garrisons on so-called \"limites\", and the higher ranking ', with more mobile forces, and the later, even higher \"magistri militum\".\n\nJustinian I made the next great changes in 534–536 by abolishing, in some provinces, the strict separation of civil and military authority that Diocletian had established. This process was continued on a larger scale with the creation of extraordinary Exarchates in the 580s and culminated with the adoption of the military theme system in the 640s, which replaced the older administrative arrangements entirely. Some scholars use the reorganization of the empire into themata in this period as one of the demarcations between the Dominate and the Byzantine (or the Later Roman) period. As a matter of scholarly convenience, the medieval phase of the Roman Empire is today conventionally referred to as Byzantine, named after the original name of the city that Constantine rebuilt into the new capital of Constantinople.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As such, \"Roman\" was long used in various languages around the Balkans to refer to the lands of that empire. Indeed, today the region is known by , , \"Romylía\", or Ρούμελη, \"Roúmeli\"; ; Macedonian and , \"Rumelija\" and , \"Rumeliya\". In old Latin Genoese documents it is known as \"Romania\", the common name for the Byzantine Empire in the Middle Ages.\n\nOriginally, the Seljuk Turks used the name \"Land of the Rûm\" (Romans) for defining Anatolia, which was gradually conquered by the armies of the Seljuk Empire from the Byzantine Empire following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum (1077–1307) meant the \"Sultanate of Anatolia\".\n\nHowever, following the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Anatolia and the Balkans starting from the second half of the 14th century, and the conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453 by Mehmed II, the term \"Rumeli\" (Land of the Romans) was applied exclusively to define the Balkan regions of the Ottoman Empire, which remained primarily populated by Christians.\n\nRumelia included the provinces of Thrace, Macedonia and Moesia, today's Bulgaria and Turkish Thrace, bounded to the north by the rivers Sava and Danube, west by the Adriatic coast, and south by the Morea. The name Rumelia was ultimately applied to a province composed of central Albania and north-western Macedonia, with Bitola for its chief town.\n\nOwing to administrative changes effected between 1870 and 1875, the name ceased to correspond to any political division. Eastern Rumelia was constituted as an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, but on September 6, 1885, after a bloodless revolution, it was united with Bulgaria. The Kosovo Vilayet was created in 1877.\n\nToday, in Turkey, the word \"Trakya\" (Thrace) has mostly replaced \"Rumeli\" (Rumelia) when referring to the part of Turkey which is in Europe (provinces of Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, the northern part of Çanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province), though Rumelia remains in use in historical contexts and the word is used in the context of the culture of current Turkish populations of the Balkans and descendants of Turkish immigrants from the Balkans. This region in Turkey is also referred to as Eastern Thrace or Turkish Thrace. In Greece, the term () has been used since Ottoman times to refer to Central Greece, especially when juxtaposed with the Peloponnese or Morea. The word \"Rumeli\" is also used in some cases (mostly by Istanbul denizens) to refer exclusively to the part of Istanbul Province that is situated west of the Bosphorus.\n"}

The concept was coined by Yuri Lotman in 1984 and is now applied to many fields, including cultural semiotics generally, biosemiotics, zoosemiotics, geosemiotics, etc. The concept is treated more fully in the collection of Lotman's writings published in English under the title \"Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture\"(1990)\n\nJuri Lotman, a semiotician at Tartu University, Estonia, was inspired by Vladimir Vernadsky's terms biosphere and noosphere to propose that a semiosphere comes into being when any two Umwelten are communicating. Later, Jesper Hoffmeyer suggested a variation to the effect that the community of organisms occupying the semiosphere will inhabit a \"semiotic niche\". This implies that the semiosphere may be partially independent of the Umwelten. Kalevi Kull argues that this suggestion is not consistent with the nature of semiosis which can only be a product of the behaviour of the organisms in the environment. It is the organisms that create the signs which become the constituent parts of the semiosphere. This is not an adaptation to the existing environment, but the continuous creation of a new environment. Kull believes that it is only possible to accept Hoffmeyer's view as an analogy to the concept of an ecological niche as it is traditionally used in biology, so that the community develops according to the semiotic understanding of the processes which are responsible for the building of Umwelt.\n\n"}

The Kingdom of Bhutan lies on the northern side of the corridor. The Kingdom of Sikkim formerly lay on the northern side of the corridor, until its merger with India in 1975.\n\nThe city of Siliguri, in the state of West Bengal, is the major settlement in this area and the central node that connects Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sikkim, Darjeeling hills, Northeast India and the rest of India.\n\nThe Siliguri Corridor was created in 1947 after the Partition of Bengal (1947) of Bengal between India and Pakistan (former state of East Pakistan, now independent Bangladesh). The kingdom of Sikkim formerly lay on the northern side of the corridor, until its union with India in 1975 via a publicly held referendum. This gave India a buffer to the north of the Siliguri Corridor and consolidated India's control over the western side of the Chinese Chumbi Valley.\n\nAlthough the Siliguri Corridor is an especially important and sensitive territory for India, its location has created a political reality that is also important for Bangladesh. The partition of India into India and Pakistan occurred as a result of hostility between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. From the very beginning, the relationship between these two new states was marked by hostilities and confrontations.\n\nThe formation of East Pakistan created a geographical barrier to the northeastern part of India. The narrow Siliguri Corridor, which at one point is less than wide, remained as the only bridge between the northeastern part of India and the rest of the country.\n\nWedged between Bangladesh to the south and west and China to the north, the region has no access to the sea closer than Kolkata, on the other side of the corridor. Between Sikkim and Bhutan lies the Chumbi Valley, a dagger-like slice of Tibetan territory. A Chinese military advance of less than would cut off Bhutan, part of West Bengal and all of North-East India, an area containing almost 50 million people. This situation arose during the war between India and China in 1962.\n\nAs a sensitive area amidst three countries, the strip is heavily patrolled by the Indian Army, the Assam Rifles, the Border Security Force and the West Bengal Police. In recent times, the area has become the focus of illegal crossings by Bangladeshi rebels and Nepali Maoist insurgents, both in search of refuge from their country. A flourishing narcotics and weapons traffic also takes place in this region.\n\nAll land transportation between mainland India and its far northeastern states uses this circuitous corridor, as there is no free-trade agreement between Bangladesh and India. The Tatulia Corridor, an alternative to the Siliguri Corridor, is proposed under Article VIII of the India–Bangladesh Trade Agreement 1980, which states that \"The two governments agree to make mutually beneficial arrangements for the use of their waterways, railways and roadways for commerce between the two countries and for passage of goods between two places in one country through the territory of the other\". However, the proposal is still in the initial stages of negotiation.\n\nThe route has a major broad gauge railway line. Electrification of this double-track corridor is in progress with assistance from CORE Central Organization for Railway Electrification). Additionally, the old metre gauge line (recently converted to a broad-gauge line) connects Siliguri Junction with Islampur in North Dinajpur District of West Bengal, via Bagdogra (the only airport of national interest in the corridor) and the bordering towns of Adhikari, Galgalia, Thakurganj, Naxalbari and Taiabpur with Nepal.

He wrote primarily on the history and geography of the areas that are now part of the Slovenian Littoral, the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Croatian counties of Istria and Primorsko-Goranska.\n\nRutar was born in a peasant family in the Alpine village of Krn near Kobarid, in what was then the Austrian county of Gorizia and Gradisca (now in Slovenia).\n\nHe attended the State Secondary School in Gorizia. In 1873 he enrolled at the University of Graz, where he studied history, geography, and philology. In Graz, he was shaped by the contemporary positivist approaches in human sciences. In 1878 he was mobilized in the Austro-Hungarian Army, in a unit sent to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was demobilized in Autumn 1879 and returned to Graz. The following year he got a job as a high school history teacher in the Dalmatian town of Kotor. In 1882, he moved to Split, where he taught at the local lyceum for the next eight years. There, he met Frane Bulić, a Croatian historian and archeologist who introduced him to the latest trends in archeology.\n\nDuring his years in Split, Rutar started publishing numerous articles on the local history of his native lands, especially the County of Gorizia. He established close contacts with the Carniolan Rudolfinium Museum, led by the renowned historian and archeologist Karel Dežman, where he helped as an expert in archeological excavations in the Slovene Lands. In 1889 he settled in Ljubljana, where he was employed as a teacher at the Second State Gymnasium of Ljubljana.\n\nHe died in the night between May 3 and May 4, when he was caught in a fire that burned down his house. Most of his personal archive was also destroyed in the fire. He was buried in St. Christopher's Cemetery in Ljubljana. In 1936, his tomb was transferred to the monumental Navje cemetery, in which prominent Slovenes are buried.\n\nRutar was one of the first Slovene historians that employed the new rigorous methods of positivist historical science into his writings. He wrote mostly on the history of political and legal institutions in the Austrian Littoral and Friuli from the feudal age to the late 18th century. He was however also interested in the habits and tradition of the peasant populations regardless their language and ethnicity, although he did concentrate on the two Slavic-speaking peoples in the area, the Slovenes and Croats. In his studies of the peasantry, he took advantage of his knowledge in philology, ethnography, and ethnology.\n\nHe clearly rejected the Romantic nationalism of the early Slovene amateur historians, such as Davorin Trstenjak or Janez Trdina, and instead focused on the specifics of local history, his favorite area of inquiry. He wrote important pioneering works on the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps, the medieval history in the County of Gorizia and Gradisca and in Friuli. He is also important as a researcher of the medieval legal institutions in his native Tolmin County and the neighbouring Venetian Slovenia. In both cases, he was particurlary interested in the institutions of rural municipal self-government, which in those two regions had survived up to the late 18th century.\n\nHe also wrote books on the history of Trieste and Istria, which were commissioned by the publishing house \"Slovenska matica\" for a wider reading public. In them, Rutar incorporated a wide spectrum of subjects in the presentation of the regions, from geography, philology, and ethnography to geology and demography. He also wrote guidebooks and intineraries of Dalmatia, as well as articles on the most various subjects in history and archeology.\n\nRutar was also a regular columnist of the two major Slovene literary magazines of the time, \"Ljubljanski zvon\" and \"Dom in svet\". In them, he exposed his views on Slovene history. He saw the Slovene Lands not only as a linguistic, cultural, and ethnographic unit, but also a political unit. He insisted on the political and legal continuity between the Slavic principality of Carantania and the Carolingian Duchy of Carinthia, from which all other provincies in Inner Austria developed.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Rutar was a popular writer. He was known for his simple, vigorous, and direct prose, as well as his predilections for clear statements and stalwart judgements. He did important work in popularizing history among Slovenes.\n\nDifferently from most Slovene public figures of the time, Rutar did not partake in any political activity, nor did he publicly profess any specific ideology. He regarded himself as a Slovene and Austrian patriot and clearly rejected Panslavism or any kind of radical nationalism. He did however not enter any polemic with other Slovene authors who held different views, but he did openly criticize Italian irredentism. He collaborated with both Liberal and Conservative Catholic journals and institutions.\n\nRutar was a close fiend of the liberal catholic poet and priest Simon Gregorčič, a native of Vrsno, a village very close to Rutar's native Krn. After Rutar's death, Gregorčič composed a poem in his memory.\n\nRutar was regarded as a vigorous, straightforward man and a passionate scholar. In the last years of his life, his health worsened and prevented him to carry out his major projects. Much of his work has remained in sketches and the destruction of his personal archive and notes has prevented later scholars from making a definitive assessment of his opus.\n\nRutar has been regarded as one of the first Slovene academic historians. He did not have any disciple to continue his work and was soon overshadowed by his fellow positivist historian Franc Kos. Rutar's studies of specific topics, such as the Slavic settlements in southwest Friuli in the 10th century, were recognized as very important by future historians such as Milko Kos, Ferdo Gestrin, and Bogo Grafenauer. Overall, however, Rutar's influence on Slovenian historiography has been relatively small, with two important exceptions. His views on the legal and political continuity of Carantania in the Carolingian period influenced the historians Josip Mal and later Jožko Šavli, while his study of the rural municipal self-government influenced the work of the renowned Slovenian legal historian Sergij Vilfan.\n\nRutar's legacy is most strongly felt in his native Goriška region, where several streets, schools, and other public institutions bear his name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13227197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13227197", "title": "Sirte Basin", "text": "Sirte Basin\n\nThe Sirte Basin is a late Mesozoic and Cenozoic triple junction continental rift (extensional basin) along northern Africa that was initiated during the late Jurassic Period. It borders a relatively stable Paleozoic craton and cratonic sag basins along its southern margins. The province extends offshore into the Mediterranean Sea, with the northern boundary drawn at the 2,000 meter (m) bathymetric contour. It borders in the north on the Gulf of Sidra and extends south into northern Chad.\n\nThe Sirte Basin ranks 13th among the world's petroleum provinces, having proven oil reserves estimated at of oil equivalent (36.7 bbl, of gas, of NGL), an amount that constitutes 1.7% of the world’s known oil reserves. The basin consists of one dominant total petroleum system, known as the Sirte-Zelten.\n\nThe Late Cretaceous Sirte Shale is the primary hydrocarbon source bed. Reservoirs range in rock type and age from fractured Precambrian basement, clastic reservoirs in the Cambrian-Ordovician Gargaf Sandstone, and Lower Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone to Paleocene Zelten Formation and Eocene carbonates usually in the form of bioherms.\n\nHydrocarbon generation commenced about 50 million years ago (Ma) in the deeper basins, about 40 Ma in many other areas, and may continue to the present day. Geothermal gradients generally range from to ; horsts and grabens generally have roughly equivalent thermal regimes relative to the primary source rock. Along the southwest and west margins of the province are extrusive igneous deposits that tend to diminish the hydrocarbon potential of these areas. The Gialo High is a relatively small horst block in the eastern Sirte Basin. It is most important and primarily known for the stacked oil fields in rocks ranging from the Early Cretaceous to Oligocene age. There are several billion barrels of oil reserves associated with the structure both over the crest of the horst as well as flanking the high in the adjacent graben.\n\nThe land area in the Sirte basin is characterized by desert steppes and includes eolian deposits from the Rebiana and Kalansho Sand Sea of the Sahara Desert. In a relatively narrow, northern coastal strip, some land areas are as much as 47 m below sea level. The basin is floored by a northwest-southeast-trending mosaic of narrow horsts and grabens, an important structural characteristic that distinguishes it from the adjacent intracratonic Kufra, Murzuk, and Ghadames basins.\n\nThe area of the Sirte Basin occupies about 230,000 km², with a wildcat drilling density of one new field wildcat per 145 km². Overall drilling density of the basin is 3.3 wells per 100 km², with an average field depth of 2,100 m. Recent indications of hydrocarbons within grabens suggest that these areas have potential as well as clastic reservoirs beneath the carbonate reservoirs in the Central Sirte Basin. The offshore area beyond 200 m depths is largely unexplored.\n\nThe Sirte Basin province is considered to be a type locality of a continental rift (extensional) area and is referred to as part of the Tethyan rift system. According to the designation scheme of Bally and Snelson, it is classified as 1211; a cratonic basin located on earlier rifted grabens on a rigid lithosphere and not associated with formation of megasutures. Clifford terms it as an interior fracture basin near the tectonic plate margin, which characteristically has an axis at an angle to that margin.\n\nThe area's structural weakness is exemplified by alternating periods of uplift and subsidence originating in the Late Precambrian, commencing with the Pan-African orogeny that consolidated a number of proto-continental fragments into an early Gondwanaland. Rifting commenced in the Early Cretaceous, peaked in the Late Cretaceous, and ended in the early Cenozoic, resulting in the triple junction within the basin. The Late Cretaceous rifting event is characterized by formation of a sequence of northwest-trending horsts and grabens that step progressively downward to the east; the Sirte Trough represents the deepest portion of the basin. These horsts and grabens extend from onshore areas northward into a complex offshore terrane that includes the Ionian Sea abyssal plain to the northeast. This plain is underlain by oceanic crust that is being subducted to the north and east beneath the Hellenic arc. The Pelagian province to the west, particularly the pull-apart basins of the Sabratah Basin and extending along the South Cyrenaica Fault Zone (SCFZ) and the Cyrenaica Platform to the east, is strongly influenced by extensional dextral strike-slip faulting. To the south, the Nubian Swell is the stable continental basement for this rifted basin.\n\nIn geology, \"trap\" refers to the stratigraphic or tectonic structural feature that ensures the juxtaposition of reservoir and seal such that hydrocarbons remain trapped in the subsurface, rather than escaping (due to their natural buoyancy). Oil and gas trapped within the porous rock unit migrate to a high point in the structure because of their low density. In the Sirte Basin the dominant trap style is structural (84 percent), with the remainder considered stratigraphic or a combination of the two. As examples of combined traps, bioherm developments in the Paleocene Zelten Group are found on horst blocks, and clastic stratigraphic traps such as at Sarir or Messla field are superimposed on structures.\n\nThe first reported petroleum occurrence in the Sirte Basin was observed in a coastal water well drilled by Italian colonists during the Italian-occupation. The Italian government embarked on geologic investigations of the area and produced a geologic map in 1934. Shows of natural gas were observed in the late 1930s, but World War II interrupted exploration efforts. Competitive bidding for concessions was subsequently permitted by two mineral laws passed in 1953 and 1955, and exploration by Esso, Mobil, Texas Gulf, and others commenced with seismic, magnetic, and gravity data being collected. From 1956 to 1961 giant oil fields were discovered. Libya started exporting oil in 1961 and by 1966 it was the 7th largest oil-producing nation in the world. During 1969, output from the Sirte Basin had even exceeded production from Saudi Arabia (3 Mmbpd). Libya nationalized its oil industry in 1973, and some American oil companies began withdrawing in 1982, following a 1981 US trade embargo. By 1986, the US government ordered remaining US companies to cease activities in Libya. In 1992, the United Nations sanctioned Libya in response to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Additional sanctions applied by the US Sanctions Act of 1996 were relaxed in 1999. Since then, American and other foreign oil companies have returned to resume their operations in Libya, led by AGIP (Italy), OMV(Austria), Veba (Germany), Total (France), Nimir (Saudi Arabia), WOC (National Oil Corporation, Conoco, Marathon, Amerada Hess), and ETAP of Tunisia.\n\nIn 2007, the Energy Information Administration estimated that the Sirte Basin Province contains approximately 80% of Libya's total proven oil reserves ( as of January 2007) and accounted for roughly 90% of the country's total oil output, which was in 2006. Over twenty-three large oil fields and sixteen giant oil fields occur in the province. Libya's onshore oil has historically been discovered mainly within the confines of three major geological trends occurring in the Sirte Basin:\n\n\nThe Amal Field produces from the Cambro-Ordovician Amal Formation and the Early Cretaceous Maragh Formation at a depth of . The Sarir Field produces from a Cretaceous Sandstone in an anticline with fault blocks discovered from a seismic survey. The Messla Field produces from the Lower Cretaceous fluvial Sarir sandstone 27 m thick at a depth of 2682 m. The Intisar 'D' Oil Field produces from an upper Paleocene pinnacle reef 385 m thick, 5 km in diameter, and at a depth of about 2700 m\n\n\n"}
