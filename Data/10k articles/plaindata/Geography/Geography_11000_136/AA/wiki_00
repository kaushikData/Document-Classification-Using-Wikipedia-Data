Major General Shaukat Sultan, former Pakistani military spokesman, said the move was necessary to block the infiltration of militants across the border. The proposed fence was initially backed by the United States.\n\nAs of November 2017, Pakistan had fenced 43 km of the border, primarily in the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The Durand Line is marked by 235 crossing points, some of which are susceptible to infiltration. The entire project is predicted to cost at least $532 million.\n\nIn September 2005, Pakistan stated it had plans to build a fence along its border with Afghanistan to prevent insurgents and drug smugglers slipping between the two countries. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf had subsequently offered to mine the border as well.\n\nThe plans to fence and mine the border were again considered in 2007 and then in 2009, but they were not fully implemented. However, a long portion along selected border areas was fenced and the work was discontinued for lack of funds. In June 2011, Major General Athar Abbas, the then spokesman for the army, said: \"We did fence around 35km of the border area as it faced continuous militant incursions. It was a joint project of ISAF and Afghanistan. But then they backed out. It was a very costly project.\" During the Musharraf period, a biometric system was installed by Pakistan on border crossings. Afghanistan had objected to the system. The bio-metric system remains intact at the border, although it is yet to be made fully functional.\n\nThe Pakistani plans for mining and fencing the border were renewed on 26 December 2006, but these plans were opposed by the Afghan government, citing that the fencing would result in \"the limitation of the freedom of movement of Pushtun tribes people\". Due to the Afghan opposition to the border fencing, the Angor Adda and Sheken areas saw a border skirmish in April 2007. On 1 April 2013, the Afghan Foreign Ministry formally protested and raised 'grave concerns' over what it called \"the Pakistani military's unilateral construction and physical reinforcement activities along the border in the eastern Ningarhar province\".\n\nAfghanistan does not recognize the Durand Line itself as a legitimate border between it and Pakistan, as it divides the Pashtun ethnic homeland in two. Afghanistan contends that the installation of a physical barrier would make this border permanent.\n\nIn June 2016, after 3 years of construction, Pakistan completed a 1,100 km trench along the Afghan border in Balochistan province to ensure proper border-management. The excavation was carried out by the Pakistani Frontier Corps. The purpose of the trench is to tighten border security by countering the flow of militants, smugglers, illegal movement and narcotics. Three Balochistan construction companies were contracted to supply manpower and arrangements. The 11-foot deep and 14-foot wide ditch will be extended along the whole border.\n\n"}

These places were mined (from 1785 to 1925) for pyrite.\n\nThe lakelets have various surface elevation.

The pond is filled with water solution of sulphuric acid (pH = 3). It is highly recommended to avoid any contact with the water for it might be dangerous. Below Purple Lakelet there is a smaller hollow which is at times filled with waters falling from the pond above – it is called Yellow Lakelet.\n\nThe colour of Azure Lakelet (635 m; also called: Blue or Emerald) water is connected with the presence of copper ions.

It was founded in 1867 by Ira Hinckley (the paternal grandfather of Gordon B. Hinckley) at the request of Brigham Young. One of its distinctive features is the use of volcanic rock in the construction of the walls, rather than the wood used in many mid-19th-century western forts. This difference in construction is the reason it is one of very few forts of this period still surviving.\n\nCove Fort is the closest named place to the western terminus of Interstate 70, resulting in Cove Fort being listed as a control city on freeway signs, though the fort is historical and has no permanent population.\n\nThe site for Cove Fort was selected by Brigham Young because of its location about halfway between Fillmore, then the capital of the Utah Territory, and the nearest city, Beaver. It provided a way station for people traveling the Mormon Road. A town would have been constructed at the Cove Fort site, but the water supply was inadequate to support a sizable population. Another key factor in the selection of the site was the prior existence of a wooden-palisade fort, Willden Fort, which provided shelter and safety for the work crews who constructed Cove Fort.\n\nThe fort is a square, on each side. The walls are constructed of black volcanic rock and dark limestone, both quarried from the nearby mountains. The walls are 18 ft high and 4 ft thick at the base, tapering to 2 ft thick at the top. The fort has two sets of large wooden doors at the east and west ends, originally filled with sand to stop arrows and bullets, and contains 12 interior rooms.\n\nAs a daily stop for two stagecoach lines, as well as many other travelers, Cove Fort was heavily used for many years, often housing and feeding up to 75 people at a time. In addition to providing a place to rest, a blacksmith/farrier resided at the fort, who shod horses and oxen, and also repaired wagon wheels. With its telegraph office and as a Pony Express stop, it also acted as a regional communications hub.\n\nIn the early 1890s, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints determined the fort was no longer required and leased it out, selling it to W.H. Kesler after the turn of the 20th century. In 1989, the Hinckley family purchased the fort and donated it back to the Church. The Church restored the fort, transported Ira Hinckley's Coalville, Utah, cabin to the site, constructed a visitor center, and reopened the fort as a historic site. The site provides free guided tours daily, starting from about 8 am until one half-hour before sunset.\n\nThe first highway to traverse Cove Fort was the Arrowhead Trail, which connected Salt Lake City with Los Angeles. When the U.S. Highway system was formed, this route became U.S. Route 91, and is today Interstate 15. When the interstate highway system was in the planning stages, planners noted no direct connection existed between the central United States and southern California. The result to fill this gap was a new freeway that would be built west from Green River, Utah, towards Cove Fort, along a path that used to be inaccessible by paved roads. Since that time, Cove Fort has also served as the western terminus of Interstate 70.\n\nIn 2004, the Federal Highway Administration was testing a new typeface, Clearview, designed to have improved readability at night with headlight illumination. One test sign was placed at Baltimore, Maryland – the eastern terminus of Interstate 70 – that listed Cove Fort as a control city with a distance of . One employee stated with the number of queries the department received about Cove Fort, the test was a success. The sign became so popular that after the test was over, federal authorities made arrangements with Maryland authorities to keep the sign permanently installed. The sign prompted a series of stories about Cove Fort to be published in the Baltimore area. Since that time, a small effort has been made by people in both states to lobby the Utah Department of Transportation to reciprocate by placing a sign at Cove Fort listing the distance to Baltimore.\n\n\n"}

Dirt roads are suitable for vehicles; a narrower path for pedestrians, animals, and possibly small vehicles would be called a dirt track—the distinction is not well-defined. Unpaved roads with a harder surface made by the addition of material such as gravel and aggregate (stones), might be referred to as dirt roads in common usage but are distinguished as improved roads by highway engineers. (Improved unpaved roads include gravel roads, laterite roads, murram roads and macadamized roads.) \n\nCompared to a gravel road, a dirt road is not usually graded regularly to produce an enhanced to encourage rainwater to drain off the road, and drainage ditches at the sides may be absent. They are unlikely to have embankments through low-lying areas. This leads to greater waterlogging and erosion, and after heavy rain the road may be impassable even to off-road vehicles. For this reason, in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, they are known as \"dry-weather roads\".\nDirt roads take on different characteristics according to the soils and geology where they pass, and may be sandy, stony, rocky or have a bare earth surface, which could be extremely muddy and slippery when wet, and baked hard when dry. They are likely to become impassable after rain. They are common in rural areas of many countries, often very narrow and infrequently used, and are also found in metropolitan areas of many developing countries, where they may also be used as major highways and have considerable width.\n\nTerms similar to dirt road are \"dry-weather road\", \"earth road\", or the \"Class Four Highway\" designation used in the People's Republic of China. A \"track\", \"dirt track\", or \"earth track\" would normally be similar but less suitable for larger vehicles.\n\nWhile most gravel roads are all-weather roads and can be used by ordinary cars, dirt roads may only be passable by trucks or four-wheel drive vehicles, especially in wet weather, or on rocky or very sandy sections. It is as easy to become bogged in sand as it is in mud; a high clearance under the vehicle may be required for rocky sections.\n\nDriving on dirt roads requires great attention to variations in the surface and it is easier to lose control than on a gravel road. In addition to the hazards already mentioned, and potholes, ruts and ridges, problems associated with driving on gravel roads include:\n\nIn Africa, parts of Asia, and parts of America, laterite soils are used to build dirt roads. However laterite, called \"murram\" in East Africa, varies considerably to earth and sand. It ranges from a hard gravel to a softer earth embedded with small stones. Not all laterite and murram roads are therefore strictly gravel roads. Laterite and murram which contains a significant proportion of clay becomes very slippery when wet, and in the rainy season, it may be difficult even for four-wheel drive vehicles to avoid slipping off very roads into the drainage ditches at the side of the road. As it dries out, such laterite can become very hard, like sun-dried bricks.\n\n"}

It extends for about along Zimbabwe's eastern border with Mozambique.\n\nThe range comprises three main mountain groups - Nyanga (to the north) which contains Zimbabwe's highest mountain Mount Nyangani, Africa's second-longest waterfall Mutarazi Falls and the Honde Valley which leads into Mozambique; Bvumba Mountains (centrally situated near the city of Mutare); and Chimanimani (to the south). These regions are all sparsely populated, highland country and are covered in rich grassland and forests.\n\nThe Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the Indian Ocean. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains, which form the watershed between the Zambezi and Save River systems.\n\nThe East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the East African Rift and Abyssinian physiographic provinces, so are part of the long chain of mountains that runs down East Africa and share many common plant and animal habitats with other mountain areas in the east of the continent.\n\nThe Higlands are home to the Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic ecoregion. The ecoregion includes the portion of the Higlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Highlands, Vumba Highlands, Chimanimani Mountains, Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated Mount Gorongosa further east in Mozambique. The Southern Miombo woodlands ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and heathlands.\n\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, \"Themeda triandra\" is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and \"Loudetia simplex\" is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including \"Loudetia simplex, Trachypogon spicatus, Exotheca abyssinica,\" and \"Monocymbium ceresiiforme\".\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, lianas, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of miombo woodland \"(Brachystegia spiciformis\", \"Brachystegia tamarindoides\" and \"Uapaca kirkiana\") and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum \"Parinari curatellifolia\" near the town of Chipinge and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and Mount Gorongosa, heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from quartzite. The heathlands are of two types, ericaceous and proteaceous. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by \"Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,\" and \"E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii\", and \"Leucospermum saxosum\" are common in the proteaceous heathlands.\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. \"Cryptostephanotis vansonii\", \"Cyrtanthus rhodesianus\", and \"Scadoxus pole-evansi\" are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the Highlands include blue monkey \"(Cercopithecus mitis)\" the Samango Sykes' monkey, East African little collared fruit bat \"(Myonycteris relicta)\" and Marshall's pygmy chameleon \"(Rhampholeon marshalli)\". Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.\n\nThe highlands are also rich in birdlife including trumpeter hornbill \"(Bycanistes bucinator)\", Knysna turaco \"(Tauraco corythaix)\", purple-crested turaco \"(Tauraco porphyreolophus)\", crested guineafowl \"(Guttera pucherani)\" and crowned eagle \"(Stephanoaetus coronatus)\". Two species, the Chirinda apalis \"(Apalis chirindensis)\" and Roberts's warbler \"(Oreophilais robertsi)\", are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts’s warbler inhabits the forest edge. \n\nThe forests are also full of butterflies, most notably swallowtails such as the emperor swallowtail \"(Papilio ophidicephalus)\" and the citrus swallowtail \"(Papilio demodocus)\" and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including skinks, geckos, lizards, frogs, toads, and snakes.\nThe mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. Large areas of the Highlands are protected, including the 171km2 Chimanimani National Park and Nyanga National Park.\n"}

Orientalist Vladimir Minorsky derived the name from a word meaning \"walnut\", a product for which the area is still known today. The 19th-century scholar Henry George Raverty suggested that the plural form emerged from the division of the country in two parts by the river Murghab.\n\nThe boundaries of Guzgan were never well defined and fluctuated wildly over time. They certainly bear no relation to the modern administrative boundaries of Jowzjan Province, named after it, or the neighbouring Faryab Province, but historically included the lands around the towns of Maymana (capital of Faryab province), Andkhuy, Shibarghan (capital of Jowzjan Province) and Sar-e Pol (capital of the namesake province). Lying on the transition zone between the Central Asian steppes and the Iranian Plateau, the region was characterized by a mixture of sedentary, urban populations in the fertile river valleys, alongside nomad tribes engaged in pastoralism, which is singled out as the region's main source of wealth by medieval geographers. Its location also meant that it was often used as a route for armies marching to and from Iran to Central Asia.\n\nIn the early 7th century, the region of Guzgan was counted as part of Tokharistan. As attested by legal documents that have tentatively been dated to the late 7th and early 8th century, the area was controlled by a local family that used the country Gozgan as the dynastic name, a custom of the era. Several are named, including Zhulad Gozgan, and Skag Gozgan, presumably one of his successors.\n\nGuzgan was conquered by the Arabs under al-Ahnaf ibn Qays in 653/4, as part of the Muslim conquest of Persia. In 737, the area was the site of the decisive Battle of Kharistan between the Arabs under Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, and the Turgesh under the \"khagan\" Suluk. In 743, the Alid Yahya ibn Zayd, son of Zayd ibn Ali, rose in revolt but was defeated and killed at Guzgan by the Umayyad governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar. His tomb was later a site of pilgrimage. In Abbasid times, the local governor resided in Anbar, possibly modern Sar-e Pol, but other accounts mention Shibarghan as the capital, and the geographers al-Muqaddasi and Yaqut al-Hamawi considered al-Yahudiyya (modern Maynama) as the capital.\n\nDespite the Arab conquest, a native dynasty, the Farighunids, who claimed descent from the Persian mythological hero Faridun and bore the title of \"Guzgan-Khudha\", continued to rule from their capital, Kundurm. They became vassals of the Samanids and then of Mahmud of Ghazni, one of whose daughters married the Farighunid emir Abu'l-Abbas Ma'mun Farighun. The latter was assassinated by his own troops in 1016, however, and Mahmud gave rule of the region to his chamberlain, Yalangtush. The Farighunids were notable as patrons of the arts and literature; the most notable product of their court is the anonymous geographical work \"Hudud ul-'alam min al-mashriq ila al-maghrib\".\n\n"}

They were created by cross-breeding two types of roses, initially by hybridising hybrid perpetuals with tea roses. It is the oldest group classified as a \"modern garden rose\".\n\nHybrid teas exhibit traits midway between both parents, being hardier than the often quite tender teas (although not as hardy as the hybrid perpetuals), and more inclined to repeat-flowering than the somewhat misleadingly-named hybrid perpetuals (if not quite as ever-blooming as the teas). \n\nHybrid tea flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, supported by long, straight and upright stems. Each flower can grow to 8–12.5 cm wide. Hybrid teas are the world's most popular type of rose by choice due to their color and flower form. Their flowers are usually borne singly at the end of long stems which makes them popular as cut flowers. \n\nMost hybrid tea bushes tend to be somewhat upright in habit, and reach between 0.75 and 2.0 metres in height, depending on the cultivar, growing conditions and pruning regime. It is the provincial flower of Islamabad capital territory.\n\nThe birth of the world's first hybrid tea is generally accepted to have been 'La France' in 1867. It was raised by Jean-Baptiste André Guillot, a French nurseryman. He did it by hybridising a tea rose, supposedly 'Madame Bravy', with a hybrid perpetual, supposedly 'Madame Victor Verdier', hence \"hybrid tea\".\n\nOther early cultivars were 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam' (Bennett 1883), 'Souvenir of Wootton' (John Cook 1888) and 'Mme. Caroline Testout', introduced by Pernet-Ducher in 1890.\n\nHybrid tea roses did not become popular until the beginning of the 20th century, when Pernet-Ducher in Lyons, France, bred the cultivar 'Soleil d'Or' (1900).\nBut the cultivar that made hybrid teas the most popular class of garden rose of the 20th century was the rose ('Madame A. Meilland'), introduced by Francis Meilland at the end of World War II, and one of the most popular rose cultivars of the 20th century. \n\nMichele Meilland Richardier cultivated a hybrid tea which had double flowers, with a coral inside and a yellow and pink outside. It was said to last very well when cut. The rose was classified as being part of the meilimona variety. The patent was filed on October 14, 1975 and was issued February 1, 1977.\n\nMost hybrid tea cultivars are not fully hardy in continental areas with very cold winters (below −25 °C). This, combined with their tendency to be stiffly upright, sparsely foliaged and often not resistant to diseases, has led to a decline in hybrid tea popularity among gardeners and landscapers in favor of lower-maintenance \"landscape\" roses. The hybrid tea remains the standard rose of the floral industry, however, and is still favored in small gardens in formal situations.\n\nThis is usually done by budding, a technique that involves grafting buds from a parent plant onto strongly growing rootstocks. One such rootstock is \"R. multiflora\".\n\nHybrid tea cultivars bred in continental areas (e.g. Canada) tend to be hardier than those hailing from more maritime regions (e.g. New Zealand).\n\nA very large number of hybrid tea cultivars have been introduced by breeders over the years; some notable examples include 'Chrysler Imperial', 'Double Delight', 'Elina', 'Fragrant Cloud', 'Mister Lincoln', and 'Precious Platinum'.\n"}

Belgrade, the capital of Serbia currently consists of 17 municipalities, 10 urban and 7 suburban, but after World War II, over 30 more municipalities were created, abolished and merged with each other.\n\nIt took 27 years (from 1944 to 1971) to territorially shape the modern metropolitan area of the City of Belgrade. Even after 1971 some changes occurred, but due to the internal reorganization, leaving the outer borders of the area intact. Certain ideas of the enlarging further the metropolitan area appeared in the early 1990s but were not realized (see \"Further expansion\" below). Some of the most important changes include:\n\n\nThe list deals with all the municipalities which existed on the territory of the modern City of Belgrade since 1945, regardless if they were administratively part of Belgrade during their existence or not.\n\n\nWith successful 2000-2002 campaigning for Surčin's split from the municipality of Zemun (proclaimed separate municipality on 24 November 2003, separate administration from November 3, 2004), several other motions for the creation of new municipalities appeared. Acting mayor of Belgrade Zoran Alimpić stated in November 2007 that probably no new municipalities will be created before 2011 or 2012. As of October 2017 none have been created.\n\n\n\nExpansion of the metropolitan area of Belgrade was actual in the 1991-1992 when a new territorial reorganization was prepared for the entire Serbia. The government of Radoman Božović proposed the detachment of the municipality of Mladenovac, for example, but also the incorporation of the municipalities of the province of Vojvodina (Opovo and Pančevo) into Belgrade. A new map, with such borders was even printed in the daily newspaper of Večernje novosti at the time, but in the end the borders remained unchanged.\n\nIn an interview in April 2008, regarding the upcoming general elections, jointly with the local and provincial as well, former mayor of Belgrade in 2000-2001 period, Milan St. Protić stated that rural municipalities (like Obrenovac and Mladenovac) should be detached from Belgrade as they can't funcion efficiently as part of urban agglomeration. In 2010, political party G17 Plus, which was part of the ruling coalition in the city, proposed a new division with 24 municipalities. New proposed 7 municipalities were Avalski Venac, Batajnica, Bežanijska Kosa, Dunavski Venac, Kaluđerica (including Leštane), New Belgrade I and II (division of present municipality in two) and Posavski Venac. \"Nova stranka\", a political party formed by the former prime minister Zoran Živković, proposed a new administrative division in the late 2015, which was to exclude the municipalities of Lazarevac, Obrenovac and Mladenovac from the City of Belgrade, and creation of new urban municipalities: Avalski Venac, Batajnica, Dunavski Venac, Kaluđerica, Žarkovo and Železnik.\n\nAfter the change in city government in 2014, a commission for the change of the City Statute was formed. It was announced in 2015 and 2016 that the new statute will also deal with the administrative division, return of the division of the municipalities within the city on urban and suburban, change in the municipal jurisdiction, etc., but as of October 2017 nothing changed. In October 2017, Belgrade's Administrative secretariat disclosed that the notions for Dunavski Venac, Avalski Venac and Kaluđerica were applied, but that all three were in a discord with the City Statute.\n"}

{"id": "4738979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4738979", "title": "Names of Germany", "text": "Names of Germany\n\nBecause of Germany's geographic position in the centre of Europe, as well as its long history as a non-united region of distinct tribes and states, there are many widely varying names of Germany in different languages, perhaps more so than for any other European nation. For example, the German language, the country is known as , in Spanish as , in French as , in Italian as (although Germans are called ), in Polish as , and in Finnish as .\n\nIn general, the names for Germany can be arranged in six main groups according to their origin:\n\n1. From Old High German \"diutisc\" or similar\n\n2. From the Latin \"Germania\" or Greek \"Γερμανία\n\n3. From the name of the Alamanni tribe\n\n4. From the name of the Saxon tribe\n\n5. From the Protoslavic \"němьcь\"\n\n6. Unclear origin\n\nOther forms:\n\nThe name \"Deutschland\" and the other similar-sounding names above are derived from the Old High German \"diutisc\", or similar variants from Proto-Germanic \"*Þeudiskaz\", which originally meant \"of the people\". This in turn comes from a Germanic word meaning \"folk\" (leading to Old High German \"diot\", Middle High German \"diet\"), and was used to differentiate between the speakers of Germanic languages and those who spoke Celtic or Romance languages. These words come from *\"teuta\", the Proto-Indo-European word for \"people\" (Lithuanian \"tauta\", Old Irish \"tuath\", Old English \"þeod\").\n\nAlso the Italian for \"German\", \"tedesco\" (local or archaic variants: \"todesco\", \"tudesco\", \"todisco\"), comes from the same Old High German root, although not the name for \"Germany\" (\"Germania\"). Also in the standardised Romansh language \"Germania\" is the normal name for Germany but in Sursilvan, Sutsilvan and Surmiran it is commonly referred to as \"Tiaratudestga\", \"Tearatudestga\" and \"Tera tudestga\" respectively, with \"tiara/teara/tera\" meaning \"land\". French words \"thiois\", \"tudesque\", \"théotisque\" and \"Thiogne\" and Spanish \"tudesco\" share this etymology.\n\nThe Germanic language which \"diutisc\" most likely comes from is West Frankish, a language which died out a long time ago and which there is hardly any written evidence for today. This was the Germanic dialect used in the early Middle Ages, spoken by the Franks in Western Francia, i.e. in the region which is now northern France. The word is only known from the Latin form \"theodiscus\". Until the 8th century the Franks called their language \"frengisk\"; however, when the Franks moved their political and cultural centre to the area where France now is, the term \"frengisk\" became ambiguous, as in the West Francian territory some Franks spoke Latin, some vulgar Latin and some \"theodisc\". For this reason a new word was needed to help differentiate between them. Thus the word \"theodisc\" evolved from the Germanic word \"theoda\" (the people) with the Latin suffix \"-iscus\", to mean \"belonging to the people\", i.e. the people's language.\n\nIn Eastern Francia, roughly the area where Germany now is, it seems that the new word was taken on by the people only slowly, over the centuries: in central Eastern Francia the word \"frengisk\" was used for a lot longer, as there was no need for people to distinguish themselves from the distant Franks. The word \"diutsch\" and other variants were only used by people to describe themselves, at first as an alternative term, from about the 10th century. It was used, for example, in the Sachsenspiegel, a legal code, written in Middle Low German in about 1220: \" Iewelk düdesch\" \"lant hevet sinen palenzgreven: sassen, beieren, vranken unde svaven\"\n(Every German land has its Graf: Saxony, Bavaria, Franken and Swabia).\n\nThe Teutoni, a tribe with a name which probably came from the same root, did, through Latin, ultimately give birth to the English words \"Teuton\" (first found in 1530) for the adjective German, (as in the Teutonic Knights, a military religious order, and the Teutonic Cross) and \"Teuton\" (noun), attested from 1833. \"Teuton\" was also used for \"Teutonisch Land\" (land of the Teutons), it's abbreviation \"Teutschland\" used in some areas until the 19th century and it's currently used official variation \"Deutschland\".\n\nIn the northern French language area (northern France, Belgium), the neighboring Germanic dialects, areas and inhabitants of Flanders to Alsace are sometimes referred to as \"Thiois\", most likely still for the area between Maastricht and Aachen and for the traditional German speaking part of Lorraine (\"Lorraine Thioise\") , The term is obsolete and derives from theodisc (see above).\n\nThe name \"Germany\" and the other similar-sounding names above are all derived from the Latin \"Germania\", of the 3rd century BC, a word simply describing \"fertile land\" behind the limes. It was likely the Gauls who first called the people who crossed east of the Rhine \"Germani\" (which the Romans adopted) as the original Germanic tribes did not refer to themselves as \"Germanus\" (singular) or \"Germani\" (plural). \n\nJulius Caesar was the first to use \"Germanus\" in writing when describing tribes in north-eastern Gaul in his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\": he records that four northern Belgic tribes, namely the Condrusi, Eburones, Caeraesi and Paemani, were collectively known as Germani. In AD 98, Tacitus wrote \"Germania\" (the Latin title was actually: \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\"), an ethnographic work on the diverse set of Germanic tribes outside the Roman Empire. Unlike Caesar, Tacitus claims that the name \"Germani\" was first applied to the Tungri tribe. The name \"Tungri\" is thought to be the endonym corresponding to the exonym \"Eburones\". \n\n19th-century and early 20th-century historians speculated on whether the northern Belgae were Celts or Germanic tribes. Caesar claims that most of the northern Belgae were descended from tribes who had long ago crossed the Rhine from Germania. However many tribal names and personal names or titles recorded are identifiably Celtic. It seems likely that the northern Belgae, due to their intense contact with the Gaulish south, were largely influenced by this southern culture. Tribal names were 'qualifications' and could have been translated or given by the Gauls and picked up by Caesar. Perhaps they were Germanic people who had adopted Gaulish titles or names. The Belgians were a political alliance of southern Celtic and northern Germanic tribes. In any case, the Romans were not precise in their ethnography of northern barbarians: by \"German(ic)\" Caesar meant \"originating east of the Rhine\". Tacitus wrote in his book \"Germania\": \"The Treveri and Nervii take pride in their German origin, stating that this noble blood separates them from all comparison (with the Gauls) and the Gaulish laziness\".\n\nThe OED2 records theories about the Celtic roots of the Latin word \"Germania\": one is \"gair\", neighbour (a theory of Johann Zeuss, a German historian and Celtic philologist) – in Old Irish \"gair\" is \"neighbour\". Another theory is \"gairm\", battle-cry (put forward by Johann Wachter and Jacob Grimm, who was a philologist as well as collector and editor of fairy tales). Yet another theory is that the word comes from \"ger\", \"spear\"; however, Eric Partridge suggests \"*gar\" / \"gavin\", to shout (as Old Irish \"garim\"), describing the Germanic tribesmen as noisy. He describes the \"ger\" theory as \"obsolete\".\n\nIn English, the word \"German\" is first attested in 1520, replacing earlier uses of \"Almain\", \"Alman\" and \"Dutch\". In German, the word \"Germanen\" today refers to Germanic tribes, just like the Italian noun \"Germani\" (adjective: \"germanici\"), and the French adjective \"germanique\", The English words \"german\" (as in \"cousin-german\") and the adjective \"germane\" are not connected to the name for the country, but come from the Latin \"germanus\", \"siblings with the same parents or father\"; just like Spanish \"hermano\", that is \"brother\", that is not cognate by any mean to the word \"Germania\".\n\nThe name \"Allemagne\" and the other similar-sounding names above are derived from the southern Germanic Alemanni, a Suebic tribe or confederation in today's Alsace, parts of Baden-Württemberg and Switzerland.\nIn English, the name \"Almain\" or \"Alman\" was used for Germany and for the adjective German until the 16th century, with \"German\" first attested in 1520, used at first as an alternative then becoming a replacement, maybe inspired mainly by the need to differ them from the more and more independently acting Dutch. In Othello ii,3, (about 1603), for example, Shakespeare uses both \"German\" and \"Almain\" when Iago describes the drinking prowess of the English:\n\nAndrew Boorde also mentions Germany in his \" Introduction to Knowledge\", c. 1547:\n\nThrough this name, the English language has also been given the Allemande (a dance), the Almain rivet and probably the almond furnace, which is probably not really connected to the word \"almond\" (of Greek origin) but is a corruption of \"Almain furnace\". In modern German, \"Alemannisch\" (Alemannic German) is a group of dialects of the Upper German branch of the Germanic language family, spoken by approximately ten million people in six different countries.\n\nAmong the indigenous peoples of North America of former French and British colonial areas, the word for \"Germany\" came primarily as a borrowing from either French or English. For example, in the Anishinaabe languages, three terms for \"Germany\" exist: ᐋᓂᒫ (\"Aanimaa\", originally \"Aalimaanh\", from the French \"Allemagne\"), ᑌᐦᒋᒪᓐ (\"Dechiman\", from the English \"Dutchman\") and ᒣᐦᔭᑴᑦ (\"Meyagwed\", Ojibwe for \"foreign speaker\" analogous to Slavic \"Némcy\" \"Mutes\" and Arab (ajam) \"mute\"), of which \"Aanimaa\" is the most common of the terms to describe Germany.\n\nThe names \"Saksamaa\" and \"Saksa\" are derived from the name of the Germanic tribe of the Saxons. The word \"Saxon\", Proto-Germanic *\"sakhsan\", is believed (a) to be derived from the word seax, meaning a variety of single-edged knives: a Saxon was perhaps literally a swordsman, or (b) to be derived from the word \"axe\", the region axed between the valleys of the Elbe and Weser. \n\nIn Finnish and Estonian the words that historically applied to ancient Saxons changed their meaning over the centuries to denote the whole country of Germany and the Germans. In some Celtic languages the word for the English nationality is derived from Saxon, e.g., the Scottish term \"Sassenach\", the Breton terms \"Saoz, Saozon\" and the Welsh terms \"Sais, Saeson\". \"Saxon\" also led to the \"-sex\" ending in Wessex, Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, etc., and of course to \"Anglo-Saxon\".\n\nThe Slavic exonym \"nemets\", \"nemtsy\" derives from Proto-Slavic \"němьcь\", pl. \"němьci\", 'the mutes', 'not able (to speak)' (from adjective \"němъ\" 'mute' and suffix -\"ьcь\"). It literally means \"a mute\" and can be also associated with similar sounding \"not able\", \"without power\", but came to signify \"those who can't speak (like us); foreigners\". The Slavic autonym (Proto-Slavic \"*Slověninъ\") likely derives from \"slovo\", meaning \"word\". According to a theory, early Slavs would call themselves the \"speaking people\" or the \"keepers of the words\", as opposed to their Germanic neighbors, the \"mutes\" (a similar idea lies behind Greek \"barbaros\", barbarian and Arab عجم (ajam), \"mute)\". At first, \"němьci\" may have been used for any non-Slav foreigners, later narrowed to just Germans. The plural form is used for the Germans instead of any specific country name, e.g. \"Niemcy\" in Polish and \"Ńymcy\" in Silesian dialect. In other languages, the country's name derives from the adjective \"němьcьska (zemja)\" meaning 'German (land)' (f.i. Czech \"Německo\"). Belarusian (\"Nyamyecchyna\"), Bulgarian (\"Nemtsiya\") and Ukrainian (\"Nimecchyna\") are also from \"němьcь\" but with the addition of the suffix -\"ina\".\n\nAccording to another theory, \"Nemtsy\" may derive from the Rhine-based, Germanic tribe of Nemetes mentioned by Caesar and Tacitus. This etymology is dubious for phonological \"nemetes\" could not become Slavic \"němьcь\". \n\nIn Russian, the adjective for \"German\", немецкий (\"nemetskiy\") comes from the same Slavic root while the name for the country is \"Germaniya\" (Германия). Likewise, in Bulgarian the adjective is \"немски\" (\"nemski\") and the country is \"Germaniya\" (Германия).\n\nOver time, the Slavic exonym was borrowed by some non-Slavic languages. The Hungarian name for Germany is \"Németország\" (from the stem Német-. lit. Német Land). The popular Romanian name for German is \"neamț\", used alongside the official term, \"german\", which was borrowed from Latin. The Arabic name for Austria النمسا \"an-Nimsā\" was borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish and Persian word for Austria, \"نمچه\" – \"Nemçe\", from one of the South Slavic languages (in the 16–17th centuries the Austrian Empire was the biggest German-speaking country bordering on the Ottoman Empire) and like in Polish also doesn't refer to a specific country but only to the people occupying it. \n\nIn Latvian and Lithuanian the names \"Vācija\" and \"Vokietija\" contain the root vāca or vākiā. Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras Būga associated this with a reference to a Swedish tribe named Vagoths in a 6th-century chronicle (cf. finn. \"Vuojola\" and eston. \"Oju-/Ojamaa\", 'Gotland', both derived from the Baltic word; the ethnonym *vakja, used by the Votes (\"vadja\") and the Sami, in older sources (\"vuowjos\"), may also be related). So the word for \"German\" possibly comes from a name originally given by West Baltic tribes to the Vikings. Latvian linguist Konstantīnos Karulis proposes that the word may be based on the Indo-European word \"*wek\" (\"speak\"), from which derive Old Prussian wackis (\"war cry\") or Latvian vēkšķis. Such names could have been used to describe neighbouring people whose language was incomprehensible to Baltic peoples. \nThose names may also derive from Slavic roots, if - then they would mean \"marauders\" or \"nomadic bandits\", which resembles similar meaning applied to the Philistines, by Nubians or Ethiopians.\n\nIn East Asia, the names have generally been imported directly from German \"deutsch\" or Dutch \"duits\" in various ways.\n\nThe Chinese name is a phonetic approximation of the German proper adjective. The Vietnamese name is based on the Chinese name. The Japanese name is a phonetic approximation of the Dutch proper adjective. The Korean name is based on the Japanese name. This is explained in detail below:\n\nThe common Chinese name () is a combination of the short form of , which approximates the German pronunciation of \"Deutsch\" ‘German’, plus \"guó\" ‘country’.\n\nThe Vietnamese name \"Đức\" is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\"đức\" ) of the character that appears in the Chinese name.\n\nJapanese language (\"doitsu\") is an approximation of the Dutch word meaning ‘German’. It was earlier written with the Sino-Japanese character compound (whose has since been simplified to ), but has been largely superseded by the above-mentioned katakana .\nThe character is sometimes used in compounds, for example (\"dokubun\") meaning ‘German literature’, or as an abbreviation, such as in .\n\nThe (South) Korean name \"Dogil\" () is the Korean pronunciation of the former Japanese name. The compound coined by the Japanese was adapted into Korean, so its characters are not pronounced \"do+itsu\" as in Japanese, but \"dok+il\" = \"Dogil\". Until the 1980s, South Korean primary textbooks adopted \"Doichillanteu\" () which approximates the German pronunciation of \"Deutschland\".\n\nThe official North Korean name \"toich'willandŭ\" () approximates the German pronunciation of \"Deutschland\". Traditionally \"Dogil\" () had been used in North Korea until the 1990s. Use of the Chinese name (in its Korean pronunciation \"Deokguk\", ) is attested for the early 20th century. It is now uncommon.\n\nThe terminology for \"Germany\", the \"German states\" and \"Germans\" is complicated by the unusual history of Germany over the last 2000 years. This can cause confusion in German and English, as well in other languages. While the notion of \"Germans\" and \"Germany\" is older, it is only since 1871 that there has been a nation-state of Germany. Later political disagreements and the partition of Germany (1945–1990) has further made it difficult to use proper terminology.\n\nStarting with Charlemagne, the territory of modern Germany was within the realm of the Holy Roman Empire. It was a union of relatively independent rulers who each ruled their own territories. This empire was called in German \"Heiliges Römisches Reich\", with the addition from the late Middle Ages of \"Deutscher Nation\" (of (the) German nation), showing that the former idea of a universal realm had given way to a concentration on the German territories.\n\nIn 19th and 20th century historiography, the Holy Roman Empire was often referred to as \"Deutsches Reich\", creating a link to the later nation state of 1871. Besides the official \"Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation\", common expressions are \"Altes Reich\" (the old Reich) and \"Römisch-Deutsches Kaiserreich\" (Roman-German Imperial Realm).\n\nRoman authors mentioned a number of tribes they called \"Germani\"—the tribes did not themselves use the term. After 1500 these tribes were identified by linguists as belonging to a group of Germanic language speakers (which include modern languages like German, English and Dutch). \"Germani\" (for the people) and \"Germania\" (for the area where they lived) became the common Latin words for Germans and Germany.\n\nGermans call themselves \"Deutsche\" (living in \"Deutschland\"). \"Deutsch\" is an adjective (Proto-Germanic *\"theudisk-\") derived from Old High German \"thiota, diota\" (Proto-Germanic *\"theudō\") meaning \"people\", \"nation\", \"folk\". The word *\"theudō\" is cognate with Proto-Celtic *\"teutā\", whence the Celtic tribal name Teuton, later anachronistically applied to the Germans. The term was first used to designate the popular language as opposed to the language used by the religious and secular rulers who used Latin.\n\nIn the Late Medieval and Early Modern period, Germany and Germans were known as \"Almany\" and \"Almains\" in English, via Old French \"alemaigne\", \"alemans\" derived from the name of the Alamanni and Alemannia. These English terms were obsolete by the 19th century. At the time, the territory of modern Germany belonged to the realm of the Holy Roman Empire (the Roman Empire restored by the Christian king of Francony, Charlemagne). This feudal state became a union of relatively independent rulers who developed their own territories. Modernisation took place on the territorial level (such as Austria, Prussia, Saxony or Bremen), not on the level of the Empire.\n\nThe French emperor, Napoleon, forced the Emperor of Austria to step down as Holy Roman Emperor in 1806. Some of the German countries were then collected into the Confederation of the Rhine, which remained a military alliance under the \"protection\" of Napoleon, rather than consolidating into an actual confederation. After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, these states created a German Confederation with the Emperor of Austria as president. Some member states, such as Prussia and Austria, included only a part of their territories within the confederation, while other member states brought territories to the alliance that included people, like the Poles and the Czechs, who did not speak German as their native tongue. In addition, there were also substantial German speaking populations that remained outside the confederation.\n\nIn 1841 Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the song \"Das Lied der Deutschen\", giving voice to the dreams of a unified Germany (\"Deutschland über Alles\") to replace the alliance of independent states. In this era of emerging national movements, \"Germany\" was used only as a reference to a particular geographical area.\n\nIn 1866/1867 Prussia and her allies left the German Confederation, which led to the confederation being dissolved and the formation of a new alliance, called the North German Confederation. It became a federal state with its constitution of 1 July 1867. The remaining South German countries, with the exception of Austria and Liechtenstein, joined the country in 1870.\n\nThe first nation state named \"Germany\" began in 1871; before that \"Germany\" referred to a geographical entity comprising many states, much as \"the Balkans\" is used today, or the term \"America\" was used by the founders of \"the United States of America.\"\n\nIn German constitutional history, the expressions \"Reich\" (reign, realm, empire) and \"Bund\" (federation, confederation) are somewhat interchangeable. Sometimes they even co-existed in the same constitution: for example in the German Empire (1871–1918) the parliament had the name \"Reichstag\", the council of the representatives of the German states \"Bundesrath\". When in 1870–71 the North German Confederation was transformed into the German Empire, the preamble said that the participating monarchs are creating \"einen ewigen Bund\" (an eternal confederation) which will have the name \"Deutsches Reich\".\n\nDue to the history of Germany, the principle of federalism is strong. Only the state of Hitler (1933–1945) and the state of the communists (East Germany, 1949–1990) were centralist states. As a result, the words \"Reich\" and \"Bund\" were used more frequently than in other countries, in order to distinguish between imperial or federal institutions and those at a subnational level. For example, a modern federal German minister is called \"Bundesminister\", in contrast to a \"Landesminister\" who holds office in a state such as Rhineland-Palatinate or Lower Saxony.\n\nAs a result of the Hitler regime, and maybe also of Imperial Germany up to 1919, many Germans – especially those on the political left – have negative feelings about the word \"Reich\". However, it is in common use in expressions such as \"Römisches Reich\" (Roman Empire), \"Königreich\" (Kingdom) and \"Tierreich\" (animal kingdom).\n\n\"Bund\" is another word also used in contexts other than politics. Many associations in Germany are federations or have a federalised structure and differentiate between a \"Bundesebene\" (federal/national level) and a \"Landesebene\" (level of the regional states), in a similar way to the political bodies. An example is the German Football Association \"Deutscher Fußballbund\". (The word \"Bundestrainer\", referring to the national football coach, does not refer to the Federal Republic, but to the Fußball\"bund\" itself.)\n\nIn other German speaking countries, the words \"Reich\" (Austria before 1918) and \"Bund\" (Austria since 1918, Switzerland) are used too. An organ named \"Bundesrat\" exists in all three of them: in Switzerland it is the government and in Germany and Austria the house of regional representatives.\n\nIn the 19th century before 1871, Germans, for example in the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848–49, argued about what should become of Austria. Including Austria (at least the German-speaking parts) in a future German state was referred to as the \"Greater German Solution\"; while a German state without Austria was the \"Smaller German Solution\".\n\nIn 1919 the Weimar Constitution postulated the inclusion of \"Deutsch-Österreich\" (the German-speaking parts of Austria), but the Western Allies objected to this. It was realised only in 1938 when Germany annexed Austria \"(Anschluss)\". National socialist propaganda proclaimed the realisation of Großdeutschland; and in 1943 the German Reich was officially renamed \"Großdeutsches Reich\". However, these expressions became neither common nor popular.\n\nIn National Socialist propaganda Austria was also called \"Ostmark\". After the \"Anschluss\" the previous territory of Germany was called \"Altreich\" (old Reich).\n\nThe official name of the German state in 1871 became \"Deutsches Reich\", linking itself to the former \"Reich\" before 1806 and the rudimentary \"Reich\" of 1848/1849. This expression was commonly used in official papers and also on maps, while in other contexts \"Deutschland\" was more frequently used.\n\nThose Germans living within its boundaries were called \"Reichsdeutsche\", those outside were called \"Volksdeutsche\" (ethnic Germans). The latter expression referred mainly to the German minorities in Eastern Europe. Germans living abroad (for example in America) were and are called \"Auslandsdeutsche\".\n\nAfter the forced abdication of the Emperor in 1918, and the republic was declared, Germany was informally called the \"Deutsche Republik\". The official name of the state remained the same. The term Weimar Republic, after the city where the National Assembly gathered, came up in the 1920s, but was not commonly used until the 1950s. It became necessary to find an appropriate term for the Germany between 1871 and 1919: \"Kaiserliches Deutschland\" (Imperial Germany) or \"(Deutsches) Kaiserreich\".\n\nAfter Adolf Hitler took power in 1933, the official name of the state was still the same. For a couple of years Hitler used the expression \"Drittes Reich\" (Third Reich), which was introduced by writers in the last years of the republic. In fact this was only a propaganda term and did not constitute a new state. Another propaganda term was \"Tausendjähriges Reich\" (Thousand years Reich). Later Hitler renounced the term \"Drittes Reich\" (officially in June 1939), but it already had become popular among supporters and opponents and is still used in historiography (sometimes in quotation marks). It led later to the name \"Zweites Reich\" (Second Empire) for Germany of 1871–1919. The reign of Hitler is most commonly called in English \"Nazi Germany\". \"Nazi\" is a colloquial short for \"Nationalsozialist\", a person who supports national socialism.\n\nAfter the defeat in World War II, Germany was occupied by the troops of Britain, France, the United States and Soviet Union. Berlin was a case of its own, as it was situated on the territory of the Soviet zone but divided into four sectors. The western sectors were later called West Berlin, the other one East Berlin. The communists tended to consider the Soviet sector of Berlin as a part of GDR; West Berlin was, according to them, an independent political unit. In the GDR \"Westberlin\" was the preferred spelling in order to de-emphasize the relationship to \"Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR\" (the GDR capital).\n\nAfter 1945, \"Deutsches Reich\" was still used for a couple of years (in 1947, for instance, when the Social Democrats gathered in Nuremberg they called their rally \"Reichsparteitag\"). In many contexts, the German people still called their country \"Germany\", even after two German states were created in 1949.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany, \"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\", established in 1949, saw itself as the same state founded in 1867/71 but \"Reich\" gave place to \"Bund\". For example, the \"Reichskanzler\" became the \"Bundeskanzler\", \"reichsdeutsch\" became \"bundesdeutsch\", \"Reichsbürger\" (citizen of the \"Reich\") became \"Bundesbürger\".\n\nGermany as a whole was called \"Deutschland als Ganzes\" or \"Gesamtdeutschland\", referring to Germany in the international borders of 1937 (before Hitler started to annex other countries). This resulted in \"all German\" (or \"pan germanique\"—a chauvinist concept) aspirations. In 1969 the Federal Ministry for All German Affairs was renamed the Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations.\n\nUntil 1970, a number of expressions competed in the Federal Republic to designate the other German state (the communist German Democratic Republic). It was called \"Sowjetische Besatzungszone\" (SBZ, Soviet Zone of Occupation), \"Sowjetzone\", \"Ostzone\", \"Mitteldeutschland\" or \"Pankow\" (many GDR politicians lived or worked in Berlin-Pankow).\n\nIn 1949, the communists, protected by the Soviet Union, established the \"Deutsche Demokratische Republik\" (DDR, German Democratic Republic, GDR). This state was not considered to be a successor of the Reich, but, nevertheless, to represent all \"good Germans\". Rulers and inhabitants of GDR called their state simply DDR or \"unsere Republik\" (our republic). The GDR still supported the idea of a German nation and the need for reunification. The Federal Republic was often called \"Westdeutschland\" or the BRD. After 1970 the GDR called itself a \"socialist state of German nation\". Westerners called the GDR \"Sowjetische Besatzungszone\" (SBZ, Soviet Zone of Occupation), \"Sowjetzone\", \"Ostzone\", \"Mitteldeutschland\" or \"Pankow\" (the GDR government was in the Pankow district of Berlin).\n\nIn 1990 the \"German Democratic Republic\" ceased to exist. Five \"neue Bundesländer\" (new federal states) were established and joined the \"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" (Federal Republic of Germany). East Berlin joined through merger with West Berlin; technically this was the sixth new federal state since West Berlin, although considered a de facto federal state, had the legal status of a military occupation zone.\n\nThe official name of the country is \"Federal Republic of Germany\" (Bundesrepublik Deutschland). The terms \"Westdeutschland\" and \"Ostdeutschland\" are still used for the western and the eastern parts of the German territory, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3191954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3191954", "title": "Natural barrier", "text": "Natural barrier\n\nA natural barrier refers to a physical feature that protects or hinders travel through or over.\n\nMountains, swamps, deserts and ice fields are among the clearest examples of natural barriers. Rivers are a more ambiguous example, as they may obstruct large-scale movement across them (especially by armies) but may facilitate smaller-scale movement along them in boats, once some of the people in the region have developed the relevant technologies. Seas have likewise been an obstacle at first, then a convenient medium for transport along coastlines, and finally a medium for intercontinental transport.\n\nNatural barriers have been important factors in human history, by obstructing migration and invasion. For example, Jared Diamond argues that West European nations have been the dominant powers of the last 500 years because Europe's many natural barriers divided it into competing nation-states and this competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.\n\nSome examples of natural barriers are the Himalayas isolating the Indian subcontinent from the rest of Asia, the Grand Canyon, the Dead sea, and the Mississippi river.\n"}
{"id": "21503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21503", "title": "Nevis", "text": "Nevis\n\nNevis is a small island in the Caribbean Sea that forms part of the inner arc of the Leeward Islands chain of the West Indies. Nevis and the neighbouring island of Saint Kitts constitute one country: the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Nevis is located near the northern end of the Lesser Antilles archipelago, about 350 km east-southeast of Puerto Rico and 80 km west of Antigua. Its area is and the capital is Charlestown.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis are separated by a shallow channel known as \"The Narrows\". Nevis is roughly conical in shape with a volcano known as Nevis Peak at its centre. The island is fringed on its western and northern coastlines by sandy beaches which are composed of a mixture of white coral sand with brown and black sand which is eroded and washed down from the volcanic rocks that make up the island. The gently-sloping coastal plain ( wide) has natural freshwater springs as well as non-potable volcanic hot springs, especially along the western coast.\n\nThe island was named \"Oualie\" (\"Land of Beautiful Waters\") by the Caribs and \"Dulcina\" (\"Sweet Island\") by the early British settlers. The name \"Nevis\" is derived from the Spanish \"Nuestra Señora de las Nieves\" (which means Our Lady of the Snows); the name first appears on maps in the 16th century. Nevis is also known by the sobriquet \"Queen of the Caribees\", which it earned in the 18th century, when its sugar plantations created much wealth for the British.\n\nNevis is of particular historical significance to Americans because it was the birthplace and early childhood home of Alexander Hamilton. For the British, Nevis is the place where Horatio Nelson was stationed as a young sea captain, and is where he met and married a Nevisian, Frances Nisbet, the young widow of a plantation-owner.\n\nThe majority of the approximately 12,000 citizens of Nevis are of primarily African descent, with notable British, Portuguese and Lebanese minority communities. English is the official language, and the literacy rate, 98 percent, is one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus gave the island the name \"San Martin\" (Saint Martin). However, the confusion of numerous poorly-charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain meant that this name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, which is still known as Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten.\n\nThe current name \"Nevis\" was derived from a Spanish name \"Nuestra Señora de las Nieves\" by a process of abbreviation and anglicisation. The Spanish name means Our Lady of the Snows. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a 4th-century Catholic miracle: a snowfall on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Presumably the white clouds that usually cover the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of this story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate.\n\nNevis was part of the Spanish claim to the Caribbean islands, a claim pursued until the Treaty of Madrid (1670), even though there were no Spanish settlements on the island. According to Vincent Hubbard, author of \"Swords, Ships & Sugar: History of Nevis\", the Spanish ruling caused many of the Arawak groups who were not ethnically Caribs to \"be redefined as Caribs overnight\". Records indicate that the Spanish enslaved large numbers of the native inhabitants on the more accessible of the Leeward Islands and sent them to Cubagua, Venezuela to dive for pearls. Hubbard suggests that the reason the first European settlers found so few \"Caribs\" on Nevis is that they had already been rounded up by the Spanish and shipped off to be used as slaves.\n\nNevis was first sighted by Columbus in 1493; the island had been settled for more than two thousand years by Amerindian people. The indigenous people of Nevis during these periods belonged to the Leeward Island Amerindian groups popularly referred to as Arawaks and Caribs, a complex mosaic of ethnic groups with similar culture and language. Dominican anthropologist Lennox Honychurch traces the European use of the term \"Carib\" to refer to the Leeward Island aborigines to Columbus, who picked it up from the Taínos on Hispaniola. It was not a name the Caribs called themselves. \"Carib Indians\" was the generic name used for all groups believed involved in cannibalistic war rituals, more particularly, the consumption of parts of a killed enemy's body.\n\nThe Amerindian name for Nevis was \"Oualie\", land of beautiful waters. The structure of the Island Carib language has been linguistically identified as Arawakan.\n\nIn spite of the Spanish claim, Nevis continued to be a popular stop-over point for English and Dutch ships on their way to the North American continent. Captain Bartholomew Gilbert of Plymouth visited the island in 1603, spending two weeks to cut twenty tons of lignum vitae wood. Gilbert sailed on to Virginia to seek out survivors of the Roanoke settlement in what is now North Carolina. Captain John Smith visited Nevis also on his way to Virginia in 1607. This was the voyage which founded Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the New World.\n\nOn 30 August 1620, James 6th of Scotland – James I of England asserted sovereignty over Nevis by giving a Royal Patent for colonisation to the Earl of Carlisle. However, actual European settlement did not happen until 1628, when Anthony Hilton moved from nearby Saint Kitts following a murder plot against him. He was accompanied by 80 other settlers, soon to be boosted by a further 100 settlers from London who had originally hoped to settle Barbuda. Hilton became the first Governor of Nevis. After the Treaty of Madrid (1670) between Spain and England, Nevis became the seat of the British colony and the Admiralty Court also sat in Nevis. Between 1675 and 1730, the island was the headquarters for the slave trade for the Leeward Islands, with approximately 6,000–7,000 enslaved West Africans passing through en route to other islands each year. The Royal African Company brought all its ships through Nevis. A 1678 census shows a community of Irish people – 22% of the population – existing as either indentured servants or freemen.\n\nDue to the profitable Slave Trade and the high quality of Nevisian sugar cane, the island soon became a dominant source of wealth for Great Britain and the slave-owning British plantocracy. When the Leeward Islands were separated from Barbados in 1671, Nevis became the seat of the Leeward Islands colony and was given the nickname \"Queen of the Caribees\". It remained colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to Antigua for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the British Leeward Islands. The island outranked larger islands like Jamaica in sugar production in the late 17th century. The wealth of the planters on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the Calendar State Papers in the British Colonial Office Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as \"head tax on slaves\", a tax payable in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in Montserrat, and 5,500 total in the other five islands. The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced by the fact that the cane juice from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of cane juice from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres). Twenty percent of the British Empire's total sugar production in 1700 was derived from Nevisian plantations. Exports from West Indian colonies like Nevis were worth more than all the exports from all the mainland Thirteen Colonies of North America combined at the time of the American Revolution.\n\nThe enslaved families formed the large labour force required to work the sugar plantations. After the 1650s the supply of white indentured servants began to dry up due to increased wages in England and less incentive to migrate to the colonies. By the end of the 17th century, the population of Nevis consisted of a small, rich planter elite in control, a marginal population of poor whites, a great majority of African-descended slaves, and an unknown number of maroons, escaped slaves living in the mountains. In 1780, 90 percent of the 10,000 people living on Nevis were black. Some of the maroons joined with the few remaining Caribs in Nevis to form a resistance force. Memories of the Nevisian maroons' struggle under the plantation system are preserved in place names such as Maroon Hill, an early centre of resistance.\n\nThe great wealth generated by the colonies of the West Indies led to wars between Spain, Britain, and France. The formation of the United States can be said to be a partial by-product of these wars and the strategic trade aims that often ignored North America. Three privateers (William Kidd being one of them) were employed by the British Crown to help protect ships in Nevis' waters.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the French, based on Saint Kitts, launched many attacks on Nevis, sometimes assisted by the Island Caribs, who in 1667 sent a large fleet of canoes along in support. In the same year a Franco-Dutch invasion fleet was repelled off Nevis by an English fleet. Letters and other records from the era indicate that the English on Nevis hated and feared the Amerindians. In 1674 and 1683 they participated in attacks on Carib villages in Dominica and St. Vincent, in spite of a lack of official approval from the Crown for the attack.\n\nOn Nevis, the English built Fort Charles and a series of smaller fortifications to aid in defending the island. This included Saddle Hill Battery, built in 1740 to replace a deodand on Mount Nevis.\n\nIn 1706, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, the French Canadian founder of Louisiana in North America, decided to drive the English out of Nevis and thus also stop pirate attacks on French ships; he considered Nevis the region's headquarters for piracy against French trade. During d'Iberville's invasion of Nevis, French buccaneers were used in the front line, infamous for being ruthless killers after the pillaging during the wars with Spain where they gained a reputation for torturing and murdering non-combatants. In the face of the invading force, the English militiamen of Nevis fled. Some planters burned the plantations, rather than letting the French have them, and hid in the mountains. It was the enslaved Africans who held the French at bay by taking up arms to defend their families and the island. The slave quarters had been looted and burned as well, as the main reward promised the men fighting on the French side in the attack was the right to capture as many slaves as possible and resell them in Martinique.\n\nDuring the fighting, 3,400 enslaved Nevisians were captured and sent off to Martinique, but about 1,000 more, poorly armed and militarily untrained, held the French troops at bay, by \"murderous fire\" according to an eyewitness account by an English militiaman. He wrote that \"the slaves' brave behaviour and defence there shamed what some of their masters did, and they do not shrink to tell us so.\" After 18 days of fighting, the French were driven off the island. Among the Nevisian men, women and children carried away on d'Iberville's ships, six ended up in Louisiana, the first persons of African descent to arrive there.\n\nOne consequence of the French attack was a collapsed sugar industry and during the ensuing hardship on Nevis, small plots of land on the plantations were made available to the enslaved families in order to control the loss of life due to starvation. With less profitability for the absentee plantation owners, the import of food supplies for the plantation workers dwindled. Between 1776 and 1783, when the food supplies failed to arrive altogether due to the rebellion in North America, 300–400 enslaved Nevisians starved to death. On 1 August 1834, slavery was abolished in the British Empire. In Nevis, 8,815 slaves were freed. The first Monday in August is celebrated as Emancipation Day and is part of the annual Nevis Culturama festival.\n\nA four-year apprenticeship programme followed the abolishment of slavery on the plantations. In spite of the continued use of the labour force, the Nevisian slave owners were paid over £150,000 in compensation from the British Government for the loss of property, whereas the enslaved families received nothing for 200 years of labour. One of the wealthiest planter families in Nevis, the Pinneys of Montravers Plantation, claimed £36,396 (worth close to £1,800,000 today) in compensation for the slaves on the family-owned plantations around the Caribbean.\n\nBecause of the early distribution of plots and because many of the planters departed from the island when sugar cultivation became unprofitable, a relatively large percentage of Nevisians already owned or controlled land at emancipation. Others settled on crown land. This early development of a society with a majority of small, landowning farmers and entrepreneurs created a stronger middleclass in Nevis than in Saint Kitts where the sugar industry continued until 2006. Even though the 15 families in the wealthy planter elite no longer control the arable land, Saint Kitts still has a large, landless working class population.\n\nNevis was united with Saint Kitts and Anguilla in 1882, and they became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967, though Anguilla seceded in 1971. Together, Saint Kitts and Nevis became independent on 19 September 1983. On 10 August 1998, a referendum on Nevis to separate from Saint Kitts had 2,427 votes in favour and 1,498 against, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nBefore 1967, the local government of Saint Kitts was also the government of Nevis and Anguilla. Nevis had two seats and Anguilla one seat in the government. The economic and infrastructural development of the two smaller islands was not a priority to the colonial federal government.\n\nWhen the hospital in Charlestown was destroyed in a hurricane in 1899, planting of trees in the squares of Saint Kitts and refurbishing of government buildings, also in Saint Kitts, took precedence over the rebuilding of the only hospital in Nevis. After five years without any proper medical facilities, the leaders in Nevis initiated a campaign, threatening to seek independence from Saint Kitts. The British Administrator in Saint Kitts, Charles Cox, was unmoved. He stated that Nevis did not need a hospital since there had been no significant rise in the number of deaths during the time Nevisians had been without a hospital. Therefore, no action was needed on behalf of the government, and besides, Cox continued, the Legislative Council regarded \"Nevis and Anguilla as a drag on St. Kitts and would willingly see a separation\". Finally, a letter of complaint to the metropolitan British Foreign Office gave result and the federal government in Saint Kitts was ordered by their superiors in London to take speedy action. The Legislative Council took another five years to consider their options. The final decision by the federal government was to not rebuild the old hospital after all, but to instead convert the old Government House in Nevis into a hospital, named Alexandra Hospital after Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII. A majority of the funds assigned for the hospital could thus spent on the construction of a new official residence in Nevis.\n\nAfter d'Iberville's invasion in 1704, records show Nevis’ sugar industry in ruins and a decimated population begging the English Parliament and relatives for loans and monetary assistance to stave off island-wide starvation. The sugar industry on the island never fully recovered and during the general depression that followed the loss of the West Indian sugar monopoly, Nevis fell on hard times and the island became one of the poorest in the region. The island remained poorer than Saint Kitts until 1991, when the fiscal performance of Nevis edged ahead of the fiscal performance of Saint Kitts for the first time since the French invasion. \n\nElectricity was introduced in Nevis in 1954, when two generators were shipped in to provide electricity to the area around Charlestown. In this regard, Nevis fared better than Anguilla, where there were no paved roads, no electricity and no telephones up until 1967. However, electricity did not become available island-wide on Nevis until 1971.\n\nAn ambitious infrastructure development programme was introduced in the early 2000s which included a transformation of the Charlestown port, construction of a new deep-water harbour, resurfacing and widening the Island Main Road, a new airport terminal and control tower, and a major airport expansion, which required the relocation of an entire village in order to make room for the runway extension.\n\nModernised classrooms and better equipped schools, as well as improvements in the educational system, have contributed to a leap in academic performance on the island. The pass rate among the Nevisian students sitting for the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) exams, the Cambridge General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) and the Caribbean Advance Proficiency Examinations is now consistently among the highest in the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\n\nThe formation of the island began in mid-Pliocene times, approximately 3.45 million years ago. Nine distinct eruptive centres from different geological ages, ranging from mid-Pliocene to Pleistocene, have contributed to the formation. No single model of the island's geological evolution can therefore be ascertained.\n\nNevis Peak (985 m /3,232 ft) is the dormant remnant of one of these ancient stratovolcanoes. The last activity took place about 100,000 years ago, but active fumaroles and hot springs are still found on the island, the most recent formed in 1953. The composite cone of Nevis volcano has two overlapping summit craters that are partially filled by a lava dome, created in recent, pre-Columbian time. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows were deposited on the lower slopes of the cone simultaneously. Nevis Peak is located on the outer crater rim. Four other lava domes were constructed on the flanks of the volcano, one on the northeast flank (Madden's Mount), one on the eastern flank (Butlers Mountain), one on the northwest coast (Mount Lily) and one on the south coast (Saddle Hill, with a height of 375 metres). The southernmost point on the island is Dogwood Point which is also the southernmost point of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nDuring the last ice age, when the sea level was 60 m lower, the three islands of Saint Kitts, Nevis and Sint Eustatius (also known as Statia) were connected as one island. Saba, however, is separated from these three by a deeper channel.\n\nThere are visible wave-breaking reefs along the northern and eastern shorelines. To the south and west, the reefs are located in deeper water and are suitable for scuba diving. The most developed beach on Nevis is the 6.5 km long Pinney's Beach, on the western or Caribbean coast. There are sheltered swimming beaches in Oualie Bay and Cades Bay. The eastern coast of the island faces into the Atlantic Ocean, and can have strong surf in parts of the shore which are unprotected by fringing coral reefs. The colour of the sand on the beaches of Nevis is variable: on a lot of the bigger beaches the sand is a yellow grey in colour, but some beaches on the southern coast have darker, reddish, or even black sand. Under a microscope it becomes clear that Nevis sand is a mixture of tiny fragments of coral, many foraminifera, and small crystals of the various mineral constituents of the volcanic rock of which the island is made.\n\nSeven volcanic centers make up Nevis. These include Round Hill (3.43 Ma), Cades Bay (3.22 Ma), Hurricane Hill (2.7 Ma), Saddle Hill (1.8 Ma), Butlers Mountain (1.1 Ma), Red Cliff and Nevis Peak (0.98 Ma). These are mainly andesite and dacite lava domes, with associated block and ash flows, plus lahars.Nevis Peak has the highest elevation at 984 m. Cades Bay and Farm Estate Soufriere are noted areas of hydrothermal activity.\n\nWater has been piped since 1911 from a spring called the \"Source\", located 1800 feet up the mountain, to storage tanks at Rawlins Village, and since 1912, to Butler's Village. Additional drinking water comes from Nelson's Spring near Cotton Ground and Bath Spring. Groundwater has been extracted since the 1990s, and mixed with the Source water.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, massive deforestation was undertaken by the planters as the land was initially cleared for sugar cultivation. This intense land exploitation by the sugar and cotton industry lasted almost 300 years, and greatly changed the island's ecosystem.\n\nIn some places along the windswept southeast or \"Windward\" coast of the island, the landscape is radically altered compared with how it used to be in pre-colonial times. Due to extreme land erosion, the top soil was swept away, and in some places at the coast, sheer cliffs as high as 25 metres (82 ft) have developed.\n\nThick forest once covered the eastern coastal plain, where the Amerindians built their first settlements during the Aceramic period, complimenting the ecosystem surrounding the coral reef just offshore. It was the easy access to fresh water on the island and the rich food source represented by the ocean life sheltered by the reef that made it feasible for the Amerindians to settle this area around 600 BC. With the loss of the natural vegetation, the balance in runoff nutrients to the reef was disturbed, eventually causing as much as 80 percent of the large eastern fringing reef to become inactive. As the reef broke apart, it in turn provided less protection for the coastline.\n\nDuring times of maximum cultivation, sugar cane fields stretched from the coastline of Nevis up to an altitude at which the mountain slopes were too steep and rocky to farm. Nonetheless, once the sugar industry was finally abandoned, vegetation on the leeward side of the island regrew reasonably well, as scrub and secondary forest.\n\nNevis has several natural freshwater springs (including Nelson's Spring). The island also has numerous non-potable volcanic hot springs, including most notably the Bath Spring near Bath village, just south of the capital Charlestown.\n\nAfter heavy rains, powerful rivers of rainwater pour down the numerous ravines (known as ghauts). When the water reaches the coastline, the corresponding coastal ponds, both freshwater and brackish, fill to capacity and beyond, spilling over into the sea.\n\nWith modern development, the existing freshwater springs are no longer enough to supply water to the whole island. The water supply now comes mostly from Government wells. The major source of potable water for the island is groundwater, obtained from 14 active wells. Water is pumped from the wells, stored and allowed to flow by gravity to the various locations.\n\nThe climate is tropical with little variation, tempered all year round (but particularly from December through February) by the steady north-easterly winds, called the trade winds. There is a slightly hotter and somewhat rainier season from May to November.\n\nNevis lies within the track area of tropical storms and occasional hurricanes. These storms can develop between August and October. This time of year has the heaviest rainfalls.\n\nThe official currency is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$), which is shared by eight other territories in the region.\n\nThe European Commission's Delegation in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean estimates the annual per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on Nevis to be about 10 percent higher than on St. Kitts.\n\nThe major source of revenue for Nevis today is tourism. During the 2003–2004 season, approximately 40,000 tourists visited Nevis. A five star hotel \"(The Four Seasons Resort Nevis, West Indies)\", four exclusive restored plantation inns, and several smaller hotels, are currently in operation. Larger developments along the west coast have recently been approved and are in the process of being developed.\n\nThe introduction of secrecy legislation has made offshore financial services a rapidly growing economic sector in Nevis. Incorporation of companies, international insurance and reinsurance, as well as several international banks, trust companies, asset management firms, have created a boost in the economy. During 2005, the Nevis Island Treasury collected $94.6 million in annual revenue, compared to $59.8 million during 2001. In 1998, 17,500 international banking companies were registered in Nevis. Registration and annual filing fees paid in 1999 by these entities amounted to over 10 percent of Nevis’ revenues. The offshore financial industry gained importance during the financial disaster of 1999 when Hurricane Lenny damaged the major resort on the island, causing the hotel to be closed down for a year and 400 of the 700 employees to be laid off.\n\nIn 2000, the Financial Action Task Force, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a blacklist of 35 nations which were said to be non-cooperative in the campaign against tax evasion and money laundering. The list included the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, as well as Liechtenstein, Monaco, Luxembourg, the British Channel Islands, Israel, and Russia.\n\nThe political structure for the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is based on the Westminster Parliamentary system, but it is a unique structure in that Nevis has its own unicameral legislature, consisting of Her Majesty's representative (the Deputy Governor General) and members of the Nevis Island Assembly. Nevis has considerable autonomy in its legislative branch. The constitution actually empowers the Nevis Island Legislature to make laws that cannot be abrogated by the National Assembly. In addition, Nevis has a constitutionally protected right to secede from the federation, should a two-third majority of the island's population vote for independence in a local referendum. Section 113.(1) of the constitution states: \"The Nevis Island Legislature may provide that the island of Nevis shall cease to be federated with the island of Saint Christopher and accordingly that this Constitution shall no longer have effect in the island of Nevis.\"\n\nNevis has its own premier and its own government, the Nevis Island Administration. It collects its own taxes and has a separate budget, with a current account surplus. According to a statement released by the Nevis Ministry of Finance in 2005, Nevis had one of the highest growth rates in gross national product and per capita income in the Caribbean at that point.\n\nThe federal prime minister, Timothy Harris, is the leader of the majority party of the federal House of Representatives in Saint Kitts, and his cabinet conducts the affairs of state. The Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis has a 14 or 15-member unicameral legislature or parliament (the Senate and House of Representatives sit and vote together): A Senate, with three or four members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and the leader of the opposition; and a popularly elected House of Representatives with 11 members, eight Saint Kitts seats and three Nevis seats. The prime minister and the cabinet are responsible to the Parliament.\n\nNevis elections are scheduled every five years. The Nevis elections of 2013, called on 23 January 2013, was won by the party in opposition, the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), led by Vance Amory. The CCM won three of the five seats in the Nevis Island Assembly, while the incumbent party, the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP), won two.\n\nIn the federal elections of 2010, the CCM won two of the three Nevis assigned Federal seats, while the NRP won one. Of the eight Saint Kitts assigned federal seats, the St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party won six and the People's Action Movement (PAM) two.\n\nJoseph Parry, leader of the opposition, has indicated that he favours constitutional reform over secession for Nevis. His party, the NRP, has historically been the strongest and most ardent proponent for Nevis independence; the party came to power with secession as the main campaign issue. In 1975, the NRP manifesto declared that: \"The Nevis Reformation Party will strive at all costs to gain secession for Nevis from St. Kitts – a privilege enjoyed by the island of Nevis prior to 1882.\"\n\nA cursory proposal for constitutional reform was presented by the NRP in 1999, but the issue was not prominent in the 2006 election campaign and it appears a detailed proposal has yet to be worked out and agreed upon within the party.\n\nIn \"Handbook of Federal Countries\" published by Forum of Federations, the authors consider the constitution problematic because it does not \"specifically outline\" the federal financial arrangements or the means by which the central government and Nevis Island Administration can raise revenue: \"In terms of the NIA, the constitution only states (in s. 108(1)) that 'all revenues...raised or received by the Administration...shall be paid into and form a fund styled the Nevis Island Consolidated Fund.' [...] Section 110(1) states that the proceeds of all 'takes' collected in St. Kitts and Nevis under any law are to be shared between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration based on population. The share going to the NIA, however, is subject to deductions (s. 110(2)), such as the cost of common services and debt charges, as determined by the Governor-General (s.110(3)) on the advice of the Prime Minister who can also take advice from the Premier of Nevis (s.110(4)).\"\n\nAccording to a 1995 report by the Commonwealth Observer Group of the Commonwealth Secretariat, \"the federal government is also the local government of St Kitts and this has resulted in a perception among the political parties in Nevis that the interests of the people of Nevis are being neglected by the federal government which is more concerned with the administration of St Kitts than with the federal administration.\"\n\nSimeon Daniel, Nevis' first Premier and former leader of the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) and Vance Amory, Premier and leader of the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM), made sovereign independence for Nevis from the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis part of their parties' agenda. Since independence from the United Kingdom in 1983, the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government have been involved in several conflicts over the interpretation of the new constitution which came into effect at independence. During an interview on Voice of America in March 1998, repeated in a government issued press release headlined \"PM Douglas Maintains 1983 Constitution is Flawed\", Prime Minister Denzil Douglas called the constitution a \"recipe for disaster and disharmony among the people of both islands\".\n\nA crisis developed in 1984 when the People's Action Movement (PAM) won a majority in the Federal elections and temporarily ceased honouring the Federal Government's financial obligations to Nevis. Consequently, cheques issued by the Nevis Administration were not honoured by the Bank, public servants in Nevis were not paid on time and the Nevis Island Administration experienced difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.\n\nThere is also substantial support in Nevis for British Overseas Territory status similarly to Anguilla, which was formerly the third of the tri-state Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla colony.\n\nIn 1996, four new bills were introduced in the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, one of which made provisions to have revenue derived from activities in Nevis paid directly to the treasury in Saint Kitts instead of to the treasury in Nevis. Another bill, The Financial Services Committee Act, contained provisions that all investments in Saint Kitts and Nevis would require approval by an investment committee in Saint Kitts. This was controversial, because ever since 1983 the Nevis Island Administration had approved all investments for Nevis, on the basis that the constitution vests legislative authority for industries, trades and businesses and economic development in Nevis to the Nevis Island Administration.\n\nAll three representatives from Nevis, including the leader of the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these bills into the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that the bills would affect the ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that the bills would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared the conviction that the bills, if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.\n\nThe constitutional crisis initially developed when the newly appointed Attorney General refused to grant permission for the Nevis Island Administration to assert its legal right in the Courts. After a decision of the High Court in favour of the Nevis Island Administration, the Prime Minister gave newspaper interviews stating that he \"refused to accept the decision of the High Court\". Due to the deteriorating relationship between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government, a Constitutional Committee was appointed in April 1996 to advise on whether or not the present constitutional arrangement between the islands should continue. The committee recommended constitutional reform and the establishment of an island administration for Saint Kitts, separate from the Federal Government.\n\nThe Federal Government in Saint Kitts fills both functions today and Saint Kitts does not have an equivalent to the Nevis Island Administration. Disagreements between the political parties in Nevis and between the Nevis Island Administration and the Federal Government have prevented the recommendations by the electoral committee from being implemented. The problematic political arrangement between the two islands therefore continues to date.\n\nNevis has continued developing its own legislation, such as The Nevis International Insurance Ordinance and the Nevis International Mutual Funds Ordinance of 2004, but calls for secession are often based on concerns that the legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration might be challenged again in the future.\n\nThe issues of political dissension between Saint Kitts and Nevis are often centred around perceptions of imbalance in the economic structure. As noted by many scholars, Nevisians have often referred to a structural imbalance in Saint Kitts' favour in how funds are distributed between the two islands and this issue has made the movement for Nevis secession a constant presence in the island's political arena, with many articles appearing in the local press expressing concerns such as those compiled by Everton Powell in \"What Motivates Our Call for Independence\": \n\nA referendum on secession from the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis was held in 1998. Although 62% voted in favor of a secession, a two-thirds majority would have been necessary for the referendum to succeed.\n\nThe island of Nevis is divided into five administrative subdivisions called parishes, each of which has an elected representative in the Nevis Island Assembly. The division of this almost round island into parishes was done in a circular sector pattern, so each parish is shaped like a pie slice, reaching from the highest point of Nevis Peak down to the coastline.\n\nThe parishes have double names, for example Saint George Gingerland. The first part of the name is the name of the patron saint of the parish church, and the second part of the name is the traditional common name of the parish. Often the parishes are referred to simply by their common names. The religious part of a parish name is sometimes written or pronounced in the possessive: Saint George's Gingerland.\n\nThe five parishes of Nevis are:\n\n\"Culturama\", the annual cultural festival of Nevis, is celebrated during the Emancipation Day weekend, the first week of August. The festivities include many traditional folk dances, such as the masquerade, the Moko jumbies on stilts, Cowboys and Indians, and Plait the Ribbon, a May pole dance. The celebration was given a more organised form in 1974, including a Miss Culture Show and a Calypso Competition, as well as drama performances, old fashion Troupes (including Johnny Walkers, Giant and Spear, Bulls, Red Cross and Blue Ribbon), arts and crafts exhibitions and recipe competitions. According to the Nevis Department of Culture, the aim is to protect and encourage indigenous folklore, in order to make sure that the uniquely Caribbean culture can \"reassert itself and flourish\".\n\nThe official language is English yet, Saint Kitts Creole (known on the island as 'Nevisian' or 'Nevis creole') is also widely spoken. The local creole is actually more widely spoken on Nevis than on the neighbouring island.\n\nNevisian culture has since the 17th century incorporated African, European and East Indian cultural elements, creating a distinct Afro-Caribbean culture. Several historical anthropologists have done field research Nevis and in Nevisian migrant communities in order to trace the creation and constitution of a Nevisian cultural community. Karen Fog Olwig published her research about Nevis in 1993, writing that the areas where the Afro-Caribbean traditions were especially strong and flourishing relate to kinship and subsistence farming. However, she adds, Afro-Caribbean cultural impulses were not recognised or valued in the colonial society and were therefore often expressed through Euro-Caribbean cultural forms. Examples of European forms appropriated to express Afro-Caribbean culture are the Nevisian and Kittitian \"Tea Meetings\" and \"Christmas Sports\". According to anthropologist Roger D. Abrahams, these traditional performance art forms are \"Nevisian approximation of British performance codes, techniques, and patterns\". He writes that the Tea Meetings were staged as theatrical \"battles between decorum and chaos\", decorum represented by the ceremony chairmen and chaos the hecklers in the audience, with a diplomatic King or a Queen presiding over the battle to ensure fairness.\n\nThe Christmas Sports included a form of comedy and satire based on local events and gossip. They were historically an important part of the Christmas celebrations in Nevis, performed on Christmas Eve by small troupes consisting of five or six men accompanied by string bands from different parts of the island. One of the men in the troupe was dressed as a woman, playing all the female parts in the dramatisations. The troupes moved from yard to yard to perform their skits, using props, face paint and costumes to play the roles of well-known personalities in the community. Examples of gossip about undesired behaviour that could surface in the skits for comic effect were querulous neighbours, adulterous affairs, planters mistreating workers, domestic disputes or abuse, crooked politicians and any form of stealing or cheating experienced in the society. Even though no names were mentioned in these skits, the audience would usually be able to guess who the heckling message in the troupe's dramatised portrayals was aimed at, as it was played out right on the person's own front yard. The acts thus functioned as social and moral commentaries on current events and behaviours in Nevisian society. This particular form is called \"Bazzarding\" by many locals. Abrahams theorises that Christmas Sports are rooted in the pre-emancipation Christmas and New Year holiday celebrations, when the enslaved population had several days off.\n\nAmerican folklorist and musicologist Alan Lomax visited Nevis in 1962 in order to conduct long-term research into the black folk culture of the island. His field trip to Nevis and surrounding islands resulted in the anthology \"Lomax Caribbean Voyage\" series. \nAmong the Nevisians recorded were chantey-singing fishermen in a session organised in a rum shop in Newcastle; Santoy, the Calypsonian, performing calypsos by Nevisian ballader and local legend Charles Walters to guitar and cuatro; and string bands, fife players and drummers from Gingerland, performing quadrilles.\n\nThe island is also known for \"Jamband music\", which is the kind of music performed by local bands during the \"Culturama Festival\" and is key to \"Jouvert\" dancing. The sounds of the so-called \"Iron Band\" are also popular within the culture; many locals come together using any old pans, sinks, or other kits of any sort; which they use to create sounds and music. This form of music is played throughout the villages during the Christmas and carnival seasons.\n\nA series of earthquakes during the 18th century severely damaged most of the colonial-era stone buildings of Charlestown. The Georgian stone buildings in Charlestown that are visible today had to be partially rebuilt after the earthquakes, and this led to the development of a new architectural style, consisting of a wooden upper floor over a stone ground floor; the new style resisted earthquake damage much more effectively.\n\nTwo famous Nevisian buildings from the 18th century are Hermitage Plantation, built of lignum vitae wood in 1740, the oldest surviving wooden house still in use in the Caribbean today, and the Bath Hotel, the first hotel in the Caribbean, a luxury hotel and spa built by John Huggins in 1778. The soothing waters of the hotel's hot spring and the lively social life on Nevis attracted many famous Europeans including Antigua-based Admiral Nelson, and Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence, (future William IV of the United Kingdom), who attended balls and private parties at the Bath Hotel. Today, the building serves as government offices, and there are two outdoor hot-spring bathing spots which were specially constructed in recent years for public use.\n\nAn often repeated legend appears to suggest that a destructive 1680 or 1690 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the buildings of the original capital Jamestown on the west coast. Folk tales say that the town sank beneath the ocean, and the tsunami is blamed for the escape of (possibly fictional) pirate Red Legs Greaves. However, archaeologists from the University of Southampton who have done excavations in the area, have found no evidence to indicate that the story is true. They state that this story may originate with an over-excited Victorian letter writer sharing somewhat exaggerated accounts of his exotic life in the tropical colony with a British audience back home. One such letter recounts that so much damage was done to the town that it was completely evacuated, and was engulfed by the sea. Early maps do not, however, actually show a settlement called \"Jamestown\", only \"Morton's Bay\", and later maps show that all that was left of Jamestown/Morton's Bay in 1818 was a building labelled \"Pleasure House\". Very old bricks that wash up on Pinney's Beach after storms may have contributed to this legend of a sunken town; however these bricks are thought to be dumped ballast from 17th and 18th century sailing ships.\n\n\n\n"}

These high latitudes are dominated by Earth's polar ice caps: the northern resting on the Arctic Ocean and the southern on the continent of Antarctica.\n\nThe Arctic has various definitions, including the region north of the Arctic Circle (currently Epoch 2010 at 66°33'44\" N), or the region north of 60° north latitude, or the region from the North Pole south to the timberline. The Antarctic is usually defined as south of 60° south latitude, or the continent of Antarctica. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty uses the former definition.\n\nThe two polar regions are distinguished from the other two climatic and biomatic belts of Earth, a tropics belt near the equator, and two middle latitude regions located between the tropics and polar regions.\n\nPolar regions receive less intense solar radiation than the other parts of Earth because the sun's energy arrives at an oblique angle, spreading over a larger area, and also travels a longer distance through the Earth's atmosphere in which it may be absorbed, scattered or reflected, which is the same thing that causes winters to be colder than the rest of the year in temperate areas.\n\nThe axial tilt of the Earth has a major effect on climate of the polar regions. Since the polar regions are the farthest from the equator, they receive the least amount of sunlight and are therefore frigid. The large amount of ice and snow also reflects a large part of what little sunlight the Polar regions receive, contributing to the cold. Polar regions are characterized by the polar climate, extremely cold temperatures, heavy glaciation wherever there is sufficient precipitation to form permanent ice, and extreme variations in daylight hours, with twenty-four hours of daylight in summer, and complete darkness at mid-winter.\n\nThere are many settlements in Earth's north polar region. Countries with claims to Arctic regions are: the United States (Alaska), Canada (Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut), Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, and Russia. Arctic circumpolar populations often share more in common with each other than with other populations within their national boundaries. As such, the northern polar region is diverse in human settlements and cultures.\n\nThe southern polar region has no permanent human habitation. McMurdo Station is the largest research station in Antarctica, run by the United States. Other notable stations include Palmer Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (United States), Esperanza Base and Marambio Base (Argentina), Scott Base (New Zealand), and Vostok Station (Russia).\n\nWhile there are no indigenous human cultures, there is a complex ecosystem, especially along Antarctica's coastal zones. Coastal upwelling provides abundant nutrients which feeds krill, a type of marine crustacea, which in turn feeds a complex of living creatures from penguins to blue whales.\n\n\n"}

However, their membership is characterized by boundaries and demarcations characteristic to a defined and unique geography, such as continents, or geopolitics, such as economic blocs. They have been established to foster cooperation and political and economic integration or dialogue among states or entities within a restrictive geographical or geopolitical boundary. They both reflect common patterns of development and history that have been fostered since the end of World War II as well as the fragmentation inherent in globalization. Most ROs tend to work alongside well-established multilateral organizations such as the United Nations. While in many instances a regional organization is simply referred to as an international organization, in many others it makes sense to use the term \"regional organization\" to stress the more limited scope of a particular membership. \n\nExamples of ROs include, a.o., the African Union (AU), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Arab League (AL), Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Council of Europe (CoE), Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), European Union (EU), South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), Union of South American Nations (USAN).\n\n\n"}

The administrative capital is Pangkham (, formerly known as Panghsang, 邦桑). The name \"Wa\" derives from the Wa ethnic group, who speak a language in the Austroasiatic family of languages.\n\nMany of the Wa are animists, and a small proportion of the population follows a derivative of either Buddhism or Christianity. The Wa were once known as the \"Wild Wa\" by the British due to their practice of headhunting.\n\nWa State is divided into northern and southern regions which are separated from one another, with the southern region bordering Thailand and consisting of 200,000 people. The total area of the region controlled by the Wa State is . Political leaders of the Wa State are mostly ethnic Wa people. The government of the Wa State emulates many political features of the government of China, having a Central Committee and a central party known as the United Wa State Party. Whilst the Wa State is \"de facto\" highly autonomous from the control of the central Myanmar government, their relationship is based on peaceful coexistence and the Wa State recognises the sovereignty of the central government over all of Myanmar.\n\nThe working language of the Wa State government is Chinese. Southwest Mandarin and Wa widely spoken by the population, with the language of education being Standard Mandarin Chinese. Television broadcasts within the Wa State are broadcast in Standard Chinese and Wa. Commodities within the Wa State are brought over from China, and the Renminbi is used for exchanges. China Mobile has cellular coverage over some parts of the Wa State.\n\nFor a long time, headman tribes were dispersed around the Wa mountainous area, with no unified governance. During the Qing dynasty, the region became separated from the tribal military control of the Dai people. British rule in Burma did not administer the Wa States and the border with China was left undefined.\n\nFrom the late 1940s, during the Chinese Civil War, remnants of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army retreated to territory within Burma as the communists took over mainland China. Within the mountain region Kuomintang forces of the held their position for two decades in preparation for a counterattack towards mainland China. Under pressure from the United Nations, the counterattack was cancelled and the army was recalled to northern Thailand and later back to Taiwan; however, some troops decided to remain within Burma. East of the Salween river, indigenous tribal guerilla groups exercised control with the support of the Burmese Communist Party.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Burmese Communist Party lost its base of operations within central Burma, and with the assistance of the Chinese communists, expanded within the border regions. Many intellectual youths from China joined the Burmese Communist Party, and these forces also absorbed many local guerillas. The Burmese communists gained control over Pangkham, which became their base of operations.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, the ethnic minorities of northeast Burma became politically separated from the Burmese Communist Party. On 17 April 1989, Bao Youxiang's armed forces announced their separation from the Burmese Communist Party, and formed the United Myanmar Ethnics Party, which later became the United Wa State Party. On 18 May, the Wa State and Myanmar military junta formed a ceasefire agreement.\n\nTensions between the central government and Wa state were heightened in 2009. During this time, peace initiative proposals by the Wa State were rejected by the Myanmar government. The government warned on 27 April 2010 that the WHP program could push Myanmar and the Wa State into further conflict.\n\nAfter the Communist Party of Burma lost control of its bases in central Burma in the late 1960s, it re-established itself in the northeast including Wa State, with the support of China. The Wa, like other ethnic groups were fighting for autonomy from Burma, and supported the CPB. They eventually rebelled along with the Kokang against the Burmese communist leadership, which was forced into exile across the Chinese border, at the time of the 8888 Uprising in mainland Burma. Following the subsequent collapse of the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) rule under Ne Win in Burma, the WNO made ceasefire and peace agreements with the new military regime, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).\n\nWa State comprises seven districts (townships) of what the Myanmar government officially deems as the Shan State. Internally, Wa State administers 15 districts within its territory.\nThe region is mainly mountainous, with deep valleys. The lowest points are approximately 600 metres above sea level, with the highest mountains over 3000 metres. Initially the Wa State was heavily reliant on opium production. With Chinese assistance, there has been a move towards growing rubber and tea plantations. The Wa State cultivates 220,000 acres of rubber. Due to the resettlement of residents from mountainous areas to fertile valleys, there is also cultivation of wet rice, corn and vegetables. Dozens died during the resettlement due to disease and road accidents. Wa State is economically dependent on China, which supports it financially and provides military and civilian advisors and weapons. It shares 82 miles (133 km) of frontier with China.\n\nUsing its 30,000 personnel, the United Wa State Army (UWSA) is the largest narcotics trafficking organization in Southeast Asia. It was once allied with the Communist Party of Burma (4,000 soldiers). The UWSA cultivates vast areas of land for the opium poppy, which is later refined to heroin. Methamphetamine trafficking is also important to the economy of the Wa State. The money from the opium is used for weapons. Although the Burmese government has begun taking measures to decrease the production of such drugs, it is an arduous task due to corruption at high levels in the government and a lack of infrastructure to carry out operations. In 2005, Wa State was declared by the UWSP as a drug-free zone and the cultivation of opium was prohibited.\n\nA BBC presentation aired on 19 November 2016 showed the burning of metamphetamine as well as a thriving trade in illegal animal parts.\n\n\n\n"}

From the study of this spectrum, the concentration of optically active components of the upper layer of the water body can be concluded via specific algorithms.\nWater quality monitoring by remote sensing and close-range instruments has obtained considerable attention since the founding of EU Water Framework Directive.\n\nIf water remote sensing is defined as the observation of the water from a distance in order to describe its color, without taking water samples, the gradual development of understanding of the transparency of natural waters and of the reason of their clarity variability and coloration has been sketched from the times of Henry Hudson (1600) to those of Chandrasekhara Raman (1930). However, the development of water remote sensing techniques (by the use of satellite imaging, aircraft or close range optical devices) didn't start until the early 1970s. These first techniques measured the spectral and thermal differences in the emitted energy from water surfaces. In general, empirical relationships were settled between the spectral properties and the water quality parameters of the water body. In 1974, Ritchie et al. (1974) developed an empirical approach to determine suspended sediments. This kind of empirical models are only able to use to determine water quality parameters of water bodies with similar conditions. In 1992 an analytical approach was used by Schiebe et al. (1992). This approach was based on the optical characteristics of water and water quality parameters to elaborate a physically based model of the relationship between the spectral and physical properties of the surface water studied. This physically based model was successfully applied in order to estimate suspended sediment concentrations.\n\nWater Remote sensing instruments allow to record the color of a water body, which provides information on the presence and abundance of optically active natural water components. The water color spectrum is defined as an apparent optical property (AOP) of the water. This means that the color of the water is influenced by the angular distribution of the light field and by the nature and quantity of the substances in the medium, in this case, water. Thus, the value of this parameter will change with changes in the optical properties and concentrations of the optically active substances in the water, the inherent optical properties or IOPS. The IOPS are independent from the angular distribution of light but they are dependent from the type and substances present in the medium as well. For instance, the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance, Kd (it is often used as an index of water clarity or ocean turbidity) is defined as an AOP, while the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient of the medium are defined as IOPS.\nThere are two different approaches to determine the concentration of optically active water components by the study of the spectra. The first approach consist of empirical algorithms based on statistical relationships and the second approach consists of analytical algorithms based on the inversion of calibrated bio-optical models. Accurate calibration of the relationships/models used is an important condition for successful inversion on water remote sensing techniques and the determination of concentration of water quality parameters from observed spectral remote sensing data.\nThus, these techniques depend on their ability to record these changes in the spectral signature of light backscattered from water surface and relate these recorded changes to water quality parameters via empirical or analytical approaches. Depending of the water constituents of interest and the sensor used, different parts of the spectrum will be analysed.\n\nBy the use of Optical close range devices (e.g. spectrometers, radiometers), airplanes or helicopters (airborne remote sensing) and satellites (space born remote sensing), the light reflected from the water bodies is measured. For instance, algorithms are used to retrieve parameters such as chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentration, the absorption by colored dissolved organic matter at 440 nm (aCDOM) and secchi depth. The measurement of these values will give an idea about the water quality of the water body being studied. A very high concentration of green pigments like chlorophyll might indicate the presence of an algal bloom, for example, due to eutrophication processes. Thus, the chlorophyll concentration could be used as a proxy or indicator for the trophic condition of a water body. In the same manner, other optical quality parameters such as suspended particles or Suspended Particulate matter (SPM), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Transparency (Kd), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) can be used to monitor water quality.\n\n"}
