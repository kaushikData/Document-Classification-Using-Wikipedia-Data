These divisions were discovered in 2002. Many of the units have equivalents in the system of South Korea. At the highest level are nine provinces, two directly governed cities, and three special administrative divisions. The second-level divisions are cities, counties, wards, and districts. These are further subdivided into third-level entities: towns, neighborhoods, villages, and \"workers' districts\".\n\nThe three-level administrative system used in North Korea was first inaugurated by Kim Il-sung in 1952, as part of a massive restructuring of local government. Previously, the country had used a multi-level system similar to that still used in South Korea.\n\n(The English translations are not official, but approximations. Names are romanized according to the McCune-Reischauer system as officially used in North Korea; the editor was also guided by the spellings used on the 2003 National Geographic map of Korea).\n\nThe nine provinces (\"To\"; , ) derive from the traditional provinces of Korea, but have been further subdivided since the division of Korea. They are large areas including cities, rural and mountainous regions. The two special cities (\"T'ŭkpyŏlsi\"; , ) are large metropolitan cities that have been separated from their former provinces to become first-level units. Four other cities have been directly governed in the past, but were subsequently reunited with their provinces or otherwise reorganized.\n\nThe three special administrative regions were all created in 2002 for the development of collaborative ventures with South Korea and other countries. One of them, the Sinuiju Special Administrative Region, was intended to draw Chinese investment and enterprise, but as of 2006 appears never to have been implemented. The special administrative regions do not have any known second- and third-level subdivisions.\n\nThe most common second-level division is the county (\"Kun\"; , ), a less urbanized area within a province or directly governed city. The more populous districts within provinces are cities (\"Si\"; , ), and the city of Nampho is a special city (\"T'ŭkkŭpsi\"; , ). Some provinces also have two types of districts (\"Ku\", \"Chigu\").\n\nThe city centers of the directly governed cities are organized into wards (\"Kuyŏk\", equivalent to South Korean \"Gu\").\n\nRural parts of cities and counties are organized into villages (\"Ri\", ). The downtown areas within cities are divided into neighborhoods (\"Tong\", ), and a populous part of a county forms a town (\"Ŭp\", ). Some counties also have workers' districts (\"Rodongjagu\", ).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30876082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30876082", "title": "Alborz", "text": "Alborz\n\nThe Alborz ( ), also spelled as Alburz, Elburz or Elborz, is a mountain range in northern Iran that stretches from the border of Azerbaijan along the western and entire southern coast of the Caspian Sea and finally runs northeast and merges into the Aladagh Mountains in the northern parts of Khorasan. This mountain range is divided into Western, Central, and Eastern Alborz Mountains. The Western Alborz Range (usually called the Talysh) runs south-southeastward almost along the western coast of the Caspian Sea. The Central Alborz (the Alborz Mountains in the strictest sense) runs from west to east along the entire southern coast of the Caspian Sea, while the Eastern Alborz runs in a northeasterly direction towards the northern parts of the Khorasan region southeast of the Caspian Sea. Mount Damavand, the highest mountain in Iran, is located in the Central Alborz Mountains.\n\nThe name \"Alborz\" is derived from that of Harā Barazaitī, a legendary mountain in the Avesta, the main text of Zoroastrianism. \"Harā Barazaitī\" reflects Proto-Iranian *\"Harā Bṛzatī\". *\"Bṛzatī\" is the feminine form of the adjective *\"bṛzant-\" \"high\", the ancestor of modern Persian \"boland\" (بلند) and \"Barz/Berazandeh\", cognate with Sanskrit \"Brihat\" (बृहत्). \"Harā\" may be interpreted as \"watch\" or \"guard\", from an Indo-European root *\"ser-\" \"protect\". In Middle Persian, \"Harā Barazaitī\" became \"Harborz\", Modern Persian \"Alborz\", which is a cognate with Elbrus, the highest peak of the Caucasus.\n\nZoroastrians may identify the range with the dwelling place of the Peshyotan, and the Zoroastrian Ilm-e-Kshnoom sect identify Mount Davamand as the home of the \"Saheb-e-Dilan\" ('Masters of the Heart'). In his epic Shahnameh, the poet Ferdowsi speaks of the mountains \"as though they lay in India.\" This could reflect older usage, for numerous high peaks were given the name and some even reflect it to this day, for example, Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, and Mount Elbariz (Albariz, Jebal Barez) in the Kerman area above the Strait of Hormuz. All these names reflect the same Iranian language compound, and share an identification as the legendary mountain Harā Bərəzaitī of the Avesta.\n\nThe Alborz mountain range forms a barrier between the south Caspian and the Iranian plateau. It is only 60–130 km wide and consists of sedimentary series dating from Upper Devonian to Oligocene, prevalently Jurassic limestone over a granite core. Continental conditions regarding sedimentation are reflected by thick Devonian sandstones and by Jurassic shales containing coal seams. Marine conditions are reflected by Carboniferous and Permian strata that are composed mainly of limestones. In the Eastern Alborz Range, the far eastern section is formed by Mesozoic (chiefly Triassic and Jurassic) rocks, while the western part of the Eastern Alborz Range is made primarily of Paleozoic rocks. Precambrian rocks can be found chiefly south of the city of Gorgan situated in the southeast of the Caspian Sea and in much smaller portions in the central and western parts of the Central Alborz Range. The central part of the Central Alborz Range is formed mainly of the Triassic and Jurassic rocks, while the northwestern section of the range is made mainly of the Jurassic rocks. Very thick beds of the Tertiary (mostly of the Eocene) green volcanic tuffs and lavas are found mainly in the southwestern and south-central parts of the range. The far northwestern part of the Alborz that constitutes what is called the Western Alborz Range or the Talish Mountains is made mainly of the Upper Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary deposits with a strip of Paleozoic rocks and a band of Triassic and Jurassic rocks in the southern parts, both in a northwest-southeast direction. As the Tethys Sea was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise movement of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed from both sides. The collisions finally caused the folding of the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleogene rocks, and the Cenozoic (chiefly the Eocene) volcanism to form the Alborz Mountains mainly in the Miocene. The Alpine orogeny began, therefore, with Eocene volcanism in southwestern and south-central parts of the Alborz and continued with the uplift and folding of the older sedimentary rocks in the northwestern, central and eastern parts of the range during the orogenic phases of importance that date from the Miocene and the Pliocene epochs.\n\nWhile the southern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are usually semiarid or arid with irregular and low precipitation, the northern slopes of the range are usually humid especially in the western parts of the Central Alborz. In the southern slopes or the Elburz Range forest steppe ecoregion, the higher elevations are arid with few trees. Juniper is the most common tree in the inaccessible areas and high elevations, while shrubs are pistachio, maple, and almond. But in the northern slopes, the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion is lush and forested. The natural vegetation of this region grows in distinct zones: the Hyrcanian forests on the lowest levels; beech forests in the middle zone; and oak forests in higher regions. The wild cypress is the dominant form of vegetation in some valleys, while olive trees grow in the western valleys of the Central Alborz near the Sefidrud. The bezoar ibex, Blanford's fox, Rüppell's fox, red fox, Persian fallow deer, wild boar, Syrian brown bear, Persian leopard, Indian wolf, buzzard, goose, woodpecker, griffon vulture, and eagle are among important animals and birds found in the Alborz Mountains. The extinct Caspian tiger also lived in the Alborz Mountains.\n\nDue to the great snowy winters of the Alborz Mountains, there are several ski resorts in different places of the range. Some consider that a few of these are among the best in the world. Some of most important ones are Dizin, Shemshak, Tochal, and Darbandsar.\n\nMount Damavand is featured twice as an online multiplayer map in the game Battlefield 3. In the game it is featured in Damavand Peak and Alborz Mountains.\n\n\n\n"}

The ecosystem includes Antarctica and several island groups in the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The continent of Antarctica is so cold and dry that it has supported only 2 vascular plants for millions of years, and its flora presently consists of around 250 lichens, 100 mosses, 25-30 liverworts, and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algal species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica's two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (\"Deschampsia antarctica\") and Antarctic pearlwort (\"Colobanthus quitensis\"), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. Antarctica is also home to a diversity of animal life, including penguins, seals, and whales.\n\nSeveral Antarctic island groups are considered part of the Antarctica realm, including South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Crozet Islands, Prince Edward Islands, Heard Island, the Kerguelen Islands, and the McDonald Islands. These islands have a somewhat milder climate than Antarctica proper, and support a greater diversity of tundra plants, although they are all too windy and cold to support trees.\n\nAntarctic krill is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, crabeater seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds. The ocean there is so full of phytoplankton because around the ice continent water rises from the depths to the light flooded surface, bringing nutrients from all oceans back to the photic zone.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living below the ice of Antarctica.\n\nMillions of years ago, Antarctica was warmer and wetter, and supported the Antarctic flora, including forests of podocarps and southern beech. Antarctica was also part of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland, which gradually broke up by continental drift starting 110 million years ago. The separation of South America from Antarctica 30-35 million years ago allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form, which isolated Antarctica climatically and caused it to become much colder. The Antarctic flora subsequently died out in Antarctica, but is still an important component of the flora of southern Neotropic (South America) and Australasia, which were also former parts of Gondwana.\n\nSome botanists recognize an Antarctic Floristic Kingdom that includes Antarctica, New Zealand, and parts of Temperate South America where the Antarctic Flora is still a major component.\n\nFour tundra ecoregions are recognized:\n"}

{"id": "50525160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50525160", "title": "Californium (video game)", "text": "Californium (video game)\n\nCalifornium is an exploration game co-developed by Darjeeling and Nova Productions, and released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows and OS X. \"Californium\" was developed as a tribute to science-fiction author Philip K. Dick on the 30th anniversary of his death. The player controls Elvin Green, a struggling writer dealing with family matters, as he discovers the means to manipulate reality, and explores several surreal landscapes.\n\nAs an exploration game, the player can move Green around the current level, but has no direct means to interact with it. Several non-playable characters can be approached to initiate a one-side dialog with them. Through each level are several cathode-ray tube monitors that once discovered will present a Roman numeral value to the player. This represents the number of reality-warping points that must be found in the nearby area. These points are marked with a glowing Θ (Theta) glyph, but may require the player to look upon the point from a specific vantage point, to turn to look at the point from a specific direction, or to look near the point to eliminate objects in front of it to make it appear. When the glyph is hidden, objects nearby will flicker in and out of reality, allowing the player to recognize the glyph is nearby. Once the glyph is found, the player interacts with their controllers to activate it. This causes a spherical bubble of a new reality to replace what had previously been there. Once all the glyphs for a section are found, the player is given some narrative for the game, and other sections of the level may be made available. Once all sections are completed in the same manner, the player must then find the right vantage point on the level to active a final large glyph that spans across many difference surfaces.\n\nElvin Green is a struggling writer living in Berkeley, California in 1967. Following the death of his daughter and the departure of his wife, Green is unable to come up with new material for a book, and his publisher threatens to drop him. Green suddenly hears a voice in his head, telling him to seek out images of the Theta. In finding these, Green is able to alter his reality and slip into new ones - one where he is a successful writer in a society that worship Abraham Lincoln as a revered figure, and other where Green has helped an alien species take over humanity.\n\n\"Californium\" was borne out of an idea between the development teams Darjeeling and Nova Productions in 2011 as the 30th anniversary of Dick's death was approaching. Darjeeling digital producer Noam Roubah noted that many of the themes that Dick had written about have since come to pass in the 21st century, such as the Internet and the dehumanization of human communications. The developers initially thought of doing a web-based project but within a few months opted to use a video game for this work. The teams brough artist Olivier Bonhomme to create surreal environments to reflect a more psychedelic feel, acknowledging the influence of recreational drugs in Dick's life, rather than the darker tones used in other adoptions of Dick's works. The developers took inspiration from Dick's earlier years in crafting Green; the departure of Green's wife and his dismissive editor are similar concepts Dick had to face early on.\n\nThe gameplay's central concept, of discovering the Theta glyph to change reality, was inspired by autobiographic material Dick wrote on coming to an epiphany in 1974 on seeing a woman wearing a ichthys symbol, which caused him to have a vision of a \"pink beam\" that would impart wisdom and insight to those it touched. The impact in the game comes from another of Dick's essays, \"If You Find This World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others\", in which Dick considers that many alternate realities are occurring simultaneously with the current one, and may come to see those though the subconscious. Journalists from \"Ars Technica\" and \"Motherboard\" have noted the game shares many similarities with Dick's 1981 \"VALIS\", the first of a planned trilogy, which presents a story in which human behavior is controlled by an external intelligence.\n\nThe game was developed with financial support from the French broadcaster Arte, and was released to coincide with an Arte mini-series on the writer. Though the game was meant to be a tribute to Dick, the developers could not get appropriate rights from Dick's estate to use his name in any of the promotional materials for the title.\n\n\"Wired\"s Jake Muncy wrote that while \"California\"s mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs may become tedious, the game performed well as a \"deep dive\" in the ideas Philip K. Dick wrote about. Daniel Oberhaus for \"Motherboard\" similarly found the gameplay overly repetitive and felt because the developers could not attach Dick's name to the game, the game's connection to the author was weak, using only the more obscure biographical facts about Dick's life to make the association. Oberhaus though praised the game's visuals and attention to era-specific details. Martin Robinson of \"Eurogamer\" similarly found the details relating to Dick and his writings to be well done, but the central gameplay mechanic of finding the hidden glyphs become frustrating as there seemed to be no logic into how to reveal some of the glyphs. \"Rock Paper Shotgun\"s John Walker commented that the approach of showing the bubbles of alternate realities was \"extraordinary as a piece of level design\", while some of the attempts at meta-fictional narration had been better accomplished in \"The Stanley Parable\".\n"}

The Seminole Heights and Hyde Park neighborhoods are two of the largest historic preservation districts in Tampa.\n\nThe downtown business district of Tampa is located immediately east of the Hillsborough River, and southwest of the Ybor City Historic District. Downtown includes the Tampa Theatre, Rivergate Tower, Tampa Museum of Art, Glazer Children's Museum, Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, Kress building, Straz Performing Arts Center, SunTrust building.\n\nTampa International Airport is located approximately west-northwest of the downtown area, and easily connected to most parts of the city by three Interstate Highways, maximizing its accessibility. The largest industrial sections of town are located to the north of the airport and east of the city limits, while most of the residential areas of the city are located to the southwest, northwest, northeast and west of downtown.\n\nAnother major business district is the Westshore Business District, located east of Tampa Bay and south of Tampa International Airport. Currently, Westshore has more than of commercial office space, 4,000 businesses with nearly 100,000 employees, 32 hotels, 2 major shopping malls (International Plaza and Bay Street and WestShore Plaza). The city of Tampa has 165 parks with within its borders.\n\nThe city's architecture contains a blend of old and new. The neighborhoods of Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, and Hyde Park neighborhoods are historic preservation districts featuring mostly Victorian homes and buildings.\n\nIn 1891, Henry B. Plant built a lavish 500+ room, , US$2.5 million eclectic/Moorish Revival-style luxury resort hotel called the Tampa Bay Hotel among of manicured gardens along the banks of the Hillsborough River. Plant's resort featured a race track, a heated indoor pool, a golf course, a 2,000-seat auditorium, tennis courts, stables, hunting and fishing tours, and electric lights and telephones in every room, plus the first elevator in town and exotic art collectibles which Plant had shipped in from around the world.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Hotel was relatively prosperous for about a decade. The resort hosted thousands of guests and many celebrities of the era, but was only filled to capacity during the Spanish–American War (see below). Henry Plant died in 1899, and his heirs sold the facilities to the city of Tampa in 1904. The city operated the hotel and used the grounds as a community gathering place until 1932, when the resort was closed, remodeled, and reopened as the University of Tampa a year later.\n\nThe city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities that were annexed by the growing city. Generally, the city is divided into the following areas: Downtown Tampa, New Tampa, West Tampa, East Tampa, North Tampa, and South Tampa.\n\nOn the eastern portion of the city lies residential neighborhoods of College Hill, Jackson Heights-Belmont Heights, Ybor City, East Ybor, Southeast Seminole Heights, Northeast Community, Northview Hills, Live Oaks Square, Rivergrove, Grant Park, South Nebraska, Woodland Terrace and the industrial section of Gary, just east of downtown. The historic section of Ybor City is also located within this district.\n\nBesides the financial district, two upscale residential neighborhoods are Davis Island and Harbour Island.\n\nOn the southern portion of the city lies residential neighborhoods of Ballast Point, Fair Oaks - Manhattan Manor, Gandy-Sun Bay South (or just Sun Bay South), Golf View, Palma Ceia, South Westshore, Bayshore Beautiful, Bayshore Gardens, Belmar Shore, Port Tampa, Golfview, New Suburb Beautiful, and Virginia Park. The region also contains portions of Sunset Park and Oscawana.\n\nOn the western portion of the city lies residential neighborhoods of Armenia Gardens Estates, Beach Park, Beach Park Isles, Bon Air, Carver City-Lincoln Gardens, Culbreath Bayou, Culbreath Isles, Drew Park, Gray Gables, Lowry Park, Mid-Peninsula, Midtown, North Bon Air, North Hyde Park, Oakford Park, Palma Ceia West, Parkview, Plaza Terrace, Ridgewood River, Riverbend, Riverside Heights, South Seminole Heights, Wellswood, West Tampa, Westshore Palms.\n\nIn the West Tampa District, the sublets include Bowman Heights, MacFarlane Park, Northeast Macfarlane, Marina Club, and Old West Tampa.\n\nThe West Tampa region also contain parts of Lowry Park North, Southeast Seminole Heights, Sunset Park and Tampa Heights.\n\nOn the northern portion of the city lies residential neighborhoods of Forest Hills, Sulphur Springs, Temple Crest, Terrace Park, University Square, and North Tampa (neighborhood).\n\nMeanwhile, with characteristics of its own, the New Tampa district contains several upscale neighborhoods. They include Hunter's Green, West Meadows, Hunter's Key, and Tampa Palms.\n\nThe tallest buildings in Tampa are all in downtown.\n\nAlong the city's western shore, three bridges span Old Tampa Bay carrying vehicular traffic to and from Pinellas County: the Howard Frankland Bridge (I-275), the Courtney Campbell Causeway (SR 60), and the Gandy Bridge (US 92).\n\nTampa is served by two major limited access toll road expressways. From its suburban eastern terminus of Brandon, the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway (SR 618) enters Tampa by way of a bridge crossing the Tampa Bypass Canal. It is a major commuter artery into downtown and continues down the South Tampa peninsula, ultimately reaching its western terminus at Gandy Boulevard (U.S. Route 92) near MacDill Air Force Base.\n\nThe Veterans Expressway (SR 589) begins at the city's western edge near the Tampa International Airport, connecting to SR 60's westbound Courtney Campbell Causeway and eastbound Memorial Highway. The Veterans Expressway leaves the city limits heading north to the suburbs of Carrollwood, Northdale, Westchase, Citrus Park, Cheval, and Lutz. Before leaving Hillsborough County, SR 589 becomes the Suncoast Parkway, which continues northward into Pasco and Hernando Counties.\n\nThree Interstate Highways pass within the city limits. Interstate 4 originates from Tampa's Malfunction Junction, where it intersects Interstate 275. I-275 is a main artery into the city from Pinellas County, and continues into downtown and northward through neighborhoods like Seminole Heights and Sulphur Springs before leaving Tampa to reunite with Interstate 75 at the Pasco county line. Immediately south of this junction, I-75 crosses through the city neighborhood of New Tampa.\n\nOther main arteries within the city include major surface roads like Hillsborough Avenue, Dale Mabry Highway, Bruce B. Downs Boulevard, Busch Boulevard, Nebraska Avenue, Florida Avenue, Fowler Avenue, Kennedy Boulevard, Adamo Drive, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.\n\n\nThe railroad legacy brought to Tampa by Henry Plant continues to serve the city. Uceta Rail Yard was established by Plant System corporate descendant, Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, in the Gary industrial sector on Tampa's east side, near Brandon. It continues to service CSX as a storage and intermodal freight transport facility today. Freight and container cargo operations at the city's seaports also depend upon dockside rail facilities.\n\nTampa's intercity passenger rail service has since 1912 been based out of Tampa Union Station. The historic facility, adjacent to downtown between the Channel District and Ybor City, is serviced by Amtrak today. Amtrak's \"Silver Star\" calls on Tampa twice daily: number 91 southbound to Miami and number 92 northbound for New York City.\n\nUnion Station also serves as the transfer hub for Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach service, offering bus connections to several cities in Southwest Florida, as well as to Orlando for transfers to the northbound \"Silver Meteor\".\n\nSince Tampa Bay was first spotted by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, sailors have admired its wide, sheltered beauty. But it had a problem; it's naturally very shallow - less than deep almost everywhere and well less than that in many places near the coast, including the approach to the small town of Tampa. By the late 19th century, typical cargo ships had grown large enough that they were not able to navigate upper Tampa Bay and reach the ports of Tampa at all.\n\nIn 1899, however, the US Congress authorized the dredging of a 27' deep channel to Port Tampa, Henry Plant's rail-to-ship facility just west of Tampa. In 1917, another channel was dredged out to the Port of Tampa proper, instantly making Tampa an important shipping location.\n\nThe bay bottom is very sandy and the ship channels need constant dredging to keep them navigable to the largest modern cargo ships. Every year, the US Army Corps of Engineers dredge up enough sediment from the bay to fill Raymond James Stadium 10 times.\n\nToday, the Port of Tampa is the largest port in Florida in throughput tonnage, making it one of the busiest commercial ports in North America. Petroleum and phosphate are the lead commodities, accounting for two-thirds of the 37 million tons of total bulk and general cargo handled by the port in 2009.\n\nThe Tampa Port Authority currently operates three cruise ship terminals in Tampa's Channel District. The Port of Tampa is home port year round for Carnival Cruise Lines' MS \"Carnival Inspiration\" and MS \"Carnival Legend\". Tampa in 2010 will also be the seasonal home to Holland America Line's MS \"Ryndam\", as well as Royal Caribbean International's MS \"Grandeur of the Seas\" and MS \"Radiance of the Seas\". Cruise itineraries from Tampa visit the Eastern and Western Caribbean islands, Belize, and Mexico.\n\nMass transit within Tampa is operated by the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HART), and includes a public bus system and a streetcar line. HART has a signed transit deal with the University of South Florida, allowing students to ride for free on most bus routes, while students from other schools may receive discounted fares.\n\nIn October, 2002, the TECO Line Streetcar System brought electric streetcar service back to Tampa for the first time in over half a century. The line operates from ten stations along a 2.4 mile (3.9 km) route, connecting Ybor City, the Channel District, the Tampa Convention Center, and downtown Tampa. The TECO Line Streetcar extension along Franklin Street to the Fort Brooke Parking Garage was completed in December 2010.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the streetcars that traversed Tampa between the late 19th and mid 20th centuries, the TECO line cars include varnished wood interiors and other nostalgic appointments. Though they may appear old-fashioned, the modern fleet of cars are wheelchair accessible and air conditioned, offering increased comfort for Tampa in the 21st-century.\n\n"}

The game was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4, for Xbox One in September 2016, and for Nintendo Switch in December 2018.\n\nThe story follows a fire lookout named Henry in the Shoshone National Forest, a year after the Yellowstone fires of 1988. A month after his first day at work, strange things begin happening to him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform the process by which their relationship is developed. The game was directed by Olly Moss and Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist Jane Ng. The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews, earning praise for its story, characters, dialogue, and visual style. However, the presence of technical issues and the game's ending were both subjects of criticism. \"Firewatch\" won the award for Best 3D Visual Experience at the Unity Awards 2016, Best Indie Game at the 2016 Golden Joystick Awards, Best Narrative at the 2017 Game Developers Choice Awards and Debut Game at the 2017 British Academy Games Awards.

Campo Santo partnered with Good Universe to make it into a film.\n\n\"Firewatch\" is an adventure game played from a first-person view that takes place in the American state of Wyoming in 1989. Players take on the role of Henry, a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in Shoshone National Forest. Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that are related to the ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure that occasionally appears watching him from afar.\n\nHenry's only means of communication is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose from a number of dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use.\n\nFollowing the Yellowstone fires of 1988, Henry (Rich Sommer) takes a job as a fire lookout in Wyoming after his wife develops advanced early-onset dementia. On his first day, Delilah (Cissy Jones), a lookout in another watchtower, contacts him via walkie-talkie and asks him to investigate illegal fireworks by the lake. Henry discovers a pair of drunken teenage girls, who accuse him of leering. On his way home he comes across a locked cave and spots a shadowy figure watching him. He returns to his watchtower to find it ransacked. The next day, Delilah asks Henry to investigate a downed communication line. He finds it cut, with a note apparently signed by the teens. He and Delilah plot to scare the girls off, but when he finds the girls' campsite ransacked and abandoned, they begin to worry. A note left at the site blames Henry for wrecking their camp and stealing their belongings.\n\nLater, Henry finds an old backpack and a disposable camera belonging to a boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains was a lookout with his father Ned. Ned was an outdoorsman who drank heavily due to his traumatic experiences in the Vietnam War, while his son, Brian, enjoyed fantasy novels and role-playing games. Though it is against the rules for employees to bring their children to the towers, Delilah was fond of Brian and lied about his presence. He and Ned apparently left abruptly and never returned. The teenage girls are reported missing. Fearing an inquiry, Delilah falsifies reports to say that neither she nor Henry encountered the girls. By the lake the next day, Henry discovers a radio and a clipboard with notes including transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is then knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant. He wakes to find the clipboard and radio gone. In a meadow referred to on the clipboard letterhead he finds a fenced-off government research area. He breaks in and discovers surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's conversations and private lives. He also discovers a tracking device which he takes with him.\n\nHenry and Delilah discuss destroying the government camp, but decide against it. As Henry hikes home, someone sets fire to the camp. The next day he uses the tracking device to find a backpack with a key to the cave. Delilah reports a figure in Henry’s tower; when Henry arrives, he finds a Walkman taped to the door with an incriminating recording of Henry and Delilah's discussion about destroying the government camp. When Henry enters the cave, someone locks the gate behind him. He escapes through another exit and discovers Brian's old hiding spot, where he went to escape his father when he tried to teach him how to climb. He goes deeper into the cave using climbing equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's decomposed body at the bottom of a cavern. Delilah is upset by the news, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, the fire at the government camp has grown out of control and an evacuation order is given for all the lookouts.\n\nAs Henry prepares to leave, the tracking device begins beeping. He follows the signal and discovers a tape with a recording from Ned. Ned claims in the tape that Brian's death was accidental, and that the boy fell due to climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society after Brian's death, Ned admits he has been living in secret in the area ever since and has chosen to venture deeper into the wilderness. Henry finds Ned’s makeshift bunker, along with items stolen from the government camp, the lookout towers, and the teenage girls, who Delilah confirms have been found safe. The government camp was simply studying wildlife; Ned had been using its radio equipment to ensure no one was looking for him and to create transcripts to scare Henry away. Delilah blames Ned for Brian's death and leaves on the helicopter. Henry goes to her tower, and he and Delilah say their goodbyes via radio. Finally, the helicopter arrives and he is evacuated.\n\n\"Firewatch\" is the first video game from Campo Santo, and was created by Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman, who were the creative leads on \"The Walking Dead\"; Nels Anderson, the lead designer of \"Mark of the Ninja\"; and artist Olly Moss. Chris Remo was involved in many aspects of the design, and also composed the score.\n\nDevelopment for \"Firewatch\" began with a single painting by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working on the periphery of game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.\n\n\"Firewatch\" runs on the Unity game engine. Ng disapproved of the tools for creating trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.\n\nThe walkie-talkie interaction in \"Firewatch\" is inspired by the relationship in \"BioShock\" between the player character and Atlas, as well as the dialog system from \"The Walking Dead\". At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in \"The Walking Dead\", as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.\n\nThe game's opening chapter features the song \"Push Play\" from Joy Chun and Nate Bosley's 2014 synthwave album \"Let's Get Electric\", which depicts a fictitious 1980s synthpop act known as Cheap Talk. Taylor Dayne's \"Tell It to My Heart\" was used as a placeholder in the scene, but Vanaman conceded that the song was too overwhelming, and would cost too much to license. Upon the realization that it would also be too costly to commission a song, Remo sought a song in the style of the 1980s by an unsigned, independent artist, leading to the use of \"Push Play\". The score features a combination of electric and acoustic guitar, bass and electric piano, with samples of Fender Rhodes as a substitute for the actual piano. Remo played all of the instruments himself.\n\nThe game was announced in March 2014 with a tentative release date of 2015. At GDC, Campo Santo housed a public playtest, and Ng hosted a panel on the design and aesthetic of the game entitled \"The Art of Firewatch\". In June 2015, the team visited E3. There, they confirmed that they would be bringing the game to PlayStation 4, but that this would be the only console version. However, an Xbox One version was later released in North America on September 21, 2016, featuring an audio tour and a free roam mode. Due to ratings issues, the version was delayed in Europe until September 30 and in Australia and New Zealand until October 14.\n\nUsers of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets can tour Henry's lookout tower using the Steam application Destinations. For this purpose, the scene was rebuilt on the Source game engine. \"Firewatch\" was made compatible with PlayStation 4 Pro on its November 10 launch, with enhanced performance through 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range imaging. The free roam mode was enabled for PlayStation 4 Pro and Steam shortly thereafter. Partnering with Limited Run Games, Campo Santo distributed under ten thousand physical copies of the game on PlayStation 4. 4,800 copies were made available for order on the Limited Run Games website on December 16, 2016, while 2,500 were sold through the Campo Santo online store starting January 16, 2017. In April 2018, Campo Santo announced the game will be released for Nintendo Switch later in the year. It was later clarified the Nintendo Switch port is a heavily optimised version of the game, and the update will also be available for other platforms. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch version features some exclusive elements. Campo Santo later confirmed, via Twitter, the worldwide release date for the Nintendo Switch port as December 17, 2018.\n\n\"Firewatch\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game sold more than five hundred thousand copies within a month of its release and over one million copies by the end of its first year. As of 2018, \"Firewatch\" has sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms.\n\nSteven Hansen at Destructoid welcomed the choice-based dialog tree gameplay, going on to praise the dialog itself, as well as the voice performances. The game's most impressive achievement, as stated by Hansen, was the \"thematic cohesion\", which was said to revolve around self-imposed isolation. The sound design was lauded to have evoked a Hitchcockian sense of fear. Reviewing \"Firewatch\", Game Informer's Jeff Cork wrote, \"I was immediately drawn into the game's world, partly because of the power of its simple text intro, and also because of the novelty of taking part in something so mundane\". Cork observed that its interactive dialog, though simple, \"breathes life into the game\" and called the conversations \"natural\" and \"engaging\". He enjoyed exploring the forest environment, yet felt the ending was unsatisfactory.\n\nScott Butterworth of GameSpot thought that the analog navigation tools – a hand-held compass and paper map – were \"immersive\" but \"occasionally frustrating\". He found that the visual beauty of the setting allowed for a more rewarding form of exploration and noted that the sound design complemented the depth of its atmosphere. Judging the development of the characters through dialog to be \"bold\" and \"admirable\", he opined that it served as \"a patient, reflective examination of how two people grow to trust and care for each other\". According to Butterworth, the voice acting was brilliant and layered with emotional nuance, as he had evolved a strong attachment to the characters. GamesRadar's Justin Towell described \"Firewatch\" as \"one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced\". He commended the voice acting for having successfully defined each character's personality traits. Towell added that the music, alongside the sound design, worked well in service of the atmosphere. However, he disparaged a few noticeable continuity problems that left him disillusioned.\n\nRyan McCaffrey at IGN hailed the sense of realism elicited by the setting, despite the stylized level design and artwork. He also approved of the script, saying that voice acting enhanced it further. Of the writing, McCaffrey said, \"It's tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that\". He deemed the ending polarizing because of the story's promising escalation. Polygon's Colin Campbell appreciated the use of humor and empathy to develop the characters, considered the game's mystery to be successful and the story to be \"elegant\" and \"satisfying\". He criticized the conclusion, regarding it as unsuccessful.\n\nIn September 2016, it was announced that Campo Santo was partnering with production company Good Universe to adapt the game into a feature film.\n"}

The location of Gatighan has not been conclusively determined.\n\nThe word Gatighan comes from the Visayan \"katigan\" meaning a boat with outrigger or, as verb, to outfit a boat with outrigger.\n\nThe logbook states that the fleet left the west port of Mazaua early morning of Thursday, April 4, 1521. According to Pigafetta, they took a northwest track, however Albo claims they took at northern track. The ships sailed to reach Gatighan at 10° N in 11–13 hours.\n\nDuring the brief stop on the island, Pigafetta documented the island's fauna: \"In this island of Gatighan are a kind of birds called Barbastigly (flying fox), who are as large as eagles. Of which we killed a single one, because it was late, which we ate, and it had the taste of a fowl. There are also in that island pigeons, doves, turtledoves, parrots, and certain black birds as large as a fowl, with a long tail. They lay eggs as large as those of a goose, which they bury a good cubit deep under the sand in the sun, and so they are hatched by the great heat made by the warm sand. And when those birds are hatched they emerge. And those eggs are good to eat.\"\n\nOn Pigafetta's map, Gatighan is the only island mass that straddles between two huge islands, Bohol and Ceylon/Seilani (Panaon Island, the south most end of Leyte). It is almost exactly at the 10° N latitude, reference point of Albo for Gatighan.\n\nDespite many attempts to determine which island was referred to as Gatighan, opinions still vary on the issue. Theories include:\n\nCarlo Amoretti, the Augustinian encyclopedist, was director of a library in Milan. In 1797 he discovered the lost handwritten Ambrosiana manuscript of Pigafetta, one of four remaining manuscripts and the only one in Italian (the rest being French). Amoretti transcribed it and published his edition, complete with notes, in 1800. In one of his notes he said Pigafetta's Mazaua may be Bellin's Limasawa, unaware that Limasawa/Dimasawa was in fact a complete negation of what Amoretti is asserting.\n\nAmoretti states that Limasawa and Mazaua are in the same latitude. It has been since determined that Limasawa is in 9° 56' N, whereas three different latitudes (Pigafetta's 9° 40' N, Albo's 9° 20' N, and the Genoese Pilot's 9° N) have been claimed for the location of Mazaua.\n\n\nAlbo, Francisco. 1522. \"Log-Book of Francisco Alvo or Alvaro\".

It aids in both the validation of existing geographical information and the collection of new geographical information through crowdsourcing. Using tools such as Google Earth, Bing Maps, Geotagged photographs and the internet, individual volunteers are able to contribute valuable information. It provides feedback on existing information overlaid on satellite imagery or by contributing entirely new data. Data can be input via the traditional desktop platform or mobile devices, with campaigns and games used to incentivize input. Resulting data are available without restriction.\n\nGlobal land cover validation exercises are feasible as images less than 2.5 meter resolution provide very detailed information on land cover with global coverage of at least 20% with more high-resolution, up to date images continuously being added. Internet tools such as Google Earth offer enormous potential for land cover validation. The use of Volunteer Geographic Information for land cover validation studies seems even more relevant as Google Earth has been used for the recent validation of remote sensing derived products e.g., the European forest cover map as well as the latest global land cover map GlobCover. Google Earth allows wider audience to be involved in a validation exercise. \n\nApplications of Geo-wiki go beyond simply improving land cover. An application helps to predict future deforestation in Central Africa, combining five existing cropland data sets from sub-Saharan Africa to create a new map which has higher accuracy than existing maps. This should reduce uncertainty and improve predictions in land use, vegetation, climate change, and earth systems modeling. Scientists from several research institutions describe development of the map in Geophysical Research Letters, along with the application of Geo-Wiki.\n\n\n\n"}

Mangroves thrive on flat coastal inlets and estuaries where the ocean tides wash warm salt water high upriver, in this ecoregion as far as 100 km, for example in the Cacheu River of Guinea-Bissau.\n\nThe mangroves have a varied composition with \"Rhizophora\", \"Laguncularia racemosa\" and \"Conocarpus erectus\" growing up to 10m tall among larger areas of \"Rhizophora\" and \"Avicennia\". The tallest trees may be and form the equivalent of gallery forests along the creeks, the mudflats between the creeks having much shorter trees. The inland fringes of the forest are clad in grasses, ferns and salt-loving plants. However, the flora in the ecoregion is not as biodiverse as that of East African mangrove forests.\n\nMangrove swamps are important feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals.

The tribal population in India, although a small minority, represents an enormous diversity of groups. They vary in language and linguistic traits, ecological settings in which they live, physical features, size of the population, the extent of acculturation, dominant modes of making a livelihood, level of development and social stratification. They are also spread over the length and breadth of the country though their geographical distribution is far from uniform. A majority of the Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in the eastern, central and western belt covering the nine States of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. About 12 percent inhabit the North-eastern region, about five percent in the Southern region and about three percent in the Northern States.\n\nThe Tribal Belt of Northwest India includes the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The tribal people of this region have origins which precede the arrival of the Ancestral North Indians and are linked to the Ancestral South Indians. these people are thought to stem back to the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley, the oldest traceable civilization of the Indian subcontinent which flourished between 3500BC and 2500BC. \n\nThe tribes of north-west India were once strongly matrilineal societies. The changing fates and fortunes of these people has caused a gradual evolution to a more patriarchal code of living. These days the tribal societies generally follow the rule of patriliny, but there remain many examples of organised matriarchy in existence in the tribal zones to this day. It is the women who organise matters such as relationships and marriages, the inheritance of land, and the distribution of wealth.\n\nThe Southern Tribal Belt, popularly known as 'Dang', a forbidden territory covered with thick forests in the region of the South Gujarat. Located on the foothills of the Sahyadri range of mountains, it has green pastures, narrow roads, deep valleys, and wild animals. During the monsoon one can see water springs and a green carpet of diverse flora/fauna.\n\nSpread across the lush green region of South Gujarat Tribal Belt said to be Kashmir of Gujarat. live the tribes of Bhil, Kholcha, Bhel, Nayaka, Koknas, Vedch, Gamits, Warlis, and Chaudaris.\n\nDakshin Gujarat Adivasi Sevamandal is an NGO founded by the Gandhian philosopher Premshankar Bhatt and his daughter Urmillaben Bhatt in 1948 to spread education in the deep forest of the South Gujarat Tribal Belt. It is registered as a trust under the Bombay Trust Act. It provides education to South Gujarat Tribals through a resident school (Ashramshalla) which offers free education, lodging and boarding. The Tribal Belt of Gujarat today has the highest literate tribal population in India.\n\nThe Central India Tribal Belt stretches from Gujarat in the west up to Assam in the east across the states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. It is among the poorest regions of the country. Over 90% of the Belt's tribal population is rural, with primitive agriculture.\n\n\n"}

He received his Ph.D. in 1964 from Clark University; his dissertation was entitled \"The physiography of Boothia Peninsula, Northwest territories a study in terrain analysis and air photo interpretation of an Arctic area\".\n\nAfter the war, Fraser had a career as a Canadian government employee with the Geographical Branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, Ottawa, publishing articles after many of his field assignments.\n\nOne of his first assignments, in the late 1940s, was as an observer on tugs in the Mackenzie River, and on Hudson's Bay Company vessels in the western Arctic Ocean.\n\nIn 1951, he assisted geomorphologist J.

Stone in 1899.\n\nThe following year, he participated in the Canadian Ice Distribution Survey. In 1953, Fraser studied the central Arctic coast around the Boothia Isthmus. In 1954, he was the department's representative to the Aklavik Relocation Survey team in the Mackenzie Delta, and in 1955, he studied the southeastern coastline of Victoria Island. 1956 found him studying the south coast of King William Island and Sherman Inlet.\n\nFraser became a Fellow and director of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 1959. In 1982, he was appointed executive secretary, publisher and general manager. A new publisher arrived in 1988, but Fraser continued in his other two roles until 1990. In that same year, the Society established the Fraser Lectureship in Northern Studies program in his honor.\n\nHe became a Fellow of the Arctic Institute of North America in 1960.\n\nIn 1975, Fraser received the Award for Service to the Profession of Geography from the Canadian Association of Geographers. Six years later, he served as president of the Association.\n\nIn 1992, Fraser was award the Camsell Medal by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in honour of his service to the Society.\n\n"}

It was also the name of a county in the Miss Silver novels (1928-61) of Patricia Wentworth.\n\nThe Ledshire of Susan Pleydell was a small, almost entirely agricultural county. Its main (presumably, county) town, on the River Ledd, was Ledenham, the location of a 400-year-old boys' public school that was the focus of the novels. Ledenham contained \"two or three unexpectedly good hotels and shops\", as well as a Regal cinema. A major landmark was Leyburn Castle, seat of the Earls of Leyburn, which served as a sort of \"county headquarters\", containing, among other things, a library, art gallery and museum. \n\nThe industrial town of Snaydon, just outside the county, some 15 miles from Ledenham, via the village of Thaxley, maintained \"steady growth\" and caused Ledshire to maintain \"a particularly nervous eye\". The spearhead of Snaydon's advance was Sir Arthur Hinton-Brigg, chairman of Hinton-Brigg Ltd, who, just after the Second World War, had married into a Ledshire landowning family and bought Thaxley Manor, his wife's childhood home. (The Grampians are close by and Snaydon is described as being \"over the border\". It is therefore a reasonable conclusion that Ledshire abuts the Scottish borders and that Snaydon is just inside Scotland).\n\nA small county like Ledshire would probably have been affected significantly by the reorganisation of local government in the 1970s. Under the new arrangements some counties, notably Rutland, disappeared, while others, such as Hereford and Worcester, were merged.\n"}

This is often out of consideration for local sensitivities, since the smaller entity may resent its takeover, and may demand its symbolic perpetuation within an amalgamated name so as to propagate the impression of a merger between equals.\n\nIn their English forms, the conjoined names may have the following patterns:\n\nThe punctuation and capitalization practices in written English vary:\nThree-word names for two-part entities are often ambiguous. For example, it may not be clear whether North Rhine-Westphalia is an amalgamation between the north part of the Rhine Province on the one hand and Westphalia on the other (true) or the northern division of some pre-existing place called Rhine-Westphalia (false). While this problem does not arise in German, no entirely satisfactory punctuation of such names has been established in English. In the above case, the hyphen is often omitted because it is misleading. It has been proposed that this state's name be punctuated \"North-Rhine/Westphalia\" in English, but the solidus or forward slash is also ambiguous.\n\nSome names have been merged and modified as an alternative to using hyphenation or grammatical conjunction:\n\nBinomial placenames are not true double placenames, but elements in a hierarchical naming system. They are a means of distinguishing two entities which share a parent geographic feature. Examples:\n\nThey are often used for railway stations and airports:\nTrenton–Mercer is an example of a marketing decision in which a small airport tries to associate itself with a larger city. Ryanair has been criticized for promoting names for airports unusually far from the city from which they are named, such as Paris Beauvais Tillé Airport (a triple name) and Frankfurt-Hahn Airport.\n\nBinomial names may be seen in German-language texts to denominate parts of towns:\n\nThe word \"and\" in its name does not always signify the union of two distinct territories:\n\nIn dual naming, words in two different languages have been joined by a hyphen or a slash to become the community's (or geographic feature's) official name, often because of language politics:\n\nSimilarly, places may simply have an official name which consists of two names, such as the Australian territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which consists of the North Keeling Island and the South Keeling Islands.\n\nSometimes names will be concatenated during a name change. Zimbabwe Rhodesia was the name of the former Rhodesia and future Zimbabwe from June 1 to December 12, 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour regions of France, several federal subjects of Russia, most local government districts of Northern Ireland and some autonomous communities of Spain (Castile and León, Castile-La Mancha) also feature two or more placenames conjoined by a hyphen or with the word \"and\" (or its translation).\n\n\n\n\nIncludes defunct personal unions and dissolved political unions.\n\n\nMetropolitan areas composed of multiple cities and shared facilities are often collectively named or referred to with the names of the major cities that comprise them. These are conjoined with an unspaced en dash in formal writing, though not journalism, which hyphenates. Some examples include:\n\nSome may even be international conurbations, and do not exist as geopolitical entities:\n\nSeparate entities historically treated as one single unit by tradition or convention:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "161704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161704", "title": "Mount Erebus", "text": "Mount Erebus\n\nMount Erebus () is the second-highest volcano in Antarctica (after Mount Sidley) and the southernmost active volcano on Earth. It is the sixth-highest ultra mountain on the continent. With a summit elevation of , it is located in the Ross Dependency on Ross Island, which is also home to three inactive volcanoes: Mount Terror, Mount Bird, and Mount Terra Nova. Several craters are located at the summit, including Side Crater, a nearly circular crater named for its location on the side of the main summit cone.\n\nThe volcano has been active since about 1.3 million years ago and is the site of the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory run by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.\n\nThe volcano was the site of the Air New Zealand Flight 901 accident, which occurred in November 1979.\n\nMount Erebus is currently the most active volcano in Antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the Erebus hotspot. The summit contains a persistent convecting phonolitic lava lake, one of five long-lasting lava lakes on Earth. Characteristic eruptive activity consists of Strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents, all within the volcano's inner crater. The volcano is scientifically remarkable in that its relatively low-level and unusually persistent eruptive activity enables long-term volcanological study of a Strombolian eruptive system very close (hundreds of metres) to the active vents, a characteristic shared with only a few volcanoes on Earth, such as Stromboli in Italy. Scientific study of the volcano is also facilitated by its proximity to McMurdo Station (U.S.) and Scott Base (New Zealand), both sited on Ross Island around 35 km away.\n\nMount Erebus is classified as a polygenetic stratovolcano. The bottom half of the volcano is a shield and the top half is a stratocone. The composition of the current eruptive products of Erebus is anorthoclase-porphyritic tephritic phonolite and phonolite, which are the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano. The oldest eruptive products consist of relatively undifferentiated and nonviscous basanite lavas that form the low broad platform shield of Erebus. Slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on Fang Ridge—an eroded remnant of an early Erebus volcano—and at other isolated locations on the flanks of Erebus. Erebus is the world's only presently erupting phonolite volcano.\n\nLava flows of more viscous phonotephrite and trachyte erupted after the basanite. The upper slopes of Mount Erebus are dominated by steeply dipping (about 30°) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large-scale flow levees. A conspicuous break in slope around 3,200 m ASL calls attention to a summit plateau representing a caldera. The summit caldera was created by an explosive VEI-6 eruption that occurred 18,000 ± 7,000 years ago. It is filled with small volume tephritic phonolite and phonolite lava flows. In the center of the summit caldera is a small, steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as Erebus crystals. The active lava lake in this summit cone undergoes continuous degassing.\n\nResearchers spent more than three months during the 2007–08 field season installing an unusually dense array of seismometers around Mount Erebus to listen to waves of energy generated by small, controlled blasts from explosives they buried along its flanks and perimeter, and to record scattered seismic signals generated by lava lake eruptions and local ice quakes. By studying the refracted and scattered seismic waves, the scientists produced an image of the uppermost (top few km) of the volcano to understand the geometry of its \"plumbing\" and how the magma rises to the lava lake.\n\nMt. Erebus is notable for its numerous ice fumaroles – ice towers that form around gases that escape from vents in the surface. The ice caves associated with the fumaroles are dark, in polar alpine environments starved in organics and with oxygenated hydrothermal circulation in highly reducing host rock. The life is sparse, mainly bacteria and fungi. This makes it of special interest for studying oligotrophs – organisms that can survive on minimal amounts of resources.\n\nThe caves on Erebus are of special interest for astrobiology, as most surface caves are influenced by human activities, or by organics from the surface brought in by animals (e.g. bats) or ground water. The caves at Erebus are at high altitude, yet accessible for study. Almost no chance exists of photosynthetic-based organics, or of animals in a food chain based on photosynthetic life, and no overlying soil to wash down into them.\n\nThey are dynamic systems that collapse and rebuild, but persist over decades. The air inside the caves has 80 to 100% humidity, and up to 3% carbon dioxide (CO), and some carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H), but almost no methane (CH) or hydrogen sulfide (HS). Many of them are completely dark, so cannot support photosynthesis. Organics can only come from the atmosphere, or from ice algae that grow on the surface in summer, which may eventually find their way into the caves through burial and melting. As a result, most micro-organisms there are chemolithoautotrophic i.e. microbes that get all of their energy from chemical reactions with the rocks, and that do not depend on any other lifeforms to survive. The organisms survive using CO fixation and some may use CO oxidization for the metabolism. The main types of microbe found there are Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria.\n\nMount Erebus was discovered on January 27, 1841 (and observed to be in eruption), by polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross, who named it and its companion, Mount Terror, after his ships, \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\" (which were later used by Sir John Franklin on his disastrous Arctic expedition). Present with Ross on the Erebus was the young Joseph Hooker, future president of the Royal Society and close friend of Charles Darwin. Erebus is a dark region in Hades in Greek mythology, personified as the Ancient Greek primordial deity of darkness, the son of Chaos.\n\nThe mountain was surveyed in December 1912 by a science party from Robert Falcon Scott's \"Terra Nova\" expedition, who also collected geological samples. Two of the camp sites they used have been recognised for their historic significance:\n\nThey have been designated historic sites or monuments following a proposal by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.\n\nMount Erebus' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of Sir Ernest Shackleton's party; Professor Edgeworth David, Sir Douglas Mawson, Dr Alister Mackay, Jameson Adams, Dr Eric Marshall and Phillip Brocklehurst (who did not reach the summit), in 1908. Its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by British mountaineer Roger Mear on 7 June 1985, a member of the \"In the Footsteps of Scott\" expedition. On January 19–20, 1991, Charles J. Blackmer, an iron-worker for many years at McMurdo Station and the South Pole, accomplished a solo ascent in about 17 hours completely unassisted, by snow mobile and on foot.\n\nIn 1992, the inside of the volcano was explored by \"Dante I\", an eight legged tethered robotic explorer. \"Dante\" was designed to acquire gas samples from the magma lake inside the inner crater of Mount Erebus to understand the chemistry better through the use of the on-board gas chromatograph, as well as measuring the temperature inside the volcano and the radioactivity of the materials present in such volcanoes. \"Dante\" successfully scaled a significant portion of the crater before technical difficulties emerged with the fibre-optic cable used for communications between the walker and base station. Unfortunately, \"Dante I\" had not yet reached the bottom of the crater, so no data of volcanic significance was\nrecorded. However, the expedition proved to be highly successful in terms of robotic and computer science, and was possibly the first expedition by a robotic platform to Antarctica.\n\nAir New Zealand Flight 901 was a scheduled sightseeing service from Auckland Airport in New Zealand to Antarctica and return with a scheduled stop at Christchurch Airport to refuel before returning to Auckland. The Air New Zealand flyover service, for the purposes of Antarctic sightseeing, was operated with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft and began in February 1977. The flight crashed into Mount Erebus on November 28, 1979, killing all 257 people on board. Passenger photographs taken seconds before the collision removed all doubt of whiteout conditions or the \"flying in a cloud\" theory, showing perfectly clear visibility well beneath the cloud base, with landmarks to the left and to the right of the aircraft visible. Further investigation of the crash showed an Air New Zealand navigational error and a cover-up that resulted in about $100 million in lawsuits. Air New Zealand discontinued its flyovers of Antarctica. Its final flight was on February 17, 1980. During the Antarctic summer, snow melt on the flanks of Mount Erebus continually reveals debris from the crash; it is visible from the air.\n\n\n"}

It was introduced to boost the production of oil and natural gas and providing level playing field for both public and private players.\n\nNew Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) was conceptualised by Amit B Singh after request by the Government of India, during 1997-98 to provide an equal platform to both Public and Private sector companies in exploration and production of hydrocarbons with Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) as a nodal agency for its implementation. \nIndia has an estimated sedimentary area of 3.14 million km. consisting of 26 sedimentary basins, of which, 57% (1.79 million km.) area is in deepwater and remaining 43% (1.35 million km.) area is in onland and shallow offshore. At present 1.06 million km area is held under Petroleum Exploration Licenses in 18 basins by national oil companies viz. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), OIL India Limited (OIL) and Private/Joint Venture companies. Before implementation of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1999, a mere 11% of Indian sedimentary basins were under exploration, which has now increased extensively over the years.\n\nRecently, bidding process was completed in NELP-IX. Till 2010, 8 rounds of NELP have been completed. 400 PSC’s have been signed, out of which 168 are in operation. The private / JV companies contribute about 46% of gas and 16% oil to the national Oil & Gas production. The Mangala fields in Rajasthan and Krishna-Godavari Basins have been the major source for oil and gas fields.\n\nNew Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) was formulated by the Government of India, during 1997-98 to provide level playing field for all the investors and providing several concessions and incentives to both Public and Private sector companies in exploration and production of hydrocarbons with Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) acting as a nodal agency for its implementation.\n\nIndia is the fifth largest consumer of primary energy and the third largest consumer of oil in the Asia–Pacific region after China and Japan. Due to high economic growth, there is a huge need for enhancing supply of energy resources. Also, dependence on imported petroleum continues to grow and is ultimately impacting the country’s long term growth. Of the 26 sedimentary basins identified in India, so far, only 20% of the total area has been well explored. The remaining areas need to be extensively explored with the best of technologies, with special emphasis on the frontier basins. \nWith the introduction of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the introduction of much-needed capital and state-of-the-art technology to explore the sector could be made possible. With the policies and regulations being some of the most transparent in the world, the NELP has revived a healthy spirit of competition between National Oil Companies and private and multinational companies. \nThe development of the exploration sector has been significantly boosted through this policy, which brought major liberalization in the sector and created pathways for private and foreign investment, where 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is allowed. Under NELP, which became effective in February 1999, the process of competitive bidding is followed wherein acreages are offered to the participating companies. \nBy mid-2012, the ninth round of bidding has been concluded along with fourth round for Coal Bed Methane (CBM) blocks. The Government of India offered the highest ever number of 70 oil & gas exploration blocks covering an area of about 1,63,535 km². and also making a parallel offer of 10 blocks under the fourth round of Coal Bed Methane Policy (CBM-IV) for exploration and production of Coal Bed Methane. The Government of India launched the Ninth round of offers for exploration acreages, NELP IX on 15 October 2010.\n\nUnder the First round of New Exploration Licensing Policy, bids were invited by the Government of India on 8 January 1999 for 48 blocks for exploration of oil and natural gas. Of these, 12 blocks were deepwater (beyond 400m isobath), 26 shallow offshore and 10 were onshore blocks. \nThe PSC’s were signed for 24 exploration blocks comprising 7 deepwater, 16 shallow offshore and 1 onshore. At present, 11 exploration blocks are under operation and 13 blocks have been relinquished.\n\nUnder the second round of New Exploration Licensing Policy, bids were invited by the Government of India 15 December 2000 for 25 blocks for exploration of oil and natural gas. Of these, 8 blocks were deepwater (beyond 400m isobath), 8 shallow offshore and 9 were onland blocks.\nThe PSC’s were signed for 23 exploration blocks comprising 8 deepwater, 8 shallow offshore and 7 onland. At present, 4 exploration blocks are under operation and 19 blocks have been relinquished.\n\nUnder the third round of New Exploration Licensing Policy, bids were invited by the Government of India on 27 March 2002 for 27 blocks for exploration of oil and natural gas. Of these, 9 blocks were deepwater (beyond 400m isobath), 7 shallow offshore and 11 were onland blocks\nThe PSC’s were signed for 23 exploration blocks comprising 9 deepwater, 6 shallow offshore and 8 onland. The exploration activities are going on in 19 awarded blocks and 4 blocks had been relinquished.\n\nUnder the Fourth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy, bids were invited by the Government of India on 8 May 2003 for 24 blocks for exploration of oil and natural gas.

As of 2012, ENI is still awaiting Drilling permission from the department of space due to the block’s proximity to a rocket launch zone (in Andaman and Nicobar Islands) of Isro.\n\nA total of fifty five blocks (55) were offered during the NELP VI round for exploration of oil and natural gas in 16 prospective sedimentary basins consists of 25 Onland, 6 Shallow Water and 24 Deep Water blocks. 165 bids from 68 E&P companies (36 foreign and 32 Indian) had participated in the bidding process as consortium/ individually.\nThe PSC’s were signed for 52 exploration blocks comprising 21 deepwater, 6 shallow water and 25 onland. The exploration activities are going on in all the 52 awarded blocks.\n\nA total of fifty Seven blocks (57) were offered during the NELP VII round for exploration of oil and natural gas in 18 prospective sedimentary basins consists of 29 Onland, 9 Shallow Water and 19 Deep Water blocks. On 22 December 2008 Contracts were signed for 41 blocks out of which 11 blocks in Deep Water, 7 blocks in Shallow Water and 23 Onland blocks.\n\nUnder the eighth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP-VIII), Government has offered 31 production sharing contracts on 30 June 2010. There are 8 deepwater blocks, 11 shallow water blocks and 12 onland blocks which are in the states of Assam (2), Gujarat (8), Madhya Pradesh (1) and Manipur (1).\n\nA total of 33 exploration blocks were offered during the bidding process. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) successfully bid for 10 of the 33 oil and gas exploration blocks, Oil India Ltd (OIL) bid for as many as 29 blocks and managed to get 10. Reliance Industries bid for two deep-sea blocks in the Andaman Basin in the Bay of Bengal and four onshore blocks in Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\nIndia began its journey into Oil Exploration and Production just seven years after the famous ‘Drake Well’, which heralded the beginning of the Petroleum era, which was drilled in Titus Ville, Pennsylvania, USA (1859). The oil reserves were located in the dense jungles, swamps, damp and undulated terrain of Brahmaputra Valley, Assam in the mid-19th century. The first well was drilled by Mr.Goodenough of Mckillop, Stewart and Co.; in Upper Assam in 1866 following a hint of oil show detected by the fleet of elephants carrying logs. \nHydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy, 2016\n\n"}
{"id": "5141223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5141223", "title": "Non-representational theory", "text": "Non-representational theory\n\nNon-representational theory is a theory developed in human geography, largely through the work of Nigel Thrift (Warwick University), and his colleagues such as J.D. Dewsbury (University of Bristol) and Derek McCormack (University of Oxford), and later by their respective graduate students. It challenges those using social theory and conducting geographical research to \"go beyond representation\" and focus on embodied experience. Thus, Dewsbury describes practices of \"witnessing\" that produce \"knowledge without contemplation\".\n\nInstead of studying and representing social relationships, non-representational theory focuses upon practices – how human and nonhuman formations are enacted or performed – not simply on what is produced. \"First, it valorizes those processes that operate before … conscious, reflective thought … [and] second, it insists on the necessity of not prioritizing representations as the primary epistemological vehicles through which knowledge is extracted from the world\". Recent studies have examined a wide range of activities including dance, musical performance, walking, gardening, rave, listening to music and children's play.\n\nThis is a post-structuralist theory inspired in part by the ideas of thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Bruno Latour and Michel Serres, and by phenomenonologists such as Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. More recently it considers views from political science (including ideas about radical democracy) and anthropological discussions of the material dimensions of human life. It parallels the conception of \"hybrid geographies\" developed by Sarah Whatmore.\n\nCritics have suggested that Thrift's use of the term \"non-representational theory\" is problematic, and that other non-representational theories could be developed. Richard G. Smith said that Baudrillard's work could be considered a \"non-representational theory\", for example, which has fostered some debate. In 2005, Hayden Lorimer (Glasgow University) said that the term \"more-than-representational\" as preferable.\n"}
{"id": "48157875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48157875", "title": "Northern Mexico", "text": "Northern Mexico\n\nNorthern Mexico (Spanish: \"el Norte de México\"), commonly referred as El Norte, is an informal term for the northern cultural and geographical area in Mexico. Depending on the source, it contains some or all of the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Sonora and Tamaulipas.\n\nIn fact there is not a border that separates the northern states from the southern states in Mexico. For some authors, only states that have a border with the US are considered as northern Mexico, i.e. Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora and Tamaulipas. Others also include Durango, Sinaloa and Baja California Sur. Other people consider that the north starts above the Tropic of Cancer, but this description would include some parts of Zacatecas and San Luis Potosí that are usually not considered northern states.\n\nIt is not known exactly when the first settlers came to Northern Mexico. The bad weather in the region limited the practice of agriculture, so ancient cultures developed a nomadic lifestyle dedicated to hunting and gathering.\n\nOne of the most important native cultures at northern Mexico are the Tepehuanes in Durango, who are actually named the \"Odamis\", meaning \"people from the mountains\". Something similar has happened with the Raramuris in Chihuahua; \"Raramuri\" means \"people who run\", but they are known as Tarahumaras. Other important cultures are Mayos and Yaquis in Sonora, and Laguneros in Coahuila. In Nuevo Leon, many nomads were exterminated for resisting the construction of Monterrey.\n\nThe first city of the region was Durango, founded by Francisco de Ibarra, a Basque explorer. During the colonial era, Durango, Chihuahua and some parts of Sinaloa and Coahuila were a Basque colony named the \"Nueva Vizcaya\". Now, most Duranguenses are Basque descendants. Other important cities like Monterrey were founded almost 50 years later.\n\n \nNorthern Mexican culture is very different from the culture in south and central Mexico. Northern Mexican opinion tends to be more conservative on average on cultural topics like abortion, gay marriage and legalization of marijuana, but more liberal on topics like business or technology. Another important difference between the North and the rest of Mexico is that Northern Mexicans tend to be more identified with their Spanish heritage.\n\nIn early 2014, the Strategic Communication Cabinet, a statistical consulting services company, published a report called \"Social Intolerance In Mexico\", in which polls that covered several social issues were conducted in the 45 largest cities and municipalities of the country. Aside from liberal Mexico City, the federal capital, the study found the strongest support for same-sex marriage in northern cities such as Tijuana and La Paz; whereas it was the weakest in Durango, Ciudad Victoria, Chihuahua and Monterrey. As for adoption by same-sex couples, it was more widely accepted in the border cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, while the least support was found in Chihuahua and Durango. Support for abortion upon request, cannabis legalisation and euthanasia was the weakest in Northern Mexico. Nonetheless, Coahuila became the first state to legalise same-sex marriage in the country.\n\nFor a long time, November 20; the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution; was considered the National Day in northern states. This has been changed by some politics implanted by the SEP making obligatory the celebrations of the September 16 (The Independence Day of Mexico) and the Día de los Muertos, which are days that originally weren't celebrated in the region.\n\nOther important days in the north are July 8, the foundation of Durango City (the first city founded in the North) and the carnaval of Mazatlán, celebrated 6 days before Ash Wednesday. Because of the American influence in the region, northern Mexicans also celebrate some American traditions like Halloween, Thanksgiving and Saint Patrick's Day.\n\nAs well as the Spanish and the indigenous people, Northern Mexico has received Lebanese, Jewish, Portuguese, Chinese, Irish, German and Italian immigrants. All this mixture of cultures have strongly influenced the gastronomy from the north. Northern Mexican gastronomy is based in beef, goat and pig meat and flour tortillas which are remnants of Jewish and Lebanese heritage. Because of the German influence cheese and dairy products are also important in the gastronomy of the region. Quesadillas and burritos are probably the two most famous dishes from the north. One of the most famous customs from northern Mexico is to reunite family and friends on weekends to prepare barbecue, named \"Carne Asada\" by the Mexicans. A variation of this tradition is to prepare discada, a mixture of grilled meats cooked on an agricultural plow disk harrow.\n\nAssociation football, or soccer, is one of the region's most popular sports, as it hosts four out of the eighteen teams that currently play in the Liga MX, the country's top division of the domestic football league system. Major cities are home to these teams such as Monterrey and Tigres UANL, both based in Monterrey, Santos Laguna in Torreón and Tijuana in the border city of the same name. Notably, Northern teams have dominated the Liga MX in the 2010s, winning a combined total of nine titles and reaching more than half of the decade's finals. Moreover, Northern teams that play in the Ascenso MX, the second professional level of the domestic football system, include: Juárez, based in the homonymous border city, Dorados de Sinaloa from Culiacán, Cimarrones de Sonora in Hermosillo, Tampico Madero and Correcaminos UAT, both based in the state of Tamaulipas.\n\nBaseball is another popular sport in Northern Mexico, particularly in states such as Sinaloa and Sonora. Six of the twelve teams of the Triple-A Mexican League are based in the North. The independent Mexican Pacific League (\"Liga Mexicana del Pacífico\" or LMP) is based in the North, with most of its eight teams playing in Northwestern Mexico. The LMP is a winter league, its season coinciding with the Major League Baseball (MLB) off-season; MLB players can therefore participate, making MPL more competitive. Since the 1970s, the winner of the Mexican Pacific League has competed in the prestigious Caribbean Series, won nine times by Mexican teams, primarily in the 21st century, such as Yaquis de Obregón and Naranjeros de Hermosillo, based in the state of Sonora, Venados de Mazatlán and Tomateros de Culiacán, both based in the state of Sinaloa. As for the Mexican Baseball League, the country's oldest running professional league, which runs in the summer season, several Northern teams participate such as Sultanes de Monterrey, Saraperos de Saltillo, Acereros de Monclova, Algodoneros de Unión Laguna, Generales de Durango, Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos and Toros de Tijuana. By far, Sultanes de Monterrey has been the most successful Northern team in the Mexican League, winning nine titles. Moreover, there are several minor state-wide baseball leagues in the region such as \"\", \"\" and \"Liga Norte de México\".\n\nAnother popular sport is basketball, played at the professional level throughout the entire year between the National Basketball League, founded in 2000, and the Pacific Coast Circuit, which exclusively involves teams based in Northwestern Mexico. The \"\" is a minor league played primarily by local teams in the border state of Chihuahua. Remarkably, Chihuahua-born Eduardo Nájera became the second Mexican to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA), after Sinaloa-born Horacio Llamas. As for American football, National Football League (NFL) following is popular in several northern cities, particularly amongst the middle and upper classes. Notably, Torreón-born kicker Raúl Allegre played for several NFL teams throughout his career in the 1980s. Boxing is one of the most popular sports in the country and Northern Mexico has long been a source of world famous players such as Julio César Chávez, Oscar de la Hoya and Misael Rodríguez.\n"}

The current leader is Kim Jong-un, the late president Kim Il-sung's grandson and son of recently deceased leader Kim Jong-il . Relations are strongest with other officially socialist states: Vietnam, Laos, and China, as well as with Russia, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Following a major famine in the early 1990s, due partly to the collapse of the Soviet Union (previously a major economic partner), leader Kim Jong-il instigated the \"Military-First\" policy in 1995, increasing economic concentration and support for the military.\n\nNorth Korea's culture is officially promoted and heavily controlled by the government.

In 1833 he married the only daughter and heiress of Major General Sir Henry Godwin KCB, and in 1854 he took the additional name of Godwin by Royal licence. At Oxford as a pupil of William Buckland he became deeply interested in geology. Soon afterwards he met and was inspired by Henry De la Beche and assisted him by making a geological map of the neighbourhood of Newton Abbot in Devon, which was embodied in the Geological Survey map. He also published an elaborate memoir \"On the Geology of the South-East of Devonshire\" (Trans. Geol. Soc. ser. 2, vol. viii.).\n\nHis attention was next directed to the Cretaceous rocks of Surrey, his home county - his estates being situated at Chilworth and Shalford near Guildford. Later he dealt with the superficial deposits bordering the English Channel, and with the erratic boulders of Selsey. In 1855 he brought before the Geological Society of London his paper \"On the possible Extension of the Coal-Measures beneath the South-Eastern part of England\", in which he pointed out on well-considered theoretical grounds the likelihood of coal measures being some day reached in that area.

{"id": "33064581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33064581", "title": "Scottish island names", "text": "Scottish island names\n\nThe modern names of Scottish islands stem from two main influences. There are a large number of names that derive from the Scottish Gaelic language in the Hebrides and Firth of Clyde. In the Northern Isles most place names have a Norse origin. There are also some island place names that originate from three other influences, including a limited number that are essentially English language names, a few that are of Brittonic origin and some of an unknown origin that may represent a pre-Celtic language. These islands have all been occupied by the speakers of at least three and in many cases four or more languages since the Iron Age, and many of the names of these islands have more than one possible meaning as a result.\n\nScotland has over 790 offshore islands, most of which are to be found in four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides, sub-divided into the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are also clusters of islands in the Firth of Clyde, Firth of Forth, and Solway Firth, and numerous small islands within the many bodies of fresh water in Scotland including Loch Lomond and Loch Maree.\n\nAs humans have lived on the islands of Scotland since at least Mesolithic times, it is clear that pre-modern languages must have been used, and by extension names for the islands, that have been lost to history. Proto-Celtic is the presumed ancestor language of all the known Celtic languages. Proponents of the controversial Vasconic substratum theory suggest that many western European languages contain remnants of an even older language family of Vasconic languages, of which Basque is the only surviving member. This proposal was originally made by the German linguist Theo Vennemann, but has been rejected by other linguists.\n\nA small number of island names may contain elements of such an early Celtic or pre-Celtic language, but no certain knowledge of any pre-Pictish language exists anywhere in Scotland.\n\nBritish or Brythonic was an ancient P-Celtic language spoken in Britain. It is a form of Insular Celtic, which is descended from Proto-Celtic, the hypothetical parent language that many linguistics belief had already begun to diverge into separate dialects or languages in the first half of the first millennium BC. By the sixth century AD, scholars of early Insular history often begin to talk about four geographically separate forms of British: Welsh, Breton, Cornish, and the now extinct Cumbric language. These are collectively known as the Brythonic languages. It is clear that whenever place names are recorded at an early date as having been transposed from a form of P-Celtic into Gaelic that this occurred prior to the transformation from \"Old British\" into modern Welsh. There are numerous Scottish place names with Brythonic roots although the number of island names involved is relatively small.\nThe Pictish language offers considerable difficulties. It is a term used for the language(s) thought to have been spoken by the Picts, the people of northern and central Scotland in the Early Middle Ages. It may have been a fifth branch of Brythonic; Kenneth H. Jackson thought that the evidence is weak, but Katherine Forsyth disagreed with his argument.\nThe idea that a distinct Pictish language was perceived at some point is attested clearly in Bede's early 8th-century \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\", which names it as distinct from both Old Welsh and Old Gaelic. However, there is virtually no direct attestation of Pictish short of the names of people found on monuments in the lands controlled by the Picts - the area north of the Forth-Clyde line in the Early Middle Ages. Many of these monuments include elaborate carved symbols, but an understanding of their significance has so far proved as elusive as interpretation of the few written fragments, which have been described as resembling an \"odd sort of gibberish\". Nonetheless, there is significant indirect place-name evidence for the Picts use of Brythonic or P-Celtic. The term \"Pritennic\" is sometimes used to refer to the proto-Pictish language spoken in this area during the Iron Age.\n\nGiven the paucity of knowledge about the Pictish language it may be assumed that islands names with P-Celtic affiliations in the southern Hebrides, and Firths of Clyde and Forth are Brythonic and those to the north and west are of Pictish origin.\n\nThis Goidelic language arrived via Ireland due to the growing influence of the kingdom of Dalriada from the 6th century onwards. It is still spoken in parts of the Scottish Highlands and the Hebrides, and in Scottish cities by some communities. It was formerly spoken over a far wider area than today, even in the recent past. Scottish Gaelic, along with modern Manx and Irish, are descended from Middle Irish, a derivative of Old Irish, which is descended in turn from Primitive Irish. This the oldest known form of the Goidelic languages, which is known only from fragments, mostly personal names, inscribed on stone in the Ogham alphabet in Ireland and western Britain up to about the 6th century. The Beurla-reagaird is a Gaelic-based cant of the Scottish travelling community.\n\nOld Norse is a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and of their overseas settlements during the Viking Age, until about 1300. Its influence on Scots island names is considerable due to the development of both the Earldom of Orkney and the Kingdom of the Isles which resulted in almost all of the inhabitable islands of Scotland (except those in the Firth of Forth) coming under Norse control from the 9th to 13th centuries.\nNorn is an extinct North Germanic language that developed from Old Norse and was spoken in Shetland, Orkney and possibly Caithness. Together with Faroese, Icelandic and Norwegian it belongs to the West Scandinavian group. Very little written evidence of the language has survived and as a result it is not possible to distinguish any island names that may be Norn rather than Old Norse. After the Northern Isles were pledged to Scotland by Norway in the 15th century, the early Scottish Earls spoke Gaelic when the majority of their subjects spoke Norn and both of these languages were then replaced by Insular Scots.\n\nEnglish is a West Germanic language, the modern variant of which is generally dated from about 1550. \nThe related Scots language, sometimes regarded as a variety of English, has regional and historic importance in Scotland. It is officially recognised as autochthonous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is a language variety historically spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster.\n\nAlthough they are the dominant languages in modern Scotland the presence of both Scots and English in island names is limited.\n\nThere are three island names in Shetland of unknown and possibly pre-Celtic origin: Fetlar, Unst and Yell. The earliest recorded forms of these three names do carry Norse meanings: \"Fetlar\" is the plural of \"fetill\" and means \"shoulder-straps\" \"Omstr\" is \"corn-stack\" and \"í Ála\" is from \"ál \" meaning \"deep furrow\". However these descriptions are hardly obvious ones as island names and are\nprobably adaptations of a pre-Norse language. This may have been Pictish but there is no clear evidence for this.\n\nThe roots of several of the Hebrides may also have a pre-Celtic origin. Indeed, the name comes from \"Ebudae\" recorded by Ptolemy, via the mis-reading \"Hebudes\" and may itself have a pre-Celtic root.\n\nSeveral of the islands of the Clyde have possible Brythonic roots. In addition to Arran (see above) Bute may have a British root and Great and Little Cumbrae both certainly have (see below).\n\nInchkeith in the Firth of Forth is recorded as \"Insula Keth\" in the 12th century \"Life of Saint Serf\". The name may derive from \"Innis Cheith\" or \"Innis Coit\" and both Mac an Tàilleir (2003) and Watson (1926) suggest that the root is the Brthyonic \"coed\". The derivation would appear to be assumed rather than attested and the modern form is \"Innis Cheith\". \"Caer\" in Welsh means a \"stone-girt fort\" and was especially applied to Roman camp sites. This is the root of Cramond Island in the Forth, with \"Caramond\" meaning \"the fort on the Almond river\". The island of Threave on the River Dee in Dumfries and Galloway takes its name from P-Celtic \"tref\", meaning \"homestead\".\n\nIt is assumed that Pictish names must once have predominated in the northern Inner Hebrides, Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland although the historical record is sparse. For example, Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century: \"As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.” However, the place names that existed prior to the 9th century have been all but obliterated by the incoming Norse-speaking Gall-Ghaeils.\n\nOrkney is pre-Norse in origin and Pictish, as may be the uninhabited Orkney island name Damsay, meaning \"lady's isle\". Remarkably few Pictish placenames of any kind can be identified in Orkney and Shetland, although some apparently Norse names may be adaptations of earlier Pictish ones. There are various ogham inscriptions such as on the Lunnasting stone found in Shetland that have been claimed as representing Pictish, or perhaps even a precursor language.\n\nIn the 14th century John of Fordun also records the name of Inchcolm as \"Eumonia\" (referring to the \"monasterium Sancti Columbe in insula Euomonia\") a name of likely Brythonic origin.\n\nFrom some point before 900 until the 14th century both Shetland and Orkney became Norse societies. The Norse also dominated the Hebrides and the islands of the Clyde for much of the same period, although their influence was much weaker there from the 13th century onwards. According to Ó Corráin (1998) \"when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown, perhaps unknowable\" although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded. \"All the islands of Britain\" were devastated in 794 with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806.\n\nAs a result, most of the island names in Orkney and Shetland have Norse names and many in the Hebrides are Gaelic transformations of the original Norse, with the Norse ending \"-øy\" or \"-ey\" for \"island\" becoming \"-aigh\" in Gaelic and then \"-ay\" in modern Scots/English.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly Shetland may have a Gaelic root—the name \"Innse Chat\" is referred to in early Irish literature and it is just possible that this forms part of the later Norn name \"Hjaltland\"— but the influence of this language in the toponymy of the Northern Isles is slight. No Gaelic-derived island names and indeed only two Q-Celtic words exist in the language of modern Orcadians - \"iper\" from \"eabhar\", meaning a midden slurry, and \"keero\" from \"caora\" - used to describe a small sheep in the North Isles.\n\nThe Hebrides remain the stronghold of the modern Gàidhealtachd and unsurprisingly this language has had a significant influence on the islands there. It has been argued that the Norse impact on the onomasticon only applied to the islands north of Ardnamurchan and that original Gaelic place names predominate to the south. However, recent research suggests that the obliteration of pre-Norse names throughout the Hebrides was almost total and Gaelic derived place names on the southern islands are of post-Norse origin.\n\nThere are also examples of island names that were originally Gaelic but have become completely replaced. For example, Adomnán records \"Sainea\", \"Elena\", \"Ommon\" and \"Oideacha\" in the Inner Hebrides, which are of unknown location and these names must have passed out of usage in the Norse era. One of the complexities is that an island such as Rona may have had a Celtic name, that was replaced by a similar-sounding Norse name, but then reverted to an essentially Gaelic name with a Norse ending.\n\nIn the context of the Northern Isles it should be borne in mind that Old Norse is a dead language and that as a result names of Old Norse origin exist only as loan words in the Scots language. Nonetheless if we distinguish between names of obviously Norse origin and those with a significant Scots element the great majority are in the former camp. \"Muckle\", meaning large or big, is one of few Scots words in the island names of the \"Nordreyar\" and appears in Muckle Roe and Muckle Flugga in Shetland and Muckle Green Holm and Muckle Skerry in Orkney.\n\nMany small islets and skerries have Scots or Insular Scots names such as Da Skerries o da Rokness and Da Buddle Stane in Shetland, and Kirk Rocks in Orkney.\nGreat Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae are English/Brythonic in derivation and there are other examples of the use of \"great\" and \"little\" such as Great Bernera and Rysa Little which are English/Gaelic and Norse/English respectively. The informal use of \"Isle of\" is commonplace, although only the Isle of Ewe, the Isle of May and Isle Martin of the larger Scottish islands use this nomenclature in a formal sense. \"Island\" also occurs, as in Island Macaskin and Mealista Island although both islands are also known by their Gaelic names of \"Eilean Macaskin\" and \"Eilean Mhealasta\". Holy Island off Arran is an entirely English name as is the collective Small Isles. Ailsa Craig is also known as \"Paddy's Milestone\". Big Scare in the Solway Firth is an English/Norse combination, the second word coming from \"sker\", a skerry.\n\nSome smaller islets and skerries have English names such as Barrel of Butter and the Old Man of Hoy in Orkney and Maiden Island and Bottle Island in the Inner Hebrides.\n\nThe Norse often gave animal names to islands and these have been transferred into English in for example, the Calf of Flotta and Horse of Copinsay. Brother Isle is an anglicisation of \"breiðare-øy\" meaning \"broad beach island\". The Norse \"holmr\", meaning \"a small and rounded islet\" has become \"Holm\" in English and there are numerous examples of this use including Corn Holm, Thieves Holm and Little Holm.\n\nEtymological details for all inhabited islands and some larger uninhabited ones are provided at Hebrides, Northern Isles, Islands of the Clyde and Islands of the Forth.\n\nBased on these tables, for the inhabited off-shore islands of Scotland (and counting Lewis and Harris as two islands for this purpose) the following results apply, excluding Scots/English qualifiers such as \"muckle\" \"east\", \"little\" etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Sahel, a belt of drier grasslands and acacia savannas, lies to the north, between the Sudanian Savanna and the Sahara Desert. To the south the forest-savanna mosaic is a transition zone between the Sudanian Savanna and the Guinean moist forests and Congolian forests that lie nearer the equator.\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature divides the Sudanian Savanna into two ecoregions, separated by the Cameroon Highlands. The West Sudanian Savanna runs from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Nigeria, and the East Sudanian Savanna runs from the Cameroon Highlands east to the western lowlands of Ethiopia.\n\nThe Sudanian Savanna is one of the three distinct physiographic provinces of the larger African Massive division. Physiography divides this province into three distinct physiographic sections, the Niger Basin, the Lake Chad Basin, and the Middle Nile Basin.\n\nThe Sudanian Savanna is characterized by the coexistence of trees and grasses. Dominant tree species are often belonging to the Combretaceae and Caesalpinioideae, some \"Acacia\" species are also important. The dominant grass species are usually Andropogoneae, especially the genera \"Andropogon\" and \"Hyparrhenia\", on shallow soils also \"Loudetia\" and \"Aristida\". Much of the Sudanian Savanna region is used in the form of parklands, where useful trees, such as shea, baobab, locust-bean tree and others are spared from cutting, while sorghum, maize, millet or other crops are cultivated beneath.\n\nThe Sudanian savanna is used by both pastoralists and farmers. Cattle are predominantly the livestock kept, but in some areas, sheep and goats are also kept. The main crops grown are sorghum and millet which are suited to the low levels of rainfall. With increasing levels of drought since the 1970s, pastoralists have needed to move southwards to search for grazing areas and have come into conflict with more settled agriculturalists.\n\n"}

While the surrounding land might appear rather nondescript, is one of the most biologically unique locations in the world. The name Taxara is also synonymous with the shallow lake that marks the center of the region. At about 14,000 feet above sea level, it is an extremely high lake. Another unusual characteristic is that it is a salt lake. Throughout the year, it bustles with many species of aquatic fowl, including three types of flamingo--the Chilean flamingo, the Andean flamingo, and the James's flamingo--which are drawn to the lake by its wide expanse of shallow plateaus abounding with algae that constitute the birds' primary food source. Because it is the only sizable body of water within many miles, it often attracts species of bird that would usually not be found in such a region. Most species thrive off the seed that is provided by the arid grassland that characterizes the region.\n"}

He was the first professor hired at The Ohio State University in 1873 and the superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1889 to 1894. Alongside his work, he was also an advocate for the adoption of the metric system by the United States.\n\nMendenhall was born in Hanoverton, Ohio, to Stephen Mendenhall, a farmer and carriage-maker, and Mary Thomas. In 1852 the family moved to Marlboro, a Quaker community outside of Akron, Ohio. His parents were strong abolitionists and frequently opened their home to escaped slaves heading north along the Underground Railroad. Mendenhall became principal of the local primary school in 1858. He formalized his teaching qualifications at National Normal University in 1861 with an \"Instructor Normalis\" degree.\n\nWhile living in Columbus, Ohio he married Susan Allan Marple in 1870. The couple had one child, Charles Elwood Mendenhall (1872-1935), teacher and chairman of the Physics Department at University of Wisconsin-Madison for 34 years.\n\nHe taught at a number of schools in Ohio including Central High School in Columbus, gaining an impressive reputation as a teacher and educator. In 1873, although he lacked conventional academic credentials, he was appointed professor of physics and mechanics at the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The college ultimately became The Ohio State University, Mendenhall being the first member of the original faculty. He was later awarded the first ever honorary Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in 1878.\nIn 1878, on the recommendation of Edward S. Morse, he was recruited to help the modernization of Meiji Era Japan as one of the \"o-yatoi gaikokujin\" (hired foreigners), serving as visiting professor of physics at Tokyo Imperial University. In connection with this appointment, he founded a meteorological observatory to make systematic observations during his residence in Japan. From measurements using a Kater's pendulum of the force of gravity at the sea level and at the summit of Mount Fuji Mendenhall deduced a value for the mass of the Earth that agreed closely with estimates that Francis Baily had made in England by another method. He also made a series of elaborate measurements of the wavelengths of the solar spectrum by means of a large spectrometer. He also became interested in earthquakes while in Japan, and was one of the founders of the Seismological Society of Japan (SSJ). During his time in Japan, he also gave public lectures on various scientific topics to general audiences in temples and in theaters.\n\nReturning to Ohio in 1881, Mendenhall was instrumental in developing the Ohio State Meteorological Service. He devised a system of weather signals for display on railroad trains. This method became general throughout the United States and Canada.\nHe became professor at the U.S. Signal Corps in 1884, introducing of systematic observations of lightning, and investigating methods for determining ground temperatures. He was the first to establish stations in the United States for the systematic observation of earthquake phenomena. Resigning in 1886, Mendenhall took up the presidency of the Rose Polytechnic Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana before becoming superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1889. During his time as superintendent, he issued the Mendenhall Order and oversaw the consequent transition of the United States's weights and measures from the customary system, based on that of England, to the metric system. Mendenhall remained a strong proponent for the official adoption of the metric system all his life. Also, as superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he was also responsible for defining the exact national boundary between Alaska and Canada. The Mendenhall Valley and Glacier in Juneau, Alaska was named for him in 1892.\n\nMendenhall invented the portable Mendenhall Gravimeter in 1890 while he was superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and at that time it provided the most accurate relative measurements of the local gravitational field of the Earth. The gravimeters were used at over 340 survey stations across the US and around the world including Germany, Holland, Java, Philippines, Cuba, Haiti, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Panama, Canada, and Mexico. The swing of the pendulum was more regular than the most accurate clocks of the era, and as the \"world's best clock\" it was used by Albert A. Michelson to measure the speed of light, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1907. An early model of the original 1890s Mendenhall Gravimeter is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\nMendenhall was appointed president of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 1894 until 1901, when he emigrated to Europe. He returned to the United States in 1912. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees of The Ohio State University in 1919 and is remembered for his successful efforts to close the College of Homeopathic Medicine and his unsuccessful effort to limit the capacity of Ohio Stadium to 45,000 seats, contending that it would never be able to fill to its design capacity of 63,000 seats. He continued to serve as a trustee until his death at Ravenna, Ohio in 1924.\n\nHis portrait is currently part of the Smithsonian Institution National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. It was painted by his former pupil Annie Ware Sabine Siebert, who was the first recipient of a Master of Arts degree from The Ohio State University in 1886, and one of the first women to earn an architecture degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1888. A portrait by famous artist and Columbus, Ohio native George Bellows was commissioned by The Ohio State University in 1913.\n\nThe largest collection of images, historical documents and handwritten material relating to Thomas Corwin Mendenhall is with Mendenhall's great-niece, filmmaker Sybil Drew.\n\nIn 1887 Mendenhall published one of the earliest attempts at stylometry, the quantitative analysis of writing style. Prompted by a suggestion made by the English mathematician Augustus de Morgan in 1851, Mendenhall attempted to characterize the style of different authors through the frequency distribution of words of various lengths. In this article Mendenhall mentioned the possible relevance of this technique to the Shakespeare authorship question, and several years later the idea was picked up by a supporter of the theory that Sir Francis Bacon was the true author of the works usually attributed to Shakespeare. He paid for a team of two people to undertake the counting required, but the results did not appear to support the theory. It has however since been shown by Williams that Mendenhall failed to take into account genre differences that could invalidate that particular conclusion. For comparison, in 1901 Mendenhall also had works by Christopher Marlowe analysed, and proponents of the Marlovian theory of Shakespearean authorship eagerly upon his finding that \"in the characteristic curve of his plays Christopher Marlowe agrees with Shakespeare about as well as Shakespeare agrees with himself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Before the establishment of the JAXA space agency in 2003, it was simply called the . All Japan's scientific satellites were launched from Uchinoura prior to the M-V launch vehicles being decommissioned in 2006. It continues to be used for suborbital launches, and has also been used for the Epsilon orbital launch vehicle. Additionally, the center has antennas for communication with interplanetary space probes.\n\nEstablished in February 1962, the Kagoshima Space Center (KSC) was constructed on the Pacific coast of Kagoshima Prefecture at Uchinoura for the purpose of launching large rockets with probe payloads. Prior to establishment of KSC, test launches of the Pencil Rocket, Baby Rocket and Kappa Rocket had been performed at the pioneering Akita rocket test facility (Michikawa) from the mid-1950s to the 1960s. However, progress in rocket development and larger launch vehicles required a site with more expansive down range than the narrow Sea of Japan. After consideration of various candidate sites, Uchinoura in Kagoshima Prefecture, fronting the Pacific Ocean, was selected. At 31° 15' north latitude and 131° 05' east longitude, and situated in hilly terrain, the site at first glance does not appear to be exceptional; however, landscape engineering resulted in a launch facility which maximizes the unique terrain features of the site.\n\nSubsequent to the so-called Baby Rocket, launch vehicles developed by Japan have been given names from the Greek alphabet, i.e. Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Omega, Lambda, and Mu. Although some Greek letters have been skipped due to project termination, the progression to Mu has been one of larger and more sophisticated rockets.\n\nLaunch test efforts at KSC with regard to the Kappa, Lambda and Lambda-4 rockets set the stage for small satellite missions. At the same time, the Mu program of large rockets was pursued. After four launch failures, an engineering test satellite was successfully put into orbit aboard a Lambda 4S-5 rocket. The satellite Ohsumi (named after a peninsula in Kagoshima Prefecture) marked Japan's first successful satellite launch. Subsequent improvements in the Mu class rocket enabled scientific satellite launches at a rate of one per year. Development of the new generation M-V rocket resulted in successful launch of the scientific satellite MUSES-B (HALCA) in February 1997.\n\nThe first launch of the Epsilon rocket, of a small scientific satellite SPRINT-A, was performed at 14:00 JST, 14 September 2013.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16649339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16649339", "title": "Wedge prism", "text": "Wedge prism\n\nThe wedge prism is a prism with a shallow angle between its input and output surfaces. This angle is usually 3 degrees or less. Refraction at the surfaces causes the prism to deflect light by a fixed angle. When viewing a scene through such a prism, objects will appear to be offset by an amount that varies with their distance from the prism.\n\nFor a wedge prism in air, rays of light passing through the prism are deflected by the angle δ, which is approximately given by\nwhere \"n\" is the index of refraction of the prism material, and α is the angle between the prism's surfaces.\n\nThe term \"optical wedge\" refers to any shallow angle between two plane surfaces of a window. This wedge may range from a few millionths of a degree of perfect parallelism to as much as three degrees of angle. Even though high-precision optics, such as optical flats, may be lapped and polished to extremely high levels of parallelism, nearly all optics with parallel faces have some slight wedge. This margin of error is usually listed in minutes or seconds of arc. Windows manufactured with an intentional wedge are often referred to as wedge prisms, and typically come with wedge angles of one, two, or three degrees. Many applications exist for wedge prisms, including laser-beam steering, rangefinding and variable focusing.\n\nA pair of wedge prisms, called a Risley prism pair, can be used for beam steering. In this case, rotating one wedge in relation to the other will change the direction of the beam. When the wedges angle in the same direction, the angle of the refracted beam becomes greater. When the wedges are rotated to angle in opposite directions, they cancel each other out, and the beam is allowed to pass straight through.\n\nMoving a wedge either closer or farther away from the laser can also be used to steer the beam. When the wedge is moved closer to the target (farther away from the laser), the refracted beam will move across the target. When two wedges in opposite directions slide relative to each other they can be used to provide variable focusing for cameras, allowing objects at vastly different distances to be photographed, in focus, at the same focal plane. This method is common in aerial or space launch-vehicle photography, when the distance to the object is changing very rapidly. Wedges were sometimes used in rangefinding, by combining the image formed by one telescope with the image formed by another.\n\nThe wedge prism is primarily used in a similar manner as an angle gauge in variable-radius plot sampling. In this type of sampling, the wedge prism is used to estimate basal area of a group of trees by counting trees which are \"in\" or \"out\" of a plot centered on a single point. Because the wedge prism refracts light to offset the object of interest (e.g. a tree), it can be used to determine whether or not the tree should be counted from a given point, based on the diameter at breast height of the tree and its distance from that point.\n\nIn this type of sampling, the prism is held a comfortable distance away from the eye with the bottom edge parallel to the ground, and trees are sighted through the prism approximately 4.5 ft. above the ground. A tree is an \"in\" tree if the offset section of the tree overlaps the bole as viewed without the prism (Figure 1). A tree where the offset section of the trunk is perfectly aligned with the original bole is a borderline tree (Figure 2) and DBH must be measured to determine if it should be counted (or, more commonly in practice, every other borderline tree is counted). A tree where the offset section of the tree does not overlap or touch the original bole is an \"out\" tree (Figure 3) and is not counted.\n\nBasal area is estimated by multiplying the count of \"in\" trees at a given point by the 'factor' of the prism. Prism factor is based on the angle of the prism, and prisms are available in different factors, expressed in both square feet/acre (5, 10, 20 BAF are most common) and square meters/hectare (1-5 BAF are common). Prism size is chosen to yield a statistically valid estimate of basal area - 6-10 \"in\" trees per plot are required, which requires a prism of the proper factor depending on the size of the trees being cruised. Larger trees will be \"in\" from further away, and a larger factor prism (20 or 30 ft/ac, 5–8 m/ha) can be used. Smaller trees will be \"out\" in a larger factor prism unless they are very close, and consequently a smaller factor prism must be used.\n\nImportantly, the bottom edge of the prism must be roughly parallel to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in forestry today because the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other angle gauges when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center, and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking forest inventory are clinometers, Biltmore sticks, relascopes, and Diameter Tapes.\n\nA wedge prism can also be used with a target placed at plot center, to establish fixed radius plots. In this function, the size of the target is carefully calibrated to the desired plot size, and the plot is defined as all the area in which the target is \"in\" as viewed through the prism.\n"}
