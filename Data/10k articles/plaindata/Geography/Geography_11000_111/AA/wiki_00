{"id": "8238720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8238720", "title": "A78 road", "text": "A78 road\n\nThe A78 is an A road in Scotland. It connects Greenock and Prestwick on a route which follows the northern section of the Ayrshire coast.\n\nThe A78 begins in Greenock, Renfrewshire as a continuation of the A8 road at the Bull Ring roundabout, and runs in a southerly direction through the Spango Valley, Inverkip, Wemyss Bay, Largs, Seamill and then bypasses the major towns of Ardrossan, Irvine and Troon amongst others before terminating near Prestwick, Ayrshire, where it forms a junction with the A77.\n\nMuch of the road is single carriageway - both for a short distance through Greenock and a 21-mile stretch between Inverkip and Ardrossan. \n\nThe rest is dual carriageway - between the Eglinton and Warrix interchanges there are in fact 3 lanes in each direction, and the road is constructed to motorway standard (with full grade separation at junctions) save for a lack of hard shoulders. The road very rarely appears busy on this stretch - the adjacent New Town development area of Irvine, North Ayrshire (which includes Kilwinning, Dreghorn and Girdle Toll) had a population of just over 50,000 in the 2001 census; the town planners designed the infrastructure for a population more in the region of 120,000.\n\nUntil December 2004, the route of the A78 went through the \"three towns\" - namely Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston. The result was a highly congested section with numerous traffic lights making progress slow. To counter this a bypass was constructed with two additional entrance/exit points other than the ends in the form of roundabouts. \n\nThe section at the Ardrossan end is a single carriageway road with a climbing lane. The other two sections are dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction.\n\nThe existence of the bypass meant that the section through the towns previously labelled A78 became a continuation of the A738 which previously formed a concurrency with the A78 through Stevenston before diverging to form Boglemart Street and subsequently many other streets in Saltcoats and Ardrossan. Many sources available today still don't acknowledge these changes, for example \"Google Maps\".\n\nThe new road can easily take 10 minutes off any journey which would otherwise involve travelling through the three towns and as a result has proven very popular amongst people who make such journeys - for example people from Largs and West Kilbride to the north who now have swifter access to the shopping facilities of Irvine and Ayr and the Morrisons supermarket at Stevenston, as well as any football fans who may be travelling to watch Kilmarnock FC.\n\nFlooding is common during periods of high winds combined with a high tide on the coastal stretch between Largs and Skelmorlie. For this reason, closure gates are located at both the north end of Largs and the south end of Skelmorlie. \n\nWhen the road is closed traffic between Largs and Greenock is often diverted along narrow country lanes with little room to pass any oncoming traffic. This has been known to cause widespread delays.\n"}

The alcohol belts refer to the traditional beverages of countries rather than what is most commonly drunk by the populace today, as in terms of drinking habits beer has become the most popular alcoholic drink in the whole world, including various parts of the wine and vodka belts.\n\nBeing an informal term, the \"vodka belt\" has no established definition. However, the general definition tends to include the following states as significant producers and consumers of vodka:\n\nThe EU countries of the vodka belt produce over 70% of the EU's vodka.\n\nThe southern boundary of the \"vodka belt\" roughly corresponds to the −2 °C January isotherm. With the exception of Poland, Ukraine, and some regions of southern Russia, cultivation of grapes is impossible or very difficult in the vodka belt.\n\nSometimes the term \"vodka belt\" is used while referring exclusively to the Slavic countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as they are the historical homeland of vodka (Poland and Russia being the nations most often associated with the invention of the drink). Before the 19th century, vodka was considered very much a \"people's drink\" that was common among the peasantry who made up the majority of the population in most countries of the time, while the political and aristocratic minority preferred imported wines or other alcoholic beverages that were considered less plebeian. There are exceptions, such as Żubrówka, a type of Polish vodka that dates back to the 16th century, which became popular among the szlachta (nobility) as well as the peasantry as early as the 18th century.\n\nIn his book about the Soviet Union, Alex de Jonge elaborates on his concept of \"geoalcoholics\". In particular, he explains Russian peculiarities by their belonging to the vodka belt and the absence of the beer belt in the Soviet Union. Other than the prevalent hard liquor the vodka belt is also characterised by a higher occurrence of binge drinking compared to the rest of Europe. Likewise, in his \"Russia and the Russians\", historian Geoffrey Hoskins notes the distinct effect vodka culture has had on the countries of the former Russian Empire, creating drinking as a social problem on a different level from other European countries.\n\nIn many countries historically belonging to the vodka belt, vodka has been supplanted by beer as the alcoholic drink of choice since the early 21st century. Residents of Finland and Sweden consume twice as much beer as vodka (in terms of pure alcohol). The Polish Beer-Lovers' Party (which won 16 seats in the Sejm in 1991) was founded on the notion of fighting alcoholism by a cultural abandonment of vodka for beer. And indeed in 1998, beer surpassed vodka as the most popular alcoholic drink in Poland. In Russia, annual consumption of beer has grown from 12 litres per capita in 1995 to 67 litres in 2006 (but still remains lower than consumption of vodka).\n\nThe term has received much attention since 2006 in the context of the \"vodka war\" within the European Union about the standardisation of vodka: the vodka belt countries insist that only spirits produced from grains and potato must be allowed to be branded as \"vodka\", according to the long established traditions of its production, a brand protection similar to the \"protected designation of origin\". The \"Schnellhardt compromise\", proposed by Horst Schnellhardt, suggests that vodkas from other than cereals, potatoes and molasses, should be labeled to say \"Vodka produced from\".\n\nThe \"beer belt\" is the territory covered by countries in Europe where beer is historically the most popular alcoholic beverage. The beer belt is located to the southwest of the vodka belt and to the northeast of the wine belt.\n\nThe geography of the beer belt is closely tied to the historical growing range of its two main ingredients: barley, and more especially hops. Barley was first domesticated during the late stone age in the ancient near east, has been brewed into beer-like beverages for thousands of years, and has been grown in most of Europe since ancient times. Hops are more narrowly distributed, preferring humid temperate climates, similar to potatoes. Originally, European \"ale\" (not yet called beer) was produced without hops, which were introduced to Europe from the east. The first evidence of hops in Europe dates from 736, in the Hallertau region of present-day Germany, although the first mention of the use of hops \"in brewing\" in that country was not until 1079.\n\nThe westward spread of hops was slow, not reaching England until 1524. Ireland was still importing hops in the eighteenth century; more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone in 1752. In 1516, the \"Reinheitsgebot\" or \"Bavarian Beer Purity Law\" established that barley, hops, and water were the only allowable ingredients in beer (yeast, while necessary for beer production, was unknown at the time). This became the template for beers across Europe. While non-barley beers (e.g., wheat beer), and non hopped-beers (e.g., flavoured with gruit) are still produced, across most of Europe \"beer\" is synonymous with barley and hops. Since the northern range of hops does not include most of Scandinavia or Russia (or much of Scotland), these areas, for the most part, are outside of the beer belt and lie in the vodka/whisky belt (see \"vodka belt\" above).\n\nBeer has also been promoted by authorities in many spirit-loving countries as a means of social control. Beer is less intoxicating per volume than spirits. The Gin Craze in eighteenth century Britain led to a campaign to promote beer as an alternative. The famous prints \"Beer Street\" and \"Gin Lane\" (1751) by William Hogarth, helped to lobby for what became the \"Gin Act\" of 1751 which taxed and regulated gin. During the 18th century the Parliament of Ireland used taxation to encourage brewing at the expense of distilling, reasoning that beer was less harmful than whiskey.\n\nOverseas, countries settled by peoples from the European beer belt also may have beer as the dominant drink, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\nThe \"wine belt\" is the territory covered by countries in Europe where wine is historically the most popular alcoholic beverage. The wine belt is located to the south of the beer belt and the vodka belt. The wine belt has been variously defined as approximately between 41° - 44°N, 30° - 50°N, and 35° - 50/51°N.\n\nCountries in the wine belt include Spain, Portugal, Italy, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Greece, Cyprus, Albania, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria, Turkey, most of Austria, San Marino, Switzerland, Romania, France, and Southern Federal District of Russia. Hungary and Slovenia are considered as part of the wine belt, but they overlap largely and are in line more with the Beer Belt instead. Additionally, Southwest England (if one classes cider as a wine analogue), parts of the Low Countries, southwestern Germany and parts of Austria could be considered to lie either within the belt or within an overlap region.\n\nOverseas, countries settled by immigrants from the European wine belt also may have wine as the dominant drink, such as Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. Wine is also important in countries such as Australia and South Africa, which while settled by European beer-belt peoples, also have warmer Mediterranean climates better suited for wine production.\n"}

{"id": "5918060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5918060", "title": "Brouwer Route", "text": "Brouwer Route\n\nThe Brouwer Route was a 17th-century route that was discovered and used by ships sailing from the African Cape of Good Hope to the Dutch East Indies base of Java, as the eastern leg of the Cape Route. The route took ships south from the Cape (which is at 34° latitude south) into the Roaring Forties (at 40-50° latitude south), then east across the Indian Ocean, before turning northeast for Java. Thus it took advantage of the strong westerly winds for which the Roaring Forties are named, greatly increasing travel speed. The problem with the route, however, was that there was no accurate way at the time to determine longitude. The sighting of either Amsterdam Island or Saint Paul Island was the cue for ships to change direction and head north. However, this was reliant on the captain's expertise.\n\nThe route was devised by the Dutch sea explorer Hendrik Brouwer in 1611, and found to halve the duration of the journey from Europe to Java, compared to the previous Arab and Portuguese monsoon route, which involved following the coast of East Africa northwards, sailing through the Mozambique Channel and then across the Indian Ocean, sometimes via India. By 1616 the Brouwer Route was compulsory for sailors of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).\n\nFor the British East India Company, Captain Humphrey Fitzherbert on \"Royal Exchange\" trialled the route in 1620, which they called the Southern route, and initially thought it a great success, but the second English ship to use the route, \"Tryall\", incorrectly judged the longitude, sailed too far east before turning north, and was wrecked on Tryal Rocks off the Pilbara coast of Australia in May 1622. The English then avoided the route for the next two decades.\n\nThe Brouwer Route played a major role in the discovery of the west coast of Australia. Many ships were wrecked along that coast, including \"Tryall\" (1622), \"Batavia\" (1629), \"Vergulde Draeck\" (1656), \"Zuytdorp\" (1712) and \"Zeewijk\" (1727). In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh explored the Australian coast while looking for survivors of the \"Ridderschap van Holland\", which disappeared in 1694 with 300 crew and two passengers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32093488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32093488", "title": "Château de la Motte", "text": "Château de la Motte\n\nChâteau de la Motte is a chateau located in the commune of Joué-du-Plain (Orne) in Normandy, France. The chateau began as a Viking Motte-and-bailey castle and evolved into the 18th and 19th century Château seen today. The two most noted families who owned the site were the Gabriel Montgommerys and the Nicolas Angos, but its role as Resistance center in World War II may be its most notable episode.\n\nLong established Norman chateaus, like Château de la Motte, usually originate from motte-and-bailey castles constructed during the earliest Norman period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The bourgeois Ango family built much of Château de la Motte in the late 16th and early 18th century. They bought the original chateau from one of the most noted names in Normandy: the descendants of Gabriel de Montgomery I (\"Montgommery\"). In 1559, Montgomery had accidentally killed King Henry II of France in a joust.\n\nChâteau de la Motte sits at the end of a long chestnut tree alley or avenue linking to the commune of Joué-du-Plain and the village of Écouché. The \"château's\" former farm, with an arched entry and coat-of-arms may have been the original chateau built in the 1660s. Today's chateau and a number of buildings have dates from the early 1820s, after restorations from the Deschamps family following the French Revolution.\n\nIn the Second World War, the chateau operated as a dairy and holiday home for Paris prostitutes. However, at the same time it functioned as headquarters for the Resistance. Escaping Allied pilots and an important arms depot were hidden here. The discovery of the depot by the Germans caused the assassination of the local mayor, and an unresolved crime, the subject of two criminal investigations and one book.\n\nChâteau de la Motte takes its name from the small-forested rise next to the current house, called a motte (\"clod of earth\" in Old French). The small mound is the remains of a Viking/Norman motte-and-bailey castle (\"motte castrale, motte féodale\" in Old French). Mottes were made throughout France and Europe from the 10th century until the early 13th century, with many sites carrying the title of La Motte, Les Mottes, Forêt de la Motte, or Château de la Motte.\n\nMottes often sat on Roman villa sites because water sources and strategic location needs were the same in both eras. Although numerous villa ruins were found nearby with the recent A88 autoroute construction, it is unknown whether this site was occupied before the Vikings, absent archaeological excavation. \nThe Château's site, including orchard and farm, has seven sources of water. Like most chateaus and mottes, this was likely the main consideration for the location. Wells and water management were important from earlier times as most drinking sources were contaminated, and sufficient water for animals was critical, even in rain-soaked Normandy. Water pollution was a known source of sickness from antiquity onward, although poorly understood.\n\nIn the 15th century, when chateaus lost their defensive function, moats fulfilled prestige and aesthetic roles as well as providing fishponds, an important source of protein for peasants.\n\nThe first mention of Château de la Motte is a letter from Guillame Lesor in 1217, asking to be a vassal of the French King. This letter followed the loss by King John of England (1199–1216) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, forcing an English withdrawal from \nNormandy.\n\nThe first motte and bailey forts were built to defend Viking/Norman power in Normandy, as the lords of Maine in the south, and Brittany, to the west, occasionally intruded in force. The river Orne was the southernmost Norman boundary for much of the 10th century, and was defended by a series of mottes, usually in groups.\n\nMotte and bailey castles usually had two main parts, both surrounded by wet or dry moats, then a wooden palisade. First constructed was the motte, or earthmound topped by a wooden tower. The tower was a last defense in an attack, and sometimes the lord's residence. The bailey contained barns, barracks, blacksmithy, chapel and other support structures. A removable wooden bridge linked the tower to the courtyard and a single fortified gate welcomed the visitor crossing the moat.\n\nThe motte may have been similar to one excavated nearby at Land de Goult, near Carrouges. Archeologists uncovered a lower court across. The motte was across at the base, with a flattened top for the tower high and wide at the top.\n\nAfter William the Conqueror's death, his sons revived motte making in the area to consolidate power from nearby Château of Falaise and Argentan. Lords continued building motte and bailey castles in the region throughout the ongoing feudal anarchy, until the mid 12th century. Thus, Château de la Motte may have originated close the letter's date of 1217.\n\nIn the 11th century a large stone tower (fr.\"grosses tour, grande tour\", or \"tour maîtresse\") was sometimes built over a water source, and the support buildings lined inside were attached to its circular wall. Stone for these structures would have been fieldstone and not cut; however, much of the structures may have been wood, or wattle and dab, not stone. Like mottes, most exterior wooden walls would have been coated in plaster to reduce fire worries, and making them resemble stone buildings.\n\nChâteau de la Motte, like most small chateaus, was most probably little more than a farm, possibly fortified during the Middle Ages. The king, or the duke of Normandy, had to give permission for building fortifications; towers, moats, and crenellations required licenses. Instead, rural architecture evolved a defensive function with buildings in compounds, built around a courtyard with water. The exterior walls had few windows, with an easy-to-defend entrance. \nCareful orientation toward the south, like most country architecture in France, was moderated on the Atlantic coast, in order to block the storms from the southwest. Today's gatehouse or dependence protects the château from the weather as well. The walls surrounding the grounds created microclimates, as well as defense, as intended. The rooftops deflect the winds upward, away from the residence. \nThe lord's dwelling would have been a modest structure from the 11th to 16th centuries, even if the home were referred to as a Great Hall (\"la grande salle\"). The home would have at least two levels with storage on the ground floor and a large public room (\"l'aula\") on the first floor, which was the actual great hall. This hall would have been a judicial, political, and economic center for the community, or parish (now \"commune\"), and located near the entrance to the Château grounds. A lord's private chamber (\"la camera\") would have been at one end, with true privacy only in the large curtained bed. The chapel (\"la capella\") was typically near, or in, the home, but no site is known today. \nDuring the Middle Ages, a lord's family usually moved between their various lands and residences, leaving the maintenance and farm production to a permanent staff. It was sort of a mandatory, perpetual picnic.\n\nA noble household consisted of an extended family including many illegitimate half brothers and sisters, along with descendants from previous mixed offspring. A mother's status determined the roles in the family, with many positions as administrators and servants. Strategic marriages with other families were sought to defend the family's power and prestige, but a lord's daughter by other than his wife could marry a high servant. Sons were expected to leave the family for service in other lords’ homes.\n\nA modest château had between 10 and 20 servants: farm and household staff such as shepherds, ditchers, cow herders, milkmaids, and cooks. Most pay was in-kind, such as food and clothes.\n\nRegardless of the construction, probably no comfortable home existed at Château de la Motte until the 17th century. King Henry IV visited the region in 1579, and stayed in an inn five kilometers away in Écouché, because there was no place suitable for him nearby.\n\nWith the inspiration of Versailles, \"châteaux de chasse\" (hunting chateaus/lodges) became popular as country retreats, with the hunt as the theme. These chateaus featured grand architecture, beautiful gardens, select majestic and exotic trees, greenhouses \"(orangeries)\" for luxuriant smells and spices, and grand entrances. A Google Earth view of the Château reveals an ancient hedge-line, or tree alley, leading from the current Château's gates to the Forest of la Motte (\"bois de la motte\").\n\nThe existing majestic lime trees (\"tilleul\") near the house and ponds may have been originals or descendants of those planted by previous lords as limes gave prestige and the grandeur of shade. Traditionally they were often planted in the courtyards center as symbols of high justice.\n\nNorman nobility originated as loyal friends and family of William the Conqueror. In turn, their knights and retainers became the petite nobility (\"petite noblesse\"), usually barons, which filled out the need for local authority and management. Early Château la Motte lords probably were among these nobles.\n\nThe known owners are taken from the original charter, which existed at the time of the writing of the book, \"Histoire du bourg d'Écouché\" By Alfred Caix in 1867.\n\n\n\nThe most famous owner of the Château de la Motte was Gabriel de Montgommery II, who acquired the Château by marriage. His father, of the same name, was the commander of the Scottish Guard; he accidentally killed King Henry II of France in a jousting tournament.\nThe tragedy occurred during a joust celebrating the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis treaty with the Habsburgs, which ended the Italian War of 1551-1559, and a marriage of the king's daughter. Gabriel de Montgommery I (1530–1574) killed the King Henry II of France when Montgommery's splintered lance sheared through the King's helmet visor and thrust into his face.\nThe King took 10 days to die, and although Montgommery was pardoned twice from the King's deathbed, he fled the country.\n\nThe young King's death shook Europe, and made the reputation of the prognosticator Nostradamus, whose recent words seemed to foretell the event.\n\nThe top sentence was actually added much later, but the last two lines attracted the popular attention.\n\nMontgommery converted to Protestantism in England. Ironically, his job as commander of the Scottish Guard in France was to search out Huguenots (French Protestants), as well as protect the King's life. He returned to France to lead numerous military campaigns in the Wars of Religion for the Protestants. His son, Gabriel de Montgommery II, and eventual owner of Chateau de la Motte, also became a Protestant commander, before and after his father's capture at a siege at Domfront and subsequent beheading.\n\nGabriel de Montgommery I, became a romantic figure linked to a book attributed to Alexander Dumas\", The Two Dianas\"; a French movie; and the Tour Montgommery at Paris’ Conciergerie, where Queen Marie Antoinette was imprisoned before being guillotined.\nThe son, Gabriel II was forgiven in the treaty of 1576, before his marriage to Suzanne de Bouquetot in 1593, daughter of the Baron of Écouché. He thus became the Lord of Château de la Motte.\n\nThe Montgommerys probably did not build at La Motte, but visited the area often, and possibly had a home in Écouché, which still exists.\n\nA year after Nicolas Ango's death (1654) his widow bought Chateau de la Motte and began building the farmhouse. Numerous other properties in Joué-du-Plain were also purchased, such as the nearby 16th-century manor Haut Mesnil, in order to fulfill the requirements of the acquiring the title of Marquis. Nicolas couldn’t attain the title himself, it went to his son, Jean-Baptist after the requisite amount of land was purchased. The title stayed with whoever owned the land afterward.\n\nThese titles were referred to as \"Lords of the Robe\", as opposed to the old aristocracy, like Montgommery, who were called \"Lords of the Sword\", who often had titles dating back to William the Conqueror.\n\nNicolas Ango was a wealthy bourgeois, and a Counselor to the King. The family had already built the private mansion \"hotel particulier\", across from St. Germain Church in Argentan.\n\nPurchase of the title marquisat brought income to the depleted royal treasury of Louis XIV, but Jean-Baptist Ango earned the King's favor by buying and closing the Huguenot temple property in Joué-du-Plain. Louis XIV had begun the unpopular process of enforcing the law of making every Christian become a Catholic. Ango's action saved the King an unpleasant job.\n\nJean-Baptist Ango married Marie LeFevre of Lezeau, daughter of Nicolas Le Fevre, advisor to the Parliament of Rouen. On the 18th century Casini map, Marquis de la Motte- Ango was the Chateau's title.\n\nThe Ango source of wealth was unclear; he may have been a lawyer. Many new-rich rose rapidly as merchants, financiers, lawyers, and doctors during the Hundred Years' War and Wars of Religion, because many male aristocrats had died. Louis XIV chose his most trusted servants from among the rising bourgeois and small nobles; two examples were Vauban for fortifications and Colbert for finances. Bourgeois were usually defined as professionals who did not work with their hands.\n\nNew lords, like the Angos, revived the ideals of country life. Jean-Baptist Ango built what would be the main residence around 1700, and probably the remainder of La Motte's buildings and walls.\n\nThe son, René-Phillipe de la Motte-Ango, married Antoinette de Dame Pellevé Flers. He became the Lord of Château de Flers after the premature deaths of her two uncles; the first uncle from a duel and the second from a horse-fall. The imposing granite Château de Flers is near the town center, and open to the public. Through skillful management, the Fler branch of the family became one of the wealthiest in France.\n\nJean Baptiste Ango IV sold the Château just before the beginning of the French Revolution. A letter from Voltaire declined the ownership of the Chateau in place of payment of a debt of only a 1000 écu in 1758. The letter said the lands had been poorly managed and systematically pillaged by the local peasants.\n\nDuring the Revolution, like most chateaus, it was probably pillaged but not burned, as portrayed in popular imagination. No useful records survive from the time. Normandy was not strongly partisan during the period. An interim manager sold off stone from the main house to nearby farms.\n\nIn 1820 the prominent Deschamps family bought the Château and built the existing home, dated at 1821-22. The barn and the orchard house have similar dates chiseled over the entrances, indicating substantial reconstruction by the family.\nAndré Champrepus, the grandson of the original Deschamps, remembered as poor, portly and single, was the last Marquis. He died at the outbreak of the Second World War. Locals recall visiting the body presented in the Château's tower, and the nephew paying all the communes taxes that year, a custom among the nobility from the Middle Ages.\n\nHonoré Jean Noel bought the Château as a retreat for his employees. He owned a ‘’café clos’’, or house of prostitution, in Paris. The enterprising Noel with his wife and family live at the Château, and they rented out the farmland with most of the buildings. Locals recall his bringing his young women there for short breaks \"to get a tan\". He provided ponies and carts for the employee to explore the Château's grounds. He also owned two \"café clos\" in Argentan. Locals referred to him as Père Noel, and they recall his Provençal accent along with a Mdm. Julos, a loud, tattooed woman that was a permanent member of the family.\n\nEmile Buffon, a well liked local man who soon became mayor of Joué-du-Plain rented the Chateau's farm. Mayors had the delicate jobs of negotiating between German demands and local resentments. This mayor's job made the position more difficult as he worked as an animal dealer. Buffon had to gather the farm animals of local farmers for the German army, as agreed to in the treaty of the French defeat. No farmer wanted to give up his best animals for Nazi diners.\n\nThe Normans in the countryside ate much better than the city dwellers throughout the War. Forward thinking Parisians made agreements with the farmers for food supplies to be sent on the train weekly.\n\nLocal people knew things were about to change. Before 1944, Germany stationed most of its troops in towns and cities, and ignored the countryside. The dreaded Gestapo, or Nazi internal police, only came to Normandy in force after January 1944. Until then, most troops stationed in France were older or ill-suited for combat. As the soldiers left, they warned the local French that their replacements would not be like them. Instead, the replacements would be young, intensely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology, and brutally battle hardened by combat on the Russian Front. These were the Waffen SS.\n\nIn the days leading up to D-Day Europe, air battles in the Norman clouds became more common. The Allies needed experienced pilots. Airmen that survived shooting down made every effort to make contact with Résistance forces. With French help, the pilots were to cross France to neutral Spain in order to return to Great Britain to fly and fight again.\nOn April 30, 1944, Charles Moore was flying his P-51 Mustang back from escorting bombers over Germany when four Messerschmitt 109 fighters attacked. He thought he had escaped, but realized he was losing altitude. He leapt from his plunging plane over Écouché. Madame Cavelot, a schoolgirl at the time, remembers seeing his parachute float above the countryside and a truck loading up with German soldiers to bring him in. Two young French boys found him moments before the soldiers did and led him to the Resistance.\nMoore recalled later that he did not know all the places he hid with the Resistance, but postwar memoires indicated he stayed in Château de la Motte. Others probably did as well, but no records survive saying whom. He recalled being smuggled to a new hideout by Denise Bachelier (sister to dairy owner and Resistant Jacques Bachelier). She returned home to find Germans waiting for her. It was May 21.\n\nDenise Bachelier had entered one of the enduring mysteries and tragedies of Joué-du-Plain during World War II, and the subject of a book and two investigations. It was a tragedy for her as well; the Germans sent her and her 18-year-old younger brother to concentration camps, her brother did not survive: he died shortly after being freed.\n\nChateau de la Motte was an arms depot for the Résistance, but its discovery by the Nazis brought an accusation of collaboration to the mayor of Joué-du-Plain. His assassination followed, possibly ordered by his brother. The events took place in and around the Chateau de la Motte.\n\nOn the day of the mayor's assassination, 16 July, just before dawn, a German Messerschmitt 109 fighter smashed into the large pond at Château de la Motte. The pilot, Haibt Oswald, died immediately.\nThe crash illustrated the desperate situation the occupying army faced. Corporal Oswald was based near Chartres. He died along with two others shot down that day from his outnumbered and out-fueled group. Not only did he die on his first combat mission, but he probably had only four hours of total flying experience. German fuel shortages meant no fuel to practice; it was a costly on-the-job training.\n\nIn that same dogfight, Canadian Michael O'Kelly was a casualty from Britain's Royal Air Force. He is the only Allied soldier in the graveyard at Écouché.\n\nThe Allies under General George Patton approached from the south, but the German occupiers continued local oppression, by managing a withdrawal across the Rhine to mount a final defense.\n\nAfter finding the arms depot, the Germans occupied the Château with soldiers living in the farmhouse and officers in the main house. The Germans installed a bakery on the Château farm grounds.\n\nM. Noel continued distributing rationing coupons for several years after the war, as shortages continued. Noel's son and some of the female employees followed the Allied armies into Germany. The girls' school closed and the schoolmistress left, to rejoin her German boyfriend in Germany.\n\nIn 1974, Fauvre, a Peugeot engineer bought La Motte along with his wife and their son.\n\nIn 1986, after Fauvre's death, Rhoisin Beresford, an Irish film director and the former wife of Bruce Beresford bought the Château from the son. Beresford was a noted director of \"Driving Miss Daisy\" and \"Terms of Endearment\". Because of her media links, numerous British notables passed through la Motte, including the heroine in the movie \"\" starring Milla Jovovich, filmed in nearby Sées.\n\nOn December 26, 1999, the chateau suffered major tree damage from the Lothar Storm. The majority of the remaining heritage trees (with the notable exception of the lime trees) from the 18th century Chateau planting were lost.\n\nIn 2014, the current owner bought La Motte.\n\n"}

Its main goal is nature conservation. The European Wildlife key objective is to conserve biological diversity and to reduce the impact of climatic changes on nature and humankind.\nThe main objective of European Wildlife is creating of non-state reserves and bio-corridors which would connect places with the most valuable biodiversity in Europe.\n\nThe non-profit organization European Wildlife was established in 2008. It was founded by Dalibor Dostal, a journalist and a former editor in chief of one of the most popular serious newspaper in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 2010 the European Wildlife starts its main project – the European Centre of Biodiversity, which should act as a “Noah’s Ark” of endangered species of plants and animals in Europe.\n\nThe main objective of the European Wildlife is creating of non-state reserves and bio-corridors which would connect places with the most valuable biodiversity in Europe. However, its most significant project is to establish a European Centre of Biodiversity, a big non-state nature reserve in Central Europe.\n\nAmong other priorities of the European Wildlife is the climate change. As well as contributing to the deceleration of climate changes, its projects also engage in reforestation. Planting of new trees means better absorption of carbon dioxide which is a by-product of European factories, transport and households. Interconnecting the places with the abundance of wildlife diversityhelps Europe adapt to the impacts of climete changes. While new forests help retaining the water in the landscape, biocorridors help the microorganisms endangered by rise in temperatures and climate fluctuations.\n\nThe well-known symbol of the European Wildlife conservation organization contains a silhouette of the European Bison. The European Bison is a symbol of a successful effort that was invested towards the rescue of animal species in situations where it seemed hopeless. All protectionist projects draw inspiration from that rescue of animals which were among the minority of the last ones to survive the First World War. Moreover, it is the largest land animal in Europe. The European Bison also has a positive influence on European ecosystems. A number of species such as rare butterflies are becoming extinct only because there are no big herbivores living in Europe. Since 2009 the orange and black and white logo with the silhouette of the animal in an orange square has been a trademark of the European Wildlife organisation in all countries of European Union registered by Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM).\n\nThe most significant project of the European Wildlife is to establish the European Centre of Biodiversity, a big non-state nature reserve in Central Europe. Its placement is important in terms of maintaining biodiversity of the whole continent. That is because Central Europe now separates populations of wild animals which live in Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe. The establishment of European centre of biodiversity should be an important step towards their mutual interconnection and thus maintaining wildlife diversity in Europe long-term.\n\nThe European Wildlife aim is to create a reserve which would be ten times ten kilometres large. The objective is to create an area big enough, a forest with a natural variety of woody species which, in future, would enable endangered species – especially large European mammals – to return. Some species such as European bison will be brought back again.\n\n\n"}

Through the GeoBase, users with an interest in geomatics have access to quality geospatial information at no cost and with unrestricted use. \n\nThese are the fundamental principles that GeoBase operates under and that direct the decision making process on a regular basis:\n\nProvincial, territorial, and municipal stakeholders agreed to work together to ensure the availability of high-quality geospatial data covering the entire Canadian landmass. This data is collected once and maintained closest to the source, and provided freely through the GeoBase with no restrictions for users.\n\nGeoBase has partnerships with federal, provincial, territorial, municipal government, and private companies, with the dual goals of eliminating data duplication and optimizing collectively available resources. GeoBase partners are involved in different levels of the data production process such as project funding, sharing of source data or by working on data collection and data processing.\n\nAll GeoBase data must conform to the following technical characteristics:\n\nThe purpose of this layer is to store names and their attributes that have been approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada (GNBC) and to make these authoritative records available for government and public use. These records include the names of over 70,000 populated places and administrative areas; 300,000 water features; and 115,000 terrain features (e.g., mountains and peninsulas).\n\nSince 2003, GeoBase has provided a consistent, accurate, and current NRN. The first edition of the NRN depicted the centerline of over 1.1 million kilometers of non-restricted use roads in Canada. In the fall of 2007 the second edition of the NRN was launched. NRN 2.0 includes place names, street names, and address ranges between intersections.\n\nRoad network data provides the framework for many geomatics applications such as mapping, geo-coding, geographic searching, and area delineations.

{"id": "5355670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5355670", "title": "Greek underworld", "text": "Greek underworld\n\nIn mythology, the Greek underworld is an otherworld where souls go after death. The original Greek idea of afterlife is that, at the moment of death, the soul is separated from the corpse, taking on the shape of the former person, and is transported to the entrance of the underworld. The underworld itself—sometimes known as Hades, after its patron god—is described as being either at the outer bounds of the ocean or beneath the depths or ends of the earth. It is considered the dark counterpart to the brightness of Mount Olympus with the kingdom of the dead corresponding to the kingdom of the gods. Hades is a realm invisible to the living, made solely for the dead.\n\nThere are six main rivers that are visible both in the living world and the underworld. Their names were meant to reflect the emotions associated with death.\n\n\nIn front of the entrance to the underworld live Grief, Anxiety, Diseases, and Old Age. Fear, Hunger, Death, Agony, and Sleep also live in front of the entrance, together with Guilty Joys. On the opposite threshold is War, the Erinyes, and Eris. Close to the doors are many beasts, including Centaurs, Gorgons, the Lernaean Hydra, the Chimera, and Harpies. In the midst of all this, an Elm can be seen where false dreams cling under every leaf.\n\nThe souls that enter the underworld carry a coin under their tongue to pay Charon to take them across the river. Charon may make exceptions or allowances for those visitors carrying a certain Golden Bough.\nCharon is appallingly filthy, with eyes like jets of fire, a bush of unkempt beard upon his chin, and a dirty cloak hanging from his shoulders. Although Charon embarks now one group now another, some souls he grimly turns away. These are the unburied which can't be taken across from bank to bank until they receive a proper burial.\n\nAcross the river, guarding the gates of the underworld is Cerberus. There is also an area where the Judges of the underworld decide where to send the souls of the person — to Elysium, the Fields of Asphodel, or Tartarus.\n\nWhile Tartarus is not considered to be directly a part of the underworld, it is described as being as far beneath the underworld as the earth is beneath the sky. It is so dark that the \"night is poured around it in three rows like a collar round the neck, while above it grows the roots of the earth and of the unharvested sea.\" Tartarus is the place that Zeus cast the Titans along with his father Cronus after defeating them. Homer wrote that Cronus then became the king of Tartarus. While Odysseus does not see them himself, he mentions some of the people within the underworld who are experiencing punishment for their sins.\n\nThe Asphodel Meadows was a place for ordinary or indifferent souls who did not commit any significant crimes, but who also did not achieve any greatness or recognition that would warrant them being admitted to the Elysian Fields. It was where mortals who did not belong anywhere else in the underworld were sent.\n\nIn the \"Aeneid\", the \"Mourning Fields\" (\"Lugentes Campi\") was a section of the underworld reserved for souls who wasted their lives on unrequited love. Those mentioned as residents of this place are Dido, Phaedra, Procris, Eriphyle, Pasiphaë, Evadne, Laodamia, and Caeneus.\n\nElysium was a place for the especially distinguished. It was ruled over by Rhadamanthus, and the souls that dwelled there had an easy afterlife and had no labors. Usually, those who had proximity to the gods were granted admission, rather than those who were especially righteous or had ethical merit. Most accepted to Elysium were demigods or heroes. Heroes such as Cadmus, Peleus, and Achilles also were transported here after their deaths. Normal people who lived righteous and virtuous lives could also gain entrance such as Socrates who proved his worth sufficiently through philosophy.\n\nThe Fortunate Isles or \"Isles of the Blessed\" were islands in the realm of Elysium. When a soul achieved Elysium, they had a choice to either stay in Elysium or to be reborn. If a soul was reborn three times and achieved Elysium all three times, then they were sent to the Isles of the Blessed to live in eternal paradise.\n\nHades (Aides, Aidoneus, or Haidês), the eldest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea; brother of Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia, is the Greek god of the underworld. When the three brothers divided the world between themselves, Zeus received the heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld; the earth itself was divided between the three. Therefore, while Hades' responsibility was in the underworld, he was allowed to have power on earth as well. However, Hades himself is rarely seen outside his domain, and to those on earth his intentions and personality are a mystery. In art and literature Hades is depicted as stern and dignified, but not as a fierce torturer or devil-like. However, Hades was considered the enemy to all life and was hated by both the gods and men; sacrifices and prayers did not appease him so mortals rarely tried. He was also not a tormenter of the dead, and sometimes considered the \"Zeus of the dead\" because he was hospitable to them. Due to his role as lord of the underworld and ruler of the dead, he was also known as Zeus Khthonios (\"the infernal Zeus\" or \"Zeus of the lower world\"). Those who received punishment in Tartarus were assigned by the other gods seeking vengeance. In Greek society, many viewed Hades as the least liked god and many gods even had an aversion towards him, and when people would sacrifice to Hades, it would be if they wanted revenge on an enemy or something terrible to happen to them.\n\nHades was sometimes referred to as Pluto and was represented in a lighter way – here, he was considered the giver of wealth, since the crops and the blessing of the harvest come from below the earth.\n\nPersephone (also known as Kore) was the daughter of Demeter, the goddess of the harvest, and Zeus. Persephone was abducted by Hades, who desired a wife. When Persephone was gathering flowers, she was entranced by a narcissus flower planted by Gaia (to lure her to the underworld as a favor to Hades), and when she picked it the earth suddenly opened up. Hades, appearing in a golden chariot, seduced and carried Persephone into the underworld. When Demeter found out that Zeus had given Hades permission to abduct Persephone and take her as a wife, Demeter became enraged at Zeus and stopped growing harvests for the earth. To soothe her, Zeus sent Hermes to the underworld to return Persephone to her mother. However, she had eaten six pomegranate seeds in the underworld and was thus eternally tied to the underworld, since the pomegranate seed was sacred there.\n\nPersephone could then only leave the underworld when the earth was blooming, or every season except the winter. The Homeric Hymns describes the abduction of Persephone by Hades:\n\nPersephone herself is considered a fitting other half to Hades because of the meaning of her name which bears the Greek root for \"killing\" and the -\"phone\" in her name means \"putting to death\".\n\nHecate was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, dogs, light, the Moon, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, necromancy, and sorcery.\n\nThe Erinyes (also known as the Furies) were the three goddesses associated with the souls of the dead and the avenged crimes against the natural order of the world. They consist of Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone.\n\nThey were particularly concerned with crimes done by children against their parents such as matricide, patricide, and unfilial conduct. They would inflict madness upon the living murderer, or if a nation was harboring such a criminal, the Erinyes would cause starvation and disease to the nation. The Erinyes were dreaded by the living since they embodied the vengeance of the person who was wronged against the wrongdoer. Often the Greeks made \"soothing libations\" to the Erinyes to appease them so as to not invoke the wrath of Erinyes, and overall the Erinyes received many more libations and sacrifices than other gods of the underworld. The Erinyes were depicted as ugly and winged women with their bodies intertwined with serpents.\nWhile Hermes did not primarily reside in the underworld and is not usually associated with the underworld, he was the one who led the souls of the dead to the underworld. In this sense, he was known as Hermes Psychopompos and with his fair golden wand he was able to lead the dead to their new home. He was also called upon by the dying to assist in their passing – some called upon him to have painless deaths or be able to die when and where they believed they were meant to die.\n\nMinos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus are the judges of the dead. They judged the deeds of the deceased and created the laws that governed the underworld. However, none of the laws provided a true justice to the souls of the dead, and the dead did not receive rewards for following them or punishment for wicked actions.\n\nAeacus was the guardian of the Keys of the underworld and the judge of the men of Europe. Rhadamanthys was Lord of Elysium and judge of the men of Asia. Minos was the judge of the final vote.\n\nCharon is the ferryman who, after receiving a soul from Hermes, would guide them across the rivers Styx and/or Acheron to the underworld. At funerals, the deceased traditionally had an obol placed over their eye or under their tongue, so they could pay Charon to take them across. To the Etruscans, Charon was considered a fearsome being – he wielded a hammer and was hook-nosed, bearded, and had animalistic ears with teeth. In other early Greek depictions, Charon was considered merely an ugly bearded man with a conical hat and tunic. Later on, in more modern Greek folklore, he was considered more angelic, like the Archangel Michael. Nevertheless, Charon was considered a terrifying being since his duty was to bring these souls to the underworld and no one would persuade him to do otherwise.\n\nCerberus (Kerberos), or the \"Hell-Hound\", is Hades' massive multi-headed (usually three-headed) dog with some descriptions stating that it also has a snake-headed tail and snake heads on its back and as its mane. Born from Echidna and Typhon, Cerberus guards the gate that serves as the entrance of the underworld. Cerberus' duty is to prevent dead people from leaving the underworld.\n\nHeracles once borrowed Cerberus as the final part of the Labours of Heracles. Orpheus once soothed it to sleep with his music.\n\nThanatos is the personification of death. He guards the Doors of Death.\n\nMelinoe is a chthonic nymph, daughter of Persephone, invoked in one of the Orphic Hymns and propitiated as a bringer of nightmares and madness. She may also be the figure named in a few inscriptions from Anatolia, and she appears on a bronze tablet in association with Persephone. The hymns, of uncertain date but probably composed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, are liturgical texts for the mystery religion known as Orphism. In the hymn, Melinoë has characteristics that seem similar to Hecate and the Erinyes, and the name is sometimes thought to be an epithet of Hecate. The terms in which Melinoë is described are typical of moon goddesses in Greek poetry.\n\nNyx is the goddess of the Night.\n\nA deep abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans, Tartarus was also considered to be a primordial deity.\n\nAchlys is the personification of misery and sadness, sometimes represented as a daughter of Nyx, sometimes as an ancient being even older than Chaos himself.\n\nStyx is the goddess of the river with the same name. Not much is known about her, but she is an ally of Zeus and lives in the underworld.\n\nEurynomos is one of the daemons of the underworld, who eats off all the flesh of the corpses, leaving only their bones.\n\nIn the Greek underworld, the souls of the dead still existed but they are insubstantial and they flitted around the underworld with no sense of purpose. The dead within the Homeric underworld lack \"menos\", or strength, and therefore they cannot influence those on earth. They also lack \"phrenes\", or wit, and are heedless of what goes on around them and on the earth above them. Their lives in the underworld were very neutral, so all social statuses and political positions were eliminated and no one was able to use their previous lives to their advantage in the underworld.\n\nThe idea of progress did not exist in the Greek underworld – at the moment of death, the psyche was frozen, in experience and appearance. The souls in the underworld did not age or really change in any sense. They did not lead any sort of active life in the underworld – they were exactly the same as they were in life. Therefore, those who had died in battle were eternally blood-spattered in the underworld and those who had died peacefully were able to remain that way.\n\nOverall the Greek dead were considered to be irritable and unpleasant, but not dangerous or malevolent. They grew angry if they felt a hostile presence near their graves and drink offerings were given in order to appease them so as not to anger the dead. Mostly blood offerings were given due to the fact that they needed the essence of life to become communicative and conscious again. This is shown in Homer's Odyssey, where Odysseus had to give blood in order for the souls to interact with him. While in the underworld, the dead passed the time through simple pastimes such as playing games, as shown from objects found in tombs such as dice and game-boards. Grave gifts such as clothing, jewelry, and food were left by the living for use in the underworld as well since many viewed these gifts to carry over into the underworld. There was not a general consensus as to whether the dead were able to consume food or not. Homer depicted the dead as unable to eat or drink unless they had been summoned; however, some reliefs portray the underworld as having many elaborate feasts. While not completely clear, it is implied that the dead could still have sexual intimacy with another, although no children were produced. The Greeks also showed belief in the possibility of marriage in the underworld, which in a sense describes the Greek underworld having no difference than from their current life.\n\nLucian described the people of the underworld as simple skeletons. They are indistinguishable from each other, and it is impossible to tell who was wealthy or important in the living world. However, this view of the underworld was not universal – Homer depicts the dead keeping their familiar faces.\n\nHades itself was free from the concept of time. The dead are aware of both the past and the future, and in poems describing Greek heroes, the dead helped move the plot of the story by prophesying and telling truths unknown to the hero. The only way for humans to communicate with the dead was to suspend time and their normal life to reach Hades, the place beyond immediate perception and human time.\n\nThe Greeks had a definite belief that there was a journey to the afterlife or another world. They believed that death was not a complete end to life or human existence. The Greeks accepted the existence of the soul after death, but saw this afterlife as meaningless. In the underworld, the identity of a dead person still existed, but it had no strength or true influence. Rather, the continuation of the existence of the soul in the underworld was considered a remembrance of the fact that the dead person had existed, yet while the soul still existed, it was inactive. However, the price of death was considered a great one. Homer believed that the best possible existence for humans was to never be born at all, or die soon after birth, because the greatness of life could never balance the price of death. The Greek gods only rewarded heroes who were still living; heroes that died were ignored in the afterlife. However, it was considered very important to the Greeks to honor the dead and was seen as a type of piety. Those who did not respect the dead opened themselves to the punishment of the gods – for example, Odysseus ensured Ajax's burial, or the gods would be angered.\n\nOrpheus, a poet and musician that had almost supernatural abilities to move anyone to his music, descended to the underworld as a living mortal to retrieve his dead wife Eurydice after she was bitten by a poisonous snake on their wedding day. With his lyre-playing skills, he was able to put a spell on the guardians of the underworld and move them with his music. With his beautiful voice he was able to convince Hades and Persephone to allow him and his wife to return to the living. The rulers of the underworld agreed, but under one condition – Eurydice would have to follow behind Orpheus and he could not turn around to look at her. Once Orpheus reached the entrance, he turned around, longing to look at his beautiful wife, only to watch as his wife faded back into the underworld. He was forbidden to return to the underworld a second time and he spent his life playing his music to the birds and the mountains.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32388810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32388810", "title": "Hesperia Planum", "text": "Hesperia Planum\n\nHesperia Planum is a broad lava plain in the southern highlands of the planet Mars. The plain is notable for its moderate number of impact craters and abundant wrinkle ridges. It is also the location of the ancient volcano Tyrrhena Mons (Tyrrhena Patera). The Hesperian time period on Mars is named after Hesperia Planum.\n\nMost place names on Mars are derived from sources in the Bible or classical antiquity. \"Hesperia\" is a Greco-Latin poetic term for \"lands to the west,\" which to the ancient Greeks and Romans meant Italy, while Spain was referred as \"Hesperia Ultima\" . \"Planum\" (pl. \"plana\") is Latin for plateau or high plain. It is a descriptor term used in planetary geology for a relatively smooth, elevated terrain on another planet or moon.\n\nThe Hesperia region of Mars was named by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877 for an intermediate-toned albedo feature centered at lat. 20°S, long. 240°W between two darker regions. Believing the dark areas were bodies of water, Schiaparelli interpreted Hesperia to be a floodplain or marsh bridging two adjacent seas, the Mare Tyrrhenum and Mare Cimmerium. Although the existence of seas on Mars had been discounted by the early 20th century, the true nature of the region remained obscure until the space age. In 1972, the Mariner 9 spacecraft showed that Hesperia was a cratered, wind-streaked plain. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally named the area Hesperia Planum in 1973. The dark areas flanking Hesperia Planum were found to be heavily cratered uplands. In 1979, the IAU designated the upland area to the west as Tyrrhena Terra and to the east as Terra Cimmeria. (\"Terra\" is a Latin descriptor term meaning land or continent.)\n\nHesperia Planum is located along the broad northeastern rim of the giant Hellas impact basin and is centered at lat. 22.3°S, long. 110°E in the Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle (MC-22). A small part of this region in the south is found in the Hellas quadrangle. It has a maximum width of 1700 km (1056 mi) and covers an area of about 2 million km (772000 sq. mi).\n\nAt large scales (>100 m), Hesperia Planum appears smooth and level, having a relatively uniform surface elevation of 1.2 km above Mars datum. The plain's surface is 200–800 m lower in elevation than the surrounding uplands of Tyrrhena Terra and Terra Cimmeria and is slightly tilted to the south, with a mean regional slope of about 0.03°. In high-resolution images (<19 m/pixel), the surface of Hesperia Planum is dominated by dust and fine-grained deposits. Few boulders or bedrock outcrops are visible. Abundant, shallow craters filled with smooth, flat-lying deposits are common. No vents or volcanic constructs are identifiable, although small (<10s meters wide) channels are present.\n\nHesperia Planum is generally interpreted to be composed of flood lavas, although layered volcaniclastic or lacustrine (lake-bed) sediments cannot be ruled out. The lavas appear to partly fill a large, irregular topographic depression that existed in Noachian times. The rims of pre-existing impact craters are still visible in places, indicating that the lava deposits are 250–500 m in thickness. The volume of lavas within Hesperia Planum is comparable to that found in large igneous provinces on Earth, such as the Columbia River Basalt Group.\n\nThe moderate amount of cratering on Hesperia Planum indicates that the plain has an intermediate age in Martian history. In planetary geology, the number density of impact craters is a measure of the relative age of a planetary surface. Heavily cratered surfaces are old, and sparsely cratered surfaces are young. Hesperia Planum is the type locality for the Hesperian System and time period. The lavas making up Hesperia Planum define the base of the Hesperian System. They erupted at the beginning of the Hesperian Period around 3700 million years ago. (Mars itself, along with the other planets, formed about 4500 million years ago.) Hesperian lavas are younger than the rocks in the heavily cratered Noachian terrains but older than rocks formed during the more recent Amazonian Period. (See Geology of Mars.)\n\nWrinkle ridges are long, linear topographic highs with a distinctive morphology that consists of a low, broad arch topped by a narrow crenulated ridge (pictured left). They are common features on the Moon where they occur exclusively within lava flow plains (the lunar maria). Their occurrence on Mars is thought to reflect a similar volcanic association. Thus, areas on Mars with abundant wrinkle ridges are interpreted as plains formed by very fluid basaltic lava (flood basalts). The ridges themselves are believed to be the surface expression of thrust faults formed after the lava flows were emplaced. They are not volcanic features, but secondary, tectonic structures that form in dense, competent rocks (such as layered basalts) that have undergone compressional stress. Hesperian-aged \"ridged plains\" like Hesperia Planum cover about 30% of the Martian surface.\n\nTyrrhenus Mons (Tyrrhena Patera) is an eroded, low-lying volcano in the western part of Hesperia Planum. It is one of the oldest large central-vent volcanoes on the planet and a member of a class of volcanoes called highland paterae, which erupted mainly in the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian. Tyrrhenus Mons stands only 1.5 km above the surrounding plains. At its center lies a 40 km diameter depression, or caldera, from which radiate numerous flat-floored valleys and ridges that suggest the volcano has been highly eroded. The low relief of Tyrrhenus Mons combined with its degraded state indicate the volcano consists largely of friable and easily eroded material such as volcanic ash. The ash was likely derived from the interaction of magma with groundwater or ice.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "63624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63624", "title": "Ibiza", "text": "Ibiza\n\nIbiza () is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (, or simply ), Santa Eulària des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is above sea level.\n\nIbiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music that originated on the island, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.\n\nIbiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\nThe official Catalan name is \"Eivissa\" (). Its name in Spanish is \"Ibiza\" (). In British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Spanish , whereas in American English the pronunciation is closer to Latin American Spanish (, ).\n\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim or Iboshim (, , \"Dedicated to Bes\"). It was later known to Romans as Ebusus. The Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the \"Pityoûssai\" (, \"Pine-Covered Islands\").\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica.\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum), and wool.\n\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Majorca, such as \"Na Guardis\", and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers, to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian General Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Moors in 902, the few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of Dénia—the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community—and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of Dénia during some time (11th century).\n\nIbiza together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon, and Alcácer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.\n\nThe island was conquered by Aragonese King James I in 1235. The local Muslim population got deported as was the case with neighboring Majorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Majorca, Menorca, and Formentera.\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of , almost six times smaller than Majorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos (in the Greek Isles) or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the \"Pityuses\" or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, at .\n\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Majorca. Ibiza comprises 5 of the community's 67 municipalities. Clockwise from the south coast, these are:\n\nAt the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an estimated 143,856 by the start of 2017, and have a land area of .\n\nIbiza has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) bordering on a Hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is , being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount goes from . The average high temperature is , while the average low is . Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and very dry, with few rainy days, often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is , while the average low is . In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is , while the low is . Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November.\n\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and by the start of 2017 had reached 143,856. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza, 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile), and the remaining 10 to 15 percent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears – IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch, in addition to a myriad of other nationalities. This mosaic reflects the fluidity of foreigners living and moving across the island, in ways that render impossible to exactly quantify the expatriate population (Rozenberg 1990).\n\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francolí was born in Ibiza, as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes. Notable former residents of Ibiza include: English punk musician John Simon Ritchie (Sid Vicious), the psychedelic rock band Philiac, comic actor Terry-Thomas, Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory, American author Clifford Irving, and film director/actor Orson Welles.\n\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages like English, French, German and Italian are widely spoken.\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore and Sant Antoni to the West.\n\nNight life in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to the hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s. During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented fincas in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists alike. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several places opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife. Four of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Privilege (formerly Ku), Amnesia and Es Paradís. These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties. The club would close at 6 AM and open again at 7 AM, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.\n\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music. The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.\n\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape. Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy, and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.\n\nThe season traditionally begins at the start of June with Space and DC10's opening parties and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties. A typical schedule for clubbers going to Ibiza includes waking at noon, early evening naps, late night clubbing, and \"disco sunrises.\" Due to Ibiza's notable tolerance toward misbehaviour from young adult tourists, it has acquired the sobriquet \"Gomorrah of the Med.\" Also well-known is Café del Mar, a long-standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by José Padilla, who has released more than a dozen eponymous album compilations of ambient music played at the location. That and other bars nearby have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre-parties after sunset, hosting popular DJ performers.\n\nThe island's government is trying to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene, passing rules including the closing of all nightclubs by 6 a.m. at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star. The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.\n\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, \"Joshua Then and Now\" by Mordecai Richler, \"Soma Blues\" by Robert Sheckley, \"Vacation in Ibiza\" by Lawrence Schimel, \"A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery\" by Hannah Blank, \"They Are Ruining Ibiza\" by A. C. Greene, and \"The Python Project\" by Victor Canning. \"Memes Eivissencs\" also have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\n\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive \"The Truth\" EP; it was later released on \"At Night, Alone.\" in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on July 24, 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast.\" \n\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities. A notable example includes \"God's Finger\" in the Benirràs Bay as well as some of the more traditional Ibizan cultural sites such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland.\n\nBecause of its rustic beauty, companies and artists alike frequently use the island for photographic and film shoots. A monument (\"The Egg\") erected in honour of Christopher Columbus can be found in Sant Antoni; Ibiza is one of several places purporting to be his birthplace.\n\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Lluís Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra, the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni, and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s. The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andrès has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens). In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has seen an increase in tourist numbers every year, with nearly 6 million people traveling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\" which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.\n\nIbiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure. This has led to imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect in July 1, 2016. Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium and building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal touristic beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's not much more tourism can be supported.\n\nIbiza is served by Ibiza Airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union.\n\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Majorca, Dénia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eulària, and Figueretes–Platja d'en Bossa.\n\nSeveral public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town—every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the Airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the Airport, and Santa Eulària.\n\nIbiza's local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as \"flaons\". Other savory dishes include \"sofrit pagès\", \"bullit de peix\" (fish stew), \"arròs de matança\" (rice with pork) and \"arròs a la marinera\".\n\n\n"}

After Magellan's death in the Philippines, Elcano took command of the carrack \"Victoria\" from the Moluccas to Sanlúcar de Barrameda in Spain.\n\nElcano was born in around 1486 to Domingo Sebastián Elcano and Catalina del Puerto. He had three brothers: Domingo Elcano, a Catholic priest, Martín Pérez Elcano, and Antón Martín Elcano.\n\nElcano fought in the Italian Wars under the command of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba in Italy, and in 1509 he joined the Spanish expedition organized by Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros against Algiers.\n\nElcano settled in Seville and became a merchant ship captain. After breaking Spanish laws by surrendering a ship to Genoan bankers in repayment of a debt, he sought a pardon from the Spanish king Charles V, by signing on as a subordinate officer for the Magellan expedition to the East Indies.\n\nElcano served as a naval commander of Charles V of Spain and took part in the expedition to the Philippines. In 1519, this 241-man expedition set sail with five ships, \"Trinidad\", \"Concepción\", \"San Antonio\", \"Santiago\", and \"Victoria\". Elcano participated in a fierce mutiny against Magellan before the convoy discovered the passage through South America, the Strait of Magellan. He was spared by Magellan and after five months of hard labour in chains was made captain of the galleon. \"Santiago\" was later destroyed in a storm. The fleet sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern coast of Brazil and into Puerto San Julián in Argentina. Several days later they discovered a passage now known as the Strait of Magellan located in the southern tip of South America and sailed through the strait. The crew of \"San Antonio\" mutinied and returned to Spain. On 28 November 1520, three ships set sail for the Pacific Ocean and about 19 men died before they reached Guam on 6 March 1521. Conflicts with the nearby island of Rota prevented Magellan and Elcano from resupplying their ships with food and water. They eventually gathered enough supplies and continued their journey to the Philippines and remained there for several weeks. Close relationships developed between the Spaniards and the islanders. They took part in converting the Cebuano tribes to Christianity and became involved in tribal warfare between rival Filipino groups in Mactan Island. \n\nOn 27 April 1521, Magellan was killed and the Spaniards defeated by natives in the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines. The surviving members of the expedition could not decide who should succeed Magellan. The men finally voted on a joint command with the leadership divided between Duarte Barbosa and João Serrão. Within four days these two were also dead. They were killed after being betrayed at a feast at the hands of Rajah Humabon. The mission was now teetering on disaster and João Lopes de Carvalho took command of the fleet and led it on a meandering journey through the Philippine archipelago.\n\nDuring the six-month listless journey after Magellan died, and before reaching the Moluccas, Elcano's stature grew as the men became disillusioned with the weak leadership of Carvalho. The two ships, \"Victoria\" and \"Trinidad\" finally reached their destination, the Moluccas, on 6 November. They rested and re-supplied in this haven, and filled their holds with the precious cargo of cloves and nutmeg. On 18 December, the ships were ready to leave. \"Trinidad\" sprang a leak, and was unable to be repaired. Carvalho stayed with the ship along with 52 others hoping to return later.\n\n\"Victoria\", commanded by Elcano along with 17 other European survivors of the 240 man expedition and 4 (survivors out of 13) Timorese Asians continued its westward voyage to Spain crossing the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. They eventually reached Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 6 September 1522.\n\nAntonio Pigafetta, an Italian scholar, was a crew member of the Magellan and Elcano expedition. He wrote several documents about the events of the expedition. According to Pigafetta the voyage covered 14,460 leagues—about .\n\nElcano was awarded a coat of arms by Charles I of Spain, featuring a globe with the motto: \"Primus circumdedisti me\" (in Latin, \"You went around me first\"), and an annual pension.\n\nIn 1525, Elcano returned to sea, and became a member of the Loaísa expedition. He was appointed leader along with García Jofre de Loaísa as captains, who commanded seven ships and sent to claim the East Indies for King Charles I of Spain. Both Elcano and Loaísa and many other sailors died of malnutrition in the Pacific Ocean, but the survivors reached their destination and a few of them managed to return to Spain.\n\nElcano never married but he had a son by María Hernández Dernialde named Domingo Elcano, whom he legitimized in his last will and testament.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7886277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7886277", "title": "Material flow analysis", "text": "Material flow analysis\n\nMaterial flow analysis (MFA) (also referred to as substance flow analysis (SFA)) is an analytical method to quantify flows and stocks of materials or substances in a well-defined system. MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of industrial ecology or anthropogenic, urban, social and industrial metabolism. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within ecosystems. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking nutrient flows through a waste water treatment plant. When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called material flow cost accounting. MFA is an important tool to study the circular economy and to devise material flow management. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the \"Journal of Industrial Ecology\", \"Ecological Economics\", \"Environmental Science and Technology\", and \"Resources, Conservation, and Recycling\".\n\nHuman needs such as shelter, food, transport, or communication require materials like wood, starch, sugar, iron and steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity expands, material production, use, and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be neglected anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from landfills or oil spills. Rising concern about global warming puts a previously unimportant waste flow, carbon dioxide, on top of the political and scientific agenda. \nThe gradual shift from primary material production to urban mining in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society.\nScientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the anthroposphere. Material flow analysis is such a method.\n\nMFA is based on two fundamental and well-established scientific principles, the systems approach and mass balance.\nThe system definition is the starting point of every MFA study.\n\nAn MFA system is a model of an industrial plant, an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary, one or more processes, material flows between processes, and stocks of materials within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to the preconceived notion that a system represents a specific industrial installation, systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are well-defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system, either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes.\n\nNext to specifying the arrangement of processes, stocks, and flows in the system definition, the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied.\nThe spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA, China, certain world regions, or the world as a whole. \nThe temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. \nThe indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says, an indicator element is a certain chemical element such as cadmium or a substance such as CO. In general, a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars, materials like steel, or other physical quantities such as energy.\n\nMFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms 'material', 'substance', or 'good', as laid out, for example, in chapter 2.1 of Brunner and Rechberger, one of the main references for the MFA method.\n\nOne of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the metabolism of the elements of the system. Unlike economic accounting, MFA also covers non-economic waste flows, emissions to the environment, and non-market natural resources. \n\nThe process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool. The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply. For a process 'oil refinery', for example, one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element, while this is not possible for a nuclear power station. A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel, but a steel mill does not.\n\nWhen quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data, mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process. Conflicting information can be reconciled using data validation and reconciliation, and the STAN-software offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application.\n\nMFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements, substances, and goods. They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles. Several examples:\n\n\n\n\nA state-of-the-art MFA consists of the following steps:\n\nWhile the term 'substance' in 'substance flow analysis (SFA) always refers to chemical substances, the term 'material' in 'material flow analysis (MFA)' has a much wider scope. According to Brunner and Rechberger the term 'material' comprises substances AND goods, and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel, timber, or products like cars or buildings. It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase.\n\nMFA is complementary to the other core industrial ecology methods life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (I/O) models. Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle. The methods mainly differ in purpose, scope, and data requirements.\n\nMFA studies often cover the entire cycle (mining, production, manufacturing, use, waste handling) of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame. Material stocks are explicit in MFA, which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap. The common use of time series (dynamic modelling) and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing long-term trends in material use.\n\n\n"}

The modern city developed from what were rural suburbs of Pune as a result of rapid industrialization that began within a decade after Indian independence in 1947. It is situated at an altitude of 530 m above sea level, about 15 km northwest of the historic center of its twin city of Pune. The twin cities as well as the cantonment areas of Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road together form the urban core of the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). According to the 2011 census, Pimpri-Chinchwad has a population of 1.72 million residing in an area of 181 km. Pimpri-Chinchwad is home to a vast variety of industrial establishments and is well known for its automotive and manufacturing industry.\n\nMegalithic remains have been found in modern-day Bhosari which suggests that the town was inhabited as early as 1100-200 BCE in the early Iron Age. However, rapid urbanization and lack of attention from the local authorities has led to worries that this heritage will be lost. It is also believed to be the capital of legendary King Bhoja. The epic Mahabharata mentions that King Rukmi of the Vidarbha Kingdom created a new capital 'Bhojakata' which lay to the west of the old capital of Kundinapuri. It is claimed that Bhosari is the site of this mythological 'Bhojakata'.\n\nChinchwad is noted for the shrine of Morya Gosavi, a prominent saint of the Ganapatya denomination of Hinduism that worships Lord Ganesha as the Supreme Being or its metaphysical concept of Brahman. Various sources place Moraya Gosavi between the 13th and 17th centuries CE. The inscription on the temple records that its construction began in 1658 CE.\n\nChinchwad is also the birthplace of the Chapekar brothers: Damodar Hari (1870-1898), Balkrishna Hari (1873-1899) and Vasudeo Hari, who assassinated W. C. Rand, a British civil service officer and the chairman of the Special Plague Committee of Poona (Pune), on 22 June 1897.\n\nFollowing the partition of India, the Government of India constructed 1,609 residences and laid out around 300 plots on 203 acres of land in the Pimpri area. This area came to be known as Pimpri Camp is one of the 31 refugee camps in Bombay State (present day Maharashtra) set up during the period.\n\nStarting in the mid-1950s, the green village fields on the sides of the highway and railways linking Pune to Mumbai were subject to large industrial development. In the 1960s, the newly founded Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) purchased vast tracts of land, developing roads and water supply infrastructure. It developed the area for a cluster of pharmaceutical, mechanical, and automotive industries, and, more recently, information technology, of national and international importance. Hundreds of thousands of people have migrated to the new hub to fill the jobs and benefit from rapid economic development.\n\nOn 4 March 1970, the villages of Pimpri, Chinchwad, Bhosari and Akurdi merged into a single municipal authority, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Council. Two years later, the Pimpri-Chinchwad New Town Development Authority (PCNTDA) was established. Its chief objective was to create a planned environment for the working population in the vicinity of their work place. On 11 October 1982, the Municipal Council was merged with seven surrounding villages and the PCNTDA area to form the a new Municipal Corporation (PCMC). The size the city more than doubled in 1997 (from 84.51 km to 170.51 km.) with the addition (in part or in full) of 18 villages located at the periphery of the PCMC as it existed in 1982. Tathawade was added to the city in 2008, bringing the total area of the city to 176.41 km.\n\nThe area within the city limits is generally flat with the altitude varying between 530 and 570 m above sea level. The city is situated approximately at 18° 37' north latitude and 73° 48' east longitude bordering its twin city of Pune on the north and north-west. The centers of the twin cities are 15 km apart. Three rivers Pavana, Mula and Indrayani flow through this area. The base rock found throughout the city is Deccan trap basalt. Building stone is the only commercially important mineral found in the area.\n\nThe city experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Typical summer months are February to May with maximum temperatures above 35 °C and reaching up to 42 °C on hotter days. The city receives most of its 722 mm of rainfall in the monsoon months of June to September. The temperature in the winter months of October to January ranges from 12 °C (min) to 30 °C (max), with night temperatures often falling below 10 °C.\n\nPune is one of the major industrial hubs in Asia and many of these industries are situated in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Industrialization started in 1954 with the arrival of Hindustan Antibiotics Limited. PCMC is now home to the Indian operations of major automobile companies like Premier Ltd., Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. - Truck & Bus Division, Mahindra Engineering services, Bajaj Auto, BEL Optronic Devices Limited, TATA Motors (formerly TELCO), Kinetic Engineering, Force Motors (formerly Bajaj Tempo) Daimler Chrysler, Thermax and Autoline Industries. In addition to this, several heavy industries such as Forbes Marshall, ThyssenKrupp and GEA Ecoflex, Alfa Laval & Sandvik Asia have their manufacturing units in the city and also the German company KSB Pumps, Swedish bearing company SKF.\n\nThe Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is the local civic body. It comprises two branches: the executive branch headed by the Municipal Commissioner, an IAS officer appointed by the Government of Maharashtra, and an elected deliberative branch, the general body, headed by the Mayor. Municipal elections are held every five years to elect councilors, popularly known as 'corporators', who form the general body of the PCMC. The corporators, in turn, elect the mayor and the deputy mayor. In the Municipal Elections held in February 2017, 128 corporators were elected to represent the 32 electoral wards (4 corporators per ward). While the position of the mayor is mostly ceremonial, the chief executive of the city is the Municipal Commissioner, appointed by the state government. The JNNURM award for Best Performing City, under Sub-Mission for Urban Infrastructure and Governance, was given to Pimpri-Chinchwad. The \"System of Assisting Residents and Tourist Through Helpline Information\" (SARATHI), the grievance portal of the city, has gained national recognition and is a role model for other cities.\n\nThe Pimpri-Chinchwad Police is the law enforcement agency for the city of Pimpri-Chinchwad. It was carved out of Pune Police department and took charge on 15 August 2018. It is a division of the Maharashtra Police and is headed by the Police Commissioner, an officer of the Indian Police Service.\n\nThe Pimpri-Chinchwad New Town Development Authority (PCNTDA), popularly known as Prādhikaraṇ (Marathi: प्राधिकरण), is the urban planning authority of the city. The authority was established in 1970 to tackle the problems and meet the infrastructure needs of rapid industrialization as well as to plan housing for the working population in the vicinity of their work place. Ever since its formation, the PMRDA has been keen to take over PCNTDA, however, there has been opposition from local leaders who want it to merge with the PCMC.\n\nPune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), which was on the cards since 1997, was formed on 31 March 2015 and is responsible for the integrated development of the PMR. Currently its jurisdiction extends over and includes the municipal corporations of Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune, three cantonment boards, seven municipal councils, 13 census towns and 842 villages.\n\nThe Pavana dam located 35 km from Pimpri-Chinchwad is the sole source of water for the city. The water is lifted at the Ravet bund is pumped to the Nigdi filtration plant from where it distributed to the entire city. As of 2018, PCMC provides around 450 million liters per day (MLD) of water to the city. This leads to the generation of around 290 MLD of sewage, of which the civic body has capacity to treat only 240 MLD at its 13 sewage treatment plants, a problem that has persisted for years. The untreated water is let into the rivers which lead to several health and environmental problems. Similar problems in the twin city of Pune as well as in the suburban areas, the rivers in the PMR are among the most polluted rivers in the state.\n\nThe state owned Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited supplies electricity to the city. The power comes from thermal, hydro, gas and renewable sources such as solar, wind and sugarcane bagasse. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), owned by the central government, as well as private enterprises such as Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Idea Cellular, Aircel, Tata DoCoMo, Tata Teleservices, Virgin Mobile, and MTS India, are the leading telephone and cell phone service providers in the city.\n\nPublic transport modes in Pimpri-Chinchwad include Suburban Railway, bus and Rainbow BRTS services operated by PMPML and auto rickshaws. Pune Metro, an urban mass rapid transit system is under construction in the twin cities. Online transport network companies like Uber and Ola cabs also provide rideshare and taxi services in the city.\n\nPimpri-Chinchwad is served by five railway stations, Chinchwad, Akurdi, Pimpri, Kasarwadi and Dapodi, on the Pune Suburban Railway as well as the Mumbai Dadar–Solapur sections of the Indian Railways (Central zone). Local trains (EMUs) connect Pimpri-Chicnhwad to its twin Pune and the hill station of Lonavala, while daily express trains connect it to Mumbai. Daily express trains through Pune Junction connect the city to other parts of the country.\n\nUntil 2007, Pimpri-Chinchwad was served by its own public transport bus service provider, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT). On 19 October 2007, it was merged with the Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) that served the neighbouring city of Pune to form the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML; \"lit. Pune Metropolitan Transport Corporation Ltd.\"). PMPML runs buses on 371 routes that cover a radius of 20 km around the cities of Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune. It also runs services on BRT corridors under the brand name Rainbow BRTS. As of May 2018, there are two operating BRT corridors in Pimpri-Chinchwad with a combined length of 22.5 km, while work is underway on three other corridors with a total length 28 km. Although the BRTS project has been deemed a failure in the neighbouring Pune, PCMC claims that the two BRT corridors, Sangvi-Kiwale and Nashik Phata-Wakad, have seen a rise in ridership after they became operation in 2015. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation operates buses from its main station at Vallabh Nagar, Pimpri to all major cities and towns in Maharashtra as well as in the neighbouring states. Private companies also run bus services throughout India.\n\nPune Metro, a mass rapid transit system, is under construction and expected to be operational by 2021. The detailed project report (DPR) was prepared for the initial two lines by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation which was approved by the State government in 2012 and by the Central government in December 2016. Out of the two lines, Line 1 will run through PCMC limits from PCMC building to Dapodi and further to Swargate in Pune. A detailed project report is being prepared for the extension of the line up to Nigdi. The project is being implemented by MahaMetro, a 50:50 joint venture of the State and Central governments. Line 3 from Hinjewadi to Civil Court, Shivajinagar was approved by the State and Central governments in January and March 2018, respectively. The 23.3-km line is being implemented by PMRDA on a public-private partnership basis and will have a station at Wakad in PCMC limits. Another metro route connecting Hinjewadi to Moshi via Nashik Phata, Bhosari is also being contemplated.\n\nPimpri-Chinchwad has a 633-km long extensive network of roads connecting its various neighbourhoods. The Old Mumbai–Pune Highway runs through the heart of the city and serves as the main connecting link for the twin cities of Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune. The other metropolitan highway serving the city is the Dehu Road–Katraj bypass. The Pune-Nashik highway originates at Nashik-Phata and runs through the neighbourhoods of Bhosari and Moshi. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway that originates at Dehu Road just outside Pimpri-Chicnhwad, is India's first six-lane high-speed expressway, and it was built in 2002. A ring road is being planned for the convenience of heavy traffic.\n\nRapid urbanization has led to the population of the city to double from 2001 to 2017. In the same period, the number of vehicles has increased of 700%. Like its neighbouring Pune, motorized two-wheelers dominate the streets. At the rate of 663 vehicles per 1000 residents, a total of 1.57 million vehicles are registered in the city in 2018, of which 1.17 million are two-wheelers. Public transportation in the city has not been able to keep up with the demand and is infamous for its unreliability leading to a constant upward trend in the number of vehicles. Unsurprisingly, the whopping number of vehicles has led to several problems including air pollution, noise pollution and traffic congestion.\n\nPune International Airport located at Lohegaon c.19 km away from the city is the closest airport. It is operated by the Airports Authority of India. In addition to domestic flights to all major Indian cities, the airport serves international direct flights to Dubai (operated by Air India Express) and to Frankfurt (operated by Lufthansa). The Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje International Airport, initially proposed at a site near the Chakan-Rajgurunagar area just north of Pimpri-Chinchwad, will now be built at Purandar c. 20 km south of Pune.\n\nAs of the 2011 Census of India, Pimpri-Chinchwad had a population of 1,729,692. The sex ratio was 833 females per 1000 males. About 13% of the population was under six years of age with a sex ratio of 875 females per 1000 males. Around 8% of the city's population lives in slums. Pimpri-Chinchwad has an average literacy rate of 89.22% (92.41% males; 85.37% females), higher than the national average of 74.04%. The 2011 census records Hinduism as the dominant religion in the city with 84.21% adherents. Islam is the second most populous religion with 6.91% adherents followed by Buddhism (5.03%), Christianity (2.09%), Jainism (1.12%) and Sikhism (0.34%) while 0.24% of the population did not state any religion. The main language spoken in the city is Marathi. There is a significant Sindhi population in Pimpri, which dates to the partition of India in 1947.\nPimpri-Chinchwad has considerable Hindi,Malayalam,Punjabi,Gujrati,Tamil,Kannada,Telugu speaking population\n\nLike most Indian cities, a number of festival are celebrated across all communities in the city including Ganeshotsav, Navaratri, Dussehra, Janmashtami,Dahi Handi and Onam Holi, Diwali, Eid al-fitr, Eid al-Adha, Christmas, Buddha Purnima, Cheti Chand, Chalio, and several others. The birth anniversary celebrations of historical figures like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the principal architect of Indian Constitution, among others are also celebrated with great pomp and show. The national holidays of Republic Day and Independence Day are also celebrated. Individual towns also organize annual village fairs which are dedicated to the local deity. The Bhairavnath fair in Bhosari is perhaps the well-known village fair for its controversial bullock cart race.\n\nThe Pimpri-Chinchwad Festival is an annual cultural event held in the city. It was started by the PCMC in 1996 under the name 'Ganesh Festival' as it used to be organized on the occasion of Ganeshotsav. Since 2004, the PCMC stopped organizing the festival and it was kept alive by the Pimpri-Chichwad Social Club. Since 2014, the festival is not organized during Ganeshotsav but at another time of the year. Pavanāthaḍi Jatrā (Marathi: पवनाथडी जत्रा) is an annual event organized by the Women and Child Welfare Committee of the PCMC. It is a three to five day long exhibition cum sale of goods produced by women's self-help groups in the city and features over 300 stalls. The city also participates in the Pune International Film Festival with screening of several films at a cinema in the city limits.\nPimpri-Chinchwad has public parks such as the park on Durga Tekdi and Bhakti-Shakti park in Nigdi, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Science Park in Chinchwad, and the Boat Club in Thergaon. The city also has a zoo named after Nisargakavi Bahinabai Chaudhari in Chinchwad. Close to the zoo is a lake garden called the Bird Valley because of the water birds like cranes which come migrating here. Appu Ghar is an amusement park located in the Pradhikaran area. There are ten public swimming pools run by PCMC. Chapekar wada in Chinchwad, the residence of the revolutionary Chapekar brothers has been restored and is now a memorial cum museum dedicated to their life and displays swords and weapons used by freedom fighters during the struggle for Indian independence. Ramkrushna More Prekshagruha in Chinchwad, Acharya Atre Rangmandir in Sant Tukaramnagar, Ankushrao Landage Natyagruha in Bhosari, Nilu Phule Rangmandir in Sangvi are the auditoria in the city. There are several cinema halls as well as shopping malls in the city. There is a fort in Punawale that was built by and named after the Peshwa Minister Sardar Borge. The Vaishnodevi Temple in Pimpri attracts devotees from all over the city.\n\nPCMC runs 136 public schools, locally called 'Municipality Schools'. According to the PCMC website, the city also has 208 private schools that are run by individuals or educational trusts. Public schools are affiliated to the State Board. Private schools vary in their choice curriculum and may follow the State Board or one of the two central boards of education, the CBSE or CISCE.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the city has 75 colleges (undergraduate and above), three medical colleges and 3 engineering colleges. Most colleges in Pimpri-Chinchwad are affiliated to the Savitribai Phule Pune University. The College of Military Engineering is located in the Dapodi area. The city is also home to the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) of the Indian Council of Medical Research established in October 1992 in Bhosari MIDC. Central Institute of Road Transport is also located in Bhosari MIDC.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "435859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435859", "title": "Scottish Lowlands", "text": "Scottish Lowlands\n\nThe Lowlands ( or \"the Lawlands\"; , \"the place of the foreigner\") are a cultural and historic region of Scotland.\n\nThe Lowlands is not an official geographical or administrative area of the country. There are two main topographic regions: the Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The term \"Lowlands\" mainly refers to the Central Lowlands. However, in normal usage it refers to those parts of Scotland not in the Highlands (or Gàidhealtachd). The boundary is usually considered to be a line between Stonehaven and Helensburgh (on the Firth of Clyde). The Lowlands lie south and east of the line. Note that some parts of the Lowlands (such as the Southern Uplands) are not physically \"low,\" Merrick for example reaching 2,766 feet, while some areas indisputably in the Highlands (such as Islay) are low-lying.\n\nIn geological terms, the dividing line between Lowlands and Highlands is the Highland Boundary Fault. There was also a legally defined Highland Line in the post-Culloden years, part of the measures taken to suppress Gaelic culture.\n\nFor other purposes, the boundary varies; but if the Boundary Fault is used, then the traditional Scottish counties entirely in the Lowlands are: Ayrshire, Berwickshire, Clackmannanshire, Dumfriesshire, East Lothian, Fife, Kinross-shire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Lanarkshire, Midlothian, Peeblesshire, Renfrewshire, Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, West Lothian and Wigtownshire.\n\nTraditional Scottish counties which straddle the Boundary fault include Angus, Dunbartonshire, Stirlingshire, Perthshire, Kincardineshire, Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Moray.\n\nGeographically, Scotland is divided into three distinct areas: the Highlands, the Central plain (Central Belt), and the Southern Uplands. The Lowlands cover roughly the latter two. The northeast plain is also \"low-land,\" both geographically and culturally, but in some contexts may be grouped together with the Highlands.\n\nThe term Lowlands is sometimes used in a more restricted sense to refer specifically to the Midland Valley. Much of this area, which has a characteristic structure of sedimentary rocks with coal deposits, lies within the basins of the Rivers Forth and Clyde. Historically, this valley has been the most agriculturally productive region of Scotland. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, coal deposits promoted concentrated industrial activity and urbanization in the Midland Valley, where 80 percent of the population of Scotland now live. While coal mining and other heavy industry have declined in the region, it remains at the centre of the Scottish economy, with electronics and computer manufacture and service sectors such as telecommunications, computer software, and finance.\n\nThe southernmost counties of Scotland, nearest the border with England, are also known as the Borders. They are sometimes considered separately from the rest of the Lowlands. Many ancestors of the Scotch-Irish, as they are known in the United States, or Ulster-Scots, originated from the lowlands and borders region before migrating to the Ulster Plantation in the 17th century and later the American frontier, many prior to the American Revolution.\n\nThe term Scottish Lowlands is used with reference to the Scots language in contrast to the Scottish Gaelic spoken in the Highlands, although historically also in parts of the lowlands, Scottish history and the Scottish clan system, as well as in family history and genealogy.\n\nDespite Scotland often being regarded as a Celtic nation, the Scottish Lowlands and its inhabitants have long been noted as having a predominantly Germanic population. The areas of modern-day Edinburgh, Midlothian, East Lothian, and the Scottish Borders were heavily settled in the 6th century by Germanic groups like the Anglo-Saxons and were also subject to the kingdoms of Bernicia and Northumbria. Other Germanic groups like the Flemish, Frisians, and Scandinavians are known to have migrated in large numbers to the Scottish Lowlands and its major towns and cities, as did many English settlers in the post-Conquest period. From here the English language of these Lowland 'Scots' eventually spread throughout the rest of Scotland, replacing the use of Scottish Gaelic in many areas.\n"}

The offered sensor data comprises descriptions of sensors themselves, which are encoded in the Sensor Model Language (SensorML), and the measured values in the Observations and Measurements (O & M) encoding format. The web service as well as both file formats are open standards and specifications of the same name defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).\n\nIf the SOS supports the transactional profile (SOS-T), new sensors can be registered on the service interface and measuring values be inserted. A SOS implementation can be used both for data from in-situ as well as remote sensing sensors. Furthermore, the sensors can be either mobile or stationary.\n\nSince 2007, the SOS is an official OGC standard. The advantage of the SOS is that sensor data - of any kind - is available in a standardized format using standardized operations. Thus the web-based access to sensor data is simplified. It also allows easy integration into existing Spatial Data Infrastructures or Geographic Information Systems.\n\nIn 2016 OGC approved the SensorThings API standard specification, a new RESTful and JSON-based standard provide functions similar to SOS. As both SensorThings API and SOS are based on the OGC/ISO 19156:2011, the two specifications have been demonstrated in an OGC IoT pilot that they can interoperate with each other.\n\nThe SOS has three so-called \"core operations\" that must be provided by each implementation. The \"GetCapabilities\" operation allows you to query a service for a description of the service interface and the available sensor data. For using the SOS, the \"GetObservation\" function is probably the most important. It can be utilized to retrieve data for specific sensors. The \"DescribeSensor\" function returns detailed information about a sensor or a sensor system and the producing processes.\n\n\n\n\nThe OGC has - not only for the SOS - its own well-defined terminology. For better understanding, here are some important terms:\n\nThe SOS is a standard of the OGC and ultimately only defines a service interface, but not an implementation. There are currently several Open Source implementations of the service:\n\n\nAlso, proprietary implementations exist.\n\n"}

{"id": "7654445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7654445", "title": "State Plane Coordinate System", "text": "State Plane Coordinate System\n\nThe State Plane Coordinate System (SPS or SPCS) is a set of 124 geographic zones or coordinate systems designed for specific regions of the United States. Each state contains one or more state plane zones, the boundaries of which usually follow county lines. There are 110 zones in the contiguous US, with 10 more in Alaska, 5 in Hawaii, and one for Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands. The system is widely used for geographic data by state and local governments. Its popularity is due to at least two factors. First, it uses a simple Cartesian coordinate system to specify locations rather than a more complex spherical coordinate system (the geographic coordinate system of latitude and longitude). By using the Cartesian coordinate system's simple XY coordinates, \"plane surveying\" methods can be used, speeding up and simplifying calculations. Second, the system is highly accurate within each zone (error less than 1:10,000). Outside a specific state plane zone accuracy rapidly declines, thus the system is not useful for regional or national mapping.\n\nMost state plane zones are based on either a transverse Mercator projection or a Lambert conformal conic projection. The choice between the two map projections is based on the shape of the state and its zones. States that are long in the east–west direction are typically divided into zones that are also long east–west. These zones use the Lambert conformal conic projection, because it is good at maintaining accuracy along an east–west axis, due to the projection cone intersecting the earth's surface along two lines of latitude. Zones that are long in the north–south direction use the Transverse Mercator projection because it is better at maintaining accuracy along a north–south axis, due to the circumference of the projection cylinder being oriented along a meridian of longitude. The panhandle of Alaska, whose maximum dimension is on a diagonal, uses an Oblique Mercator projection, which minimizes the combined error in the X and Y directions.\n\nIn 1933, the North Carolina Department of Transportation asked the Coast and Geodetic Survey to assist in creating a comprehensive method for converting curvilinear coordinates (latitude and longitude) to a user-friendly, 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This request developed into the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), which is now the most widely used expression of coordinate information in local and regional surveying and mapping applications in the United States and its territories (Doyle, \"Professional Surveyor Magazine\", January 2004 link). It has been revised several times since then. When computers began to be used for mapping and GIS, the state plane system's cartesian grid system and simplified calculations made spatial processing faster and spatial data easier to work with.\n\nEven though computer processing power has improved radically since the early days of GIS, the size of spatial datasets and the complexity of geoprocessing tasks being demanded of computers have also increased. Thus the state plane coordinate system is still useful. \n\nOriginally, the state plane coordinate systems were based on the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27). Later, the more accurate North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) became the standard (a geodetic datum is the way a coordinate system is linked to the physical Earth). More recently there has been an effort to increase the accuracy of the NAD83 datum using technology that was not available in 1983. These efforts are known as \"High Accuracy Reference Network\" (HARN) or \"High Precision GPS Network\" (HPGN). In addition, the basic unit of distance used is sometimes feet and sometimes meters. Thus a fully described coordinate system often looks something like: \"Washington State Plane North, NAD83 HARN, US Survey feet\". This information is needed in order to accurately transform data from one coordinate system to another.\n\nThe main problem with the state plane coordinate system is that each zone uses a different coordinate system. This is not a major problem as long as one's needs are within the boundaries of a given state plane zone, as is the case with most county and city governments. However, the need to transform spatial data from one coordinate system to another can be burdensome. Sometimes a regional area of interest — such as a metropolitan area covering several counties — crosses a state plane zone boundary. The Seattle metropolitan area is an example of this. King County, which includes the City of Seattle, uses the \"Washington State Plane North\" coordinate system, while Pierce County, which includes the City of Tacoma, uses \"Washington State Plane South\". Thus any regional agency that wants to combine regional data from local governments has to transform at least some data into a common coordinate system.\n\n\n"}
