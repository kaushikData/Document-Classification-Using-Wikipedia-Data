{"id": "3378374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3378374", "title": "A249 road", "text": "A249 road\n\nThe A249 is a road in Kent, England, running from Maidstone to Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey. It mainly functions as a link between the M2 and M20 motorways, and for goods vehicle traffic to the port at Sheerness.\n\nIn 2006 an upgraded dual carriageway section opened between Iwade and Queenborough, including a new fixed crossing over the Swale. The existing lifting Kingsferry Bridge has been retained as an alternative route. On 5 September 2013 more than 100 vehicles were involved in an accident on the crossing.\n\nThe A249 begins close to Maidstone town centre, where it commences by heading eastwards from the southbound A229 Lower Stone Street along first Mote Road and then along Wat Tyler Way. Due to Maidstone's one-way system, the westbound carriageway extends along for a short way along Knightrider Street (towards the Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone) before it then ends, as it meets the northbound carriageway of the A229. At the top of Wat Tyler Way, where that road meets King Street, the A249 occupies a small gyratory system which joins the A20 (heading east to Ashford). \n\nFrom here, the A249 heads north on Albion Place. This very quickly becomes the Sittingbourne Road (crossing over the Maidstone East railway station -Bearsted railway station). After passing Vinters Park, and reaching the north end of the town at the Chiltern Hundreds roundabout (named after the adjacent pub). This old route (Maidstone and Sittingbourne) is broken as the old Sittingbourne Road has become a Park and Ride facility. \n\nThis break occurred during the 1990s, as the result of works to widen and upgrade the former A20(M) Maidstone Bypass section of the M20 to remove a bottleneck on the newly completed motorway. Instead of following its old course, the route turns east onto the Bearsted Road towards Grove Green, becoming a dual carriageway before turning north again just before Newnham Court Farm. Here, the route crosses the M20, rejoining the Sittingbourne Road at the exit of the motorway roundabout. From this point onwards, the route becomes Primary.\n\nThe road then climbs up onto the Downs via Detling Hill, past the village of Detling and crossing the Pilgrim's Way and North Downs Way (between Boxley and Thurnham). Just after the M20 junction where it meets Pilgrim's Way, is a footbridge called Jade's Crossing, named after the schoolgirl who died along with her grandmother in a road accident in 2000 whilst attempting to cross the busy road in the absence of such a bridge. Immediately after the footbridge, the carriageways diverge, with the northbound carriageway taking a higher route up the hill and the southbound carriageway taking a separate lower route where it negotiates a chicane at the bottom of the steep hill. \n\nAfter Detling Hill, the road becomes known as the Maidstone road and passes the Kent County Showground (on the left) and White Horse Wood (on the right). Further on the road passes a large layby on the northbound carriageway, which was closed in 2005 after local residents complained that it was a haunt of doggers. The road passes the village of Stockbury (on the left), then heads to a junction coming off the M2. \n\nFrom here the route used to carry on as a single carriageway road towards Sheppey on the old Maidstone Road, however a new dualled Maidstone Road running parallel but slightly west was completed in the mid nineties and this is the route that the A249 follows now under the M2 viaduct. The route now passes the hamlets of Danaway and Chestnut Street. The next junction on the A249, comes at Key Street, where it meets the A2, which heads left to Newington and Rainham to the west or right Sittingbourne to the east. \n\nFrom here the route continues across the flat plains of Swale, past Bobbing(on the left), Kemsley and Milton Regis(on the right). As it approaches Swale railway station on the southern banks of the Swale, the road now becomes the Sheppey Way which now bridges the Swale via the Sheppey Crossing, opened in 2006, having previously used the Kingsferry Bridge which has to be lifted to allow ships to pass on the Swale. Non-motorised traffic still uses the old route and rejoins the A249 on the island.\n\nOnce on the Isle of Sheppey, the road follows a new dual carriageway built in conjunction with the new bridge as far as Queenborough. Then it returns to its old single carriageway route along Brielle way into Sheerness, past Blue Town (on the left), before ending at a roundabout near the seaport and former passenger ferry port in Sheerness. Here the A249 becomes the A250 on Bridge Road.\n\n"}

{"id": "2572110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2572110", "title": "Alternative names for Northern Ireland", "text": "Alternative names for Northern Ireland\n\nThere are a number of alternative names for Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland consists of six historic counties of Ireland, and remains part of the United Kingdom following the independence of the other twenty-six counties as the Irish Free State in 1922 (now the Republic of Ireland, officially named \"Ireland\"). In addition to, and sometimes instead of, its official name, several other names are used for the region. Significant differences in political views between unionists and Irish nationalists are reflected in the variations of names they use for the region. A proposal to change Northern Ireland's legal name to Ulster was seriously considered by the UK and Northern Ireland Governments in 1949 but in the end the name \"Northern Ireland\" was retained.\n\nThe official and legal name of the region is \"Northern Ireland\". The legal name is used by both the British and Irish governments, internationally by governments around the world, and by most of its inhabitants.\n\n\"Ulster\" is often used by unionists and some media outlets of the UK. This is the Hiberno-Norse form of the province of \"Uladh\" (pronounced \"Ull-ah\") (Irish \"Uladh\" and Old Norse \"ster\", meaning \"province\", yields \"Uladh Ster\" or, in English, \"Ulster\"). Examples of official use of this term are the Ulster Unionist Party, the University of Ulster, and the BBC Radio Ulster.\n\nThis term is disliked by some nationalists because the whole of the Province of Ulster consists of nine counties – three of which, County Monaghan, County Cavan and County Donegal, are in the Republic of Ireland. Unionists have argued that because Ulster's size has changed much over the centuries, \"Ulster\" can be applied to Northern Ireland alone. The Government of Northern Ireland once considered a proposal to change the official name to Ulster. Some also reject the claim of the Republic of Ireland to have inherited the tradition of the Irish Republic of the Irish War of Independence, because it excludes the north east, and refer to the Republic variously as \"the Free State\" or \"The Twenty-Six Counties\".\n\n\"The Province\" is also sometimes used, referring directly to the status of Northern Ireland as a \"province\" of the United Kingdom. This also, however, could be obliquely used to refer to the province of Ulster; and since no other constituent part of the United Kingdom is known as a province, a less controversial usage is \"the region\".\n\nIn 1949, members of the United Kingdom parliament debated how best it was to respond to Ireland's decision to terminate its last connection with the British King. Ireland also adopted a law saying that the state could be described as the \"Republic of Ireland\". Some British MPs did not consider this was appropriate. One said that \"Ulster has as much right to be called the \"Kingdom of Ireland\" as Southern Ireland has to be called the \"Republic of Ireland.\" However, Northern Ireland was never renamed the Kingdom of Ireland.\n\nNationalists in the region and their supporters elsewhere commonly refer to it as \"The North of Ireland\", \"The North-East\" or \"The North\". This can be used to implicitly deny British sovereignty by placing it into the rest of Ireland, at least linguistically. It does, however, contain the same geographic anomaly as it does not contain Ireland's most northerly point.\n\n\"The Six Counties\" and \"The Occupied Territories\" are other popular names among republicans, as it can portray the region as a mere collection of Irish counties, rather than a legal political entity. \n\n\"The Occupied Six Counties\" is a phrase sometimes used by more extreme republicans, especially since the arrival of additional British Army soldiers, but originally employed simply to suggest the illegitimacy of the British presence in Northern Ireland. This is sometimes rendered as \"The Occupied Zone\" or \"The OZ\".\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, people typically refer to the region simply as \"the North\". Similarly, and more commonly, in Northern Ireland, \"the South\" is sometimes used (by both unionists and nationalists) as a shorthand term for the Republic of Ireland.\n\nObviously this explanation does not hold for parts of the Republic such as County Donegal giving rise to the joke that while further out in a boat on Lough Foyle, \"the South is north, and the North is south\".\n\nA colloquial name for Northern Ireland which has grown in popularity in recent years is \"Norn Iron\", derived from an over exaggerated pronunciation of 'Northern Ireland' in a broad Belfast accent. This name is often used by fans of the football team both on banners and in conversation.\n\nNorthern Ireland is literally translated to \"Tuaisceart Éireann\" or \"Tuaisceart na hÉireann\" in Irish (though it is sometimes known as \"Na Sé Chontae\" 'The Six Counties' by republicans) and \"Norlin Airlann\" or \"Northern Ireland\" in Ulster Scots.\n\nUlster unionists often use the name \"Ulster\" as a synonym for Northern Ireland. Sometimes there are calls to formally change the name of Northern Ireland to Ulster.\n\nIn 1937 a plebscite was held in the Irish Free State which approved a new Constitution. Amongst its provisions, the name of the Irish state was changed to \"Ireland\"; this led to discussions, both at a governmental level and in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, about Northern Ireland being renamed as Ulster.\n\nAhead of the renaming of the Irish Free State to simply \"Ireland\" in 1937, the British Prime Minister and the Home Secretary discussed the matter with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Craigavon when he was in London in July 1937. It was reported to the Cabinet that:\n\nLater, the British Home Secretary discussed the new name for the Irish state (and other matters) with the Acting Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, J. M. Andrews on 10 December 1937 just under three weeks before the new Constitution came into effect. Since the earlier discussions with Lord Craigavon, the Law Officers have given their opinion that local\nlegislation changing the name of Northern Ireland to Ulster would be ultra vires, and that legislation by Westminster would be necessary if the change of name were to be made. It was this which the Home Secretary wished to discuss with Mr. Andrews. The Home Secretary reported on the discussions to his Cabinet colleagues noting the following:\n\nThe parliamentary reports of the Parliament of Northern Ireland record an instance in 1937 where the proposal to rename Northern Ireland as Ulster was given formal consideration. On 1 December 1937, Thomas Joseph Campbell, MP (Nationalist) asked the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland whether the Government was considering changing the name of Northern Ireland, and, if so what name was being considered. Responding, the Minister of Finance John Miller Andrews MP said \"the matter has been under discussion amongst Members of the Government, but no Cabinet decision has been taken\".\n\nThis exchange followed speeches in parliament the previous month by two Independent Unionist MPs, Tommy Henderson and John William Nixon ,raising the possible name-change. Both regretted the name-change was not mentioned in the King's Speech. Mr. Henderson criticised the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland's handling of the matter. He said that \"the Attorney-General suggested recently that the name of Northern Ireland should be changed to Ulster\". However, according to Mr Henderson it was \"absolutely impossible to change the name of this area from Northern Ireland to Ulster without amending the 1920 Act\" (the Government of Ireland Act 1920). That Act could only be amended by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and not the Parliament or government of Northern Ireland. He concluded that in making the suggestion, the Attorney-General had tried to \"\"throw dust in the eyes of the Ulster people\".\"\n\nThis exchange had followed a statement made by the Attorney General, Sir Anthony Babbington KC on 15 November 1937 in Belfast in which he criticised the new Constitution proposed for Ireland. In particular, he was critical of its claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. He said:\n\nThe Attorney General continued by saying that it was of \"great importance\" that the \"cumbersome name\" of Northern Ireland that came into the Act of 1920 alongside Southern Ireland should be changed. He continued further remarking that \"The name of Southern Ireland has been changed and it was time that the name of Northern Ireland should be changed to Ulster\".\n\nAt a British Cabinet meeting on 22 November 1948 it was decided that a Working Party be established to \"[consider] what consequential action may have to be taken by the United Kingdom Government as a result of Eire's ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth\". At the time the Irish parliament was soon expected to pass the \"Republic of Ireland Act\", by which Ireland (formally referred to as \"Eire\" by the British authorities) would shortly become a republic, and thereby leave the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Working Party was chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, Norman Brook. Its report dated 1 January 1949 was presented by Prime Minister Clement Attlee to the Cabinet on 7 January 1949. Among its recommendations were that the name of Northern Ireland should be changed to Ulster. In this regard the Working Party's report noted:\n\nThe Working Party's report appended draft legislation (a draft of the Ireland Act) including provision for the \"Ulster\" name change. With respect to the arguments against the name change, the report noted in particular that the UK's \"Representative\" (effectively Ambassador) in Dublin believed taking the name \"Ulster\" would \"give fresh opportunities for anti-British propaganda by Eire\". The report also noted that the Commonwealth Relations Office also held that view and its representative on the working party had asked that before a final decision be taken:\n\nA Downing Street Conference between the UK and Northern Ireland governments was held on 6 January 1949. The Conference was held on the initiative of the Northern Ireland Government. Its purpose was to consider possible legislation to give statutory effect to Prime Minister Clement Attlee's assurance that Northern Ireland's constitutional position would not be prejudiced by the Republic of Ireland Act by which Ireland had decided to leave the British Commonwealth and any other possible consequences for Northern Ireland arising from the Irish decision. The UK government was represented at the Conference by the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations while Northern Ireland premier Sir Basil Brooke led the Northern Ireland delegation. Prime Minister Attlee reported to his Cabinet colleagues the following day that he had discussed relevant Working Party proposals with the Northern Ireland delegation. \"As a result of that discussion\", Attlee reported that he would \"recommend that the title of Northern Ireland should not he changed to Ulster\".\n\nOn 10 January 1949, Prime Minister Attlee presented a memorandum of his own to his Cabinet. With respect to his recommendation that the name for Northern Ireland should not be changed, he said:\n\nThe proposed name change was the subject of some reportage in the media with \"The Times\" reporting shortly before the conference:\n\nThe fresh proposal to change the name to Ulster drew protest from the Nationalist Party MP for Fermanagh and Tyrone, Anthony Mulvey. He sent a telegram to Attlee to strongly \"protest against any proposal to change the title Northern Ireland to Ulster\". Mulvey argued that \"[a]ny assent to the suggestion proposed can only be regarded as a calculated affront to the Irish nation and still further embitter relations between the peoples of Great Britain and Ireland...\". Mulvey sent a telegram in similar terms to the Irish Minister for External Affairs, Seán MacBride who responded as follows:.\n\nThe UK government cabinet minutes of 12 January 1949 noted that \"N.I. [Northern Ireland] Ministers accepted the name “N.I.” eventually\" A few days after the Conference \"The Times\" also reported that \"[i]t is not thought that the suggestion to rename Northern Ireland \"Ulster\" has found much support.\" In a somewhat colourful but not too accurate explanation of events, in the run up to the General Election in Northern Ireland in 1949, Thomas Loftus Cole declared that the British Government had refused to allow the name change \"\"because the area did not comprise the nine counties of the province. We should demand our three counties [Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan] so that we could call our country Ulster, a name of which we are all proud\".\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "981885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=981885", "title": "Bjarmaland", "text": "Bjarmaland\n\nBjarmaland (also spelt \"Bjarmland\" and \"Bjarmia\"; Latin: \"Biarmia\" or \"Byarmia\"; Old English: \"Beormaland\") was a territory mentioned in Norse sagas since the Viking Age and in geographical accounts until the 16th century. The term is usually seen to have referred to the southern shores of the White Sea and the basin of the Northern Dvina River (\"Vienanjoki\" in Finnish) as well as, presumably, some of the surrounding areas. Today, those territories comprise a part of the Arkhangelsk Oblast of Russia.\n\nAccording to the \"Voyage of Ohthere\" (c. 890 CE), the Norwegian merchant Ottar (Ohthere) reported to king Alfred the Great that he had sailed for 15 days along the northern coast and then southwards, finally arriving at a great river, probably the Northern Dvina. At the estuary of the river dwelt the \"Beormas\", who unlike the nomadic Sami peoples were sedentary, and their land was rich and populous. Ohthere did not know their language but he said that it resembled the language of the Sami people. The Bjarmians told Ohthere about their country and other countries that bordered it.\n\nLater, several expeditions were undertaken from Norway to Bjarmaland. In 920, Eric Bloodaxe made a Viking expedition, as well as Harald II of Norway and Haakon Magnusson of Norway, in 1090.\n\nThe best known expedition was that of Tore Hund (Tore Dog) who together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland in 1026. They started to trade with the inhabitants and bought a great many pelts, whereupon they pretended to leave. Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god \"Jómali\". This god had a bowl containing silver on his knees, and a valuable chain around his neck. Tore and his men managed to escape from the pursuing Bjarmians with their rich booty.\n\nThe name Bjarmaland appears in Old Norse literature, possibly referring to the area where Arkhangelsk is presently situated, and where it was preceded by a Bjarmian settlement. The first appearance of the name occurs in an account of the travels of Ohthere of Hålogaland, which was written in about 890.\n\nThe name Permians is already found in the oldest document of the Rus', the \"Nestor's Chronicle\" (1000–1100). The names of other Uralic tribes are also listed including some Samoyedic peoples as well as the Veps, Cheremis, Mordvin, and Chudes.\n\nThe place-name Bjarmaland was also used later both by the German historian Adam of Bremen (11th century) and the Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) in \"Bósa saga ok Herrauðs\", reporting about its rivers flowing out to Gandvik. It is not clear if they reference the same Bjarmaland as was mentioned in the \"Voyage of Ohthere\", however. The name of the Bjarmian god \"Jómali\" is so close to the word for \"god\" in most Finnic languages that Bjarmians were likely a Finnic group. In fact, languages belonging to other language groups have never been suggested within serious research.\n\nOlaus Magnus located Bjarmaland in the Kola Peninsula in his \"Carta marina et descriptio septentrionalium terrarum\" (1539), while Johannes Schefferus (1621–1679) identified it with Lappland.\n\nBjarmians cannot be connected directly to any existing group of people living today, but it is likely that they were a separate group of Finnic speakers in the White Sea area. Toponyms and loan words in dialects in northern Russia indicate that Finnic speaking populations used to live in the area. Also Russian chronicles mention groups of people in the area associated with Finno-Ugric languages.\n\nAccordingly, many historians assume the terms \"beorm\" and \"bjarm\" to derive from the Uralic word \"perm\", which refers to \"travelling merchants\" and represents the Old Permic culture. However, some linguists consider this theory to be speculative.\n\nRecent research on the Uralic substrate in northern Russian dialects suggests that several other Uralic groups besides the Permians, lived in Bjarmaland, assumed to have included the \"Viena Karelians, Sami and Kvens\". According to Helimski, the language spoken c. 1000 AD in the northern Archangel region, which he terms \"Lop\"', was closely related to but distinct from the Sami languages proper. That would fit Ottar's account perfectly.\n\nBjarmian trade reached southeast to Bolghar, by the Volga River, where the Bjarmians also interacted with Scandinavians and Fennoscandians, who adventured southbound from the Baltic Sea area.\n\nModern historians suppose that the wealth of the Bjarmians was due to their profitable trade along the Northern Dvina, the Kama River and the Volga to Bolghar and other trading settlements in the south. Along this route, silver coins and other merchandise were exchanged for pelts and walrus tusks brought by the Bjarmians. In fact, burial sites in modern Perm Krai are the richest source of Sasanian and Sogdian silverware from Iran. Further north, the Bjarmians traded with the Sami.\n\nIt seems that the Scandinavians made some use of the Dvina trade route, in addition to the Volga trade route and Dnieper trade route. In 1217, two Norwegian traders arrived in Bjarmaland to buy pelts; one of the traders continued further south to pass to Russia in order to arrive in the Holy Land, where he intended to take part in the Crusades. The second trader who remained was killed by the Bjarmians. This caused Norwegian officials to undertake a campaign of retribution into Bjarmaland which they pillaged in 1222.\n\nThe 13th century seems to have seen the decline of the Bjarmians, who became tributaries of the Novgorod Republic. While many Slavs fled the Mongol invasion northward, to Beloozero and Bjarmaland, the displaced Bjarmians sought refuge in Norway, where they were given land around the Malangen fjord by Haakon IV of Norway in 1240. More important for the decline was probably that, with the onset of the Crusades, the trade routes had found a more westerly orientation or shifted considerably to the south.\n\nWhen the Novgorodians founded Velikiy Ustiug, in the beginning of the 13th century, the Bjarmians had a serious competitor for the trade. More and more Pomors arrived in the area during the 14th and 15th centuries, which led to the final subjugation and assimilation of the Bjarmians by the Slavs.\n\nThe collaborationist Quisling regime planned to build Norwegian colonies in Northern Russia, following a future success of Operation Barbarossa, and which were to be named \"Bjarmaland\"; but these plans never came to be.\n\n\n"}

It is the longest river of Ukraine and Belarus and the fourth-longest river in Europe. \nThe total length is approximately with a drainage basin of .\nThe river is noted for its dams and hydroelectric stations. The Dnieper is an important navigable waterway for the economy of Ukraine and is connected via the Dnieper–Bug Canal to other waterways in Europe.\n\nIn antiquity, the river was known to the Greeks as the Borysthenes and was part of the Amber Road. Arheimar, a capital of the Goths, was located on the Dnieper, according to the Hervarar saga.\n\nThe name \"Dnieper\" may be derived either from Sarmatian \"the river on the far side\" or from Scythian (Dānapr) \"deep river.\" By way of contrast, the name Dniester either derives from \"the close river\" or from a combination of Scythian \"Dānu\" (river) and \"Ister\", the Thracian name for the Dniester. Perhaps the name Dnieper (ancient \"Danapris\") is derived from Turkic \"Dynporis\" (from Turkic \"tyn\" \"quiet\" and \"boris\" \"winding\").\n\nIn the three countries through which it flows it has essentially the same name, albeit pronounced differently:\n\nThe late Greek and Roman authors called it - and respectively. Its Old East Slavic name used at the time of Kievan Rus' was or , the Huns called it \"Var\", and Bulgars - \"Buri-Chai\". The name in . The river is mentioned both by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC as (), as well as by Strabo; this name is Scythian (cf. Iranian *) and translates as \"wide land\", referring most likely to the Ukrainian steppe. . Unless Icelandic Snorre Skald Sturlasson, in Ynglinga saga, meant Danube, which is rather unlikely, wrote that this river run through Great Sviþjoð (Great Sweden), and separate Asia from Europe (also named Enea, from the eponymous Aeneas). It is, Snorre explains, in his time called Tanais, in earlier times Tanakvisl, and Vanakvisl. This is the realm of the Vanir. To the east is Asia, and the realm of the Æsir. In Snorre Sturlasons perspective ancient peoples that were either later deified, or who practiced deification of their rulers, aka apotheosis. \n\nThe total length of the river is variously given as or , of which are within Russia, are within Belarus, and are within Ukraine. Its basin covers , of which are within Ukraine, are within Belarus.\n\nThe source of the Dnieper is the sedge bogs (Akseninsky Mokh) of the Valdai Hills in central Russia, at an elevation of . For of its length, it serves as the border between Belarus and Ukraine. Its estuary, or liman, used to be defended by the strong fortress of Ochakiv.\n\nOn the Dnepr River to the south of Komarin urban-type settlement, Braghin District, Gomel Region the southern extreme point of Belarus is situated.\n\nThe Dnieper has many tributaries (up to 32,000) with 89 being rivers of 100+ km. The main ones are, from its source to its mouth:\n\nMany small direct tributaries also exist, such as, in the Kiev area, the Syrets (right bank) in the north of the city, the historically significant Lybid (right bank) passing west of the centre, and the Borshahivka (right bank) to the south.\n\nThe water resources of the Dnieper basin compose around 80% out of all Ukraine.\n\nDnieper Rapids were part of trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, first mentioned in the Kiev Chronicle. The route was probably established in the late eighth and early ninth centuries and gained significant importance from the tenth until the first third of the eleventh century. On the Dnieper the Varangians had to portage their ships round seven rapids, where they had to be on guard for Pecheneg nomads.\n\nAlong this middle flow of the Dnieper, there were nine major rapids (although some sources cite a fewer number of them), obstructing almost the whole width of the river, about 30–40 smaller rapids, obstructing only part of the river, and about 60 islands and islets.\n\nAfter Dnieper Hydroelectric Station was built in 1932, they were inundated by Dnieper Reservoir.\n\nThere are a number of canals connected to the Dnieper:\n\nThe river is part of the Quagga mussel's native range. The mussel has been accidentally introduced around the world where it has become an invasive species.\n\nFrom the mouth of the Prypiat River to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, there are six sets of dams and hydroelectric stations, which produce 10% of Ukraine's electricity.\n\nThe first constructed was the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (or DniproHES) near Zaporizhia, built in 1927–1932 with an output of 558 MW. It was destroyed during World War II, but was rebuilt in 1948 with an output of 750 MW.\n\nMajor cities, over 100,000 in population, are in bold script.\nCities and towns located on the Dnieper are listed in order from the river's source (in Russia) to its mouth (in Ukraine):\nArheimar, a capital of the Goths, was located on the Dnieper, according to the Hervarar saga.\n\nAlmost of the river is navigational (to the city of Dorogobuzh). The Dnieper is important for the transport and economy of Ukraine: its reservoirs have large ship locks, allowing vessels of up to to access as far as the port of Kiev and thus create an important transport corridor. The river is used by passenger vessels as well. Inland cruises on the rivers Danube and Dnieper have been a growing market in recent decades.\n\nUpstream from Kiev, the Dnieper receives the water of the Pripyat River. This navigable river connects to the Dnieper-Bug canal, the link with the Bug River. Historically, a connection with the Western European waterways was possible, but a weir without any ship lock near the town of Brest, Belarus, has interrupted this international waterway. Poor political relations between Western Europe and Belarus mean there is little likelihood of reopening this waterway in the near future. River navigation is interrupted each year by freezing in winter, and severe winter storms.\n\nThe River Dnieper has been a subject of chapter X of a story by Nikolai Gogol \"A Terrible Vengeance\" (1831, published in 1832 as a part of the \"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka\" short stories collection). It is considered as a classical example of description of the nature in Russian literature. The river was also described in the works of Taras Shevchenko.\n\nThe River Dnieper has been a subject for artists, great and minor, over the centuries. Major artists with works based on the Dnieper are Arkhip Kuindzhi and Ivan Aivazovsky.\n\n\nNowadays the Dnieper River suffers from anthropogenic influence and obtain numerous emissions of pollutants. The Dnieper is close to the Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant radioactive dumps (near Kamianske), and susceptible to leakages of radioactive waste. The river is also close to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station (Chernobyl Exclusion Zone) that is located next to the mouth of the Prypiat River.\n\n\n\n"}

The region is also impact by seismicity and deformation associated with the East African Rift system and the Comoros region is one of the best places in the world to study rift-hotspot interactions. The islands remain volcanically active. \n\nThe Comoros location in the Mozambique Channel is tectonically complex, due to the displacement of the Malagasarian microcontinent from the margin of the supercontinent Gondwana. \n\nFrom the Permian until the Early Jurassic, the Comoros region experienced Karoo rifting, on an northeast-southwest trend. During the Middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, an ocean basin, running north-south formed along the Davie Ridge. \n\nThe volcanoes in the Comoros date to the recent past of the Pliocene, Pleistocene and Holocene period. \nThe oldest volcano on the chain is 7.7 million years old, on Mayotte. Volcanoes are older further east. Anjouan is 3.9 million years old and Moheli is five million years old. Grande Comore is the youngest at only 10,000 years old. Some geologists have proposed that the Comoros is an example of one of 11 primary mantle plumes worldwide. \n\nThe volcanoes produce alkali olivine basalt, although small amounts of phonolite and trachytic lava have also been found. Scoria and puzzolanic tuff is known from Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli. \n\nThe East African Rift System became active 22 to 25 million years ago in the Miocene and its offshore extent is the youngest. The rift system causes seismicity, extensional deformation and created the offshore Kerimbas Graben. \nMount Karthala is an active volcano on Grande Comore, which erupted in April, 2005 and May, 2006. \n\nThere is very little mining in the Comoros, aside from the production of building material. In some cases, coral is mined to produce lime for concrete. \n"}

{"id": "13435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13435", "title": "Hydrology", "text": "Hydrology\n\nHydrology (from Greek: ὕδωρ, \"hýdōr\" meaning \"water\"; and λόγος, \"lógos\" meaning \"study\") is the scientific study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water on Earth and other planets, including the water cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability. A practitioner of hydrology is a hydrologist, working within the fields of earth or environmental science, physical geography, geology or civil and environmental engineering. Using various analytical methods and scientific techniques, they collect and analyze data to help solve water related problems such as environmental preservation, natural disasters, and water management.\n\nHydrology subdivides into surface water hydrology, groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology), and marine hydrology. Domains of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface hydrology, hydrogeology, drainage-basin management and water quality, where water plays the central role.\n\nOceanography and meteorology are not included because water is only one of many important aspects within those fields.\n\nHydrological research can inform environmental engineering, policy and planning.\n\n\n\nHydrology has been a subject of investigation and engineering for millennia. For example, about 4000 BC the Nile was dammed to improve agricultural productivity of previously barren lands. Mesopotamian towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls. Aqueducts were built by the Greeks and Ancient Romans, while the history of China shows they built irrigation and flood control works. The ancient Sinhalese used hydrology to build complex irrigation works in Sri Lanka, also known for invention of the Valve Pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs, anicuts and canals which still function.\n\nMarcus Vitruvius, in the first century BC, described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands. With adoption of a more scientific approach, Leonardo da Vinci and Bernard Palissy independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified.\n\nPioneers of the modern science of hydrology include Pierre Perrault, Edme Mariotte and Edmund Halley. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the Seine. Marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain discharge, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea.\n\nAdvances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli piezometer and Bernoulli's equation, by Daniel Bernoulli, and the Pitot tube, by Henri Pitot. The 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including Darcy's law, the Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-Poiseuille's capillary flow equation.\n\nRational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of particular importance were Leroy Sherman's unit hydrograph, the infiltration theory of Robert E. Horton, and C.V. Theis's aquifer test/equation describing well hydraulics.\n\nSince the 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially geographic information systems (GIS). (See also GIS and hydrology)\n\nThe central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the Earth through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers, or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a cycle. Water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle.\n\nThe areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between its various states, or within a given state, or simply quantifying the amounts in these states in a given region. Parts of hydrology concern developing methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water, while others concern modelling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making prediction in practical applications.\n\nGround water is water beneath Earth's surface, often pumped for drinking water. Groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) considers quantifying groundwater flow and solute transport. Problems in describing the saturated zone include the characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure and, by inference, groundwater depth (see: aquifer test). Measurements here can be made using a piezometer. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storativity and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods for characterising aquifers. There are also problems in characterising the vadose zone (unsaturated zone).\n\nInfiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water is absorbed, and the rest percolates down to the water table. The infiltration capacity, the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water, depends on several factors. The layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that is proportional to its thickness, while that plus the depth of water above the soil provides the driving force (hydraulic head). Dry soil can allow rapid infiltration by capillary action; this force diminishes as the soil becomes wet. Compaction reduces the porosity and the pore sizes. Surface cover increases capacity by retarding runoff, reducing compaction and other processes. Higher temperatures reduce viscosity, increasing infiltration.\n\nSoil moisture can be measured in various ways; by capacitance probe, time domain reflectometer or Tensiometer. Other methods include solute sampling and geophysical methods.\n\nHydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport, although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics. Surface water flow can include flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise. Methods for measuring flow once water has reached a river include the stream gauge (see: discharge), and tracer techniques. Other topics include chemical transport as part of surface water, sediment transport and erosion.\n\nOne of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and aquifers. Groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any particular location, depending on the relationship between stream stage and groundwater levels.\n\nIn some considerations, hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-atmosphere boundary and so it is important to have adequate knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation can be measured in various ways: disdrometer for precipitation characteristics at a fine time scale; radar for cloud properties, rain rate estimation, hail and snow detection; rain gauge for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall; satellite for rainy area identification, rain rate estimation, land-cover/land-use, and soil moisture, for example.\n\nEvaporation is an important part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by humidity, which can be measured by a sling psychrometer. It is also affected by the presence of snow, hail and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog. Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as transpiration\nfrom plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. A direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's evaporation pan.\n\nDetailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well as momentum, heat flux and energy budgets.\n\nRemote sensing of hydrologic processes can provide information on locations where \"in situ\" sensors may be unavailable or sparse. It also enables observations over large spatial extents. Many of the variables constituting the terrestrial water balance, for example surface water storage, soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and snow and ice, are measurable using remote sensing at various spatial-temporal resolutions and accuracies. Sources of remote sensing include land-based sensors, airborne sensors and satellite sensors which can capture microwave, thermal and near-infrared data or use lidar, for example.\n\nIn hydrology, studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds, and both dissolved and sediment material. In addition, water quality is affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and various chemical transformations that may take place. Measurements of water quality may involve either in-situ methods, in which analyses take place on-site, often automatically, and laboratory-based analyses and may include microbiological analysis.\n\n\nObservations of hydrologic processes are used to make predictions of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is \"Prediction in Ungauged Basins\" (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.\n\nBy analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. When making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur, analyses are made in terms of the return period of such events. Other quantities of interest include the average flow in a river, in a year or by season.\n\nThese estimates are important for engineers and economists so that proper risk analysis can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems. Statistical information is utilized to formulate operating rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural, industrial and residential demands.\n\nHydrological models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for understanding hydrological processes, within the general field of scientific modeling. Two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished:\n\nRecent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the behavior of hydrologic systems to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.\n\nWater movement is a significant means by which other material, such as soil, gravel, boulders or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial input to receiving waters may arise from a point source discharge or a line source or area source, such as surface runoff. Since the 1960s rather complex mathematical models have been developed, facilitated by the availability of high speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are nutrients, pesticides, total dissolved solids and sediment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He variously styled himself \"Johannes Glogoviensis\", \"Glogerus\", \"de Glogovia\" and \"Glogowita\"; but while he may have been of German extraction, he never used the name \"Schelling.\"\n\nHe began his education in a local school at the Collegiate Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. As the scion of a wealthy bourgeois family, he could continue his education at one of the best universities in that part of Europe — the University of Krakow. He embarked on his studies there, at age 16, in 1462 (the first documented date in his life). After three years he obtained his baccalaureate, and after two more — his licentiate. In 1468 he received his \"Magister Artium\" degree, the equivalent of a Doctor of Philosophy degree. This was but the beginning of a forty-year academic career. He would later also obtain a baccalaureate in theology.\n\nJohn of Głogów was an adherent of the Cologne Thomism, a philosophical school that upheld the legacy of Thomas Aquinas. But while siding in some questions with Thomas, in others he sided with Albertus Magnus.\nFrom 1468 John lectured in the Department of Arts at the University of Krakow, in all seven liberal arts. His greatest passions were grammar, Aristotelian logic, physics, physiology, and astronomy. In 1478 and 1489–90 he was dean of the department of arts. He wrote textbooks covering the complete range of philosophical knowledge at the time. His numerous extant works cover grammar, logic, philosophy, geography, astronomy and astrology. He won fame in the latter field with his \"prognostications\"; in one of these, he predicted the advent of a \"black friar\" who would bring disarray to Christianity. The friar would later be identified with the Augustinian monk, Martin Luther.\n\nJohn of Głogów wrote a work entitled \"Introductio in artem numerandi\" (Latin: Introduction to the Art of Using Numbers; 1497). He wrote commentaries to Ptolemy's \"Cosmography\". He is thought to have been one of the teachers of Nicolaus Copernicus, who enrolled at the University of Krakow in 1491.\n\nJohn authored 60 volumes, mainly astronomical and astrological. His grammar was used in Kraków schools for over a century. He is reputed to have been the first in Poland to note the discovery of America.\n\nJohn's works show little originality, but his erudition was impressive.\n\nHis first two years of lecturing had given him entree to the Kraków Academy's \"Collegium Minus\" (the Lesser College), and from 1484 he had been a member of the \"Collegium Maius\" (the Greater College). Collegiate membership entailed a semi-monastic life and the observation of an uncommonly austere regime. He devoted his income to charitable works.\n\nJohn took a special interest in students from his native Silesia, building and operating a dormitory for them. Between 1433 and 1510, 120 scholars from Głogów matriculated at Kraków—one of the largest groups, alongside those from Wrocław.\n\nJohn of Głogów, an \"ornament of Kraków University,\" died in Kraków on 11 February 1507 and was interred at St. Florian's Church.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5800712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5800712", "title": "Klonk", "text": "Klonk\n\nKlonk is a Czech national nature monument within the landscape park Český Kras which lies in the northern part of the village of Suchomasty, approximately 12 kilometres from Beroun. It is globally recognized as a geologically important location due to the presence of the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) marking the boundary between Silurian and Devonian periods. The boundary was set based on the first appearance of the graptolite \"Monograptus uniformis\" in the bed number 20. The stratotype was ratified on the 8th of February 1972 by the International Union of Geological Sciences in Montreal as the first formally accepted GSSP.\n\nThe positioning of the boundary between Silurian and Devonian has been a matter of discussion since the 19th century. The so called hercynian question was resolved only after the ratification of the GSSP in 1972. Ever since then, Klonk is one of the most popular stratigraphic profiles in the world. The monument was declared as a protected area in 1977.\n\nKlonk is a rocky slope by the right bank of Suchomastský brook. It contains two formations of upper Silurian (Kopanina formation, Požáry formation) and one formation of lower Devonian (Lochkov formation named for the nearby ' profile'). Kopanina formation is represented by calcareous shales, Požáry formation by gray tabular limestones and bioclastic limestones can be found in Lochkov formation. The boundary beds are intact, without disturbance by tectonic processes, there are no facial changes and the profile is made of one continuous sequence.\n\nThere are various paleontologically significant objects, apart from the already mentioned graptolites it is possible to find the trilobite \"Warburgella rugulosa\" typical for the base of Devonian period, the conodont \"Icriodus wolschmidti\" and the chitinozoan \"Agnochitina chlupaci\". Various other invertebrates can be found in the profile, such as bivalves, gastropods, crustaceans and brachiopods. Apart from animals, remains of terrestrial flora can also be found in the beds, namely the genus \"Cooksonia\". Soils are rather undeveloped, only close above the brook in the lower part of the slope clayey screes can be found.\n\nThere is a unique monument representing the geological boundary set by international agreement. It was built in 1977 by academic sculptor Jiří Novotný.\n\nVarious plant communities can be found at Klonk. The vicinity of the brook is characterized by human planted vegetation, for example the common alder (\"Alnus glutinosa\"), European ash (\"Fraxinus excelsior\") or Canadian poplar (\"Populus x canadensis)\", in the lower parts of the slope are the remains of scree forests with dominant sycamore. Shady limestones by the brook are a favourable location for a number of rare bryophytes, such as the craven featherwort (\"Pedinophyllum interruptu\"m) or beech feather-moss (Eurhynchium crassinervum).\n\nMost of the slope is covered by vegetation which is not native to the location – black pine (\"Pinus nigra)\", European larch (\"Larix decidua\"), black locust (\"Robinia pseudoaccacia\") and Norway spruce (\"Picea abies\"). The original community of oak-hornbeam forests (Sessile oak (\"Quercus petraea\"), common hornbeam (\"Carpinus betulus\"), field maple (\"Acer campestre\")) can only be found in the upper parts of the profile. The formerly woodless areas tend to be covered by bushes of dog-rose (\"Rosa canina\"), blackthorn (\"Prunus spinosa\") and common dogwood (\"Cornus sanguinea\"), atop the hill we may find an area of xerothermic grasslands such as spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and hairy oxytropis (\"Oxytropis pilosa\").\n\nKlonk is the nesting place for a number of birds, among others the grey wagtail (\"Motacilla cinerea\"), Eurasian sparrowhawk (\"Accipited nisus\") or the common buzzard (\"Buteo buteo\"). Most of the fauna here is represented by invertebrates, however apart from other areas of the Bohemian karst it is somewhat poorer in molluscs. Vertebrate fauna is represented by red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes)\", European badger (\"Meles meles\"), wood mouse (\"Apodemus sylvaticus\") and other, usually common species.\n\nThe goal of the protection plan is to secure the important geological profile and preserve it for future study. Klonk is mainly threatened by amateur palaeontologists who expect a rich locality, however the location is important mainly due to microfossils. Another threat is the overgrowing of vegetation, which has been successfully removed mechanically and by herbicides in the past. The removal of unwanted vegetation should also help the return of the original vegetation, which used to be strongly influenced by pasture. Plans for the future include marking of borders of the protected area in order to facilitate management, since it lies on parts of two private properties.\n\nThe profile is currently closed to the public not only to protect it, but also to avoid injuries of visitors on the steep slope.\n\nThe location is a part of 39 kilometers long geological educational trail, which also leads through adjacent areas of importance such as Lom na Kobyle, Zlatý kůň, Koda and others. Individual localities aren’t necessarily related and it is thus possible to travel only through certain segments of the trail. The trail is suitable even for cyclists and the information boards are in Czech with English abstract.\n\n"}

{"id": "48881306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48881306", "title": "List of box office records set by Star Wars: The Force Awakens", "text": "List of box office records set by Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\n\"\" is the seventh film in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, released ten years after . Co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams, the film stars Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac in new roles, with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher reprising their roles from the original trilogy which concluded in 1983. Prior to its release, the film was predicted by box office analysts to break records, citing the relative lack of competition owing to its date of release, being released in large formats such as IMAX in a high number of venues, and multi-generational appeal to both fans of the previous movies and children as success factors.\n\n\"The Force Awakens\" was released in December 2015 and went on to break multiple box office records in various markets. The film set the worldwide records for the highest-grossing opening weekend and the fastest to gross $1 billion. In its domestic market of the United States and Canada, it set the records for the highest-grossing film, opening day, first through third weekends, and single calendar month, as well as the fastest cumulative grosses through $900 million. In other markets, it became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom and set opening weekend records in several countries including the UK, Germany, Australia, and Russia.\n\nA large proportion of the records were set in the domestic market of the United States and Canada. A comparative lack of \"Star Wars\" nostalgia and unfavourable currency exchange rates were identified as factors limiting the film's box office performance in other markets, while repeat viewings during the December holiday season boosted sales in the domestic market. A compounding factor is that whereas the US and Canada box office is closely tracked by sites such as Box Office Mojo and The Numbers, the same is not true for other box office territories. Many of the records set by the film are listed below. Data on the previous record and records that have since been surpassed are presented where available and applicable. All grosses are given in unadjusted US dollars, except where noted otherwise.\n\nWorldwide, the film set records for the highest-grossing opening weekend and the fastest to gross $1 billion, as well as several IMAX records.\n\nIn the domestic market, the film grossed more money faster than any previous film. It set several records for specific time frames and days of the week, including ones that were still records when adjusting for inflation. Many of the records it broke were set by \"Jurassic World\", which was released six months prior in June 2015.\nOutside of the United States and Canada market, the film set opening records in one form or another in 30 different markets. The United Kingdom and Ireland market saw several records surpassed, including the record for the highest-grossing film of all time. Data on precise figures, previous record holders, and surpassed records is limited due to the absence of box office record trackers for these markets.\n"}

{"id": "21772870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21772870", "title": "List of mammals of South America", "text": "List of mammals of South America\n\nThis is a list of the native wild mammal species recorded in South America. South America's terrestrial mammals fall into three distinct groups. The marsupials and xenarthrans are 'old-timers', their ancestors having been present on the continent since at least the very early Cenozoic Era. During the early Cenozoic, South America's only land connection was to Antarctica, so it was effectively cut off from most of the world; as the fragments of Gondwana continued to separate, this connection was lost, leaving South America an island continent. Caviomorph rodents and monkeys arrived as 'waif dispersers' by rafting across the Atlantic from Africa in the Eocene epoch, 35 million or more years ago. All the remaining nonflying mammals of South America are recent arrivals, having migrated from North America via Central America during the past seven million years as part of the Great American Interchange; this invasion, which peaked around three million years ago, was made possible when the formation of the volcanic Isthmus of Panama bridged North and South America. The newcomers out-competed and drove to extinction many unique mammals that had evolved during South America's long period of isolation, as well as some species from other classes (e.g., terror birds).\n\nSouth America suffered another major loss of mammal species in the Quaternary extinction event, which started around 12500 cal BP, at roughly the time of arrival of Paleoindians, and may have lasted up to several thousand years. At least 37 genera of mammals were eliminated, including most of the megafauna. While South America currently has no megaherbivore species weighing more than 1000 kg, prior to this event it had a menagerie of about 25 of them (consisting of gomphotheres, camelids, ground sloths, glyptodonts, and toxodontids – 75% of these being 'old-timers'), dwarfing Africa's present and recent total of 6.\n\nAnthropogenic climate change and the damage to its ecosystems resulting from the rapid recent growth of the human population pose a further threat to South America's biodiversity.\n\nThe list consists of those species found in the nations or overseas territories of continental South America (including their island possessions, such as the Galápagos), as well as in Trinidad and Tobago and the Falkland Islands; Panama is not included. As of May 2012, the list contains 1331 species, 340 genera, 62 families and 15 orders. Of the taxa from nonflying, nonmarine groups (992 species, 230 genera, 40 families and 12 orders), 'old-timers' comprise 14% of species, 15% of genera, 20% of families and 42% of orders; African immigrants make up 38% of species, 30% of genera, 40% of families and 17% of orders; North American invaders constitute 49% of species 55% of genera, 40% of families and 50% of orders. At the order level, the 'old-timers' are overrepresented because of their ancient local origins, while the African immigrants are underrepresented because of their 'sweepstakes' mode of dispersal.\n\nOf the species, 9 are extinct, 29 are critically endangered, 64 are endangered, 111 are vulnerable, 64 are near-threatened, and 255 are data-deficient. Mammal species presumed extinct since AD 1500 (nine or ten cases) are included. Domestic species (e.g., the guinea pig, alpaca, and llama) and introduced species are not listed.\n\nNOTE: this list is inevitably going to be incomplete, since new species are continually being recognized via discovery or reclassification. Places to check for missing species include the list, including recently removed entries, and the species listings in the articles for mammalian genera, especially those of small mammals such as rodents or bats.\n\nThe following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the IUCN; those on the left are used here, those in the second column in some other articles:\n\nThe IUCN status of all listed species except bats was last updated during the period from March to June 2009; bats were updated in September 2009.\n\nThe infraclass Metatheria includes all living and extinct marsupials, but also includes some related extinct orders of mammals that are no longer considered marsupials, such as Sparassodonta. At least six families of sparassodonts lived in South America prior to the interchange, dominating the niches for large mammalian carnivores.\n\nMarsupials are a collection of pouched mammals that was once more widely distributed. Today they are found primarily in isolated or formerly isolated continents of Gondwanan origin. South America's 22 extant genera compares with , 1 in North America north of Mexico, 52 in Australia, and 2 in Sulawesi. South American marsupials are thought to be ancestral to those of Australasia.\n\nDidelphimorphia is the order of common opossums of the Western Hemisphere. Opossums probably diverged from the basic South American marsupials in the late Cretaceous or early Paleocene. They are small to medium-sized marsupials, about the size of a large house cat, with a long snout and prehensile tail.\n\n\nThere are six extant species of shrew opossum. They are small shrew-like marsupials confined to the Andes.\n\n\nThe monito del monte of Chile and Argentina is the only extant member of its family and the only surviving member of an ancient order, Microbiotheria. It appears to be more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other Neotropic marsupials; this is a reflection of the South American origin of all Australasian marsupials.\n\n\nSirenia is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps, and marine wetlands. All four species are endangered. They evolved about 50 million years ago, and their closest living relatives are elephants. The manatees are the only extant afrotherians in the Americas. However, a number proboscid species, some of which survived until the arrival of Paleoindians, once inhabited the region. Those that reached South America have usually been classified as gomphotheres, but sometimes instead as elephantids.\n\n\nThe armadillos are small mammals with a bony armored shell. All 21 extant species are found in South America, where they originated. Their much larger relatives, the pampatheres and glyptodonts, once lived in North and South America but became extinct following the appearance of humans.\n\n\nThe order Pilosa is confined to the Americas and contains the tree sloths and anteaters (which include the tamanduas). All 5 extant genera and 9 of 10 extant species are present in South America, the ancestral home of the group. (The exception is the pygmy three-toed sloth, endemic to an island off Panama.) Numerous ground sloths, some of which reached the size of elephants, were once present in both North and South America, as well as on the Antilles. (Some west coastal South American forms had even evolved into marine sloths.) All of these went extinct following the arrival of humans. Extant tree sloths fall into two groups that are not closely related, and which do not form a clade; two-toed sloths are much more closely related to some extinct ground sloths than to three-toed sloths.\n\n\nThe order Primates includes the lemurs, monkeys, and apes, with the latter category including humans. It is divided into four main groupings: strepsirrhines, tarsiers, monkeys of the New World (parvorder Platyrrhini), and monkeys and apes of the Old World. South America's 20 genera of nonhuman primates compares with , , 23 in Africa and 19 in Asia. All South American monkeys are believed to be descended from ancestors that rafted over from Africa about 25 million years ago in a single dispersal event.\n\n\nRodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continually and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small, although the capybara can weigh up to 45 kg (100 lb). South America's rodent fauna today is largely an outgrowth of two spectacularly fortunate ancient \"sweepstakes\" dispersal events, each of which was followed by explosive diversification. Caviomorphs, the first rodents to reach the continent, are believed to have washed ashore after rafting across the Atlantic from Africa over 30 million years ago. More recently, ancestral sigmodontine rodents apparently island-hopped from Central America 5 million or more years ago, prior to the formation of the Panamanian land bridge. These two groups now comprise 36 and 60%, respectively, of all South American rodent species. The corresponding figures are 10 and 27% , 2% and 10% , 0.5 and 3% for North America north of Mexico, and 72 and 27% for recent endemic Caribbean rodents. Conversely, sciurids make up 3% of rodents in South America, 8% in Central America, 15% in Mexico and 31% in North America north of Mexico, while castorimorphs are 1%, 16%, 26% and 28%, respectively. Sciurids are absent from South America's southern cone, while castorimorphs are only present in northwest South America (Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador). Illustrating the advantage of gaining a head start in colonizing a new land mass, sigmodontine rodents comprise 99.5% of all cricetid rodents in South America, but only 42% in Central America, 17% in Mexico and 7% in North America north of Mexico.\n\n\n\n\nThe lagomorphs comprise two families, Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Though they can resemble rodents, and were classified as a superfamily in that order until the early 20th century, they have since been considered a separate order. They differ from rodents in a number of physical characteristics, such as having four incisors in the upper jaw rather than two. South America's meager lagomorph diversity (6 species compared to 18 for North America north of Mexico) reflects their recent arrival and failure (so far) to diversify much. Only the tapeti is present south of northern South America; lagomorphs are absent from most of South America's southern cone.\n\n\nEulipotyphlans are insectivorous mammals. Shrews and solenodons closely resemble mice, hedgehogs carry spines, while moles are stout-bodied burrowers. In South America, shrews are only found in the north (Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru), a legacy of their relatively recent immigration to the continent by way of Central America (where shrew species are ). Moles are not found in the Americas south of northern Mexico.\n\n\nThe bats' most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in the world naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are over 260 species of carnivorans, the majority of which feed primarily on meat. They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition. South America is notable for its diversity of canids, having in spite of their relatively brief history there. South America's felid diversity is also greater than that of North America north of Mexico, while its mustelid diversity is comparable and its mephitid and ursid diversities are lower. Its procyonid diversity is somewhat less than , the center of the family's recent evolution. The diversification of canids and felids in South America was partly a consequence of the inability of the continent's native avian and metatherian predators to compete effectively following the Great American Interchange.\n\n\nThe odd-toed ungulates are browsing and grazing mammals. They are usually large to very large, and have relatively simple stomachs and a large middle toe. Following the interchange with North America, South America's odd-toed ungulates included equids of genus \"Equus\" as well as tapirs. Equids died out in both North and South America around the time of the first arrival of humans, while tapirs died out in most of North America but survived in Central and South America. South America also once had a great diversity of ungulates of native origin, but these dwindled after the interchange with North America, and disappeared entirely following the arrival of humans. Sequencing of collagen from fossils of one recently extinct species each of notoungulates and litopterns has indicated that these orders comprise a sister group to the perissodactyls. If, as some evidence suggests, perissodactyls originated in India, both ungulate groups may have been of Gondwanan origin, despite being laurasiatheres.\n\n\nThe weight of even-toed ungulates is borne about equally by the third and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 noncetacean artiodactyl species, including many that are of great economic importance to humans. South America's belies their relatively recent arrival. The presence of camelids in South America but not North America today is ironic, given that they have a 45-million-year-long history in the latter continent (where they originated), and only a 3 million year history in the former.\n\n\nThe infraorder Cetacea includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater. Their closest extant relatives are the hippos, which are artiodactyls, from which cetaceans descended; cetaceans are thus also artiodactyls.\n\n\n\n\nList of mammals of Greenland\n\nList of mammals of Mexico\n\nList of mammals of Antarctica\n"}

{"id": "57367309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57367309", "title": "List of rulers of Liptako", "text": "List of rulers of Liptako\n\nLiptako is a historic region in West Africa which included parts of modern-day Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali. Control of the area changed hands between several regional ethnic groups, before the Gurma people established the kingdom of Koala. In the early 19th century, they were in turn overthrown by the Fula. Although a second kingdom of Koala was established to the south of the first, it never reclaimed significant regional power.\n\nThe Fula established Liptako as an Islamic state and an emirate of the Sokoto Caliphate. The emir of Liptako was its ruler until the French colonial occupation began in 1897, but retained political power until the position was dissolved by the post-colonial Upper Volta government in 1963. The emir now serves as a tribal chief on a more local scale.\n\nInformation about the early history of the region that would become Liptako is scant, and no dates or records of rulership are known to exist. The area is believed to have changed hands between various ethnic groups, including the Dogon, the Kurumba, and possibly also the Bambara, Bissa, and Mossi.\n\nBeginning in the late 15th century, the region was ruled by the Songhai as part of their empire. According to the \"Tarikh al-Sudan\", the first king of the Songhai Empire, Sonni Ali died during an expedition in the area in 1492. The chronicle later names Arbinda-Farma Bokar, a son of a daughter of Askia Mohammad I, as having influence in the region in 1549–1550, but does not ascribe any particular title to him. After the collapse of the Songhai Empire in 1591, the Kurumba probably reestablished control over the region.\n\nAround 1718, the Gurma people took control of the area from the Kurumba. Balibagini, a member of a cadet branch of the royal family of Nungu, established the first kingdom of Koala, taking the title \"bedo\" (pl. \"bediba\"). The community that served as the capital, also named Koala, was not the present-day town of that name, but a now-lost settlement in the west of the Liptako region. In establishing his kingdom, Balibagini warred with the Kurumba, pushing them west toward Aribinda, and with the Fula, who were forbidden from the new kingdom. When his brother, Udan Jari, died, Balibagini annexed the territory he had controlled as well. The territory he carved out was larger than later Liptako, stretching as far east as the Niger River.\n\nPaamba, the fifth \"bedo\", lifted Balibagini's edict prohibiting a Fula presence in Koala, setting the stage for the kingdom's eventual fall. During the reign of the eighth king, Yencaari, a dispute over inheritance and taxation in the Fula village of Selbo escalated a rebellion that ultimately forced the Gurma to flee to the south. Yencaari was killed during the conflict, with one local account suggesting that he was injured in battle, succumbing to his wounds in Bani after the Gurma exodus. Yencaari's son and heir-apparent, Umaru, was also either killed or disgraced in battle, although he may have led the Gurma south after their defeat.\n\nAfter a brief period of political turmoil, a survivor of the Koala ruling family, Kalinkuma, established a new town of Koala (at its present location) as the capital of a second kingdom of that name. Although the title of \"bedo\" was retained by the local traditional ruler even after the French occupation of the region, this second kingdom occupied a substantially smaller territory and had relatively little regional influence.\n\n\nSome members of the traditionally pastoral Fula people began to settle in the Liptako area as early as the 15th century. In the early 19th century, escalating tensions between the Islamized Fula and the ruling Gurma led to a jihad, inspired by Usman dan Fodio and the Fulani War. This conflict destroyed Koala, largely pushed the Gurma out of the region, and established Fula rule. The newly-established Liptako was not fully independent, but rather an emirate of the Sokoto Caliphate, administered through an intermediate suzerain in Gwandu. Nevertheless, distance and local sentiment permitted Liptako's emir considerable local control. The emirship was a hereditary office with a traditional order of succession defined by custom. The right of succession belonged to a male-descent child of the earliest surviving familial generation; within a generation, children of older brothers had precedence over the children of younger brothers, and older brothers were preferred over their younger siblings. However, not all successions passed strictly in this manner.\n\nThe French occupied the Liptako capital of Dori on 30 April 1897, during the reign of Bokari Sori, but did not remove the emir, and largely permitted the precolonial political system to continue. In 1963, Maurice Yaméogo, the first president of the independent Republic of Upper Volta, formally disbanded the emirate. Nassourou continued to use the title, which remained a source of significant local respect and political influence. Currently, the emir of Liptako serves as a tribal chief for the Fula in Séno Province.\n\nFollowing the death of Aamadu Iisa, a succession crisis occurred when Bokari Sori and Buhaari Iisa both claimed the emirship. In 1891, French military officer Parfait-Louis Monteil visited Liptako amidst the crisis and entered into a treaty with Buhaari's son Boubakar, believing Buhaari to be the eventual next emir. In 1895, colonial administrator Georges Destenave traveled to Liptako as part of an effort to confirm the status of French treaties with various local authorities and was informed that Buhaari was dead, having never become emir.\n\nAfter Nassourou Abdoulaye Dicko's death in 2010, representatives of the family selected the late emir's brother, Boubacar Bassirou Dicko, to succeed him in a ceremony on 10 December 2010. Four days later, a council of Liptako village chiefs elected Nassourou's son, Ousame Amirou Dicko, to the same office. The disputed succession was eventually resolved in favor of Ousame.\n\nThe emirs of Liptako claim descent from a semi-legendary migrant named Birmaari Saala Paate, who was said to have followed a wandering bull from Macina, in modern-day Mali, to Liptako.\n\n\n\n"}

The administrative services of the executive branch of the government are regulated by the \"National Government Organisation Act, BE 2534 (1991)\" (พระราชบัญญัติระเบียบบริหารราชการแผ่นดิน พ.ศ. 2534). Under this Act, the services are divided into three levels: central, provincial and local.\n\nThe central government (ราชการส่วนกลาง) consists of ministries, bureaus, and departments (กระทรวงทบวงกรม \"krasuang tha-buang krom\").\n\nEach of the ministries (กระทรวง \"krasuang\") and bureaus (ทบวง \"tha-buang\") is led by a minister (รัฐมนตรี \"ratthamontri\") who is a member of the Council of Ministers (คณะรัฐมนตรี \"Khana Ratthamontri\"). A bureau may be an independent agency with the same status as a ministry or may be subject to a ministry. Currently, there are no bureaus.\n\nThe ministries and bureaus are divided into departments (กรม \"krom\"), inter alia. Each department is led by a director general (; ).\n\nThere is a central government agency called Office of the Prime Minister (; ). It is led by the prime minister (; ) and bears ministerial status.\n\nThere are also independent central government agencies. These agencies are not under any ministry, bureau, or department, but are directly subject to the prime minister. They are:\n\n\nThe provincial government (ราชการส่วนภูมิภาค) consists of provinces (จังหวัด \"changwat\"). there were 76 provinces.\n\nEach province is led by a governor (ผู้ว่าราชการจังหวัด \"phu wa ratchakan changwat\") and is divided into districts (อำเภอ \"amphoe\"). , there were 878 districts throughout the country. In each province, there is one capital district (อำเภอเมือง \"amphoe mueang\"). For example, the capital district of Chiang Mai Province is Mueang Chiang Mai District (อำเภอเมืองเชียงใหม่ \"Amphoe Mueang Chiang Mai\"). The exception is Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, where both the province and the capital district share the same name.\n\nEach district is led by a district chief (นายอำเภอ \"nai amphoe\"). \n\nUntil 2007, some provinces might include minor districts (กิ่งอำเภอ \"king amphoe\"). A minor district was established in large areas where the small number of residents did not warrant the formation of a district. Each minor district was led by a district clerk (ปลัดอำเภอ \"palat amphoe\").\n\nGovernors, district chiefs, and district clerks are appointed by the central government.\n\nLocal government (ราชการส่วนท้องถิ่น) consists of two types: ordinary and special.\n\nOrdinary local government (ราชการส่วนท้องถิ่นรูปแบบทั่วไป) is of two forms.\n\n\nVillage chiefs are elected by local citizens. The chiefs of the villages in a subdistrict elect one of their number to also serve as the chief of the subdistrict. According to the \"Municipalities Act, BE 2496 (1953)\", when the new form of local government is adopted in any locality, the Minister of Interior may revoke the old form for that locality.\n\nA city municipality is established in an area where there are at least 50,000 citizens, a town municipality, in an area where there are at least 10,000 citizens, and a subdistrict municipality, in any other area. The government of each municipality is divided into two branches: the executive branch led by a mayor (นายกเทศมนตรี \"nayok thetsamontri\") and the legislative branch led by a municipal council (สภาเทศบาล \"sapha thetsaban\"). The mayors and the municipal councillors are directly elected by the local citizens.\n\nAs for an administrative organisation, the government is also divided into two branches: the executive branch led by an administrative organisation chief (นายกองค์การบริหาร \"nayok ong kan borihan\") and the legislative branch led by an administrative organisation council (สภาองค์การบริหาร \"sapha ong kan borihan\"). The administrative organisation chiefs and councillors are directly elected by the local citizens.\n\nSpecial local government (ราชการส่วนท้องถิ่นรูปแบบพิเศษ) is established in some significant localities. Currently, this type of local government is found in:\n\n\nThe governments of Bangkok and Pattaya are divided into two branches: executive and legislative.\n\nBangkok: the executive branch is led by the Governor of Bangkok (ผู้ว่าราชการกรุงเทพมหานคร \"Phu Wa Ratchakan Krung Thep Maha Nakhon\") and the legislative branch is led by the Council of Bangkok (สภากรุงเทพมหานคร \"Sapha Krung Thep Maha Nakhon\"). The territory of Bangkok is divided into districts (เขต \"khet\"). There are now 50 districts. The government of each district is also divided into two branches: the executive branch led by a district director (ผู้อำนวยการเขต \"phu amnuai kan khet\") and the legislative branch led by a district council (สภาแขวง \"sapha khwaeng\"). Each district is then divided into subdistricts (แขวง \"khwaeng\"). There are now 180 subdistricts. Each subdistrict is led by a subdistrict head (หัวหน้าแขวง \"hua na khwaeng\").\n\nThe Governor of Bangkok and the Councillors of Bangkok are directly elected by the citizens of Bangkok. The district directors and the subdistrict heads are appointed by the Governor of Bangkok from amongst the Bangkok metropolitan officers (ข้าราชการกรุงเทพมหานคร), whilst the district councillors are directly elected by the local citizens.\n\nPattaya:, the executive branch is led by the Mayor of Pattaya (นายกเมืองพัทยา \"Nayok Mueang Phatthaya\") and the legislative branch is led by the Council of Pattaya (สภาเมืองพัทยา \"Sapha Mueang Phatthaya\"). The Mayor of Pattaya and the Councillors of Pattaya are directly elected by the citizens of Pattaya.\n\nThere is a plan to adopt the special local government in Chiang Mai, which would turn Chiang Mai Province into Chiang Mai Metropolis (เชียงใหม่มหานคร \"Chiang Mai Maha Nakhon\"). The plan was proposed to the National Assembly by the citizens of Chiang Mai in October 2013. However, it is regarded by the conservatives as separatism.\n\nThere is also a plan to establish Mae Sot City (นครแม่สอด \"Nakhon Mae Sot\") in Tak Province. The city would cover the current areas of Mae Sot City Municipality (เทศบาลนครแม่สอด) and Tha Sai Luat Subdistrict Municipality (เทศบาลตำบลท่าสายลวด). The plan would also result in the dissolution of both municipalities.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century until 1932 there was an additional subdivision called \"monthon\" (มณฑล, circle), with some of the larger monthons subdivided into \"boriwen\" (บริเวณ, area). The first provinces were named \"mueang\" (เมือง, township) as those developed from the historical city-states. There were both \"mueang\" directly dependent from Bangkok (thus similar to the modern province), as well as \"mueang\" under the supervision of a more powerful neighbouring \"mueang\", or part of the semi-independent tributary states. In 1906 the transition to the term \"changwat\" started, which was finalised in 1916.\n\nAfter the abolition of the \"monthon\", a new subdivision named \"region\" (ภาค, \"Phak\") was established. At first there were four regions with changing outlines. These were changed into nine regions in 1951. In 1956 these regions were abolished as well.\n\nA former municipal level were the \"sukhaphiban\" (sanitation districts, สุขาภิบาล), which were mostly responsible for sanitary tasks like waste management. The administrative level was created in 1908, in May 1999 all were converted into subdistrict municipalities.\n\nUntil 2007 minor districts (\"king amphoe\") were a special kind of districts, still partially a subordinate of another district. Usually newly created districts at first became minor districts and were upgraded to full districts after a few years. On 24 August 2007 all 81 minor districts were upgraded to full districts, despite many still not meeting the prerequisites for becoming a full district.\n\nBangkok and its vicinity (ปริมณฑล, pari monthon), including five adjacent provinces are referred to as Bangkok Metropolitan Region - BMR ().\n\nThere are several definitions of regions in Thailand. The one used by the National Statistical Office defines four regions - north, northeast, south and central.\n\nLos Angeles, California is sometimes jokingly referred to as \"The 78th Province\" of Thailand, because the city has the highest Thai population of any city outside of Thailand (roughly 100,000).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39339867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39339867", "title": "Pampa Grande", "text": "Pampa Grande\n\nPampa Grande is an archaeological site located in the Lambayeque Valley, in northern Peru, situated on the south shore of the Chancay River. It is located to the east of the city of Chiclayo.\n\nThis ancient city belonged both to Cupisnique and to Chavin cultures, and the earliest dates are around 600 BC. Later, during the Moche period (600-700 A.D.), the city was a major regional capital. Another famous Moche site, Sipan, is located only about 10 km west from Pampa Grande along the Chancay River valley.\n\nPampa Grande is located about 54 km inland from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDuring the time of the Moche occupation at Pampa Grande the Lambayeque Valley generally had a moderate climate year round. The average temperature measures about 22 degrees C and ranges from 10 degrees C to 35 degrees C depending on the seasons. In the winter months from June to September the El Nino current picks up and brings torrential rains and wind changes to coastal areas. However, these rains rarely hit the valley, as the annual precipitation levels are minimal. The rainy season lasts from February to April. The Chancay River is filled to capacity during the rainy season.\n\nConsiderable rains must have hit the site since the Moche period, because the architecture of the site, including the main pyramid, has been severely eroded.\n\nDuring the Early Horizon Period (900-200 BC):\n\n\nThe Early Intermediate Period (200 BC-600 AD)\n\n\nThe Middle Horizon (600-1000 AD)\n\n\nThe Late Intermediate Period (1000-1450 AD)\n\n\nThe Late Horizon\n\n\nThere is little evidence left from pre-Moche II phases. If there were any significant evidence left behind, much of it would have been destroyed by the later Moche civilization phases. According to Shimada, the “post-Moche V developments in the region remain largely unknown.” This makes Moche phases II-V the most examined periods.\n\nThe site was excavated with a large team of students and professionals for the Royal Ontario Museum Project starting in 1973, and continuing through 1975. Dr. Kent C. Day, Izumi Shimada, Melody Shimada, Andrew Ignatieff, Martha Anders, Hans Knapp, John Haas, Manuel Arboleda, and Juan Cabanillas all participated in the excavation from 1973-1975.\n\nMany of these participants helped in some way in the interpretation of the site as well. In addition, Terry D’Altroy, Christine Krueger, Ciro Hurtado, and Christopher B. Donnan were also involved in the interpretations at Pampa Grande.\n\nStarting in 2004, Llana Johnson worked at the site for her dissertation at UCLA.\n\nDuring the late Moche V period, Pampa Grande became one of the largest Moche sites anywhere, and occupied the area of more than 400 ha.\n\nStarting around 600 AD, new constructions were laid out and built in a short period of time, including an enormous ceremonial complex. At the heart of the complex is Huaca Grande, also known locally as \"Huaca Fortaleza\"—the tallest ceremonial platform in Peru.\n\nThe villages surrounding the urban center at Pampa Grande were likely small agricultural villages, which farmed for themselves and the Moche elite. Elaborate irrigation systems leading to the valley floors that stemmed from nearby rivers supported the rural farmers and led to intensification in agricultural production. Another large landscape change was the mound of Huaca Grande. Huaca Grande, a large pyramid structure, was constructed with adobe bricks. It arose as the Pampa Grande Elite gained political and economic power.\n\nMacrobotanical remains show us that the non-urban farmers cultivated domestic plants such as beans, maize, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, chili pepper, gourd, algorrobo and cotton. Storage facilities “revealed pollen spores from the fern and monocot families. These types of plants were likely used for medicinal purposes and/or as animal fodder”. The paleobotanical collection also has several wild species that could have been used for “fuel, building materials, animal fodder, medicine, and herbs”.\nSeveral types of lithic artifacts were discovered in and around Pampa Grande. The stone adzes, which were bifacially flaked with appendages in order to be hafted to wooden handles, were used for tilling and harvesting. Batáns, large grinding stones, and manos, which were smaller hand-held grinding stones, were found in most every household. (Johnson, 2010: 119-120) In addition, scarce amounts of copper were found. Including fishing net weights, needles and fishhooks.\n\nThere seems to be little evidence of hunting within Pampa Grande, as most of the 1,200 animal bones found were from domesticated animals. And the tools were primarily agricultural focused with the exception of butchering tools. However, there were nearby Moche civilizations that hunted for sea lions, deer and snails. In addition to domestic animal remains, marine shells, and guinea pig feces were found.\n\nThe many faunal remains include, but are not limited to, marine invertebrate and vertebrate remains like shellfish, bony fish, and sea lion. Also terrestrial vertebrate including dog, guinea pig, iguana, llama and alpaca and rodents were uncovered. There were “extensive marine species, large quantities of camelid (alpaca and llama), and moderate quantities of small terrestrial mammals”.\n\nIn the Late Moche Period households lost autonomy and became reliant on elites and specialists, and integrated into the complex urban economy. “As agriculture intensifies and populations become concentrated in cities, the transmission of valuable goods and land increases in importance as resources become more limited”. This led to specialization. Specialized items such as ceramics, figurines, beads, ornaments and spindle whirls were traded among urbanites at Pampa Grande.\n\nExotic foods such as “white-tailed deer, sea lion, coca leaves, aji peppers, and many types of fruits” are found rarely in domestic contexts, but appear in elite households, which suggests the powerful had greater trading capability. However, there seems to have been a steady flow of shellfish from the nearby Pacific Ocean. High quality polychrome vessels have been found that source to the Wari Empire. This civilization was located in the Central Andean Highlands.\n\nWe see specialization occur for two specific reasons at Pampa Grande. Johnson explains that, “agricultural intensification around Pampa Grande, coupled with periodic droughts, left much of the valley without sufficient water for agriculture. This resulted in a large population in need of work and subsistence goods, thus requiring valley inhabitants to aggregate at Pampa Grande and find specialized non-agricultural work”. In addition to this, “standardization is a good indicator of specialization because it reflects the producers’ concern with efficiency and homogeneity.\n\nAt Pampa Grande there were numerous elite-sponsored workshops, which had minimal evidence of habitation. These workshops had controlled access, so as to keep the materials inside of them. Though many of the specialists in these workshops were commoners, elites also took part in craft production. Family and households also produced specialized goods, but on a much less controlled basis. Family units often organized their labor by kinship relations and operated in independent and domestic compounds. Such workshops were more loosely monitored by local authorities. And often, only checked up on when goods were expected as tribute to the elite.\n\nUrban households would have been reliant on economic and social relationships in order to acquire specialized household utilitarian products. The production of material and agricultural goods seems to have been gendered. The “female roles in the household included more daily and maintenance activities related to child rearing and food preparation, while males engaged in more specialized activities related to the production of craft and agricultural items”. We see standardization, by using molds, among many of the vessels, including: “stirrup-spout bottles figurines, rattles, whistles, and trumpets. Many storage vessels were made with out molds as well, however by the later Moche phases, there was a significant increase in vessels produced using molds.\n\nThere are two types of structures found at Pampa Grande, the elite Huacas and the common housing and occupational “Units”. Huacas are earthen pyramids made from large adobe bricks built during the Middle Moche Period. They served as spaces for public and private rituals and housed the elite. The tops of the Huacas were platforms standing over public plazas. Huaca Grande is the largest Huaca located at Pampa Grande out of twenty-two Huacas. The units can be divided into two groups. In general, there are occupational units on the outer edge of the urban area and the residential units placed all around the site.\n\nThe urban center had many residential compounds, both for the higher-class elite and the lower class. The high-class compounds were built with higher quality materials and craftsmanship and commonly have high privacy walls that distinguish them.\nThe materials used in construction at Pampa Grande seem to be the locally accessible materials rather than culturally ideal materials. The adobe bricks were basic sun-dried mud bricks that are found as one of the main architectural components. In addition to adobe brick, quadrangular rock was a common building material. For mortar, many techniques were used. Often found, there was dirt interior with clay on the exterior, or mud with fragments of utilitarian ceramic were used as mortar. Walls were also “constructed using a core-and-veneer masonry style. This architectural style is common at Moche sites and consists of rubble interior surrounded by nicely-shaped stones that form an external veneer”. For elite housing, large pieces of rock would have been carried from a nearby source on the backs of camelids (alpaca, llamas) and cut to size as construction took place. This technique was also used in constructing the Huacas.\n\nAs in most cases, the architecture at Pampa Grande developed as the society developed socially, economically, and politically. At the time of the Late Moche Period, larger urban areas developed around the “necks of some valleys in order to control access to water”. The earlier household units were constructed of multiple differing structures with different functions. As time went by the more common household unit was an apartment style building divided internally for different functionality.\n\nEthnicity, status, wealth and religious ideologies can often be determined from decoration on utilitarian and elaborate, valuable items. “However, very little evidence for the presence of different ethnic groups has been found at Moche cities during any time period”. The “indicators of socio-economic status are household size, architectural design, and household artifacts”. As mentioned above, more elite classes had higher quality materials and better craftsmanship in their household units as a way of differentiating between elite and common people. This included more durable materials for higher walls and foundation, and core-and-veneer masonry style of construction. This is contrasting to the mortar used by the non-elites made of dirt and clay. Elite dwellings also have additional patios and extra living space in comparison to common dwellings. These extra spaces are often used for exclusive or special economic and social events and activities.\n\nThe most commonly found artifacts at Pampa Grande are ceramic artifacts. The difference between elite and common housing units can be determined by the type of ceramics found in the unit as well as the architecture of the unit. Utilitarian ceramics make up the majority of the ceramic artifacts. These utilitarian pieces include the common “large storage vessels (also referred to as tinajas, paicas, or urns), ollas (short-neck/neckless vessels with large openings), jars (globular vessels with restricted openings and short to tall rims), and to a lesser extent fineware ceramics, such as floreros (flaring-rim bowls), and stirrup-spout bottles (Gayoso and Gamarra 2005). Other vessel forms include single-spout and handle bottles, dippers, bowls, and plates”.\n\nMany of these ceramic artifacts were mass-produced by using molds. However, it was not until the population at Pampa Grande developed over time that the mass-production of molded ceramics became popular. Utilitarian, mass-produced storage ceramics are often associated with lower economic class. Face-neck jars are storage vessels recovered from all over, which is one way we can tell they are signifiers of lower socio-economic class. These jars frequently depict a human or animal face on one side. However, a small number of the face-neck jars are made without molds and are stamped with the face design into the neck. This is would be an example of higher quality but common utilitarian vessel. “Higher quality, labor-intensive vessels such as painted stirrup spouts and high burnished blackware bowls” are associated with higher socio-economic status and are found less often at Pampa Grande.\n\nBecause of Pampa Grande’s geographical location, at the neck of the river in the valley, centralization of power was important to maintain control over the water source in order to protect against drought. As agricultural intensification led to drought, Pampa Grande inhabitants needed new forms of work that a new bureaucratic government helped establish and oversee. However, speculations on governmental and elite structures are generalized and talked about as the Moche elite, and no specific claims are made about Pampa Grande as a single site.\n\nAfter the new system of production was created, the elite members managed different specialists directly, or indirectly. Household hierarchies were based on kin relationships. There was significant ancestor worship sponsored by the state.\n\nThe basis on which elites rise or are put in power are never discussed in any of the sources.\n\nArchitecture is one way to differentiate between socio-economic classes. The Huaca living quarters and the common unit living quarters are one obvious and extreme difference in architecture that shows the socio-economic class difference. The pyramids, like Huaca Grande, were signs of power for the Moche. They were constructed quickly with a timesaving method in order to have immediate power and likely put poor people to work and subordinate them. Within the Huacas there were smaller rooms that likely served at living and cooking quarters for the servants to the elite. Such social segregation is evidence of oppression or coercion of the poor inhabitants.\n\nThere is debate about how rigid the social class boundaries were at Pampa Grande. Izumi Shimada believes there were strictly four social classes; “(1) the highest class of elites, religious specialists, and administrators, (2) elites that played key roles in the procurement and allocation of valuable raw materials and production of wealth items, (3) supervisors and managers of production activities with a certain degree of social mobility, and (4) the lowest and largest class of laborers who commuted to work in the fields and craft production workshops”. IIana Johnson, on the other hand, concludes that there were much less rigid social boundaries. She sites the evidence of differing architectural sectors correlating with naturally occurring topographical differences. This gives leads her to the conclusion that they were not so strictly segregated.\n\nThere has been no specific reporting on burials or skeletal remains. We do know, however, that most of the burials were inside building (domestic) complexes/units or inside workshops. Some artifacts that were found among such burials are spindle whorls, copper plates and knives, many ceramic artifacts and occasionally gold and silver that indicated higher or elite status. This indicates that people were buried with materials related to their occupation and status, which seem to be related.\n\nThere are two common types of representations of iconographic art on ceramic materials; fineline painting and three-dimensional forms.\n\nFineline drawing tradition is common late Moche style. Many iconographic representations have realistic animal and human images in the Moche culture. Paintings portraying deities are most commonly found on ceramic stirrup bottle spouts. Identical motifs of “bird-with-bowl, ritual runners, and deities fighting” can be found at Pampa Grande and Galindo, which is 160 km away.\n\nFigures resembling an anthropomorphized iguana and an elderly individual, described as \"wrinkle face\", were significant characters towards the beginning of Phase V in the Moche period.\n\n'Wrinkle face', a mythological deity, is recognized from its “wide round eyes, snarling-fanged mouth, and dense wrinkles over the entire face”. 'Wrinkle face', carved or stamped three-dimensionally onto face-neck jars, is frequently depicted fighting supernatural creatures.\n\nNude, bound warriors are often depicted on neck-jars. These depictions are not likely mythical creatures, but rather, ritualistic representations of warriors.\n\nAccording to ethno historical records it was the men who were involved in the specialized activities, whereas women were child bearers and domestic individuals. Therefore it might be likely that it was the men who performed any ritualistic duties. However, there is no ethno historic evidence specifically concerning mythical or ritual aspects of Pampa Grande society.\n\nHowever, at some point, most of the traditional Moche “iconographic elements ceased to be depicted”. The realistic animal and human imagery, commonly found on utilitarian ceramic ware, was replaced with geometrical patterns. These new designs are suggested to be abbreviated versions of the earlier detailed images and motifs in Moche traditional art.\n\nThe “Temple of the Stairway and Wave” is a geometrical band motif that is assumed to have been symbolic of the place where rituals and human sacrifice took place.\n\nThere is no evidence of written records from Pampa Grande.\n\nHuacas were the equivalent of palaces or temples. They served as spaces for public and private rituals and housed the elite. The tops of the Huacas were platforms standing over public plazas. Huaca Fortaleza (Huaca Grande) is the tallest man-made earthen structure in South America It includes numerous murals, like previous ceremonial Moche pyramids. Some of the murals were on the lower, exterior, visible from public areas, while some were on upper terraces. This suggests that the Huacas at Pampa Grande were used for ritualistic (public) ceremonies \n\nThe murals on the first terrace featured a reoccurring red and orange reptile, resembling an iguana. (Haas, 1985: 400) There is also evidence of concentrated luxury goods and foods in the lofty, spacious rooms in the Huaca that suggest it was the residence for the ruling elite. There are amulets and votives figurines recovered that are believed to have been used in shamanistic practices among households. There is a presence of patios in domestic structures. These were likely used for domestic events and rituals, like home worship.\n\nNo altars are found on the huacas at Pampa Grande, like other similar sacrificial Moche sites.\n\nThe only priest figures mentioned are the Bird priest and the Priestess, which are major Moche icons, but not found at Pampa Grande. Shamanistic traditions were performed using figurines in order to cure illness, help with pregnancy and fertility, and to recognize rights of passage. The social standing of the shamans have never been discussed in my sources. The evidence for domestic ancestor worship suggests the elite are also partaking in ancestor worship. This means their ancestors would have probably been wealthy and their fortune was passed down in the family and been the worshiped had most influence in the state development.\n\nThere has been little reporting on burials or skeletal remains. We do know, however, that most of the burials were inside building (domestic) complexes/units or inside workshops. Some artifacts that were found among such burials are spindle whorls, copper plates and knives, many ceramic artifacts and occasionally gold and silver that indicated higher or elite status. This indicates that people were buried with materials related to their occupation and status, which seem to be related. Other than potential looting, the few burials that were mentioned seemed to have been left at peace by the residents of Pampa Grande.\n\nFrom the few burial artifacts, we can see that the women are buried with things related to their occupation, which was frequently domestic. Primarily, we see spindle whorls and threading weights at the female burials. In male burials there are typically copper-metal smelted artifacts, along with ceramics. There is one case of a burial in a communal plaza, located inside of a domestic complex. This suggests kinship ties among the complex, and also contributes to the theory that Pampa Grande residents practiced ancestor worship, because the burial was in a ritualistic plaza.\n\nIt is more likely to find evidence of external influence in the burials of the elites. As Shimada explains, the elite would have more contact with external figures and would be more likely than the commoners to integrate external art into their burial goods. Also, elites were commonly buried with larger amounts of status items than commoners. It seems as though there were no wars or battles at Pampa Grande, so there would be no evidence for how enemies/foreigners were treated differently from local residents.\n\nThere was a pottery workshop discovered that had two potters (who likely worked in the workshop) buried with large amounts of high status artifacts. These potters were likely highly skilled elite members of society. They both were afflicted by “professional traumas.” “They suffered from rheumatism in the hands and arthritis on the backbone, hands, and knees, which correspond with activities related to long-term pottery manufacture” This case is the only case from excavated parts of the site to have evidence of disease or trauma.\n\nThere is no evidence of trauma on the very limited skeletal remains. No mass graves were found. The location and architecture were agriculturally focused, rather than militarily focused. There are no historical written records, and little ethno-historic evidence for warfare or violence.\n\nThere is no evidence for conquest of Pampa Grande or that Pampa Grande made any advances on other polities. The artistic styles seemed to have evolved over-time not in relation to conquest.\n\nThere were numerous elite-sponsored workshops, which had minimal evidence of habitation. These workshops had controlled access, so as to keep the materials inside of them. Family and households also produced specialized goods, but on a much less controlled basis. Local authorities more loosely monitored family and household workshops. It is likely that they only checked up on household workshops when goods were expected as tribute to the elite. However, there is no evidence suggesting the tribute paid to or from anywhere outside of the town and closely surrounding areas.\n\nThere has been no evidence or discovery of a writing system at Pampa Grande.\n\nThere are a few different recurring motifs that appear at Pampa Grande. The most common motifs are the “bird with a bowl” or bird priest, waves, “wrinkle face” and iguana figures. The bird priest appears commonly on ceramics in the Moche culture, but is scarcely found at Pampa Grande. However, this is such a common Moche figurine, that it is important to consider when looking at Pampa Grande. This motif is part bird and part human, and would have been part of sacrificial or other ceremonies. It is often displayed in scenes fighting other deities. However, its meaning and interpretation is contested.\n\nWaves are frequently found at Pampa Grande, primarily on ceramics/pottery. The waves have two different interpretations. Often waves appear in conjunction with right triangles or “stairs”. These geometric shapes would have served as an abbreviated version of earlier and more complex motifs. The first way this geometric motif has been interpreted is symbolizing marine life and its importance. Expert, Ilana Johnson, explains one way the waves can be interpreted. They “…could have been an abbreviated version of the stylized catfish or double-headed serpent motif found in panels on the murals at Huaca de la Luna and Huaca El Brujo [other Moche sites]”. The second way these wave motifs are interpreted are as the Temple of the Stairway and Wave. This is said to have been a ceremonial place where ritual human sacrifice took place. The wave motif is often found in several places on one piece of pottery.\n\n“Wrinkle face” was likely a deity or religious/political figure at Pampa Grande. He is often painted (fineline) onto pottery. The pottery typically depicts Wrinkle face as a snarling, wrinkled face with large, round eyes. Similarly to the bird priest, Wrinkle face is often shown battling other mythological deities or shown in a burial scene.\n\nMurals on the first terrace of Huaca Grande featured a reoccurring red and orange reptile, resembling an iguana. (Haas, 1985: 400) The iguana figures were most commonly found in Huaca Grande. It is likely that iguanas were eaten at Pampa Grande because they are found to be a luxury dish in current day Peru. It is possible that the iguanas were also represented by Wrinkle face, however that is an uncertain interpretation. Their purpose in the terraces of Huaca Grande along with their symbolic meaning is unclear. (Haas, 1985: 400)\n\nThe abandonment of Pampa Grande took place not long after 700 A.D. No experts discuss the evidence of abandonment, but rather discuss it as a known point in Pampa Grande’s history. They instead discuss the details of the different theories as to why and how the site was abandoned and what evidence supported such theories.\n\nThree theories exist about the abandonment of Pampa Grande. However, Shimada explains that these theories have issues because the “available data pertaining to this problematic time period are largely ambiguous because of their fragmentary nature…”.\n\nNevertheless, the arguments for each theory have data to support them. First, a flood possibly due to unusual rains, followed by El Nino sparked the abandonment. Excavations have found “thick and uniform deposits of water-borne sand and silt” on floor surfaces. It is suggested that the deposits are a result of a single large flood. In addition to the existence of the silt deposit, it covers everything presumed to have been on the floor surface at the time of abandonment. Shimada cautions, however, that the date of the flood is difficult to pinpoint. Also, the deposit is possibly a result of numerous floods.\n\nExternal invasion by the Huari Empire is another theory, however weak; Shimada explains it could have led to the abandonment of Pampa Grande. There are Huari style objects that are found at Pampa Grande. In addition to the Huari objects, almost all domestic rooms had large amounts of carbonized wood. This suggests that these spaces were burned as part of the Huari invasion. However, this interpretation loses credibility because of the isolated occurrences of Huari style artifacts. This evidence is not “adequate proof” of a Huari invasion.\n\nInternal forces and conditions weakened the society making it susceptible to forces and events. The establishment of Pampa Grande was so rapid. The governing body and system was never firmly established, which led to changes in the way Pampa Grande was run. This made the structure of the economy susceptible to unrest and other events.\n\nThere is evidence of a redistributive economy made possible by tributes made to the elites. With such a model, if a large environmental problem occurred, accompanied by increasingly complex population, tributes would only be plausible up to a certain point. This is one possible way Shimada discusses for the revolt of the people as the cause of abandonment.\n\nThe theory of revolt is the most widely accepted. The violent ending is interpreted with the data of widespread intensive burning of domestic and other structures, as mentioned above in the Huari invasion theory. There also is a large amount of burnt corn and beans in storage facilities. The burnt roofing that lays directly on burnt floor surfaces may indicate that the fire and abandonment occurred around the same time.\n\nOne stray piece of evidence in this theory is that many adobe units that show no sign of destruction by fire. In addition to this, the burnt adobe structures do not necessarily show signs of intentional destruction. Many of the artifacts are intact.\n\nThere is evidence for Huari and/or Tiahuanaco cultural occupation shortly after the abandonment. However, there is little evidence of the extent to which the site was occupied at this time.\n\nThe Chimu culture shows up in the surrounding areas a significant amount of time after the Huari.\n\nThe Inca have clearly had a presence at Pampa Grande dating from 1476 to the early 1500s. However, there is little pottery or material remains until the arrival of the Spaniards in 1532.\n\n\"Pampa Grande and the Mochica Culture\".

In 1009 the country was again redivided, this time into one royal district, five provinces (\"Do\") and two frontier districts (\"Gye;\" 계; ?). \n\nAfter the Joseon Dynasty's rise to power and the formation of Joseon in 1392, the country was redivided into eight new provinces (\"Do\") in 1413. The provincial boundaries closely reflected major regional and dialect boundaries, and are still often referred to in Korean today simply as the Eight Provinces (\"Paldo\"). In 1895, as part of the Gabo Reform, the country was redivided into 23 districts (\"Bu;\" 부; ), which were replaced a year later by thirteen new provinces.\n\nThe thirteen provinces of 1896 included three of the original eight provinces, with the five remaining original provinces divided into north and south halves (\"Bukdo\" (북도; ) and \"Namdo\" (남도; ) respectively). The thirteen provinces remained unchanged throughout the period of Japanese annexation.\n\nWith the liberation of Korea in 1945, the Korean peninsula was divided into Northern Korea and Southern Korea under trusteeship from Soviet Union and America, with the dividing line established along the 38th parallel. As a result, three provinces—Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon (Kangwŏn)—were divided into North Korea and South Korea today.\n\nThe special cities of Seoul and P'yŏngyang were formed in 1946. Between 1946 and 1954, five new provinces were created: Jeju in South Korea, and North and South Hwanghae, Chagang, and Ryanggang in North Korea.\n\nSince 1954, provincial boundaries in both the North and South have remained unchanged but new cities and special administrative regions have been created.\n\nIn 660, the southeastern kingdom of Silla conquered Baekje in the Southwest, and in 668, Silla conquered Goguryeo in the north with the help of China's Tang Dynasty. For the first time, most of the Korean peninsula was ruled by a single power. Silla's northern boundary ran through the middle of southern Goguryeo, from the Taedong River (which flows through P'yŏngyang) in the west to Wŏnsan in modern-day Kangwon Province in the east. In 721, Silla solidified its northern boundary with Balhae (which replaced Goguryeo in the north) by building a wall between P'yŏngyang and Wŏnsan.\n\nThe country's capital was Geumseong (modern-day Gyeongju), and sub-capitals were located at Geumgwan-gyeong (Gimhae), Namwon-gyeong, Seowon-gyeong (Cheongju), Jungwon-gyeong (Chungju), and Bugwon-gyeong (Wonju).\n\nThe country was divided into nine provinces (\"Ju\"): three in the pre-660 territory of Silla, and three each in the former kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo.\n\nThe table below lists the three preceding kingdoms, each province's name in the Roman alphabet, hangul, and hanja, as well as the provincial capital, and the equivalent modern-day province.\n\nIn 892, Gyeon Hwon founded the kingdom of Later Baekje in southwestern Silla, and in 918, Wanggeon (King Taejo) established the kingdom of Goryeo in the northwest, with its capital at Songak (modern-day Kaesŏng). In 935, Goryeo conquered the remnants of Silla, and in 936, it conquered Later Baekje. Songak was greatly expanded and renamed Gaegyeong. Taejo expanded the country's territory by conquering part of the land formerly belonging to Goguryeo, in the northwest of the Korean peninsula, as far north as the Amnok River (Yalu River). A wall was constructed from the Amnok River in the northwest to the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea) in the southeast, on the boundary between Goryeo and the northeastern Jurched territory.\n\nThe country had one capital (Gaegyeong) and three sub-capitals: Donggyeong (modern-day Gyeongju and the former capital of Silla), Namgyeong (modern-day Seoul), and Seogyeong (modern-day P'yŏngyang).\n\nOriginally, the country had one royal district (\"Ginae;\" 기내; ) around Gaegyeong and twelve administrative districts (\"Mok;\" 목; ): (Note that Gwangju-mok is modern-day Gwangju-si in Gyeonggi Province, not the larger Gwangju Metropolitan City.)\n\nThe twelve districts were soon redivided into ten provinces (\"Do;\" 도; ). Gwannae-do included the administrative districts of Yangju, Hwangju, Gwangju, and Haeju; Jungwon-do included Chungju and Cheongju; Hanam-do replaced Gongju; Gangnam-do replaced Jeonju; Yeongnam-do replaced Sangju; Sannam-do replaced Jinju; and Haeyang-do replaced Naju and Seungju; the three other new provinces were Yeongdong-do, Panbang-do, and Paeseo-do. \n\nFinally, in 1009, the ten provinces were again redivided, this time into five provinces (\"Do\") and two frontier districts (\"Gye;\" 계; ?).\n\nThe table below lists the provinces of Silla, the administrative districts of Goryeo that replaced them, then the pre- and post-1009 provinces, as well as their modern equivalents. \n\nIn 1413, Korea (at that time called Joseon) was divided into eight provinces: Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgyŏng (originally called Yeonggil), Hwanghae (originally called P'unghae), and P'yŏngan.\n\nIn 1895, Korea was redivided into 23 districts (\"Bu;\" 부; ), each named for the city or county that was its capital. The districts were short-lived, however, as the following year, the provincial system was restored.\n\nIn 1896, the former eight provinces were restored, with five of them (Chungcheong, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgyŏng, and P'yŏngan) being divided into North and South Provinces (\"Bukdo\" (북도; ) and \"Namdo\" (남도; ) respectively). The resulting system of thirteen provinces lasted until the Division of Korea in 1945.\n\nThe thirteen provinces were: North and South Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, North and South Gyeongsang, North and South Hamgyŏng, Hwanghae, North and South Jeolla, and North and South P'yŏngan.\n\nUnder Japanese rule, Korean provinces remained much the same, only taking on the Japanese reading of the hanja. The Provinces of Chōsen were:\n\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into Northern Korea and Southern Korea under trusteeship of the Soviet Union and the United States. The peninsula was divided at the 38th parallel in 1945. In 1948, the two zones became the independent countries of North Korea and South Korea.\n\nThree provinces—Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon—were divided by the 38th parallel.\n\n\nAlso in 1946, the cities of Seoul in the south and Pyongyang in the north separated from Gyeonggi and South Pyongan Provinces respectively to become Special Cities. Both North Korea and South Korea upgraded cities to a level equal to a province, and these cities are sometimes counted along with provinces.\n\nFinally, the new provinces of Jeju Province (in the south, in 1946) and Chagang Province (in the north, 1949) were formed, from parts of South Jeolla and North Pyongan respectively. In 1954, Ryanggang Province split from South Hamgyong.\n\nThe following table lists the present provincial divisions in the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\n Sources include Nahm 1988 (in Korean).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25169288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25169288", "title": "Reservoir modeling", "text": "Reservoir modeling\n\nIn the oil and gas industry, reservoir modeling involves the construction of a computer model of a petroleum reservoir, for the purposes of improving estimation of reserves and making decisions regarding the development of the field, predicting future production, placing additional wells, and evaluating alternative reservoir management scenarios. \n\nA reservoir model represents the physical space of the reservoir by an array of discrete cells, delineated by a grid which may be regular or irregular. The array of cells is usually three-dimensional, although 1D and 2D models are sometimes used. Values for attributes such as porosity, permeability and water saturation are associated with each cell. The value of each attribute is implicitly deemed to apply uniformly throughout the volume of the reservoir represented by the cell.\n\nReservoir models typically fall into two categories:\n\nSometimes a single \"shared earth model\" is used for both purposes. More commonly, a geological model is constructed at a relatively high (fine) resolution. A coarser grid for the reservoir simulation model is constructed, with perhaps two orders of magnitude fewer cells. Effective values of attributes for the simulation model are then derived from the geological model by an upscaling process. Alternatively, if no geological model exists, the attribute values for a simulation model may be determined by a process of sampling geological maps.\n\nUncertainty in the true values of the reservoir properties is sometimes investigated by constructing several different realizations of the sets of attribute values. The behaviour of the resulting simulation models can then indicate the associated level of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe phrase \"reservoir characterization\" is sometimes used to refer to reservoir modeling activities up to the point when a simulation model is ready to simulate the flow of fluids.\n\nCommercially available software is used in the construction, simulation and analysis of the reservoir models.\n\nThe processes required to construct reservoir models are described by the phrase \"Seismic to simulation\". The process is successful if the model accurately reflects the original well logs, seismic data and production history.\n\nReservoir models are constructed to gain a better understanding of the subsurface that leads to informed well placement, reserves estimation and production planning. Models are based on measurements taken in the field, including well logs, seismic surveys, and production history. \n\nSeismic to simulation enables the quantitative integration of all field data into an updateable reservoir model built by a team of geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. Key techniques used in the process include integrated petrophysics and rock physics to determine the range of lithotypes and rock properties, geostatistical inversion to determine a set of plausible seismic-derived rock property models at sufficient vertical resolution and heterogeneity for flow simulation, stratigraphic grid transfer to accurately move seismic-derived data to the geologic model, and flow simulation for model validation and ranking to determine the model that best fits all the data.\n\nThe first step in seismic to simulation is establishing a relationship between petrophysical key rock properties and elastic properties of the rock. This is required in order to find common ground between the well logs and seismic data.\n\nWell logs are measured in depth and provide high resolution vertical data, but no insight into the inter-well space. Seismic are measured in time and provide great lateral detail but is quite limited in its vertical resolution. When correlated, well logs and seismic can be used to create a fine-scale 3D model of the subsurface.\n\nInsight into the rock properties comes from a combination of basic geologic understanding and well-bore measurements. Based on an understanding of how the area was formed over time, geologists can predict the types of rock likely to be present and how rapidly they vary spatially. Well log and core measurements provide samples to verify and fine-tune that understanding. \n\nSeismic data is used by petrophysicists to identify the tops of various lithotypes and the distribution of rock properties in the inter-well space using seismic inversion attributes such as impedance. Seismic surveys measure acoustic impedance contrasts between rock layers. As different geologic structures are encountered, the sound wave reflects and refracts as a function of the impedance contrast between the layers. Acoustic impedance varies by rock type and can therefore be correlated to rock properties using rock physics relationships between the inversion attributes and petrophysical properties such as porosity, lithology, water saturation, and permeability.\n\nOnce well logs are properly conditioned and edited, a petrophysical rock model is generated that can be used to derive the effective elastic rock properties from fluid and mineral parameters as well as rock structure information. The model parameters are calibrated by comparison of the synthetic to the available elastic sonic logs. Calculations are performed following a number of rock physics algorithms including: Xu & White, Greenberg & Castagna, Gassmann, Gardner, modified upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman, and Batzle & Wang. \n\nWhen the petrophysical rock model is complete, a statistical database is created to describe the rock types and their known properties such as porosity and permeability. Lithotypes are described, along with their distinct elastic properties.\n\nIn the next step of seismic to simulation, seismic inversion techniques combine well and seismic data to produce multiple equally plausible 3D models of the elastic properties of the reservoir. Seismic data is transformed to elastic property log(s) at every trace. Deterministic inversion techniques are used to provide a good overall view of the porosity over the field, and serve as a quality control check. To obtain greater detail needed for complex geology, additional stochastic inversion is then employed.\n\nGeostatistical inversion procedures detect and delineate thin reservoirs otherwise poorly defined. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based geostatistical inversion addresses the vertical scaling problem by creating seismic derived rock properties with vertical sampling compatible to geologic models.\n\nAll field data is incorporated into the geostatistical inversion process through the use of probability distribution functions (PDFs). Each PDF describes a particular input data in geostatistical terms using histograms and variograms, which identify the odds of a given value at a specific place and the overall expected scale and texture based on geologic insight.\n\nOnce constructed, the PDFs are combined using Bayesian inference, resulting in a posterior PDF that conforms to everything that is known about the field. A weighting system is used within the algorithm, making the process more objective.\n\nFrom the posterior PDF, realizations are generated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. These realizations are statistically fair and produce models of high detail, accuracy and realism. Rock properties like porosity can be cosimulated from the elastic properties determined by the geostatistical inversion. This process is iterated until a best fit model is identified.\n\nInversion parameters are tuned by running the inversion many times with and without well data. Without the well data, the inversions are running in blind-well mode. These blind-well mode inversions test the reliability of the constrained inversion and remove potential bias. \n\nThis statistical approach creates multiple, equi-probable models consistent with the seismic, wells, and geology. Geostatistical inversion simultaneously inverts for impedance and discrete properties types, and other petrophysical properties such as porosity can then be jointly cosimulated. \n\nThe output volumes are at a sample rate consistent with the reservoir model because making synthetics of finely sampled models is the same as from well logs. Inversion properties are consistent with well log properties because the histograms used to generate the output rock properties from the inversion are based on well log values for those rock properties.\n\nUncertainty is quantified by using random seeds to generate slightly differing realizations, particularly for areas of interest. This process improves the understanding of uncertainty and risk within the model.\n\nFollowing geostatistical inversion and in preparation for history matching and flow simulation, the static model is re-gridded and up-scaled. The transfer simultaneously converts time to depth for the various properties and transfers them in 3D from the seismic grid to a corner-point grid. The relative locations of properties are preserved, ensuring data points in the seismic grid arrive in the correct stratigraphic layer in the corner point grid.\n\nThe static model built from seismic is typically orthogonal but flow simulators expect corner point grids. The corner point grid consists of cubes that are usually much coarser in the horizontal direction and each corner of the cube is arbitrarily defined to follow the major features in the grid. Converting directly from orthogonal to corner point can cause problems such as creating discontinuity in fluid flow. \n\nAn intermediate stratigraphic grid ensures that important structures are not misrepresented in the transfer. The stratigraphic grid has the same number of cells as the orthogonal seismic grid, but the boundaries are defined by stratigraphic surfaces and the cells follow the stratigraphic organization. This is a stratigraphic representation of the seismic data using the seismic interpretation to define the layers. The stratigraphic grid model is then mapped to the corner point grid by adjusting the zones.\n\nUsing the porosity and permeability models and a saturation height function, initial saturation models are built. If volumetric calculations identify problems in the model, changes are made in the petrophysical model without causing the model to stray from the original input data. For example, sealing faults are added for greater compartmentalization.\n\nIn the last step of seismic to simulation, flow simulation continues the integration process by bringing in the production history. This provides a further validation of the static model against history. A representative set of the model realizations from the geostatistical inversion are history matched against production data. If the properties in the model are realistic, simulated well bottom hole pressure behavior should match historical (measured) well bottom hole pressure. Production flow rates and other engineering data should also match. \n\nBased on the quality of the match, some models are eliminated. After the initial history match process, dynamic well parameters are adjusted as needed for each of the remaining models to improve the match. The final model represents the best match to original field measurements and production data and is then used in drilling decisions and production planning.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55360088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55360088", "title": "Richard Hore", "text": "Richard Hore\n\nRichard Hore () was an English explorer who conducted an early voyage to the coast of what is now Newfoundland, where his passengers allegedly engaged in cannibalism in order to survive. His travels are attested in the writings of Richard Hakluyt, who documented the ill-fated expedition. Apart from his famous journey and its immediate aftermath, little is known about the life of Richard Hore.\n\nOne of the few contemporary accounts of Richard Hore's life is contained in \"The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation\", a late 16th century history by Richard Hakluyt. Master Hore, described as \"a man of goodly stature and of great courage\" who was \"given to the studie of Cosmographie,\" succeeded in attracting a number of gentlemen interested in visiting the North American coast. According to Hakluyt, the expedition was to set out on two ships: the \"Trinity\", captained by Hore himself, and the \"Minion\", upon which sailed men such as Armigil Wade. Hakluyt derived his narrative from two sources: the testimony of Thomas Butts, son of William Butts, and Oliver Dawbeny. Dawbeny, who sailed on the \"Minion\", had been interviewed by Hakluyt's cousin, Richard Hakluyt of the Middle Temple, while Thomas Butts, who had sailed on the \"Trinity\", was very old when he was interviewed personally by Hakluyt as the last surviving witness to the voyage.\n\nAfter embarking from Gravesend in April 1536, the ships sailed for two months without sighting land until they approached Cape Breton, where they turned northeast until they reached the Island of Penguin. There the passengers killed and ate a large number of native birds as well as several bears. According to Oliver Dawbeny, at this point the English encountered some indigenous persons in a canoe, who fled and could not be located afterwards. This was likely an encounter with the Beothuk, although the possibility remains that Hore's crew had encountered the Inuit. \n\nFollowing this incident, the expedition began to experience serious shortage of supplies, to the point where Dawbeny relates that a man was killed and partially eaten by one of his companions. When news of this was brought to the captain, he vigorously harangued the crew on their actions before beginning to \"exhort [them] to repentance, and besought all the company to pray, that it might please God to looke upon their miserable present state, and for his owne mercie to relieve the same.\" Despite the denunciation of cannibalism, soon after the crew prepared to draw lots to determine which of them should be sacrificed for the survival of the rest. The unexpected arrival of a well-supplied French ship prevented this from occurring, as the English seized the French ship and left its crew to fend for themselves.\n\nThe return voyage passed far enough northward for the expedition to witness large icebergs in the summer months, and arrived in St. Ives, Cornwall in October 1536. They stayed for a time at the home of John Luttrell before returning home to London, where Thomas Butts was described as being so emaciated that he would not have been recognized by his parents if it were not for an identifying wart on his knee. Some time after their return, the French ship that had been attacked by the expedition arrived in England and made a petition of grievance to King Henry VIII, who was so moved by pity for his subjects that he spared them punishment but personally repaid the wronged Frenchmen in full from his own coffers.\n\nRichard Hakluyt's account of the voyage of Richard Hore has been closely scrutinized by skeptical historians. E. G. R. Taylor discovered court records of a lawsuit brought against Hore by the merchant William Dolphyn, who was seeking redress for breach of contract and whose ship had been chartered for the voyage by Hore. The lawsuit, which makes no mention of undue hardships, identifies Hore's second ship as the \"William of London\" and not \"Minion\", a probable error on Hakluyt's part. Later documents on Richard Hore detailed further legal troubles, as he had gained control of a ship called the \"Valentine\" in 1537 and within the next year was investigated for allegedly kidnapping some Portuguese subjects and then was found to be in debt to one Sir Thomas Spent. There are no other known surviving primary sources on Richard Hore, as the memoirs written by Armigil Wade have evidently been lost.\n\nOther inquiries have called into question whether any of the ship's company actually resorted to the eating of human flesh. Philip Levy theorizes that the misidentification of Hore's ship \"William\" as the \"Minion\" may have been a deliberate or accidental reference to another ship called \"Minion\" whose crew had endured hunger in 1568 while in the Gulf of Mexico. Further, the incident of man-eating which was related from Dawbeny's testimony must be seen as problematic, given the confusion in Hakluyt's narrative over which of his two sources witnessed each anecdote. Levy suggests that because the actual cannibalistic moment was not directly witnessed, it could be seen as merely a veiled threat from a sailor who had been caught eating some other kind of meat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "609248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=609248", "title": "Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians", "text": "Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians\n\nThe Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, also called the Ridge and Valley Province or the Valley and Ridge Appalachians, are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian division and are also a belt within the Appalachian Mountains extending from southeastern New York through northwestern New Jersey, westward into Pennsylvania and southward into Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. They form a broad arc between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province (the Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus). They are characterized by long, even ridges, with long, continuous valleys in between.\n\nThe ridge and valley system presents an important obstacle to east–west land travel even with today's technology. It was a nearly insurmountable barrier to railroads crossing the range as well as to walking or horse-riding migrants traveling west to settle the Ohio Country, Northwest Territory and Oregon Country, before the days of motorized transportation. In the era when animal power dominated transportation there was no safe way to cross east–west in the middle of the range; crossing was only possible nearer its extremes except for a few rough passages opened mid-range during the colonial era such as Cumberland Gap, Braddock's Road and Forbes Road, later improved into America's first National Roads (respectively Wilderness Road, Cumberland Road, Lincoln Highway or designated U.S. 40 and U.S. 30 in later years).\n\nThe eastern head of the Ridge and Valley region is marked by the Great Appalachian Valley, which lies just west of the Blue Ridge. The western side of the Ridge and Valley region is marked by steep escarpments such as the Allegheny Front, the Cumberland Mountains, and Walden Ridge.\n\nThese curious formations are the remnants of an ancient fold-and-thrust belt, west of the mountain core that formed in the Alleghenian orogeny (Stanley, 421-2). Here, strata have been folded westward, and forced over massive thrust faults; there is little metamorphism, and no igneous intrusion.(Stanley, 421-2) The ridges represent the edges of the erosion-resistant strata, and the valleys portray the absence of the more erodible strata. Smaller streams have developed their valleys following the lines of the more easily eroded strata. But a few major rivers, such as the Delaware River, the Susquehanna River, the New River, and the Potomac River, are evidently older than the present mountains, having cut water gaps that are perpendicular to hard strata ridges. The evidence points to a wearing down of the entire region (the original mountains) to a low level with little relief, so that major rivers were flowing in unconsolidated sediments that were unaffected by the underlying rock structure. Then the region was uplifted slowly enough that the rivers were able to maintain their course, cutting through the ridges as they developed.\n\nValleys may be synclinal valleys or anticlinal valleys.\n\nThese mountains are at their highest development in central Pennsylvania, a phenomenon termed the \"Pennsylvania climax\".\n\n\n"}

Bearings to landmarks are taken at intervals as the vessel sails offshore, and are used to fix features on the coast and further inland. Intervening coastal detail is sketched in. \n\nThe method was used by James Cook, and subsequently by navigators who sailed under—or were influenced by—him, including George Vancouver, William Bligh and Matthew Flinders.\n"}

Sometimes, the proliferation of errors in disease mapping has led to inefficient decision-making, implementation of inappropriate health policies and negative impact on the advancement of scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A majority of the planet's solid surface is abyssal plain, at depths between below the surface of the oceans. The solid surface location on the planet closest to the centre of the orb is the Challenger Deep, located in the Mariana Trench at a depth of . Although a number of human activities are conducted underwater—such as research, scuba diving for work or recreation, or even underwater warfare with submarines, this very extensive environment on planet Earth is hostile to humans in many ways and therefore little explored. But it can be explored by sonar, or more directly via manned or autonomous submersibles. The ocean floors have been surveyed via sonar to at least a coarse resolution; particularly-strategic areas have been mapped in detail, in the name of detecting enemy submarines, or aiding friendly ones, though the resulting maps may still be classified.\n\nAn immediate obstacle to human activity under water is the fact that human lungs cannot naturally function in this environment. Unlike the gills of fish, human lungs are adapted to the exchange of gases at atmospheric pressure, not liquids. Aside from simply having insufficient musculature to rapidly move water in and out of the lungs, a more significant problem for all air-breathing animals, such as mammals and birds, is that water contains so little dissolved oxygen compared with atmospheric air. Air is around 21% O; water typically is less than 0.001% dissolved oxygen.\n\nThe density of water also causes problems that increase dramatically with depth. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 14.7 pounds per square inch or around 100 kPa. A comparable water pressure occurs at a depth of only ( for sea water). Thus, at about 10 m below the surface, the water exerts twice the pressure (2 atmospheres or 200 kPa) on the body as air at surface level.\n\nFor solids and liquids like bone, muscle and blood, this added pressure is not much of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, paranasal sinuses and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10 ft (3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10 m (33 ft) is 100% (100 kPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30 m (100 ft) to 40 m (130 ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).\n\nAny object immersed in water is provided with a buoyant force that counters the force of gravity, appearing to make the object less heavy. If the overall density of the object exceeds the density of water, the object sinks. If the overall density is less than the density of water, the object rises until it floats on the surface.\nWith increasing depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and the amount of visible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths (red end of the visible spectrum) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the visible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is turbid, in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10 m (33 feet). At 100 m (330 ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.\n\nThe euphotic depth is the depth at which light intensity falls to 1% of the value at the surface. This depth is dependent upon water clarity, being only a few metres underwater in a turbid estuary, but may reach up to 200 metres in the open ocean. At the euphotic depth, plants (such as phytoplankton) have no net energy gain from photosynthesis and thus cannot grow.\n\nAt depths greater than a few hundred metres, the sun has little effect on water temperature, because the sun's energy has been absorbed by water at the surface. In the great depths of the ocean the water temperature is very low. In fact, 75% of the water in the world ocean (the great depths) has a temperature between 0 °C and 2 °C.\n\nWater conducts heat around 25 times more efficiently than air. Hypothermia, a potentially fatal condition, occurs when the human body's core temperature falls below 35 °C. Insulating the body's warmth from water is the main purpose of diving suits and exposure suits when used in water temperatures below 25 °C.\n\nSound is transmitted about 4.3 times faster in water (1,484 m/s in fresh water) as it is in air (343 m/s). The human brain can determine the direction of sound in air by detecting small differences in the time it takes for sound waves in air to reach each of the two ears. For these reasons divers find it difficult to determine the direction of sound underwater. However, some animals have adapted to this difference and many use sound to navigate underwater.\n\n\n"}
