{"id": "462030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462030", "title": "Alidade", "text": "Alidade\n\nAn alidade (archaic forms include alhidade, alhidad, alidad) or a turning board is a device that allows one to sight a distant object and use the line of sight to perform a task. This task can be, for example, to draw a line on a plane table in the direction of the object or to measure the angle to the object from some reference point. Angles measured can be horizontal, vertical or in any chosen plane.\n\nThe alidade was originally a part of many types of scientific and astronomical instrument. At one time, some alidades, particularly those used on graduated circles as on astrolabes, were also called \"diopters\". With modern technology, the name is applied to complete instruments such as the plane table alidade.\n\nThe word in Arabic ( , \"the ruler\"), signifies the same device. In Greek and Latin, it is respectively called , \"dioptra\", and , \"fiducial line\".\n\nThe earliest alidades consisted of a bar, rod or similar component with a vane on each end. Each vane (also called a pinnule or pinule) has a hole, slot or other indicator through which one can view a distant object. There may also be a pointer or pointers on the alidade to indicate a position on a scale. Alidades have been made of wood, ivory, brass and other materials.\n\nThe figure on the left displays drawings that attempt to show the general forms of various alidades that can be found on many antique instruments. Real alidades of these types could be much more decorative, revealing the maker's artistic talents as well as his technical skills. In the terminology of the time, the edge of an alidade at which one reads a scale or draws a line is called a \"fiducial edge\".\n\nAlidade B in the diagram shows a straight, flat bar with a vane at either end. No pointers are used. The vanes are not centred on the bar but offset so that the sight line coincides with the edge of the bar.\n\nThe vanes have a rectangular hole in each with a fine wire held vertically in the opening. To use the alidade, the user sights an object and lines it up with the wires in each vane. This type of alidade could be found on a plane table, graphometer or similar instrument.\n\nAlidades A and C are similar to B but have a slit or circular hole without a wire. In the diagram, the openings are exaggerated in size to show the shape; they would be smaller in a real alidade, perhaps 2 mm or so in width. One can look through the openings and line the openings up with the object of interest in the distance. With a small opening, the error in sighting the object is small. However, if a dim object such as a star is observed through a small hole, the image is difficult to see.\n\nThis form is shown in the diagram as having pointers. These can be used to read off an angle on a scale that is engraved around the outer edge (or limb) of the instrument. Alidades of this form are found on astrolabes, mariner's astrolabes and similar instruments.\n\nAlidade D has vanes without any openings. In this case, the object is viewed and the alidade is rotated until the two opposite vanes simultaneously eclipse the object. With skill, this sort of alidade can yield very precise measures. In this example, pointers are shown.\n\nAlidade E is a representation of a very interesting design by Johannes Hevelius. Hevelius was following in Tycho Brahe's footsteps and cataloging star positions with high accuracy. He did have access to the telescopic sights that were being used by astronomers in other countries, however, he chose to use naked-eye observations for his positional instruments. Due to the design of his instruments and the alidades, as well as his diligent practices, he was able to yield very precise measures.\n\nHevelius' design featured a pivot point with a vertical cylinder and a vane at the observer's end. The vane had two narrow slits that were spaced precisely the same distance apart as the diameter of the cylinder (in the diagram, the portion of the vane between the slits is removed for clarity; the left and right edges of the opening represent the slits). If the observer could sight a star on only one side of the cylinder, as seen in F, the alignment was off. By carefully moving the vane so that the star could just barely be seen on either side of the cylinder (G), the alidade was aligned with the position of the star. This could not be used with a closely located object. A star, being so far away as to exhibit no parallax to the naked-eye, would be observable as a point source simultaneously on both sides.\n\n\n\n"}

The latter is located at the northwestern edge of the Triassic Kontum Massif, in central Vietnam. Important passes are the Nape Pass and the Mụ Giạ Pass.\n\nThe Annamite Range runs parallel to the Vietnamese coast, in a gentle curve which divides the basin of the Mekong River from Vietnam's narrow coastal plain along the South China Sea. Most of the crests are on the Laotian side. The eastern slope of the range rises steeply from the plain, drained by numerous short rivers. The western slope is more gentle, forming significant plateaus before descending to the banks of the Mekong. The range itself has three main plateaus, from north to south: Phouane Plateau, Nakai Plateau and Bolaven Plateau.\n\nLaos lies mostly within the Mekong basin, west of the divide, although most of Houaphan Province and a portion of Xiangkhoang Province (where the famous Plain of Jars is located) lie east of the divide. Most of Vietnam lies east of the divide, although Vietnam's Tây Nguyên (Central Highlands) region lies west of the divide, in the Mekong basin.\n\n\"An-nam\" means in Chinese \"to pacify the south\", referring to the region's location relative to China.\n\nThe Annamite mountains now form an important tropical seasonal forest global ecoregion, the Annamite Range Moist Forests Ecoregion, which consists of two terrestrial ecoregions, the Southern Annamites montane forests and the Northern Annamites moist forests.\n\nThe range is home to rare creatures such as the recently discovered Annamite rabbit and the antelope-like saola, the Douc langur, the large gaur, the Chinese pangolin and the Indochinese tiger.\n\nMost of the highlands like the Annamite Range and the Central Highlands were populated by ethnic minorities who were not Vietnamese during the 20th century's start. The demographics were drastically transformed with the mass colonization of 6 million settlers from 1976 to the 1990s, which led to ethnic Vietnamese Kinh outnumbering the native ethnic groups in the highlands.\n\n\n"}

It aims to understand how humans view space, place, and environment. It involves the formalization of factors that influence our spatial cognition to create a more effective representation of space. These improved models assist in a variety of issues, for example, the developing maps that communicate better, providing navigation instructions that are easier to follow, utilizing space more practically, accounting for the cultural differences on spatial thinking for more effective cross-cultural information exchange, and an overall increased understanding of our environment.\n\nNotable researchers in this branch of geography include David Mark, Daniel Montello, Max J. Egenhofer, Andrew U Frank, Christian Freksa, Edward Tolman, and Barbara Tversky, among others.\n\nConference on Spatial Information Theory (COSIT) is a biennial international conference with a focus on the theoretical aspect of space and spatial information.\n\nThe US National Research Council published a book titled, “Learning to think spatially (2006)” written by the Committee on Support for Thinking Spatially. The committee believes that incorporating GIS and other spatial technologies in K-12 curriculum would promote spatial thinking and reasoning.\n\nThe connection between spatial cognition and human activity and survival exists from ancient times. As learned from etymology, geometry has its origins in land surveying of the annual floods of the Nile river. Spatial cognition developed from the study of cognitive psychology which began to be considered as a separate field in the late 1960s through Ulric Neisser’s book \"Cognitive Psychology\" (1967). Initially, research on spatial cognition was hindered due to many leading researchers believing that visual and spatial world could be explained using language processing. Later on, research on imagery showed that by reducing the representation of the visual and spatial world into language researchers ignored ‘fascinating’ issues. Around the same time, geographers were studying how people perceived and remembered the geographical world.\n\nCognitive geography and behavioral geography draw from early behaviorist works such as Tolman's concepts of \"cognitive maps\". More cognitively oriented, these geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.\n\nExamples of early works on Cognitive Geography include Tolman’s `Cognitive maps in rats and men’ compared the behavior of laboratory rats with the navigation and wayfinding abilities of humans. Similar work during that period dealt with the peoples’ perception of direction and spatial relations, for example, Americans typically think that South America is aligned directly south of North America when in fact most of South America is much further east. In the early 70s, the focus was on how to improve maps by providing useful information, delivering an understandable message, and making it more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe interaction between humans and the environment is a major focus among the Geographers. The objective of this research area is to minimize the disparity between the environment and its geometric representation and the removal of spatial cognitive biases that are inherent. Examples of spatial cognitive biases include the overestimation of distance between two locations when there is a large number of intersections and nodes in the path. There is a tendency to recollect irregular streets or rivers as straighter, more parallel, or more perpendicular than they are. David Mark through his research illustrates how spatial features like inland water bodies (lakes, ponds, lagoons) are categorized differently in English and French speaking population, and therefore, could cause issues in cross-cultural geographical information exchange.\n\nStudies have been done on wayfinding and navigation. Wayfinding is defined as “the mental processes involved in determining a route between two points and then following that route” and involves planning trips, optimizing routes, and exploring different places. The researchers are trying to find the perfect amount of information, not more and not less, for making navigation more efficient. Landmarks play an important factor in wayfinding and navigation, therefore, researchers are looking to automate the selection of landmarks which would make maps easier to follow.\n\nDisplaying information through maps has been shaped by how humans sense space and direction. Communicating effectively through maps is a challenge for many cartographers. For example, symbols, their color, and their relative size have an important role to play in the interaction between the map and the mapmaker.\n\nThe study of Geo-ontology has also been of interest to researchers in this field. Geo-ontology involves the study of the variations among different cultures in how they view and sense landforms, how to communicate spatial knowledge with other cultures while overcoming such barriers, an understanding of the cognitive aspects of spatial relations, and how to represent them in computational models. For example, there might be some geographic meaning that might not be well explained using words. There might be some differences in understanding when spatial information is explained verbally instead of non-verbal form.\n\nSome of the questions that cognitive geographers deal with include the influence of scale on the information provided in maps, the difference in how we view geographic knowledge differently from different sources, for example, text-based, map-based, or any real-world experience. A typical study in Cognitive Geography involves volunteers responding to a questionnaire after being shown some spatial information. The researchers use this data to find the spectrum of interpretations by the volunteers about the subject in focus.\n\n\n"}

By the 1650s it was used for whale hunting.\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Davis Strait as follows:\n\n\"On the North.\" The Southern limit of Baffin Bay [The parallel of 70° North between Greenland and Baffin Land<nowiki>]</nowiki>.\n\n\"On the East.\" The Southwest coast of Greenland.\n\n\"On the South.\" The parallel of 60° North between Greenland and Labrador.\n\n\"On the West.\" The Eastern limit of the Northwestern Passages South of 70° North [the East coast of Baffin Island to East Bluff, its Southeastern extremity] and of Hudson Strait [A line from East Bluff, the Southeast extreme of Baffin Island (), to Point Meridian, the Western extreme of Lower Savage Islands, along the coast to its Southwestern extreme and thence a line across to the Western extreme of Resolution Island, through its Southwestern shore to Hatton Headland, its Southern point, thence a line to Cape Chidley, Labrador ()].\n\nThe Davis Strait is underlain by complex geological features of buried grabens (basins) and ridges, probably formed by strike-slip faulting during Paleogene times about 45 million to 62 million years ago. The strike-slip faulting transferred plate-tectonic motions in the Labrador Sea to Baffin Bay.

This has led Greenland's minister and provincial council to offer a large number of off-shore concessions to potential hydrocarbon (oil and gas) extraction. The largest concessions areas are located in seas west of Greenland, primarily the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay, but with several smaller concessions in the Greenland Sea in the east also.\n\n"}

Total degree days from an appropriate starting date are used to plan the planting of crops and management of pests and pest control timing. Weekly or monthly degree-day figures may also be used within an energy monitoring and targeting scheme to monitor the heating and cooling costs of climate controlled buildings, while annual figures can be used for estimating future costs.\n\nA degree day is computed as the integral of a function of time that generally varies with temperature. The function is truncated to upper and lower limits that vary by organism, or to limits that are appropriate for climate control. The function can be estimated or measured by one of the following methods, in each case by reference to a chosen base temperature:\n\nA zero degree-day in energy monitoring and targeting is when either heating or cooling consumption is at a minimum, which is useful with power utility companies in predicting seasonal low points in energy demand.\n\nHeating degree days are typical indicators of household energy consumption for space heating. The air temperature in a building is on average higher than that of the air outside. A temperature of indoors corresponds to an outside temperature of about . If the air temperature outside is below 15.5 °C, then heating is required to maintain a temperature of about 18 °C. If the outside temperature is below the average temperature it is accounted as 1 degree-day. The sum of the degree days over periods such as a month or an entire heating season is used in calculating the amount of heating required for a building. Degree Days are also used to estimate air conditioning usage during the warm season.\n\nGrowing degree days are based on 5°C as typical plant growth stops below that temperature. Plants growth has been observed to relate stage of growth to the number of degree days. Many plants will fruit after a certain number of degree days. Strawberries for instance. Other plants however, called deterministic, will fruit based on the time of year which the plant determines from the number of hours of sunlight in a day. Think of Easter lilies or Christmas cactus.\n\nThe paper referenced shows the complexity of plant growth and degree days. \nCanadians use Growing Degree Days to predict when mosquitoes and black fly emerge and cease.

It is the upper valley or basin of the river Serchio, and thus lies between the main ridge of the Northern Apennines to the north-east and the Alpi Apuane to the west. The principal towns are Castelnuovo di Garfagnana and Barga.\n\nThe people of the Garfagnana were Apuani and Friniati. The area was conquered by the Romans in 180 BC. After the fall of the Carolingian empire in 888 it came under the control of various feudal lords, and was later caught up in the rivalry between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. In 1248 the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II ceded it to the Republic of Lucca. In the fifteenth century much of the territory came under the control of the d'Este family of Ferrara, and in 1847 the remaining part was absorbed into the Duchy of Modena. With the unification of Italy, the Garfagnana became part of the province of Massa e Carrara, and in 1923 passed to that of Lucca.\n\nThe Garfagnana is almost entirely mountainous. It has heavy rainfall, and much of it is densely wooded, often with sweet chestnut, \"Castanea sativa\". Chestnuts were until recently an important food source; the Farina di Neccio della Garfagnana, a chestnut flour, has DOP status. The farro of the region, Farro della Garfagnana, has Indicazione Geografica Protetta status; the area is also known for its lentils and for its porcini mushrooms. It is the area of origin of the Garfagnina breed of cattle, of the Garfagnina breed of goat, and of the Garfagnina Bianca sheep breed.\n\nThe capital of the region is Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.\n\nThe Garfagnana and Lunigiana were struck by a powerful earthquake on 7 September 1920. The worst damage and largest number of deaths were at Villa Collemandina; the greatest intensity was recorded there and at Fivizzano.\n"}
{"id": "15974212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15974212", "title": "Geohash", "text": "Geohash\n\nGeohash is a public domain geocoding system invented by Gustavo Niemeyer, which encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters and digits. It is a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into buckets of grid shape, which is one of the many applications of what is known as a Z-order curve, and generally space-filling curves.\n\nGeohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation, nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. The longer a shared prefix is, the closer the two places are.\n\nIn February 2008, together with the announcement of the system, the inventor launched the website http://geohash.org/, which allows users to convert geographic coordinates to short URLs which uniquely identify positions on the Earth, so that referencing them in emails, forums, and websites is more convenient.\n\nTo obtain the Geohash, the user provides an address to be geocoded, or latitude and longitude coordinates, in a single input box (most commonly used formats for latitude and longitude pairs are accepted), and performs the request.\n\nBesides showing the latitude and longitude corresponding to the given Geohash, users who navigate to a Geohash at geohash.org are also presented with an embedded map, and may download a GPX file, or transfer the waypoint directly to certain GPS receivers. Links are also provided to external sites that may provide further details around the specified\nlocation.\n\nFor example, the coordinate pair codice_1 (near the tip of the peninsula of Jutland, Denmark) produces a slightly shorter hash of codice_2.\n\nThe main usages of Geohashes are:\n\n\nGeohashes have also been proposed to be used for geotagging.\n\nWhen used in a database, the structure of geohashed data has two advantages. First, data indexed by geohash will have all points for a given rectangular area in contiguous slices (the number of slices depends on the precision required and the presence of geohash \"fault lines\"). This is especially useful in database systems where queries on a single index are much easier or faster than multiple-index queries. Second, this index structure can be used for a quick-and-dirty proximity search: the closest points are often among the closest geohashes.\n\nUsing the hash codice_3 as an example, here is how it is decoded into a decimal latitude and longitude\n\nThe first step is decoding it from base 32 using the following character map:\n\nThis operation results in the bits 01101 11111 11000 00100 00010. Assuming that counting starts at 0 in the left side, the even bits are taken for the longitude code (0111110000000), while the odd bits are taken for the latitude code (101111001001).\n\nEach binary code is then used in a series of divisions, considering one bit at a time, again from the left to the right side. For the latitude value, the interval -90 to +90 is divided by 2, producing two intervals: -90 to 0, and 0 to +90. Since the first bit is 1, the higher interval is chosen, and becomes the current interval. The procedure is repeated for all bits in the code. Finally, the latitude value is the center of the resulting interval. Longitudes are processed in an equivalent way, keeping in mind that the initial interval is -180 to +180.\n\nFor example, in the latitude code 101111001001, the first bit is 1, so we know our latitude is somewhere between 0 and 90. Without any more bits, we'd guess the latitude was 45, giving us an error of ±45. Since more bits are available, we can continue with the next bit, and each subsequent bit halves this error. This table shows the effect of each bit. At each stage, the relevant half of the range is highlighted in green; a low bit selects the lower range, a high bit selects the upper range.\n\nThe column “mean value” shows the latitude, simply the mean value of the range. Each subsequent bit makes this value more precise.\n\nFinal rounding should be done carefully in a way that\n\nSo while rounding 42.605 to 42.61 or 42.6 is correct, rounding to 43 is not.\n\nGeohashes can be used to find points in proximity to each other based on a common prefix. However, edge case locations close to each other but on opposite sides of the 180 degree meridian will result in Geohash codes with no common prefix (different longitudes for near physical locations). Points close by at the North and South poles will have very different geohashes (different longitudes for near physical locations).\n\nTwo close locations on either side of the Equator (or Greenwich meridian) will not have a long common prefix since they belong to different 'halves' of the world. Put simply, one location's binary latitude (or longitude) will be 011111... and the other 100000..., so they will not have a common prefix and most bits will be flipped. This can also be seen as a consequence of relying on the Z-order curve (which could more appropriately be called an N-order visit in this case) for ordering the points, as two points close-by might be visited at very different times. However, two points with a long common prefix will be close-by.\n\nIn order to do a proximity search, one could compute the southwest corner (low geohash with low latitude and longitude) and northeast corner (high geohash with high latitude and longitude) of a bounding box and search for geohashes between those two. This will retrieve all points in the z-order curve between the two corners, which can be far too many points, this also breaks down at the 180 meridians and the poles. Solr uses a filter list of prefixes, by computing the prefixes of the nearest squares close to the geohash .\n\nSince a geohash (in this implementation) is based on coordinates of longitude and latitude the distance between two geohashes reflects the distance in latitude/longitude coordinates between two points, which does not translate to actual distance, see Haversine formula.\n\nExample of non-linearity for latitude-longitude system:\n\nNote that these limitations are not due to geohashing, and not due to latitude-longitude coordinates, but due to the difficulty of mapping coordinates on a sphere (non linear and with wrapping of values, similar to modulo arithmetic) to two dimensional coordinates and the difficulty of exploring a two dimensional space uniformly. The first is related to Geographical coordinate system and Map projection, and the other to Hilbert curve and z-order curve. Once a coordinate system is found that represents points linearly in distance and wraps up at the edges, and can be explored uniformly, applying geohashing to those coordinates will not suffer from the limitations above.\n\nWhile it is possible to apply geohashing to an area with a cartesian coordinate system, it would then only apply to the area where the coordinate system applies.\n\nDespite those issues, there are possible workarounds, and the algorithm has been successfully used in Elasticsearch, MongoDB, HBase, and Accumulo to implement proximity searches.\n\nAn alternative to storing Geohashes as strings in a database are Locational codes, which are also called spatial keys and similar to QuadTiles.\n\nThe Geohash algorithm was put in the public domain by its inventor in a public announcement on February 26, 2008.\n\nWhile comparable algorithms have been successfully patented and\nhad copyright claimed upon, GeoHash is based on an entirely different algorithm and approach.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57609446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57609446", "title": "Geology of Ivory Coast", "text": "Geology of Ivory Coast\n\nThe geology of Ivory Coast is almost entirely extremely ancient metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement rock between 2.1 and more than 3.5 billion years old, comprising part of the stable continental crust of the West African Craton. Near the surface, these ancient rocks have weathered into sediments and soils 20 to 45 meters thick on average, which holds much of Ivory Coast's groundwater. More recent sedimentary rocks are found along the coast. The country has extensive mineral resources such as gold, diamonds, nickel and bauxite as well as offshore oil and gas. \n\nVirtually all of Ivory Coast is underlain by very ancient rocks from the Archean and the Paleoproterozoic that form part of the West African Craton, except for Cenozoic sediments and sedimentary rocks along the coast and in offshore basins. Weathering has rendered the upper layers of ancient Precambrian crystalline basement rock into sediments and soils. \n\nThree billion year old Archean rocks are situated in the Kenema domain and the Man Shield, centered around the city of Man, Ivory Coast. The rocks are granulite and migmatite gneiss, with some granitoids and banded iron formations in remnant supracrustal belts. Archean rocks were affected by two major orogeny mountain building events, the Leonian orogeny 3.5 to 2.9 billion years ago and the Liberian orogeny 2.9 to 2.5 billion years ago. \n\nPaleoproterozoic terranes are separated from Archean rocks by the Sassandra mylonitic zone. The Baoule-Mossi domain in eastern Ivory Coast continues into Ghana and includes northeast-southwest trending volcanic belts, with sedimentary basins in between. The 2.9 to 2.15 billion year old volcanic belts formed from a tholeiitic magma series that experienced low-grade metamorphism and was intruded by granitoids. The sedimentary basins have isoclinal folding and contain dacite volcaniclastic rocks, greywacke and argillite. \n\nCentral Ivory Coast has a more jumbled terrain. Volcanic belts, formed 2.1 billion years ago, lack clear spacing and do not run parallel and the intervening basins are filled with granitoids and gneisses. The quartz-pebble conglomerates, arkoses and sandstones of the Tarkwaian Group outcrop in a few isolated locations near Bondoukou in the northwest. The Eburnean orogeny, 2.1 billion years ago metamorphosed many of the Paleoproterozoic rocks, creating shear zones and intruding granitoid plutons which vary between tonalite and peraluminous granite. \n\nCoastal sedimentary basins formed as a result of the rifting apart of the supercontinent Pangaea, opening the Atlantic Ocean and now hold Ivory Coast's offshore oil and gas reserves. Clastic sediments formed throughout the Neogene and up to recent times. \n\nFractured crystalline basement rock is the main source of groundwater in Ivory Coast. Early Precambrian granite and gneiss rocks store groundwater in deep fractures and in weathered sand and clay layers at the surface, ranging between 20 to 30 meters thick and occasionally as much as 60 meters. Near surface weathering in cocoa producing regions of the country has resulted in a layer of clay and argillaceous material, with low permeability and limited groundwater, in Late Precambrian Birrimian aquifers. The schists typically have a 45 meter thickness of weathered material. Water does occur 20 to 30 meters deep in sands and in cracks in the volcanic rock. Well drilling teams need to remove clay from the borehole to prevent fine particles from blocking well screens. \n\nAlong the coast, Ivory Coast has a deep, high transmissivity and unconfined sedimentary aquifer formed in the Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene. It is overlain by Quaternary marine sands formed in the last 2.5 million years. This high productivity aquifer recharges quickly from rainfall and has a lower layer of clay that often separates freshwater from saline water. \n\nIvory Coast has significant mineral deposits, but mining has not played a major role in the economy of Ivory Coast. Gold is one of the most notable resources. Native gold is hosted in steeply dipping quartz veins near the boundaries of volcanic belts and sedimentary basins, disseminated in massive sulfide deposits or as alluvial gold in river gravels. In other cases, paleoplacer alluvial gold is included in conglomerates and sericite and quartz schist in the Tarkwaian Group. The Aniuri Mine in southeast Ivory Coast is an example of auriferous quartz veins in the Afema shear zone (a continuation of the Bibiani shear zone from Ghana). Babadougou and Toulepleu both have alluvial gold mines. \n\nDiamonds are also found in alluvial deposits, south of Korhoga at Tortiya as well as at Seguela. Kanangone, Seguela and Tortiya all have kimberlite dikes but none contain diamonds. Iron is another important resource in Ivory Coast. The Monogaga deposit near Sassandra is a Minette Oolitic type iron deposit formed in the Miocene and Pliocene and has a 40% iron concentration. Mt. Gao, Segaye, Tia, Tortro and Klahoyo all have Lake Superior type magnetite deposits. Biankoumo has nickel-rich laterite soils atop amphibolite gneisses, close to the border with Guinea. In some cases, nickel deposits have appreciable amounts of cobalt. \n\nManganese occurs as carbonates, silicates and oxides and reaches concentrations of 47% in lenticular bodies, drilled into in the northwest of the country. Underlying phyllite and gondite became enriched in manganese near the Blafa-Gueto hills and Mokta, forming the residual caps. Ivory Coast also has bauxite, nickel and copper deposits associated platinum group minerals, as well as titanium and tantalite in beach sands. Ivory Coast also has modest offshore oil and gas reserves. \n"}
{"id": "372051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=372051", "title": "Gethsemane", "text": "Gethsemane\n\nGethsemane (, \"Gethsemane\"; , \"Gat Shmanim\"; , \"Gaḏ Šmānê\", lit. \"oil press\") is an urban garden at the foot of the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, most famous as the place where Jesus prayed and his disciples slept the night before his crucifixion; i.e. the site recorded as where the agony in the garden took place.\n\n\"Gethsemane\" appears in the Greek original of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark as Γεθσημανή (\"Gethsēmanē\"). The name is derived from the Aramaic ܓܕܣܡܢ (Gaḏ-Šmānê), meaning \"oil press\". and call it χωρἰον (18:1), meaning a place or estate. The Gospel of John says Jesus entered a garden (κῆπος) with his disciples.\n\nAccording to the New Testament it was a place that Jesus and his disciples customarily visited, which allowed Judas to find him on the night of his arrest.\n\nThere are four locations claimed to be the place where Jesus prayed on the night he was betrayed.\n\nWilliam McClure Thomson, author of \"The Land and the Book\", first published in 1880, wrote: \"When I first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its very old olive trees. The Latins, however, have within the last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall around it. The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north of it. My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and dismal night. I am inclined to place the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of the present Gethsemane.\"\n\nAll of the foregoing is based on long-held tradition and the conflating of the synoptic accounts of Mark (14:31) and Matthew (26:36) with the Johannine account (John 18:1). Mark and Matthew record that Jesus went to \"a place called the oil press (Gethsemane)\" and John states he went to a garden near the Kidron Valley. Modern scholarship acknowledges that the exact location of Gethsemane is unknown.\n\nAccording to Luke , Jesus' anguish on the Mount of Olives (Luke does not mention Gethsemane; Luke 22:39–40) was so deep that \"his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\"\n\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, Gethsemane is the garden where the Virgin Mary was buried and was assumed into heaven after her dormition on Mount Zion.\n\nThe Garden of Gethsemane became a focal site for early Christian pilgrims. It was visited in 333 by the anonymous \"Pilgrim of Bordeaux\", whose \"Itinerarium Burdigalense\" is the earliest description left by a Christian traveler in the Holy Land. In his \"Onomasticon\", Eusebius of Caesarea notes the site of Gethsemane located \"at the foot of the Mount of Olives\", and he adds that \"the faithful were accustomed to go there to pray\".\n\nEight ancient olive trees growing in the Latin site of the garden may be 900 years old (see below).\n\nIn 1681 Croatian knights of the Holy Order of Jerusalem, Paul, Antun and James bought the Gethsemane Garden and donated it to the Franciscan community, who owns it until this day. A three-dimensional plate on the right side next to the entrance to the garden describes the aforementioned gift to the community..\n\nA study conducted by the National Research Council of Italy in 2012 found that several olive trees in the garden are amongst the oldest known to science. Dates of 1092, 1166 and 1198 AD were obtained by carbon dating from older parts of the trunks of three trees. DNA tests show that the trees were originally planted from the same parent plant. This could indicate an attempt to keep the lineage of an older species intact. Then again, the three trees tested could have been sprouts reviving from the older roots. \"The results of tests on trees in the Garden of Gethsemane have not settled the question of whether the gnarled trees are the very same which sheltered Jesus because olive trees can grow back from roots after being cut down\", researchers said.\n\nHowever Bernabei writes, \"All the tree trunks are hollow inside so that the central, older wood is missing . . . In the end, only three from a total of eight olive trees could be successfully dated. The dated ancient olive trees do, however, not allow any hypothesis to be made with regard to the age of the remaining five giant olive trees.\" Babcox said that the roots of the oldest trees are possibly much older and then points out the traditional claim that the trees are two thousand years old.\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n"}

{"id": "496213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=496213", "title": "Henry Schoolcraft", "text": "Henry Schoolcraft\n\nHenry Rowe Schoolcraft (March 28, 1793 – December 10, 1864) was an American geographer, geologist, and ethnologist, noted for his early studies of Native American cultures, as well as for his 1832 expedition to the source of the Mississippi River. He is also noted for his major six-volume study of Native Americans published in the 1850s.\n\nHe served as United States Indian agent in Michigan for a period beginning in 1822. There he married Jane Johnston, mixed-race daughter of a prominent Scotch-Irish fur trader and Ojibwa mother, herself a daughter of Ojibwa war chief Waubojeeg. Jane taught Schoolcraft the Ojibwe language and much about her maternal culture. They had several children, two of whom survived past childhood. She is now recognized as the first Native American literary writer in the United States.\n\nIn 1846 the widower Schoolcraft was commissioned by Congress for a major study, known as \"Indian Tribes of the United States\", which was published in six volumes from 1851 to 1857. He married again in 1847, to Mary Howard, from a slaveholding family in South Carolina. In 1860 she published the bestselling \"\", an anti-\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" novel.\n\nSchoolcraft was born in 1793 in Guilderland, Albany County, New York, the son of Lawrence Schoolcraft and Margaret-Anne Barbara (née Rowe) Schoolcraft. He entered Union College at age 15 and later attended Middlebury College. He was especially interested in geology and mineralogy.\n\nHis father was a glassmaker, and Schoolcraft initially studied and worked in the same industry. He wrote his first paper on the topic, \"Vitreology\" (1817). After working in several glass works in New York, Vermont and New Hampshire, the young Schoolcraft left the family business at age 25 to explore the western frontier.\n\nFrom November 18 to February 1819, Schoolcraft and his companion Levi Pettibone made an expedition from Potosi, Missouri, to what is now Springfield. They traveled further down the White River into Arkansas, making a survey of the geography, geology, and mineralogy of the area. Schoolcraft published this study in \"A View of the Lead Mines of Missouri\" (1819). In this book he correctly identified the potential for lead deposits in the region; Missouri eventually became the number one lead-producing state. (French colonists had previously developed a lead mine outside St. Louis in the 18th century.) He also published \"Journal of a Tour into the Interior of Missouri and Arkansaw\" (1821), the first written account of a European-American exploration of the Ozarks.\n\nThis expedition and his resulting publications brought Schoolcraft to the attention of the Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, who considered him \"a man of industry, ambition, and insatiable curiosity.\" Calhoun recommended him to the Michigan Territorial Governor, Lewis Cass, for a position on an expedition led by Cass to explore the wilderness region of Lake Superior and the lands west to the Mississippi River. Beginning in the spring of 1820, Schoolcraft served as a geologist on the Lewis Cass expedition. Beginning in Detroit, they traveled nearly along Lake Huron and Lake Superior, west to the Mississippi River, down the river to present-day Iowa, and then returning to Detroit after tracing the shores of Lake Michigan.\n\nThe expedition was intended to establish the source of the Mississippi River, and in part to settle the question of an undetermined boundary between the United States and British Canada. The expedition traveled as far upstream as Upper Red Cedar Lake in present-day Minnesota. Since low water precluded navigating farther upstream, the lake was designated the river's headwaters, and renamed in honor of Cass. (Schoolcraft noted, however, that locals informed the expedition that it was possible to navigate by canoe farther upstream earlier in the year, when water levels were higher.) Schoolcraft's account of the expedition was published as \"A Narrative Journal of Travels Through the Northwestern Regions...to the Sources of the Mississippi River\" (1821).\n\nIn 1821 he was a member of another government expedition that traveled through Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. In 1832, he led a second expedition to the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Arriving a month earlier than had the 1820 expedition, he was able to take advantage of higher water to navigate to Lake Itasca.\n\nSchoolcraft met his first wife Jane Johnston soon after being assigned in 1822 to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, as the first US Indian agent in the region. Two years before, the government had built Fort Brady and wanted to establish an official presence to forestall any renewed British threat following the War of 1812. The government tried to ensure against British agitation of the Ojibwa.\n\nJane Johnston was the eldest daughter of John Johnston, a prominent Scots-Irish fur trader, and his wife \"Ozhaguscodaywayquay\" (Susan Johnston), daughter of a leading Ojibwe chief, \"Waubojeeg,\" and his wife. Both of the Johnstons were of high status; they had eight children together, and their cultured, wealthy family was well known in the area.\n\nJane was also known as \"Bamewawagezhikaquay\" (Woman of the Sound the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky). Her knowledge of the Ojibwe language and culture, which she shared with Schoolcraft, formed in part the source material for Longfellow's epic poem \"The Song of Hiawatha\".\n\nJane and Henry had four children together:\nThe Schoolcrafts sent Janee and John to a boarding school in Detroit for part of their education. Janee at 11 could handle the transition, but John at nine had a more difficult time and missed his parents.\n\nThe Schoolcrafts had a literary marriage, producing a family magazine. They included their own poetry in letters to each other through the years. Jane suffered from frequent illnesses. She died in 1842, while visiting a sister in Canada, and was buried at St. John's Anglican Church, Ancaster, Ontario.\n\nOn January 12, 1847, after moving to Washington, DC, Schoolcraft married again, at age 53, to Mary Howard (died March 12, 1878). She was a southerner and slaveholder, from an elite planter family of the Beaufort district of South Carolina. Her support of slavery and opposition to mixed-race unions created strains in her relationship with the Schoolcraft children. They became alienated from both her and their father.\n\nAfter Schoolcraft's hands became paralyzed in 1848 from a rheumatic condition, Mary devoted much of her attention to caring for him and helping him complete his massive study of American Indians, which had been commissioned by Congress in 1846.\n\nIn 1860, she published the novel \"\" (which she said her husband had encouraged). One of many pro-slavery books published in response to Harriet Beecher Stowe's bestselling \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", such defenses of slavery, published in the decade before the American Civil War, became known as the anti-Tom genre. Hers became a best-seller, although not on the scale of Stowe's.\n\nSchoolcraft began his ethnological research in 1822 during his appointment as US Indian agent at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. He had responsibility for tribes in what is now northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. From his wife Jane Johnston, Schoolcraft learned the Ojibwe language, as well as much of the lore of the tribe and its culture.\n\nSchoolcraft created \"The Muzzeniegun, or Literary Voyager\", a family magazine which he and Jane produced in the winter of 1826–1827 and circulated among friends (\"muzzeniegun\" being Ojibwe for book). It contained mostly his own writings, although he did include a few pieces from his wife and a few other locals. Although they produced only single issues, each was distributed widely to residents in Sault Ste. Marie, then to Schoolcraft's friends in Detroit, New York, and other eastern cities. Jane Johnston Schoolcraft used the pen names of \"Rosa\" and \"Leelinau\" as personae to write about different aspects of Indian culture.\n\nSchoolcraft was elected to the legislature of the Michigan Territory, where he served from 1828 to 1832. In 1832, he traveled again to the upper reaches of the Mississippi to settle continuing troubles between the Ojibwe and Dakota (Sioux) nations. He worked to talk to as many Native American leaders as possible to maintain the peace. He was also provided with a surgeon and given instructions to begin vaccinating Indians against smallpox. He determined that smallpox had been unknown among the Ojibwe before the return in 1750 of a war party that had contact with Europeans on the East Coast. They had gone to Montreal to assist the French against the British in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War).\n\nDuring the voyage, Schoolcraft took the opportunity to explore the region, making the first accurate map of the Lake District around western Lake Superior. He discovered the true headwaters of the Mississippi River in Lake Itasca, a name which he coined from the Latin words \"veritas meaning 'truth' and caput\" meaning 'head'. The nearby Schoolcraft River, the first major tributary of the Mississippi, was later named in his honor. United States newspapers widely covered this expedition. Schoolcraft followed up with a personal account of the discovery with his book, \"Narrative of an Expedition Through the Upper Mississippi River to Itasca Lake\" (1834).\n\nAfter his territory for Indian Affairs was greatly increased in 1833, Schoolcraft and his wife Jane moved to Mackinac Island, the new headquarters of his administration. In 1836, he was instrumental in settling land disputes with the Ojibwe. He worked with them to accomplish the Treaty of Washington (1836), by which they ceded to the United States a vast territory of more than 13 million acres (53,000 km²), worth many millions of dollars. He believed that the Ojibwe would be better off learning to farm and giving up their wide hunting lands. The government agreed to pay subsidies and provide supplies while the Ojibwe made a transition to a new way of living, but its provision of the promised subsidies was often late and underfunded. The Ojibwe suffered as a result.\n\nIn 1838 pursuant to the terms of the treaty, Schoolcraft oversaw the construction of the Indian Dormitory on Mackinac Island. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It provided temporary housing to the Ojibwe who came to Mackinac Island to receive annuities during their transition to what was envisioned by the US government as a more settled way of life.\n\nIn 1839 Schoolcraft was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northern Department. He began a series of Native American studies later published as the \"Algic Researches\" (2 vols., 1839). These included his collection of Native American stories and legends, many of which his wife Jane Johnston Schoolcraft told him or translated for him from her culture.\n\nWhile in Michigan, Schoolcraft became a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan in its early years. In this position he helped establish the state university's financial organization.\n\nSchoolcraft founded and contributed to the first United States journal on public education, \"The Journal of Education.\" He also published \"The Souvenir of the Lakes\", the first literary magazine in Michigan.\n\nSchoolcraft named many of Michigan's counties and locations within the former Michigan Territory. He named Leelanau County, Michigan after his wife's pen name of \"Leelinau\". For those counties established in 1840, he often created \"faux\" Indian names. In names such as Alcona, Algoma, Allegan, Alpena, Arenac, Iosco, Kalkaska, Leelanau, Lenawee, Oscoda and Tuscola, for example, Schoolcraft combined words and syllables from Native American languages with words and syllables from Latin and Arabic. Lake Itasca, the source lake of the Mississippi River, is another example of his \"faux\" Indian names.\n\nWhen the Whig Party came to power in 1841 with the election of William Henry Harrison, Schoolcraft lost his political position as Indian agent. He and Jane moved to New York. She died the next year during a visit with a sister in Canada, while Schoolcraft was traveling in Europe.\n\nHe continued to write about Native Americans. In 1846 Congress commissioned him to develop a comprehensive reference work on American Indian tribes. Schoolcraft traveled to England to request the services of George Catlin to illustrate his proposed work, as the latter was widely regarded as the premier illustrator of Indian life. Schoolcraft was deeply disappointed when Catlin refused. Schoolcraft later engaged the artist Seth Eastman, a career Army officer, as illustrator. An Army brigadier general, Eastman was renowned for his paintings of Native American peoples. He had two extended assignments at Fort Snelling in present-day Minnesota, the second time as commander of the fort, and had closely studied, drawn and painted the people of the Indian cultures of the Great Plains.\n\nSchoolcraft worked for years on the history and survey of the Indian tribes of the United States. It was published in six volumes from 1851-1857 by J. B. Lippincott & Co. of Philadelphia. Critics praised its scholarship and valuable content by Schoolcraft, and the meticulous and knowledgeable illustrations by Eastman. Critics also noted the work's shortcomings, including a lack of index, and poor organization, which made the information almost inaccessible. Almost 100 years later, in 1954, the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution prepared and published an index to the volumes.

It is divided into 12 floristic provinces according to the work of Armen Takhtajan, a Soviet-Armenian botanist who created a classification system for flowering plants. One of the main characteristics of the region is a great diversity and abundance of species, especially in the Iranian Plateau. The region's climate is predominantly continental, with the rainy season either in winter or spring to early summer.\n"}
{"id": "7955644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7955644", "title": "J. Ross Mackay", "text": "J. Ross Mackay\n\nJohn Ross Mackay, (偕約翰, December 31, 1915 – October 28, 2014) was a Canadian geographer. He is most noted for his explorations of permafrost phenomena in the western Canadian Arctic. His 40 plus years of study has enabled the building of pipeline operations and petroleum explorations in areas of frozen ground. The Royal Society of Canada stated the following when Mackay was awarded the Willet G. Miller Medal in 1975:\n\nMackay was born in Formosa (Taiwan) (then under Japanese rule) to George William Mackay and Jean Ross Mackay, as well as brother to siblings Leslie, Anna, Margaret and Isabel Minnie (1917-2012). His grandfather was George Leslie Mackay, who was instrumental in bringing Christianity and public health care to Northern Taiwan (Formosa). The Mackay Memorial Hospital was named after his ancestor.\n\nMackay completed a B.A. at Clark University in 1939. He obtained an M.A. from Boston University in 1941. That same year he left his studies to join the war effort. Mackay enlisted in the Canadian Army. Mackay completed training near Toronto and further training as a private (gunner) at a large artillery camp in Petawawa, on the Ottawa River. He was commissioned an Officer (Lieutenant) by 1942. Before the Second World War ended he attained the rank of Major in the Canadian Intelligence Corps. He was stationed in Ottawa until he was discharged in 1946.\n\nIn September 1946 Mackay joined McGill University's Department of Geography as an Assistant Professor. His first paper on \"The North Shore of the Ottawa River, Quyon to Montebello, Quebec\" was published in the Revue Canadienne de Geographie, Volume 1 in 1947. In 1949 he obtained a Ph.D. from the Université de Montréal. Later that year he accepted a position at the University of British Columbia as an Assistant Professor with the Department of Geology and Geography. In 1953 Mackay was promoted to Associate Professor and became a full Professor in 1957.\n\nMackay gained international scientific recognition through his experimental and field investigations in geography, and especially on the topic of permafrost.

{"id": "398416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=398416", "title": "Map–territory relation", "text": "Map–territory relation\n\nThe map–territory relation describes the relationship between an object and a representation of that object, as in the relation between a geographical territory and a map of it. Polish-American scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski remarked that \"the map is not the territory\" and that \"the word is not the thing\", encapsulating his view that an abstraction derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse models of reality with reality itself. The relationship has also been expressed in other terms, such as Alan Watts's \"The menu is not the meal.\"\n\nThe expression first appeared in print in \"A Non-Aristotelian System and its Necessity for Rigour in Mathematics and Physics\", a paper that Alfred Korzybski gave at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 28, 1931. The paper was reprinted in \"Science and Sanity\", 1933, pp. 747–61. In this book, Korzybski acknowledges his debt to mathematician Eric Temple Bell, whose epigram \"the map is not the thing mapped\" was published in \"Numerology\".\n\nThe Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte illustrated the concept of \"perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves\" in a number of paintings including a famous work entitled \"The Treachery of Images\", which consists of a drawing of a pipe with the caption, \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\" (\"This is not a pipe\").\n\nIn \"The Medium Is the Message\", Marshall McLuhan expanded this argument to electronic media. Media representations, especially on screens, are abstractions, or virtual \"extensions\" of what our sensory channels, bodies, thinking and feeling do for us in real life.\n\nThis concept occurs in the discussion of exoteric and esoteric religions. Exoteric concepts are concepts which can be fully conveyed using descriptors and language constructs, such as mathematics. Esoteric concepts are concepts which cannot be fully conveyed except by direct experience. For example, a person who has never tasted an apple will never fully understand through language what the taste of an apple is. Only through direct experience (eating an apple) can that experience be fully understood.\n\nLewis Carroll, in \"Sylvie and Bruno Concluded\" (1893), made the point humorously with his description of a fictional map that had \"the scale of a mile to the mile\". A character notes some practical difficulties with such a map and states that \"we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.\"\n\nJorge Luis Borges's one-paragraph short story \"On Exactitude in Science\" (1946) also describes a map that has the same scale as its territory, here an entire empire where cartography has become exactingly precise.\n\nLaura Riding, in her poem \"The Map of Places\" (1927), deals with this relation: \"The map of places passes. The reality of paper tears.\"\n\nThe University of Cambridge economist Joan Robinson (1962) emphasized the disutility of 1:1 maps and other overly detailed models: \"A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one.\"\n\nKorzybski's argument about the map and the territory also influenced the Belgian surrealist writer of comics Jan Bucquoy for a storyline in his comic \"Labyrinthe\": a map can never guarantee that one will find the way out, because the accumulation of events can change the way one looks at reality.\n\nHistorian of religions J. Z. Smith wrote a book entitled \"Map Is not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions\" (1978, University of Chicago Press 1993 paperback: ).\n\nAuthor Robert M. Pirsig uses the idea both theoretically and literally in his book \"\" when the main character/author becomes temporarily lost due to an over reliance on a map, rather than the territory that the map describes.\n\nIn 2010, French author Michel Houellebecq published his novel, \"La carte et le territoire\", translated into English as \"The Map and the Territory\". The title was a reference to Alfred Korzybski's aphorism. The novel was awarded the French literary prize, the Prix Goncourt.\n\nRobert Anton Wilson, in his book \"Prometheus Rising\", also makes this point about the map not being reality. He explicitly attempts to explain this important principle to the reader.\n\nThe mathematician James A. Lindsay made the idea that the map is not reality a primary theme of his 2013 book \"Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly\". In it, he argues that all of our scientific theories, mathematics, and even the idea of God are conceptual maps often confused \"for the terrain\" they attempt to explain. In a foreword to the book, physicist Victor J. Stenger expresses agreement with this point of view.\n\nIn 2017, Ugly Duckling Presse published a book of poetry by Marília Garcia called \"The Territory Is Not the Map\", translated from the Portuguese (\"O país não é o mapa\") by Hilary Kaplan. \n\nYuval Noah Harari's 2018 book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, has a description of people following directions from their navigation software and driving into the ocean. \n\nGregory Bateson, in \"Form, Substance and Difference\", from \"Steps to an Ecology of Mind\" (1972), argued the essential impossibility of knowing what any actual territory is. Any understanding of any territory is based on one or more sensory channels reporting adequately but imperfectly:\n\nElsewhere in that same volume, Bateson argued that the usefulness of a map (a representation of reality) is not necessarily a matter of its literal truthfulness, but its having a structure analogous, for the purpose at hand, to the territory. Bateson argued this case at some length in the essay \"The Theology of Alcoholics Anonymous\".\n\nTo paraphrase Bateson's argument, a culture that believes that common colds are transmitted by evil spirits, that those spirits fly out of you when you sneeze, can pass from one person to another when they are inhaled or when both handle the same objects, etc., could have just as effective a \"map\" for public health as one that substituted microbes for spirits.\n\nAnother basic quandary is the problem of accuracy. Jorge Luis Borges' \"On Exactitude in Science\" describes the tragic uselessness of the perfectly accurate, one-to-one map:\n\nA more extreme literary example, the fictional diary of Tristram Shandy is so detailed that it takes the author one \"year\" to set down the events of a single \"day\" – because the map (diary) is more detailed than the territory (life), yet must fit into the territory (diary written in the course of his life), it can never be finished. Such tasks are referred to as supertasks.\n\nWith this quotation of Josiah Royce, Borges describes a further conundrum of when the map is contained within the territory, you are led into infinite regress:\n\nNeil Gaiman retells the parable in reference to storytelling in \"Fragile Things\" (it was originally to appear in \"American Gods\"):\n\nThe development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the simulation of ideas as encoded in electronic signals, as Baudrillard argues in \"Simulacra and Simulation\" (1994, p. 1):\n\nThe philosopher David Schmidtz draws on this distinction in his book \"Elements of Justice\", apparently deriving it from Wittgenstein's private language argument.\n\nThe fundamental trade-off between accuracy and usability of a map, particularly in the context of modelling, is known as Bonini's paradox, and has been stated in various forms, poetically by Paul Valéry: \"Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable.\"\n\n"}

He was a member of the patrician Basel Merian family.\n\nBorn in Basel, Merian learned the art of copperplate engraving in Zürich. He next worked and studied in Strasbourg, Nancy, and Paris, before returning to Basel in 1615. The following year he moved to Oppenheim, Germany where he worked for the publisher Johann Theodor de Bry, who was the son of renowned engraver and traveler Theodor de Bry.\n\nIn 1617, Merian married Maria Magdalena de Bry, daughter of the publisher, and was for a time associated with the de Bry publishing house. In 1620, when Oppenheim was destroyed by fire during the Spanish occupation, they moved back to Basel, but three years later returned to Germany, this time to Frankfurt. They had four daughters and three sons, including Matthäus Merian the Younger. Maria Magdalena de Bry died in 1645 and the following year Matthäus married Johanna Catharina Hein. Five years later, Matthäus died, leaving his wife with two small children, Anna Maria Sibylla Merian (born 1647) who later became a pioneering naturalist and illustrator and a son, Maximilian, who died before his third birthday.\n\nIn 1623 Merian took over the publishing house of his father-in-law after de Bry's death. In 1626 he became a citizen of Frankfurt and could henceforth work as an independent publisher. He spent most of his working life in Frankfurt.\n\nEarly in his life, he had created detailed town plans in his unique style, e.g. a plan of Basel (1615) and a plan of Paris (1615). With Martin Zeiler (1589 - 1661), a German geographer, and later (circa 1640) with his own son, Matthäus Merian (\"der Jüngere\", i.e. \"the Younger\" or \"Jr.\") (1621 - 1687), he produced a series of \"Topographia\". The 21-volume set was collectively known as the \"Topographia Germaniae\". It includes numerous town plans and views, as well as maps of most countries and a World Map—it was such a popular work that it was re-issued in many editions. He also took over and completed the later parts and editions of the \"Grand Voyages\" and \"Petits Voyages\", originally started by de Bry in 1590.\n\nMerian's work inspired the \"Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna\" by Erik Dahlberg. The German travel magazine \"Merian\" is named after him.\n\nHe was also noted for the finesse of his alchemical illustrations, in books such as the \"Musaeum Hermeticum\" (1678) and \"Atalanta Fugiens\" (1618).\n\nMatthäus Merian died after several years of illness in 1650 in Langenschwalbach, near Wiesbaden.\n\nAfter his death, his sons Matthäus Jr. and Caspar took over the publishing house. They continued publishing the \"Topographia Germaniae\" and the \"Theatrum Europaeum\" under the name \"Merian Erben\" (i.e. Merian Heirs).\n\n\n\n"}

He has two daughters.\n\nHe has written academic papers and books on chalk grassland, on the vegetation and archaeology of Thailand (and on the rest of southeast Asia), on ecology and biogeography (e.g. his textbook 'Historical Plant Geography'), on fire ecology on lichens and mosses, on tropical rain forest and on the construction of environmental knowledge.\n\nHe is currently chairman of The Anglo-Thai Society, UK.

He believes that the Kyoto Protocol is moribund politically . Stott is concerned that the UK is failing to address its core energy needs, which must involve a mix of clean coal, gas, and probably nuclear power. Stott also encourages development of energy infrastructure in the developing world.

{"id": "3560872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3560872", "title": "Skarpnäcksfältet", "text": "Skarpnäcksfältet\n\nSkarpnäcksfältet () is a subdistrict of Skarpnäcks Gård in the Skarpnäck borough of Stockholm, Sweden. Skarpnäcksfältet was built in the 1980s, and has 8,734 inhabitants as of December 31, 2009. \n\nArchaeological findings, such as a hill fort and stone circles near Flatensjön, indicate that Skarpnäcksfältet and nearby areas were populated by vikings as early as the 10th century.\n\nSkarpa, a cottage of the Årsta property, was first mentioned in the will of Duke Valdemar in 1318, where it was listed as one of his donations to Uppsala domkyrka. Skarpa derives from the word \"skarp\" (), and is believed to have indicated the soil quality, which was heavy loam. It is believed that the small village of Skarpa by, with the Skarpa cottage, also consisted of three homesteads dating as far back as the 13th century.\nAccording to a document from 1432, Skarpa was sold by the Archdiocese of Uppsala to Hans Kröpelin, the chieftain of Eric of Pomerania, who was the King of Sweden at the time. Like in the will of Duke Valdemar, Skarpa was part of the Årsta property.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the land and cottages of Skarpa by were included in the Tyresö property. Tyresö was owned by the Oxenstierna family, which constructed a mansion in Skarpa by. A countess of the family (Maria Sofia de la Gardie) made Skarpa a manor () which she named \"Skarpnäck\". The manor continued to grow in the 18th century, now housing workers and farmers. The manor switched owners a few times, and in the beginning of the 19th century, there were almost 30 buildings in Skarpnäcks gård. The last owner, Friedrich Neumüller, constructed the main building which still exists today, roughly 150 years later. Eventually, in 1922, the property was sold to the Stockholm Municipality.\n\nThe Skarpnäck Airfield was constructed on Skarpnäcksfältet around 1940. Originally intended to be a reserve airfield for the military, those plans were soon abandoned, and in 1943, \"Stockholms Segelflygklubb\" () moved its operations to the airfield. The airfield was commonly used for other activities, including balloon flying, races such as the 1948 Stockholm Grand Prix, baseball and greyhound racing.\n\nThe airfield became a centre for alternative society movements. In August 1950, the International Union of Socialist Youth, together with the Swedish Social Democratic Youth Association, organized a week-long international tent camp, in which Tage Erlander (prime minister of Sweden), participated. During the United Nations environmental conference in 1972, which took place in Stockholm, thousands of hippies, environmental activists and leftist activists gathered in a large tent camp at Skarpnäck Airfield, organized mostly by the Hog Farm and other Woodstock veterans. This also became a large musical event, with progressive artists like Peps Persson, Kebnekajse, Blå Tåget and Träd, Gräs & Stenar playing.\n\nWith the initiative of \"Motorförarnas Helnykterhetsförbund\", a temperance organization, Sweden's first drive-in church service was held at Skarpnäck Airfield on May 30, 1957. Bishop Odd Hagen of the Methodist church spoke in front of 1,000 cars, and altogether around 6,000 people. The altar was placed on a lorry platform.\n\nIn September 1980, the Stockholm Municipality decided that a large residential area called \"Skarpnäcksstaden\" () would be constructed on the airfield. The baseball and greyhound-racing facilities remained and were included in the new residential area, but the greyhound-racing was closed in 2006 in favour of a football field of artificial turf.\n\nSkarpnäcksfältet is a subdistrict of Skarpnäcks gård in the Skarpnäck borough. However, since the area's construction in the 1980s, the police and Stockholm Municipality publish their statistics for Skarpnäcks gård separately between Skarpnäcksfältet and Pungpinan (the two subdistricts). Skarpnäcksfältet accounts for the majority of the Skarpnäcks gård district's population, and is colloquially referred to as Skarpnäck. Skarpnäcksfältet is served by a metro station named Skarpnäck, contributing to the name confusion.\n\nSkarpnäcksfältet neighbours Flaten to the southeast, Orhem to the south, Sköndal in the Farsta borough to the southwest, Pungpinan to the northwest, Bagarmossen to the north, and the nature reserve Nackareservatet in Nacka Municipality to the east.\n\nThe Skarpnäck metro station is located below ground, and has one entrance on Skarpnäcks Allé. The original plan was to have two entrances, the other one located south of the current one, but those plans were never carried out. Skarpnäck metro station opened in 1994, making it the 100th and newest station of the Stockholm Metro. Skarpnäck is the terminus of the green line 17, a role it took from Bagarmossen in 1994. A number of buses also pass through Skarpnäcksfältet – 180 between Kärrtorp and Orhem, 811 between Gullmarsplan and Älta and 816 between Gullmarsplan and Tyresö Centrum. 181 to Farsta strand, 172 to Norsborg and 173 to Skärholmen all have their terminus on Skarpnäcksfältet.\n\nThe construction of \"Skarpnäcksstaden\" began in the early 1980s. This was a few years after the finish of the Million Programme, a project designed to offer everyone a reasonably priced home by building one million dwellings in a 10-year period, 1965 to 1974. While the project succeeded, it was heavily criticized for the buildings' lack of aesthetics, the common image of a Million Programme building being a large, gray apartment complex of cement in a monotone dormitory suburb.\n\nThus, with the planning of \"Skarpnäcksstaden\", time was spent to assure that the mistakes of the Million Programme were not repeated. The area was to move away from the mass production-style of the Million Programme, instead focusing on a variation of houses and apartments. Skarpnäcksstaden was intended to be a complete small town in itself, with housing, workplaces and schools. In all, the classical elements of a small town inspired the design of Skarpnäcksfältet greatly, for instance in the structure of blocks with streets, squares and courtyards.\n\nThe characteristical orange-red brick buildings of Skarpnäcksfältet have received international attention, partially because the relatively large area consists of exclusively such buildings. Other than the apartment buildings, a number of row-houses and an industrial area were built around the same time, painted in similar colours to fit with the rest of Skarpnäcksfältet. The design, by architect Leif Blomquist, has received several awards for its extraordinarity. Skarpnäcksfältet has considerably few connections with other districts, giving it the image of a slightly isolated area, and some argue that a road to Bagarmossen with new housing developments would lead to a better integration of Skarpnäcksfältet, while others think that the nature between the two areas should be preserved.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1990, 3,390 apartments were built on Skarpnäcksfältet. On December 31, 1990, 1,419 of those were publicly owned rental apartments, 736 were privately owned rental apartments and 1,235 were condominiums. As of December 31, 2009, there are 3,564 apartments on Skarpnäcksfältet - 1,323 publicly owned rental apartments, 194 privately owned rental apartments and 2,047 condominiums. There are also 277 other dwellings, mostly row-houses.\n\nAs of December 31, 2009, there are 332 studio apartments, 1,155 two-room apartments, 1,199 three-room apartments, 816 four-room apartments and 150 five-room apartments. Most of the other 277 dwellings have four or five rooms. Given that there were many big apartments on Skarpnäcksfältet, plenty of families with children moved there, which lead to Skarpnäcksfältet having the highest child density (highest number of children per square km) in northern Europe during the mid-90s.\n\nSkarpnäcksfältet has 8,734 inhabitants as of December 31, 2009. People with a foreign background (born outside Sweden, or with both parents born outside Sweden) made up for 42.8% of Skarpnäcksfältet's population, compared to 26.6% of the entire Skarpnäck borough, and 28.7% of Stockholm as a whole.\n\nThe unemployment rate of Skarpnäcksfältet was 4.8% on October 31, 2009. In comparison, 3.8% of the Skarpnäck borough population were unemployed, and 3.6% of Stockholm as a whole. The average income on Skarpnäcksfältet was 227,000 Swedish kronor, this was below the Skarpnäck borough average of 250,200 Swedish kronor as well as the Stockholm average of 294,500 Swedish kronor.\n\n"}
