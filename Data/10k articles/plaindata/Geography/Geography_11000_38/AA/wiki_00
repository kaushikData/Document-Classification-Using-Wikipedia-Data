It was named for the Georgian town of Abastumani.\n\nIt was discovered on 3 October 1935, by Soviet–Russian astronomer Pelageya Shajn at Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. On the same night, the asteroid was independently discovered by South African astronomer Cyril Jackson at Johannesburg Observatory. It was one of the last large-sized bodies discovered in the outer belt \"(also see 1269 Rollandia and 1902 Shaposhnikov, discovered in 1930 and 1972, respectively)\".\n\nThe dark and reddish asteroid is classified as a rare P-type asteroid in the Tholen taxonomic scheme, of which only a few dozens bodies are currently known. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 3.3–3.6 AU once every 6 years and 4 months (2,326 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.03 and an inclination of 20° with respect to the ecliptic. The first used precovery was taken at Lowell Observatory in 1929, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 6 years prior to its discovery.\n\nIn April 2002, a rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observation by astronomer John Gross at the U.S. \"Sonoran Skies Observatory\" (G94) in Benson, Arizona. It gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 in magnitude ().\n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures between 98.3 and 107.8 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a very low albedo between 0.026 and 0.033. The \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link\" adopts the results obtained by IRAS, i.e. a diameter of 101.5 kilometers and an albedo of 0.0298.\n\nThis minor planet is named after the spa town of Abastumani located in the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia. It is now the place where the Abastuman Astronomical Observatory (code 119) is situated ().\n\n"}

Synagogues from before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE include Gamla, Masada and Herodium. The oldest remains of a Palestinian synagogue dates from the 1st-century CE. After the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the local synagogue became its substitute and from Late Antiquity onward, the number of synagogues discovered rise significantly, with over one hundred being unearthed in Palestine alone. Over fifty of these are situated in Galilee and on the Golan Heights.\n\nA survey conducted in the 1970s found that of the known synagogue inscriptions, 67 were in Greek and found in the coastal and major inland cities. Another 54 were in Aramaic, and 14 in Hebrew. The vast majority of inscriptions are dedicatory, while the remainder feature literary sources or are short labels for images. Decorations used on mosaic floors, capitals and lintels were symbolic of the Temple service and included the \"menorah\", \"lulav\" and \"etrog\". Lions were depicted to represent the power of God. Aside from remains found in-situ, architectural elements of the synagogues are often found to have been reused in the houses of adjacent villages. Sometimes dressed stones were transferred further afield and lintels from the doorways of ancient Palestinian synagogues are also to be found in contemporary homes in Syria.\n\nThe earliest synagogue inscription uncovered to date is in Greek and dates to the first century BCE or the first century CE. It was discovered in the City of David, just south of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem:\n\nAll of the early synagogues were purpose-built and many synagogues dating to the talmudic era onwards had annexes attached to the main structure, indicating that synagogues additionally functioned as a communal centres.\n\nModern-day synagogue architects have relied upon synagogue architecture in ancient Palestine in an attempt to create an \"identifiably Jewish style\" of synagogue design. The Henry S. Frank Memorial Synagogue in Philadelphia was inspired by the remains of the synagogue at Kfar Bar'am.\n\nBefore the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, synagogues served a different purpose that after that event. Several examples of such early synagogues from the time and territory of the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties until 70 CE have been excavated in pre-1967 Israel, on the West Bank, and one on the Golan Heights. Some are recognised as synagogues by a larger part of the scientific community, while some are very controversial. They all share only a certain number of architectural characteristics with the better-accepted post-destruction synagogues.\n\nHere is a list of all the structures from the Land of Israel/Palestine region discovered as of July 2018 and interpreted by some as Second Temple Period synagogues.

Some weeds mask a companion plant's scent, or the pheromones of pest insects, as with ground ivy, as well as oregano and other mints.\n\nSome also are unpleasant to small animals and ground insects, because of their spines or other features, keeping them away from an area to be protected.\n\nSome weeds act as trap crops, distracting pests away from valued plants. Insects often search for target plants by smell, and then land at random on anything green in the area of the scent. If they land on an edible \"weed\", they will stay there instead of going on to the intended victim. Sometimes, they actively prefer the trap crop.\n\nRecent studies on host-plant finding have shown that flying pests are far less successful if their host-plants are surrounded by any other plant or even \"decoy-plants\" made of green plastic, cardboard, or any other green material.\n\n\nOne scientific study said that simply having clover growing nearby cut the odds of cabbage root flies hitting the right plant from 36% to 7%.\n\nMany plants can grow intercropped in the same space, because they exist on different levels in the same area, providing ground cover or working as a trellis for each other. This healthier style of horticulture is called forest gardening. Larger plants provide a wind break or shelter from noonday sun for more delicate plants.\n\nConversely, some intercropped plants provide living mulch effect, used by inhibiting the growth of any weeds that are actually harmful, and creating a humid, cooler microclimate around nearby plants, stabilizing soil moisture more than they consume it for themselves.\n\nPlants such as ryegrass, red clover, and white clover are examples of \"weeds\" that are living mulches, often welcomed in horticulture.\n\nRepel plants or fungi, through a chemical means known as allelopathy. Specific other plants can be bothered by a chemical emission through their roots or air, slowing their growth, preventing seed germination, or even killing them.\n\nA common companion plant benefit from many weeds is to attract and provide habitat for beneficial insects or other organisms which benefit plants.\n\nFor example, wild umbellifers attract predatory wasps and flies. The adults eat nectar, but they feed common garden pests to their offspring .\n\nSome weeds attract lady beetles or the \"good\" types of nematode, or provide ground cover for predatory beetles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other countries also use English as their primary and official languages.\n\nIn the European Union, English is one of 24 official languages and is widely used by institutions and majority of population as native (United Kingdom and Ireland) and as a second language in other member states.\n\nEnglish is the third largest language by number of native speakers, after Mandarin and Spanish.\n\nEstimates that include second language speakers vary greatly, from 470 million to more than 1 billion. David Crystal calculates that, as of 2003, non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1. When combining native and non-native speakers, English is the most widely spoken language worldwide.\n\nBesides the major varieties of English, such as American English, British English, Canadian English, Australian English, Irish English, New Zealand English and their sub-varieties, countries such as South Africa, India, the Philippines, Jamaica and Nigeria also have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from English-based creole languages to Standard English.\n\nIndia now claims to be the world's second-largest English-speaking country. The most reliable estimate is around 10% of its population or 125 million people, second only to the US and expected to quadruple in the next decade.27 Nov 2012 (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20500312)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population\n\nThere are six large countries with a majority of native English speakers that are sometimes grouped under the term Anglosphere. In numbers of English speakers they are: the United States (at least 231 million), the United Kingdom (60 million), Canada (at least 20 million), Australia (at least 17 million), Ireland (4.8 million) and New Zealand (4.8 million). \n\nEnglish is also the primary natively spoken language in the countries and territories of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, the British Indian Ocean Territory, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Grenada, Guam, Guernsey, Guyana, the Isle of Man, Jamaica, Jersey, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nOther substantial communities of native speakers are found in South Africa (4.8 million) and Nigeria (4 million, 5%).\n\nIn some countries where English is not the most spoken language, it is an official language; these countries include Botswana, Cameroon (co-official with French), Eswatini (Swaziland), Fiji, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Liberia, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, the Federated States of Micronesia, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. There also are countries where in a part of the territory English became a co-official language, e.g. Colombia's San Andrés y Providencia and Nicaragua's Mosquito Coast. This was a result of the influence of British colonization in the area.\n\nIndia has the largest number of second-language speakers of English (\"see\" Indian English); Crystal (2004) claims that, combining native and non-native speakers, India has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world. However, most scholars and research that has been conducted dispute his assertions.\n\nEnglish is one of the eleven official languages that are given equal status in South Africa (South African English). It is also the official language in current dependent territories of Australia (Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Cocos Island) and of the United States (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico (in Puerto Rico, English is co-official with Spanish) and the US Virgin Islands), and the former British colony of Hong Kong. (See List of countries where English is an official language for more details.)\n\nAlthough the United States federal government has no official languages, English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 US state governments. Furthermore, per United States nationality law, the process of becoming a naturalized citizen of the US entails a basic English proficiency test, which may be the most prominent example of the claim of the nation not having an official language being belied by policy realities.\n\nAlthough falling short of official status, English is also an important language in several former colonies and protectorates of the United Kingdom, such as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBecause English is so widely spoken, it has often been referred to as a \"world language\", the lingua franca of the modern era, and while it is not an official language in most countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. It is, by international treaty, the official language for aeronautical and maritime communications. English is one of the official languages of the United Nations and many other international organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. It is also one of two co-official languages for astronauts (besides the Russian language) serving on board the International Space Station.\n\nEnglish is studied most often in the European Union, and the perception of the usefulness of foreign languages among Europeans is 67 percent in favour of English ahead of 17 percent for German and 16 percent for French (). Among some of the non-English-speaking EU countries, the following percentages of the adult population claimed to be able to converse in English in 2012: 90 percent in the Netherlands, 89 percent in Malta, 86 percent in Sweden and Denmark, 73 percent in Cyprus, Croatia, and Austria, 70 percent in Finland, and over 50 percent in Greece, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Germany. In 2012, excluding native speakers, 38 percent of Europeans consider that they can speak English.\n\nBooks, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world, and English is the most commonly used language in the sciences with Science Citation Index reporting as early as 1997 that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.\n\nIn publishing, English literature predominates considerably with 28 percent of all books published in the world [leclerc 2011] and 30 percent of web content in 2011 (down from 50 percent in 2000).\n\nThis increasing use of the English language globally has had a large impact on many other languages, leading to language shift and even language death, and to claims of linguistic imperialism.

{"id": "24823574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24823574", "title": "Etymology of Skye", "text": "Etymology of Skye\n\nThe etymology of Skye attempts to understand the derivation of the name of the island of Skye in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Skye's history includes the influence of Gaelic, Norse and English speaking peoples, and the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward. \n\nThe Gaelic name for the \"Isle of Skye\" is \"An t-Eilean Sgitheanach\" (or \"Sgiathanach\", a more recent and less common spelling). The meaning of this name is not clear. Various etymologies have been proposed, such as the \"winged isle\" or \"the notched isle\" but no definitive solution has been found to date and the placename may be from a substratum language and simply opaque. \n\nFor example, writing in 1549, Donald Munro, High Dean of the Isles wrote: \"This Ile is callit \"Ellan Skiannach\" in Irish, that is to say in Inglish the wyngit Ile, be reason it has mony wyngis and pointis lyand furth fra it, throw the dividing of thir foirsaid Lochis\".\n\nThis was by no means the first written reference. Roman sources refer to the \"Scitis\" (see the Ravenna Cosmography) and \"Scetis\" can be found on a map by Ptolemy. A possible derivation from \"*skitis\", an early Celtic word for \"winged\", which may describe the island's peninsulas that radiate out from a mountainous centre, has also been suggested.\nIn the Norse sagas Skye is called \"Skíð\", for example in the \"Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar\", and in a skaldic poem in \"Saga Magnús konungs berfœtts\" in the \"Heimskringla\" from c. 1230. According to other authors, it was referred to in Norse as \"skuy\" \"misty isle\", \"*skýey\", or \"skuyö\" \"cloud isle\". It is not certain whether the Gaelic poetic name for the island, \"Eilean a' Cheò\" \"isle of the mist\" precedes or postdates the Norse name. Some legends also associate the isle with the mythic figure of Queen Scáthach.\n\nThe problems with the proposed Gaelic etymologies can be summed up as follows. Firstly, the Gaelic word for \"winged\" is \"sgiathach\" and \"sgiathanach\" is not attested in Gaelic except in the place name and the ethnonym \"Sgiathanach\" \"person from Skye\". Secondly, the recorded pronunciations all point towards a clear preceding the \"-ach\" ending: , , or . This means the form \"Sgiathanach\" is very unlikely to be based on the Gaelic plural of \"wing\" (\"sgiathan\"), which contains a schwa in the last syllable () and would represent a highly unusual adjectival form based on a plural noun. Thirdly, the diminutive/nominaliser ending \"-an\" would result in , with a clear in the last syllable. This form \"sciathán\" or \"sgiathan\" is indeed attested in the modern Gaelic languages. The Old Irish attested form is \"scíath\" (cognate with modern Welsh \"ysgwydd\" \"shoulder\") with a reconstructed Celtic form *\"skeito\"-, which suggests the Irish form \"sgiathán\" is an innovation and an unlikely root for \"Sgiathanach\". Finally, deriving the name from \"Scáthach\" involves two main problems: there would be a case of unexplained palatalisation of [s̪k] to [s̪kʲ] and an unexplained extra element \"-an-\".\n\nThe roots of the Roman and Greek forms, \"Scit-\" and \"Scet-\" (meaning unknown), could be the root of \"Sgitheanach\" as they would regularly develop into Old Gaelic [s̪gʲiθ-] and be an entirely logical source for the attested Norse \"Skíð\". It would also lead to modern \"Sgitheanach\" via a regular suffigation of \"-an\" and \"-ach\" to form an ethnonym and adjective. This would also explain the use of an apparent root form in \"An Cuan Sgith(e)\" The Minch (the strait separating the Outer Hebrides from the Inner Hebrides) and the older Irish form of \"Scíth\" rather than the modern \"An tOileán Sgiathanach\", for example: \"Do ṡiuḃal sé Scíṫ agus an dá Uiḃeast agus Beinn a’ Ṁaola...\" \"He travelled Skye and the two Uists and Benbecula...\". In this case the interpretation of the name as \"winged\" may simply be a case of folk etymology.\n\nIn April 2007 it was reported in the media that the island's official name had been changed by the Highland Council to \"Eilean a' Cheò\". However, the Council clarified that this name referred only to one of its 22 wards in the then impending election, and that there were no plans to change signage or discontinue the English name.\n"}

Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Thutmose IV was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.\"\n\nModern Giza's layout is accessed by two main roads.

Dominating the plateau and running in a southwest diagonal through the site are the three pyramids of the pharaohs Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura. The northernmost, and the largest, one belongs to Khufu. Khafra's pyramid is built precisely on a southwest diagonal to his father's pyramid, as well as having been built on higher ground to create the illusion of being bigger. The pyramid of Menkaura is much smaller and is not aligned along the same diagonal line as the other two pyramids. On a clear day the Pyramids of Abusir can be seen from the Giza Plateau.

{"id": "1985810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1985810", "title": "Golden Crescent", "text": "Golden Crescent\n\nThe Golden Crescent is the name given to one of Asia's two principal areas of illicit opium production (with the other being the Golden Triangle), located at the crossroads of Central, South, and Western Asia. This space overlaps three nations, Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan, whose mountainous peripheries define the crescent.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) heroin production estimates for the past 10 years show significant changes in the primary source areas. In 1991, Afghanistan became the world's primary opium producer, with a yield of 1,782 metric tons (U.S. State Department estimates), surpassing Myanmar, formerly the world leader in opium production. The decrease in heroin production from Myanmar is the result of several years of unfavorable growing conditions and new government policies of forced eradication. Afghan heroin production increased during the same time frame, with a notable decrease in 2001 allegedly as a result of the Taliban's fatwa against heroin production. Afghanistan now produces over 90% of the world's \"non-pharmaceutical-grade\" opium. In addition to opiates, Afghanistan is also the world's largest producer of hashish.\n\nThe Golden Crescent has a much longer history of opium production than does Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle emerged as a modern-day opium-producing entity only in the 1980s, after the Golden Crescent did so in the 1950s. The Golden Triangle began making an impact on the opium and morphine market in the 1980s and has steadily increased its output since then in order to match the increasing demand. During the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, a retaliation to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the Golden Crescent’s opium production took a huge hit, producing almost 90% less opium than in 2000. \n\nAt the peak of its opium production in 2007, the Golden Crescent produced more than 8,000 of the world’s almost 9,000 total tons of opium, a near monopoly. The Golden Crescent also dominates the cannabis resin market due to the high resin yields of the region (145 kg/ha), four times more than Morocco (36 kg/ha). The Golden Crescent also caters to a much larger market, about 64% more than the Golden Triangle. It produces and distributes over 2,500 tons of opiates to Africa, Europe, the Americas and Central Asia and supplies almost 9.5 million opiate users worldwide. \n\nDespite worldwide efforts to capture and seize as much opium product as possible, total opiate seizures only brought in 23.5% of the total estimated product distributed worldwide. Of these seizures around 97% of opium and morphine seizures are made in the Middle East and heroin seizures are made mostly in the Middle East or Europe. In Afghanistan only one percent of the heroin that is exported illegally is intercepted and destroyed by the national governments. Although Afghanistan is the major producer of opiates in the Golden Crescent, most of the seizures are made in Iran, their neighbor to the west. This is because traffickers are arrested while crossing the border from Afghanistan to Iran so that they can distribute the product to Europe and Africa where there is a high demand for opiates. In Pakistan the majority of traffickers arrested are 38% Nigerians and 32% Pakistanis. \n\nThese traffickers, essential to the transportation of the drugs from the source to end-user markets, make large profits because of how risky the job is. A rough estimate of how many people are currently involved in drug trafficking is above one million. The majority of opium produced in Afghanistan comes from the Kandahar and Helmand provinces, Helmand being the major producer. Of the 5,300 tons of opium produced in Afghanistan, 2,700 tons is transformed into heroin. In 2008, almost half of the heroin produced was used in Iran. Even though Afghanistan is the leading producer, only 7% was used there.\n\nAlthough the Golden Triangle heroin dominates the Asian illegal drug markets, the Golden Crescent is increasingly becoming a source of illicit drugs trafficked into western China, particularly the nearby Xinjiang Province.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28022656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28022656", "title": "Lineated valley fill", "text": "Lineated valley fill\n\nLineated valley fill (LVF), also called lineated floor deposit, is a feature of the floors of some channels on Mars, exhibiting ridges and grooves that seem to flow around obstacles. Shadow measurements show that at least some of the ridges are several metres high. LVF is believed to be ice-rich. Hundreds of metres of ice probably lie protected in LVF under a thin layer of debris. The debris consists of wind-borne dust, material from alcove walls, and lag material remaining after ice sublimated (changed from a solid directly to a gas) from a rock-ice mixture. Some glaciers on Earth show similar ridges. High-resolution pictures taken with HiRISE reveal that some of the surfaces of lineated valley fill are covered with strange patterns called closed-cell and open-cell brain terrain. The terrain resembles a human brain. It is believed to be caused by cracks in the surface accumulating dust and other debris, together with ice sublimating from some of the surfaces. The cracks are the result stress from gravity and seasonal heating and cooling. This same type of surface is present on Lobate debris aprons and Concentric crater fill so all three are believed to be related.\n\nLineated floor deposits began as lobate debris aprons (LDAs), which form as material leaves narrow mountain valleys and spreads out as an apron. By tracing the paths of the ridges on LDAs, researchers have come to believe that the curved ridges characteristic of lobate debris aprons straighten out to form the more or less straight ridges of LVF.\n\nIn the regions where LVF and LDAs occur, many craters have concentric crater fill: large ridges and other surfaces nicknamed brain terrain, after the surface corrugations of the human brain.\n\nThe study of lineated valley fill and other features related to debris-covered ice has been greatly aided by the abundance of data received from Mars orbiting instruments. Excellent images have been obtained from THEMIS, MOC, CTX, and HiRISE. Detailed altimetry was collected by MOLA.\n\nThe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Shallow Radar gave a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs, meaning that pure water ice made up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections), strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers covered with a thin layer of rocks. Since lineated valley terrain is derived from lobate debris aprons, it probably contains buried ice—at least in places.\n\nStudies of LDAs and LVF give evidence that there have been multiple episodes of glaciation on Mars, including ones that produced glaciers nearing a kilometre in thickness. These ice ages are related to major climate shifts caused by major variations in axial tilt. Earth's rather large moon prevents large changes in its tilt. The two moons of Mars are tiny. So Mars undergoes large periods when its ice cap receives more direct sunlight. \nDuring this time ice in the cap sublimates, and thick snow falls in mid-latitudes — the zones where concentric crater fill, lineated valley fill and lobate debris aprons are common. The distribution of craters on LVF indicates a late Amazonian age for at least some areas.\n\nLineated valley fill is common in the middle latitudes, especially near the northern dichotomy boundary. The Nilosyrtis Mensae, Protonilus Mensae and Deuteronilus Mensae bear many examples of LVF. Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and Hellas quadrangle contain many valleys displaying lineated valley fill.\n\nLVF and other ice-related forms are collectively known as fretted terrain, which includes winding and straight valleys with isolating plateaus and mesas.\n\nStudies of lineated valley fill have added evidence that the climate of Mars has undergone many large changes in the past.\n\nAt times there is snow, and at times the snow may melt. The resulting small areas of liquid water cause weathering of the rocks and may provide a favourable environment for life. Understanding lineated valley fill and other manifestations of buried ice will allow future colonists to find sources of water.\n\nReull Vallis, as pictured below, displays such deposits. Sometimes the lineated floor deposits show a chevron pattern which is further evidence of movement. The picture below taken with HiRISE of Reull Vallis shows these patterns.\n\n\n"}

A notorious town bully, he controlled the Council without any opposition until the Vicar's arrival, and is consequently disliked by many, being rigid, old-fashioned, efficient, callous and punctual, yet as the show progresses, becomes lovable and endearing. Apart from the vicar, he is the only sane person in the village. Despite regularly complaining about the council, he has never missed a meeting. In fact, in one episode Jim and Owen reminisce about when David's wife went into labour with Hugo, and David held the meeting in the maternity ward. His wife left him prior to the show's beginning due to his obnoxious nature (although he mistakenly believes she left him because he was a bad cook.) In later episodes of the series, Horton comes to fall for the Vicar and even proposes to her (she accepts his proposal but later decides to back out). He is initially a Conservative, but defects to the Labour Party in 2000 as part of his attempt to persuade Geraldine to marry him. Whether he switches his party allegiance back after she refuses him is unknown. His love for the vicar, however, is steadfast and true. He later supported the Make Poverty History campaign. He is a multi-millionaire. Hugo mentions that people used to call him \"Dirty Dave\" due to his collection of Victorian pornography. David was an unloving father to Hugo, and even threatened to disinherit him if he married Alice, whom David detests. However he changed his mind and later admitted to the Vicar that Alice and Hugo are happy together.\nAlice Springs Horton (née Tinker) is the verger at the church. Blonde and scatterbrained (Geraldine describes her as having \"the intellectual capacity and charisma of a cactus\"), Alice is the only main character who does not sit on the parish council, although she did in the episode \"Autumn.\" She is the product of a one-night stand between her mad mother (who in the last two episodes is said to be in a mental home) and the cousin of David Horton's father (present-day David Horton's first cousin once removed and predecessor on the parish council), also called David Horton. She and Hugo, her second cousin once removed, are fond of each other and the vicar plays Cupid successfully in one episode. They eventually marry and have ten children - the eldest, Geraldine, was born on 24 December 1999, in the middle of the village nativity play in which her parents were playing Mary and Joseph. Featuring in the closing credits for most episodes, Geraldine and Alice have a cup of tea while Geraldine tries to tell Alice a joke (frequently the joke is slightly off-colour). Alice rarely understands the jokes that Geraldine tells her and usually proceeds to over-analyse the humour thereby completely killing the joke. In the final episode Geraldine's new husband Harry Kennedy explains the grammar involved and Alice finally understands it. Alice believes in the Easter Bunny, Father Christmas and the tooth fairy. After reading \"The Da Vinci Code\" she believes herself to be descended from Jesus. She is dim-witted and naive but also sweet-natured and very endearing. She has many misconceptions, such as mistaking Black Sabbath for gospel singers, telling David that Jesus was one of The Carpenters and referring to Albert Einstein as Andrew Einstein. Alice is a fan of the Wombles and of the Teletubbies. In episode 12, January 22, 1998, when Alice gets married to Hugo Horton, her bridesmaids are La-La and Po, who hold the wedding-dress train of Alice.\nAs a child Alice had a series of budgies named Carrot and, until Geraldine reveals that each Carrot was a separate budgie entirely, Alice believed that her first budgie Carrot was reincarnated, \"Just like Jesus, but with feathers\". Alice also has a sister, Mary, who is older than Alice but is even more dim-witted. Alice's mother is often described as insane by Geraldine, and there is considerable confusion regarding Alice's father. Although she states that her father (revealed to be a philanderer) is dead, she later names David Horton, the cousin of the councillor David Horton's father as her biological father, but she often claims not to know who her father really was.\n\nA rabid fan of \"Doctor Who\", Alice unsuccessfully tries to incorporate themes from the sci-fi show into her wedding, including having a wedding gown \"with lots of hearts on it...and a different Doctor Who in each one.\" However, she ends up with a gown decorated with a massive heart with hers and Hugo's names inside. She succeeds in having a \"Doctor Who\" wedding during Geraldine's own wedding. When Gerry's friends take over wedding preparations, Alice uses her position as maid of honour to dress herself as the Tenth Doctor and the other bridesmaids as Daleks.\nHugo Horton is David's sweet-natured, friendly yet dim-witted and childlike son; Geraldine once also likens his intellect to a cactus. In \"Celebrity Vicar\", a newspaper describes him in the headline \"Rich as Croesus, Thick as Shit\"; Hugo does not think the press meant to be rude, to which David replies \"Though you can't deny it's a possibility.\" Sometimes seen sporting a Royal Agricultural College tie, he served as his father's campaign manager at the October 1994 district council election, but inadvertently wound up going door to door with David's Labour opponent, Kevin Smewyn, delivering adverts and making introductions for him. Hugo and Alice Tinker are always shown to have tender feelings for each other, but they do not get together as a couple until Geraldine plays Cupid in \"Engagement\". David was never a loving nor affectionate father to Hugo, dominating him and undermining all his dreams and ambitions. In one episode, Geraldine mentions that God is a father much like his own father, and Hugo recalls what his father did to him as a child: shouting, insulting and caning him (although he does mention a time when David pretended to be Father Christmas). When Geraldine corrects him and says she was referring to a loving, caring father, Hugo believes he had another father. Despite this, Hugo still loves and respects his father but finally stands up to him when it came to marrying Alice, whom David predictably despises. He nicknames Geraldine \"Mrs God\". Hugo has a Golden Retriever named Bruno who is seen in \"Animals\" and \"Election\". He is a huge fan of Kylie Minogue.\nFrank Pickle (born 12 August 1929) is the likable but boring and pedantic secretary of the parish council. He is so boring that nobody listens to him, even when he tries to relate such momentous events such as \"the time he went down to the pub and they'd completely run out of crisps\" or \"the time when the milkman was 47 minutes late\" or \"when he heard a cuckoo in March, only it turned out to be a pigeon\". In \"Celebrity Vicar\", while trying to get \"crazy anecdotes\" about Geraldine for a journalist with all the details, the newspaper headline asks \"Is this The Most Boring Man in Britain?\" Due to his tendency to go on and on when given the opportunity, it is said that five people, including his parents, have died while he was talking, and even his therapist accused him of being boring. He decided to declare his homosexuality in a radio broadcast to the village (after over 40 years of keeping it secret), but apart from Geraldine, who was with Frank at the time, none of the villagers listened to his broadcast. The next day, he decides to assert his sexuality more openly by wearing a bright cerise blazer to attend the parish council meeting rather than his usual brown one. Other references in the show suggest that Frank is bisexual, as he also once admitted to fancying Margaret Beckett as well as fellow councilors Owen Newitt and David Horton; is as affected by the naked model in the Dibley Parish Life Art Class as the others and painted the same model in the landscape class. He also admitted to sleeping with Owen's cousin Sally and it is implied that he fathered one of her three children (the other two being fathered by Jim and Owen). He defines his ideal man as a 25-year-old South American with an interest in Oxfordshire council procedures. \n\n\"He also gives Alice away at her wedding but wears a sign which states that he is not Alice's father and also tries to put a note in the programme that states that he is not Alice's father but is a close family friend and has \"not had sexual relations with Mrs Tinker in any way whatsoever\".\" \nJim Trott is a parish council member, who has an idiosyncratic way of prefacing \"no-no-no-no-no...\" to almost everything he says, in particular \"yes!\" A newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" gives him the headline \"No, No, No, No Brain\". His stuttering once led him to lose on \"Deal or No Deal\". His wife Doris does the opposite, saying \"yes-yes-yes-yes-yes...\". Jim used to be a good dancer, though an unconvincing singer. Despite being married to Doris, he has no qualms about joining Owen in openly flirting with the Vicar, frequently commenting on her \"lovely arse\". He is also openly promiscuous with a penchant for young blondes and Eastern beauties. In one episode he learns that Doris is having sex with her cousin Brenda. In the final episode, he proposed to the vicar, suggesting that he is no longer married, perhaps through divorce, or that his wife has died prior to this episode or that he is willing to commit bigamy. He became the church organist after the death of Letitia Cropley. In the episode \"The Christmas Lunch Incident\", Jim mentions that Doris is taking \"A Competent Grandparenting Course\", suggesting Jim has children but this is never mentioned in the show, though it is implied he fathered a child with Owen's cousin Sally.\n\nOwen Newitt is a local farmer and a parish council member with a very earthy manner. He lives alone at the farm with his animals and is famous for displaying extremely poor personal hygiene, compounded with chronic problems with his stomach and bowels, both resulting in flatulence. The newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" dubbed him \"Britain's B.O. King\". He was the first to support the new vicar's appointment as a lone dissenter, saying that a woman would not be a bad thing since the previous vicar was \"a regular old woman anyway\", just as David looked set to persuade the other members of the parish council to oppose Geraldine's appointment. His signature running gag was that he was chronically late for the parish council meetings, and had humorously legitimate, if gruesome, reasons for his delays (often involving graphic tales of amputating animals' appendages or otherwise mangling them). Previous generations of his family also appear to be as bloodthirsty as Owen, as he proudly declares they have been \"staging cock-fights\" and \"gassing badgers\" in the village for several centuries, and he also has a few murderers in his family. He also has had a history of \"sorrow and tragedy, \" according to Jim and Frank: his brother drowned himself, because of his girlfriend's refusing to marry him; his father shot himself shortly after his wife left him; and his grandmother tried to leave, but his grandfather shot \"her\" and then himself. Owen proposed to the vicar in \"Engagement\". She rejected him, mainly because she simply did not love him (she also cited, not to his face, that \"his breath smells like nerve gas\" and the gel on his hair is really lard). He was not upset, having found out that she was a drinker and declares he cannot tolerate women who drink. Despite this, he frequently makes crude and misguided attempts at flirting with her, which typically backfire, and even proposed to her again the night before her wedding to Harry Kennedy. Regardless of his foul mouth and coarse nature, Owen is a genuinely kind-hearted and caring person, a fact noted by the Vicar, Hugo and Alice, both of whom appointed him godfather to their firstborn daughter. Owen spent every Christmas alone since his uncle's death in 1971 until Geraldine joined him for Christmas dinner in 1996 (one of many such invitations she accepted that year). In several episodes, dialogue suggests that Owen engages in bestiality (such as when he declares rumours that the vicar is a lesbian to be the \"best news since they made having sex with animals legal again\"). Owen also has a swearing 'probling' and often uses the word 'bloody,' describing the word as 'a useful adjective'.\nLetitia Cropley was a Parish Council member and the Dibley church organist. Geraldine once referred to her as \"The Queen of Cordon Bleurgh\", and David Horton called her \"The Dibley Poisoner\". She was the creator of such revolting \"delicacies\" as \"Bread and butter pudding surprise\" (a recipe for which she was breeding snails), Marmite cake (which she served for Frank's birthday), orange cake with Branston Pickle icing (which she served at the cake stall at the Dibley autumn fayre), parsnip brownies, plain pancakes \"with just a hint of liver,\" and chocolate spread sandwiches made with cod roe. Letitia only appeared in the first series and the special \"The Easter Bunny\", in which she died. Her dying request to Geraldine was that she take over from her as the Easter Bunny, taking chocolate eggs around the village each Easter. However, when Geraldine saw every member of the parish council doing the same, as well as some other residents, it became clear that she had made the same request to all of them, owing to her forgetful nature. Earlier in the episode she said she had a \"memory like an elephant that's lost its memory\".\nAfter her death, Jim and Frank referred to her as a redheaded beauty in her youth, along with Owen's father having talked of her often, with various nicknames such as 'Luscious Letitia,' Titillatin' Tish,' and 'always lets you dock your boat in her jetty Letty'. In her youth, she was notoriously promiscuous, with Jim and David both describing her as \"rampant\" and a \"nymphomaniac.\" It has also been suggested that she has a crush on Frank and thinks he has 'nice thighs', as she admitted on her death bed. She was generally seen on the Parish Council crocheting.\n\nDavid Horton's very tall and attractive brother Simon Horton (Clive Mantle) becomes one of the Vicar's lovers in a brief romance. They first meet at the drinks party before Alice and Hugo's wedding and later they meet again when Simon comes up for Sunday lunch with David. After many efforts to get rid of several parishioners who come knocking on her door with various requests, including telling Jim Trott and Frank Pickle that 7 down on a crossword is \"Plodipop\", and arranging the four words \"Leave-You-Remorseless-Bastards\" on the Scrabble board, Geraldine finally manages to join Simon who's waiting patiently in her bedroom, followed by a few weeks of romantic bliss. Later Simon dumps her telling her that he has a girlfriend in Liverpool. A struck Geraldine therefore goes into seclusion, binging on chocolate bars and pots of ice cream, and neglecting her church duties. She decides to resign from her ministry as the Vicar of Dibley, but changes her mind when her parishioners and friends show their loyalty and support by hanging up a huge banner that reads \"That tall git Simon may have bonked you and then dumped you like an old jock strap but we still love you. \"\n\nHarry Jasper Kennedy moves to Dibley from London, buying Sleepy Cottage from David Horton for £500,000. His first visitors in Dibley are Geraldine and Alice, who initially intend to make it clear to Harry that he is not welcome in the village, but are won over by his good looks and friendly manner the moment he opens his front door. Over the course of the following days, Harry and Geraldine go on a succession of dates together, which culminate in the two sharing a kiss. Their romance takes a brief knock when Harry's sister Rosie (Keeley Hawes) visits him in Dibley and Geraldine mistakes her for Harry's romantic partner. However, Harry proposes to Geraldine, who ecstatically agrees to marry him. Their wedding is the focal point of the final regular episode of the series, \"The Vicar in White\". Harry briefly appears once more in the 2007 special sketch for Comic Relief, in which he and Geraldine participate in \"Celebrity, Non-Entity Wife Swap\", in which Sting moves in with Geraldine for a week, while Harry spends a week with Trudie Styler.\n\nGeraldine Horton: The daughter of Alice and Hugo Horton. She was born on Christmas Eve 1999 during Geraldine Granger's nativity play, when Alice and Hugo played Mary and Joseph. She has nine siblings. Her grandfather, David Horton, pities baby Geraldine and her siblings for being born to their simple-minded parents yet it is evident that they adore their daughter. A statue was made of Geraldine, as an infant, on the village green. She appears in the episodes \"Winter\", \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" and again with all nine of her siblings in a Christmas special. In the Christmas special Horton is presented, along with her five sisters, in pink tutus or pink plaid skirts and other accessories such as pink fur ponchoes. She is the only child of Hugo and Alice whose name is mentioned. In the \"Merry Christmas\" episode, when the Horton children are revealed, Geraldine stands in the centre in front of her father (holding her youngest brother) and brothers and stands behind her four sisters and next to her mother (holding the youngest sister). Alice and Hugo had planned on naming their first born \"Vicar\" after the vicar but Geraldine suggests the name \"Geraldine\" instead and this becomes the child's name.\n\nAlice and Hugo's other children only ever appeared as a cameo in the 2004 Christmas Special. They had 10 children (four sons and six daughters). As seen in a documentary of the 2004/05 specials DVD release, a scene with Geraldine greeting the children revealing their outrageous names was cut before the show went in front of cameras.\n"}

It owes its name to an ancient tree, which seems to be dead but has a young sprig growing next to it, and stands on the grounds of the modern Russian Orthodox Monastery of the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe site is located southwest of Mamre, historically near Hebron and now inside the city. Also called \"The Oak of Abraham\", it is an ancient tree which, in one tradition, is said to mark the place where Abraham entertained the three angels or where Abraham pitched his tent.\n\nThis site is distinct and at a different location from the site considered as Mamre by Herod the Great, Josephus, Constantine the Great, early Church historians and Christian pilgrims all until the mid-12th century, such as Arculf and Abbot Daniel. That site is at a location called in Arabic Ramat al-Khalil (the older name used by archaeologists) and currently Bir al-Haram ar-Rameh, which is a few kilometres north of the site described in this article. After the mid-12th century, the tradition of the \"Oak of Mamre\" has migrated to one or several places along the road from Mamre to Hebron, such as the site from this article.\n\nAs written in a footnote from an 1895 publication of Arculf's pilgrimage report, \"[t]he Oak or Terebinth of Abraham has been shown in two different sites. Arculf and many others (Jerome, Itin[erarium] Hierosol[ymitanum], Sozomen, Eucherius [possibly Eucherius of Lyon], Benjamin of Tudela, the Abbot Daniel... etc.) seem to point to the ruin of er Râmeh, near which is Beit el Khulil, or Abraham's House, with a fine spring well. This is still held by the Jews to be the Oak of Mamre. The Christians point to another site, Ballûtet Sebta, where there is a fine specimen of Sindian (Quercus Pseudococcifera).\" \"Ballut\" is the Arabic word for oak.\n\nThe site of the oak was acquired in 1868 by Archimandrite Antonin (Kapustin) for the Church of Russia, and the Monastery of the Holy Trinity was founded nearby. The site has since been a major attraction for Russian pilgrims before the revolution, and is the only functioning Christian shrine in the Hebron region. After the Russian Revolution, the property came under the control of the ROCOR.\n\nA long-standing tradition is that the \"Oak of Abraham\" will die before the appearance of the Antichrist. The main oak trunk has appeared to be dead since 1996. Following construction work in the 1970s, a wooden ring in the form of a chalice was built around the tree, and its roots began to die. In 1997, a small sprig was seen growing near the withered oak. In October 2016, Russian botanists began a project to save the tree. In 1998 a root sprout appeared.\n\nThe Hebron Monastery has emerged as a political issue between Russia and Palestinian authorities.\n"}

The square is located in Lower Town, with the Croatian National Theatre building at its centre. It is sometimes billed as the \"most beautiful square in Zagreb\".\n\nThe present-day square was formed in the period between 1856 (when the former hospital was built on its northern side) and 1964 (when the \"Ferimport\" building was erected on the western side). However, the majority of buildings overlooking the square were built in the late 19th century in the historicist style of architecture.\n\nRepublic of Croatia Square was the first in line of three squares which form the west wing of the so-called Lenuci's horseshoe (), a U-shaped belt of squares and parks designed by engineer Milan Lenuci in the late 19th century which frames the core part of Zagreb's city centre. The east wing of the belt is formed by the King Tomislav, Strossmayer and Zrinski squares, and the west wing by the Marulić, Mažuranić and Republic of Croatia squares, with the Botanical Garden connecting the two. The square is home to several cultural and educational institutions and several landmark sculptures.\n\n\n\n\nBeing one of the most prominent squares in Zagreb its name was often changed in accordance to political circumstances of the time. The last change happened in 2017, as citizens' groups were lobbying for another name change on the grounds that Josip Broz Tito is a negative historical personality, due to his involvement in the many deaths during the rule of his communist regime. The following is a complete list of names the square carried throughout its history.\n\n\nIn February 2008 about 2000 protesters, dressed in red aprons, gathered at the Marshal Tito Square, as it was known at the time, demanding the square to be renamed Theatre Square. Some 200 supporters of Marshal Tito also assembled at the opposite end of the square. The police prevented the two groups from coming in contact with each other. Zagreb's Mayor Milan Bandić said that there is no historic reason to change the name of the square.

His broad scope is illustrated by the fact that he makes extensive use of quantitative methods, while critically dealing with subjects of social and political relevance. Johnston also is an unusually productive author: As of December 2009, he has authored or co-authored more than 50 books and 800 papers, and edited or co-edited a further more than 40 books (if translated and revised editions are counted separately). Among the books he has edited is \"The Dictionary of Human Geography\", the first four editions of which as main editor.\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Manchester in 1962 and 1964, respectively, he moved to Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. There, Johnston obtained a PhD degree, and came in contact with what has become known as the quantitative revolution of geography. He also wrote his first paper on urban social geography during that time. From 1967–1974, he was part of the academic staff at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, where his interest in electoral geography began to develop. Johnston then was appointed professor at the University of Sheffield. In 1979, \"Geography and Geographers\", which he has updated and expanded every few years since then, and whose various editions have been translated into four languages, was published. Johnston became co-editor of the two journals Progress in Human Geography and Environment and Planning A that same year. In 1981, the first edition of \"The Dictionary of Human Geography\", to which Johnston has contributed hundreds of articles, was published. It has maintained its status as the discipline's authoritative dictionary ever since. After serving as pro-vice-chancellor for academic affairs of the University of Sheffield, he became vice-chancellor of the University of Essex in 1992. Since 1995, Johnston has been professor at the University of Bristol. He resigned from the editorial boards of both \"Progress in Human Geography\" and \"Environment and Planning A\" in 2006.\n\nJohnston has been one of the most cited geographers for decades. Among the most prestigious awards Johnston has received are the Murchison Award (1985) and the Victoria Medal (1990) by the Royal Geographical Society, the Prix Vautrin Lud at the International Geography Festival 1999, and a lifetime achievement award from the Association of American Geographers (2009).

Planet acquired the satellites with their purchase of Terra Bella (formerly Skybox Imaging), a Mountain View, California-based company founded in 2009 by Dan Berkenstock, Julian Mann, John Fenwick, and Ching-Yu Hu, from Google in 2017.\n\nThe resolution of the SkySat satellite imagery and videos is high enough to observe objects that impact the global economy such as terrain, cars and shipping containers. The satellites can capture video clips lasting up to 90 seconds at 30 frames per second. The high-definition satellite video from SkySat satellites “could help us understand our world better by analyzing movement of goods and people, providing visual data about supply chains, shipping, industrial plant activity, and even humanitarian relief efforts.”\n\nThe constellation's goal is to be able to provide high-resolution satellite imagery of any place on Earth multiple times a day. When Skybox originally delevoped the satellites, they planned to \"change the nature\" of the satellite industry by building satellites with \"off-the-shelf\" electronics that cost under $50 million.\n\nThe SkySat satellites are based on the CubeSat concept, using inexpensive automotive grade electronics and fast commercially available processors, but scaled up to approximately the size of a minifridge. The satellites are approximately 80cm long, compared to approximately 30cm for a 3U CubeSat, and weigh 220lbs.\n\nThe satellites are manufactured by SSL, the optical payloads are built by L3 Technologies, and the satellite thrusters are provided by ECAPS.\n\nBy April 2012, Skybox Imaging had raised a total of of private capital from Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canaan Partners and Norwest Venture Partners to develop the SkySat constellation.\n\nOn November 21, 2013, the first satellite, SkySat-1, was launched on a Dnepr rocket from Yasny, Russia. Less than a month later, on December 11, 2013, the first images captured by the SkySat-1 satellite, of Perth, Abu Dhabi, and the coast of Somalia, were released.

It is owned and operated by TerraServer.com, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina. The company was previously named Aerial Images until May 2002 when the assets of Aerial Images were sold and the company renamed itself TerraServer.com, Inc.\n\nAerial Images was a part of the original project that involved Microsoft and Compaq as a demonstration of the real-world scalability of SQL Server and Microsoft's Windows NT Server. Aerial Images brought in satellite imagery from Sovinformsputnik (the Russian Federal Space Agency) and GeoEye. TerraServer expanded its partnerships and became an image provider for LandVoyage and the DigitalGlobe family of companies: GlobeXplorer and AirPhotoUSA, as well as imagery from the USGS and USDA.\n\nAfter an agreement that ended in January 2000, the operations split into two pieces. Aerial Images kept the TerraServer.com domain name to create a commercial site selling custom selected imagery. Microsoft went forward with their own imagery project, which provides access to United States Geological Survey imagery. The Microsoft project used the TerraServer brand name in a variety of ways including terraserver.homeadvisor.com, terraserver.microsoft.com, and terraserver.msn.com. In 2003, Microsoft rebranded its research service as TerraServer-USA, and then Microsoft Research Maps. There may exist confusion between the two sites, because of the name similarity. However, TerraServer.com, Inc. is the sole owner of the registered trademark TerraServer. The \"TerraServer\" name is a reference to 'Terra', which is Latin for 'earth' or 'land'.\n\nThe TerraServer viewer allows users to select imagery from different dates and of different resolutions. While most of the TerraServer imagery is focused on high resolution, color, satellite and aerial imagery, TerraServer.com also offers Color Infrared Imagery, Panchromatic Imagery, Low Resolution Satellite Imagery, and topographic maps. Subscribers to TerraServer.com gain access to a drawing and measuring tool that can measure surface distance and area on the images. TerraServer also makes a number of image overlays available, including road names, FEMA flood data, earthquake data, landslide data, real estate parcels, parks, schools, hospitals, airports, and zip codes.\n"}

She was a forerunner of modern icebreakers and had an exceptionally diverse service life. According to the United States Coast Guard official website, \"Bear\" is described as \"probably the most famous ship in the history of the Coast Guard.\"\n\nBuilt in Scotland in 1874 as a steamer for sealing, she was owned and operated out of Newfoundland for ten years. In the mid-1880s, she took part in the search for the Greely Expedition. Captained by Michael Healy of the United States Revenue Cutter Service (later part of the U.S. Coast Guard), she worked the 20,000-mile coastline of Alaska. She later assisted with relief efforts after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\n\nHer services also included the second expedition of Admiral Richard E. Byrd to Antarctica, and again to the southernmost continent in 1941 to evacuate Americans at the beginning of World War II. She later served in patrol duty off the coast of Greenland for the United States Navy. Between some of these missions, she was a museum ship in Oakland, California and starred in the 1930 film version of Jack London's \"The Sea-Wolf\".\n\nAfter World War II, \"Bear\" was returned to use again as a sealing vessel. Finally, in 1963, 89 years after she had been built, while being towed to a stationary assignment as a floating restaurant in Philadelphia, \"Bear\" foundered and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean about east of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia.\n\n\"Bear\" was built in 1874 as a sealer at Dundee, Scotland shipyards. Custom-built for sealing out of St. John's, Newfoundland, \"Bear\" was the most outstanding sealing vessel of her day, the lead ship in a new generation of sealers. Heavy-built with thick wooden planks, \"Bear\" was rigged as a sailing barquentine but her main power was a steam engine designed to smash deep into ice packs to reach seal herds. At the time of her arrival in St. John's, there were 300 vessels outfitted each season to hunt seals, but most were small schooners or old sailing barques. The new sealing ships represented by \"Bear\" radically transformed the Eastern North Atlantic seal fishery as they replaced the hundreds of smaller sealing vessels owned by merchants in outports around Newfoundland with large and expensive steamships owned by large British and Newfoundland companies based in St. John's. Owned at first by the Scottish firm W. Grieve and Sons, she was acquired in 1880 by R. Steele Junior. \"Bear\" spent a decade sealing from St. John. In 1884, the Steeles sent \"Bear\" back to Scotland for a refit.\n\nThe massive wooden hulls of Newfoundland sealing vessels had proved ideal for arctic exploration. Just back from her refit in 1884 and ready for another season of sealing, \"Bear\" was instead purchased by the US government in 1884 and took part in the search for the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, whose seven survivors were found at Cape Sabine.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1926, \"Bear\" served as a United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter, making the seasonal trek each May from her port in Oakland, California to sail north to Alaskan waters for the five month season, cruising 10,000 miles on Bering Sea Patrol, where she looked out for seal poachers, shipwrecked whalers, and illicit trade with Alaska Natives, ferried reindeer from Siberia to Alaska, and served as a floating courthouse. By order of the Department of the Treasury, \"Bear\" was given free run to arrest and seize possessions of poachers, smugglers and illegal traders, as well as take census of people and ships, record geological and astronomical information, take note of tides, and escort whaling ships.\n\nOne captain of \"Bear\", Michael \"Hell Roaring Mike\" Healy, was considered a savior by many of the whalers and native Eskimos, as he bought Siberian reindeer at his own expense for the starving natives to use as the foundation for a new herd in Alaska, paralleling, and possibly in cooperation with, missionary Sheldon Jackson. Healy was the first African-American commissioned officer in U.S. history, and during Captain Healy's and \"Bear\"s 1891 Bering Sea Patrol, the following was accomplished:\n\nDuring one of its yearly trips back to San Francisco, \"Bear\" assisted in rescue operations for 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\nThe Revenue Cutter Service was merged with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard on 28 January 1915 and the ship was renamed USCGC \"Bear\".\n\nCruising to Alaska for her last patrol in the 1926 season, on her return to Oakland that November she was replaced by a new cutter, and ownership was transferred to the city for use as a large barkentine rigged museum ship, \"Bear\" starred as the sealer \"Macedonia\" in the 1930 film version of Jack London's \"The Sea-Wolf\".\n\nIn 1932 \"Bear of Oakland\" was purchased by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd for $1,050, as a replacement for the barquentine . He used her in the Second Byrd Expedition alongside the old steel-hulled lumber ship \"Pacific Fir\", renamed by Byrd , in honor of the New York brewer who was a major sponsor of expedition.\n\nAfter the expedition, Admiral Byrd leased \"Bear\" to the Navy for one dollar a year, for use on his government sponsored (third) expedition.\n\nOn 11 September 1939 she was re-commissioned in the U.S. Navy for service during the 1939–1941 United States Antarctic Service Expedition, led by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and renamed USS \"Bear\" (AG-29). She carried a Barkley-Grow seaplane on board. Lieutenant Commander Richard H. Cruzen was captain of \"Bear\" during the expedition. Cruzen would rise to the rank of rear admiral and commanded the U.S. Navy ships which participated in a large Antarctic expedition named Operation Highjump in 1948.\n\nIn early 1941, USS \"Bear\" assisted in the evacuation of the members of the Antarctic Expedition, as international tensions rose in the months that led up to America's entrance into World War II. \"Bear\" arrived at the Mikkelsen Islands, just north of the Antarctic Circle, on 16 March 1941, and its crew helped to build an adequate airstrip to evacuate personnel and equipment from the expedition base in the area.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1944, USS \"Bear\" served in the Northeast Atlantic Greenland Patrol. The rigging was cut down to two masts to become a fully motorized ship. After the capture, on 12 September 1941, of the German-controlled Norwegian sealer , which was used as a supply ship for secret weather stations, by , \"Bear\" towed the prize to Boston. When more modern ships were available to replace her, \"Bear\" was decommissioned on 17 May 1944 and laid up in Boston until the end of the war.\n\n\"Bear\" had the distinction of being the oldest U.S. Navy ship to be deployed outside the continental United States during World War II. She was also one of a very few U.S. Navy ships to have served during the Spanish–American War as well as both world wars. (The sailing relics and were both in active commissioned service during World War II but neither left port during the war.)\n\n\"Bear\" was purchased from the US government in 1948 by Frank M. Shaw of Halifax, Nova Scotia for $5,199. Shaw intended to use the ship for sealing. Renamed \"Arctic Bear\", her refit for sealing proved costly and with the decline of the large-scale Newfoundland seal hunt, she was laid up in Halifax Harbour subject to on and off again refits, and lay derelict for periods of times as she remained at various moorings around Halifax and Dartmouth.\n\nBy the early 1960s \"Bear\" was considered for restoration as a museum ship by the City of Dartmouth as well as her old home at Oakland and by the San Francisco marine museum. However the purchase price from Shaw Steamships and the extensive restoration costs scuttled museum plans.\n\nIn 1962 she was purchased by Alfred Johnston of Philadelphia for a floating seafood restaurant. Repairs were made to the ship at Industrial Shipping Limited in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia for her new role including the carving of a new bear figurehead.\n\nIn 1963, while in tow by the tug \"Irving Birch\" to Philadelphia, \"Bear\" foundered about east of Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia, at . She went down early in the morning of 19 March 1963 after a gale struck and severed the tow line. The mast collapsed and punctured the hull, causing the sinking. Her crew of two were rescued by \"Irving Birch\".\n\n\"Bear\"s exceptional career lasted for 89 years. She spent a total of 47 years in commissioned service of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, Coast Guard and Navy. She served under the flags of three different nations (United Kingdom, United States and Canada). She was one of only a few ships to have served in both arctic regions.\n\nThere is a large detailed scale model of \"Bear\" on display in the Stockton Center for International Law, part of the United States Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nThe figurehead from \"Bear\" is in the collection at the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}
