{"id": "7004443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7004443", "title": "Arctic haze", "text": "Arctic haze\n\nArctic haze is the phenomenon of a visible reddish-brown springtime haze in the atmosphere at high latitudes in the Arctic due to anthropogenic air pollution. A major distinguishing factor of Arctic haze is the ability of its chemical ingredients to persist in the atmosphere for an extended period of time compared to other pollutants. Due to limited amounts of snow, rain, or turbulent air to displace pollutants from the polar air mass in spring, Arctic haze can linger for more than a month in the northern atmosphere.\n\nArctic haze was first noticed in 1750 when the Industrial Revolution began. Explorers and whalers could not figure out where the foggy layer was coming from. \"Poo-jok\" was the term the Inuit used for it. Another hint towards clarifying this issue was relayed in notes approximately a century ago by Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen. After trekking through the Arctic he found dark stains on the ice. The term \"Arctic haze\" was coined in 1956 by J. Murray Mitchell, a US Air Force officer stationed in Alaska, to describe an unusual reduction in visibility observed by North American weather reconnaissance planes. From his investigations, Mitchell thought the haze had come from industrial areas in Europe and China. He went on to become an eminent climatologist.\nThe haze is seasonal, reaching a peak in late winter and spring. When an aircraft is within a layer of Arctic haze, pilots report that horizontal visibility can drop to one tenth that of normally clear sky. At this time it was unknown whether the haze was natural or was formed by pollutants.\n\nIn 1972, Glenn Shaw of the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska attributed this smog to transboundary anthropogenic pollution, whereby the Arctic is the recipient of contaminants whose sources are thousands of miles away. Further research continues with the aim of understanding the impact of this pollution on global warming.\n\nThe pollutants are commonly thought to originate from coal-burning in northern mid-latitudes, especially in Asia. The aerosols contain about 90% sulfur and the rest is carbon, which makes the haze reddish in color. This pollution is helping the Arctic warm up faster than any other region, although increases in greenhouse gases are the main driver of this climatic change.\n\nSulfur aerosols in the atmosphere affect cloud formation, leading to localized cooling effects over industrialized regions due to increased reflection of sunlight, which masks the opposite effect of trapped warmth beneath the cloud cover. During the Arctic winter, however, there is no sunlight to reflect. In the absence of this cooling effect, the dominant effect of changes to Arctic clouds is an increased trapping of infrared radiation from the surface.\n\nShip emissions, mercury, aluminium, vanadium, manganese, and aerosol and ozone pollutants are many examples of the pollution that is affecting this atmosphere, but the smoke from forest fires is not a significant contributor. Some of those pollutants figure among environmental effects of coal burning. Due to low deposition rates, these pollutants are not yet having adverse effects on people or animals. Different pollutants actually represent different colors of haze. Dr. Shaw discovered in 1976 that the yellowish haze is from dust storms in China and Mongolia. The particles were carried polwards by unusual air currents. The trapped particles were dark gray the next year he took a sample. That was caused by a heavy amount of industrial pollutants.\n\nHome fires in India also contribute.\n\nAccording to Tim Garrett, an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Utah involved in the study of Arctic haze at the university, mid-latitude cities contribute pollution to the Arctic, and it mixes with thin clouds, allowing them to trap heat more easily. Garret's study found that during the dark Arctic winter, when there is no precipitation to wash out pollution, the effects are strongest, because pollutants can warm the environment up to three degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nEuropean climatologists predicted in 2009 that by the end of the 21st century, the temperature of the Arctic region is expected to rise 3° Celsius on an average day. In that same article, \"National Geographic\" quoted the co-author of the study, Andreas Stohl, of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, \"Previous climate models have suggested that the Arctic's summer sea ice may completely disappear by 2040 if warming continues unabated.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49658", "title": "Aurora", "text": "Aurora\n\nAn aurora (plural: auroras or aurorae), sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic).\n\nAuroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere) due to Earth's magnetic field, where their energy is lost.\n\nThe resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.\n\nThe word \"aurora\" comes from the Latin word for \"dawn, morning light\", since auroras were formerly thought to be the first light of dawn.\n\nMost auroras occur in a band known as the \"auroral zone\", which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the \"auroral oval\", a band displaced towards the night side of the Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the Internet.\n\nIn northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind. The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nA geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. The instantaneous distribution of auroras (\"auroral oval\") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.\n\nAuroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be subvisual.\n\nAuroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.\nAn aurora may appear overhead as a \"corona\" of rays, radiating from a distant and apparent central location, which results from perspective.\nAn electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the \"pitch angle\" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.\nOther types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g.\"poleward arcs\" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related \"theta aurora\", and \"dayside arcs\" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora, \"black aurora\" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.\n\nThe altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras. They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000 km.\nImages of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in the use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities. Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectra present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of a film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.\n\nDavid Malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately. For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultraviolet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters. Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites. Excellent images are possible with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50 mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.\n\nEarly work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar.\n\nAuroras frequently appear either as a diffuse glow or as \"curtains\" that extend approximately in the east–west direction. At some times, they form \"quiet arcs\"; at others, they evolve and change constantly. These are called \"active aurora\".\n\nThe most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. \"In situ\" particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid subsecond variations in intensity.\nThe diffuse aurora, though, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility. It can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow. Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.\n\n\nIn addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), discovered in 1972. Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.\n\nAurora noise, similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about above the Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.\n\nA full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes, but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.\n\nThe details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes. Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty citizen science observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed \"STEVE\" (a reference to the animated film Over the Hedge in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature \"Steve\"); subsequent reportage went viral, and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.\n\nThe immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.\nElectrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines. Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.\n\nAuroras result from emissions of photons in the Earth's upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state. They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:\nOxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.\nThis is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.\n\nBright auroras are generally associated with Birkeland currents (Schield et al., 1969; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125 km); the rest (\"region 2\") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the \"partial ring current\" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.\n\nIonospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary Hall current flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named \"auroral electrojets\" (see also Birkeland currents).\n\nThe Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400 km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger. Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity. Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.\nThe solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts \"across\" (or is cut \"by\"), rather than \"along\", the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the \"direction\" of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process (\"the dynamo effect\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.\nThe IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the Parker spiral. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible Sun at any time.\nThe solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.\n\nAuroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.\n\nEarth's magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 Earth radii or Re), producing a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream. The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long \"magnetotail\" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 Re).\nThe high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.\nOn 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.\n\nGeomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.\n\nThe electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature. The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.\nThe increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.\n\nOne early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop. No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, Poisson's equation indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop. Inexplicably though, some authors still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact. In another example, there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the ion beam energies..., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration'.\n\nAnother theory is based on acceleration by Landau resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region. This process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world, and appears well able to account in principle for most – if not all – detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.\n\nOther mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.\n\nOther processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200 km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an \"overflow\" along magnetic field lines of the copious \"ring current\" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.\nSome O+ ions (\"conics\") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They therefore start at their \"mirror points\" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the \"mirror effect\" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.\n\nThe discovery of a 1770 Japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the Carrington event, which affected telegraph networks.\n\nThe auroras that resulted from the \"great geomagnetic storm\" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history. In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, \"It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken \"in the act\".\" The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by \"The New York Times\" that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was \"so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light\". One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, Elias Loomis published a series of nine papers on the Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859 in the \"American Journal of Science\" where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.\n\nThat aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the \"Boston Traveler\":\n\nThe conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner. Such events led to the general conclusion that\n\nAn aurora was described by the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th century BC. Seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his \"Naturales Quaestiones\", classifying them, for instance as \"pithaei\" ('barrel-like'); \"chasmata\" ('chasm'); \"pogoniae\" ('bearded'); \"cyparissae\" ('like cypress trees'), and describing their manifold colors. He wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds, and recalled that under Tiberius, an aurora formed above the port city of Ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue. It has been suggested that Pliny the Elder depicted the aurora borealis in his \"Natural History\", when he refers to \"trabes\", \"chasma\", 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.\nIn the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras \"puae buae\" ('ashes'), while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world. The Dieri people of South Australia say that an auroral display is \"kootchee\", an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia refer to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people in southwest Queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the \"Oola Pikka\", ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.\n\n\"Bulfinch's Mythology\" relates that in Norse mythology, the armour of the Valkyrior \"sheds a strange flickering light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what Men call the 'aurora borealis', or 'Northern Lights' \". There appears to be no evidence in Old Norse literature to substantiate this assertion. The first Old Norse account of \"norðrljós\" is found in the Norwegian chronicle \"Konungs Skuggsjá\" from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.\n\n\nIn the 1740s Benjamin Franklin theorized in his paper \"Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation\" that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air: \n\nObservations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of Uppsala by Anders Celsius and Olof Hiorter. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.\nA variety of Native American myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer Samuel Hearne traveled with Chipewyan Dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the \"ed-thin\" ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.\n\nDuring the night after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting \"Aurora Borealis\" by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.\n\nA mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century. It quotes Halley as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the \"Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences\" between 1666 and 1716. And that one aurora recorded in \"Berlin Miscellany\" for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at Bologna was stated to be the first ever seen there. Celsius (1733) states the oldest residents of Uppsala thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the Maunder minimum in sunspot activity.\n\nIt was the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.\n\nBoth Jupiter and Saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as on Uranus and Neptune.\n\nThe auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially Io, are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter. These arise from electric currents along field lines (\"field aligned currents\"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.\n\nAuroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.\n\nAn aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express. The aurora was located at Terra Cimmeria, in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.\n\nThe first ever extra-solar auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259. The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.\n\n\n\n"}

The two areas were inhabited by the Eastern \"Barbaroi\" or \"Baribah\" (\"Berbers\") as referred to by ancient Greek philosophers. These inhabitants were the ancestors of today's local Afroasiatic-speaking populations such as Somalis and Bejas.\n\nGeographers historically divided the eastern coast of Africa at large into several regions based on each region's respective inhabitants. In Somalia was \"Barbara\", which was the land of the Eastern \"Baribah\" or \"Barbaroi\" (Berbers), as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively. In modern-day Eritrea and Ethiopia was \"al-Habash\" or Abyssinia, which was inhabited by the \"Habash\" or Abyssinians, who were the forebears of the Habesha.\n\nAccording to the \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\", a 1st century CE travelogue written by a Greek merchant based in Alexandria, the first Barbara region extended from just south of Berenice Troglodytae in southeastern Egypt to just north of Ptolemais Theron in northeastern Sudan, whilst the second Barbara region was then located just beyond the Bab al-Mandeb up to the \"Market and Cape of Spices, an abrupt promontory, at the very end of the Berber coast toward the east\" found in northeastern Somalia. This second Barbara region was home to entrepôts known as the \"far-side\" ports. Archaeological excavations led by Neville Chittick have identified the Market and Cape of Spices as the present-day Damo.\n\nAlong with the neighboring \"Habash\" (Abyssinians) of Al-Habash toward the interior, the \"Periplus\" records the Berbers of the second Barbara region as engaging in extensive commercial exchanges with Egypt and Pre-Islamic Arabia. The travelogue mentions these Berbers as trading frankincense, among various other commodities, through their port cities such as Malao, Avalites, Mundus, Mosylon and Opone. Competent seamen, the \"Periplus\"' author also indicates that they sailed throughout the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for trade. The document describes the Berbers' system of governance as decentralized, and essentially consisting of a collection of autonomous city-states.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13754920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13754920", "title": "Bundle adjustment", "text": "Bundle adjustment\n\nBundle adjustment is almost always used as the last step of every feature-based 3D reconstruction algorithm. It amounts to an optimization problem on the 3D structure and viewing parameters (i.e., camera pose and possibly intrinsic calibration and radial distortion), to obtain a reconstruction which is optimal under certain assumptions regarding the noise pertaining to the observed image features: If the image error is zero-mean Gaussian, then bundle adjustment is the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Its name refers to the bundles of light rays originating from each 3D feature and converging on each camera's optical center, which are adjusted optimally with respect to both the structure and viewing parameters (similarity in meaning to categorical bundle seems a pure coincidence). Bundle adjustment was originally conceived in the field of photogrammetry during the 1950s and has increasingly been used by computer vision researchers during recent years.\n\nBundle adjustment boils down to minimizing the reprojection error between the image locations of \nobserved and predicted image points, which is expressed as the sum of squares of a large number of nonlinear, real-valued functions. Thus, the minimization is achieved using nonlinear least-squares algorithms. Of these, Levenberg–Marquardt has proven to be one of the most successful due to its ease of implementation and its use of an effective damping strategy that lends it the ability to converge quickly from a wide range of initial guesses. By iteratively linearizing the function to be minimized in the neighborhood of the current estimate, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm involves the solution of linear systems termed the normal equations. When solving the minimization problems arising in the framework of\nbundle adjustment, the normal equations have a sparse block structure owing to the lack of interaction among parameters for different 3D points and cameras. This can be exploited to gain tremendous computational benefits by employing a sparse variant of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm which explicitly takes advantage of the normal equations zeros pattern, avoiding storing and operating on zero-elements.\n\nBundle adjustment amounts to jointly refining a set of initial camera and structure parameter estimates for finding the set of parameters that most accurately predict the locations of the observed points in the set of available images. More formally, assume that formula_1 3D points are seen in formula_2 views and let formula_3 be the projection of the formula_4th point on image formula_5. Let formula_6 denote the binary variables that equal 1 if point formula_4 is visible in image formula_5 and 0 otherwise. Assume also that each camera formula_5 is parameterized by a vector formula_10 and each 3D point formula_4 by a vector formula_12. Bundle adjustment minimizes the total reprojection error with respect to all 3D point and camera parameters, specifically\n\nwhere formula_14 is the predicted projection of point formula_4 on image formula_5 and formula_17 denotes the Euclidean distance between the image points represented by vectors formula_18 and formula_19. Clearly, bundle adjustment is by definition tolerant to missing image projections and minimizes a physically meaningful criterion.\n\n\n\n"}

Located in County Kerry, Carrauntoohil is the central peak of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, Ireland's highest mountain range.\n\nCarrauntoohil is composed of sandstone particles of various sizes which are collectively known as \"Old Red Sandstone\". Old Red Sandstone has a purple–reddish colour (stained green in places), and has virtually no fossils. Carrauntoohil was subject to significant glaciation the result of which are deep fracturing of the rock, and the surrounding of Carrauntoohil by U-shaped valleys, sharp arêtes, and deep corries.\n\nCarrauntoohil is the central peak of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, and has three major ridges. A narrow rocky ridge, or arête, to the north, known as the \"Beenkeragh Ridge\", summits The Bones (\"Na Cnámha\"), and leads to Ireland's second-highest peak, Beenkeragh (\"Binn Chaorach\") at . The ridge westward, called the \"Caher Ridge\", also an arête, leads to Ireland's third-highest peak, Caher at . A third and much wider, but unnamed, south-easterly ridge, or spur, leads down to a col where sits the top of the \"Devil's Ladder\" (a classic access route for Carrauntoohil from the \"Hag's Glen\"), but then rises back up to Cnoc na Toinne , from which the long easterly ridge section of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks is accessed.\n\nCarrauntoohil overlooks three U-shaped valleys, each with their own lakes. To the east is Hag's Glen (\"Com Caillí\", \"hollow of the Cailleach\"), to the west is Coomloughra (\"Com Luachra\", \"hollow of the rushes\") and to the south is Curragh More (\"Currach Mór\", \"great marsh\"). \n\nCarrauntoohil has a deep corrie, known as the \"Eagle's Nest\", at its north-east face, which is accessed from the \"Hag's Glen\", and rises up through three levels. At the top, the \"third level\", is Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland's highest lake. From the \"Eagle's Nest\", the main gullies of Carrauntoohil's north-east face can be seen, being: \"Curved Gully\", \"Central Gully\", and \"Brother O'Shea's Gully\". Sometimes the term \"Eagle's Nest\" is used to refer to the small stone Mountain Rescue Hut that sits on the \"first level\" of the corrie, where the \"Heavenly Gates\" descent gully meets the \"Eagle's Nest\" corrie.\n\nCarrauntoohil is the highest mountain in Ireland on all classification scales. It is the 133rd–highest mountain, and 4th most prominent mountain, in Britain and Ireland, on the Simms classification. Carrauntoohil is regarded by the Scottish Mountaineering Club (\"SMC\") as one of 34 Furths, which is a mountain above in elevation, and meets the other SMC criteria for a Munro (e.g. \"sufficient separation\"), but which is outside of (or \"furth\") Scotland; which is why Carrauntoohil is referred to as one of the 13 Irish Munros.\n\nCarrauntoohil's larger prominence qualifies it to meet the P600 classification and the Britain and Ireland Marilyn classification. Carrauntoohil is the highest mountain in the MountainViews Online Database, \"100 Highest Irish Mountains\".\n\nA wooden cross was erected on the summit, a privately owned commonage, in the 1950s by the local community. In 1976 it was replaced by a steel cross. In 2014, the cross was cut down by unknown persons in protest against the Catholic Church, but it was re-erected shortly after.\n\nBecause of the dangers of the steep north-east and east faces of Carrauntoohil, Kerry Mountain Rescue (\"KMR\") have placed danger signs on the summit, and particularly above the \"Howling Ridge\" sector (the ridge between the north-east and east faces), whose initial section can be mistaken for a hill-walkers descent route.\n\n'Carrauntoohil' is the common spelling and used by Ordnance Survey Ireland. Others include 'Carrantoohil', 'Carrantouhil', 'Carrauntouhil' and 'Carrantuohill', which are an anglicisations of an Irish placename. Paul Tempan's \"Irish Hill and Mountain Names\" (2010) notes that \"its name is shrouded in uncertainty\", and that \"Unlike some lesser peaks, such as Mangerton or Croagh Patrick, it is not mentioned in any surviving early Irish texts\". The official Irish name is \"Corrán Tuathail\", which Tempan notes is interpreted as \"Tuathal's sickle\", Tuathal being a male first name. Patrick Weston Joyce previously interpreted it as \"inverted sickle\". However, one of the earliest written accounts of the mountain, by Isaac Weld in 1812, calls it 'Gheraun-Tuel', and Samuel Lewis's \"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\" (1837) calls it 'Garran Tual'. This suggests that the first element was \"géarán\" (\"fang\")—which is found in the names of other Kerry mountains—and that the earlier name may have been \"Géarán Tuathail\" (\"Tuathal's fang\").\n\nClimber and author Jim Ryan noted in his 2006 book, \"Carrauntoohil and MacGillycuddy’s Reeks\", that the actual mountain of Carrauntoohil, including most of the Hag's Glen, is in private ownership. The freehold is owned by four families: Donal Doona, John O'Shea, John B. Doona, and James Sullivan. Their great-grandfathers bought the land from the \"Irish Land Commission\", \"paying the sum of eleven shillings and two cents (70 cents in today's money), twice a year for many decades\". Ryan's book commended the owners for providing access over the years, despite damage to their farms.\n\nA State–sponsored report into access for the range in December 2013 titled \"MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Development Assessment\" (also called the Mountain Access Project, or MAP), mapped the complex network of land titles. Unlike many other national mountain ranges, the MacGillycuddy's Reeks are not part of a national park or a trust structure, and are instead completely privately owned.\n\nThe straightforward route is via the \"Devil's Ladder\", which starts at \"Cronin's Yard\" () in the north-east, moves into the Hag's Glen, continues along between Lough Gouragh and Lough Calee, until the \"Devil's Ladder\", a worn path from the glen to the col between Carrauntoohil and Cnoc na Toinne is visible. No special climbing equipment is needed, but caution is advised as the \"Devil's Ladder\" has become unstable with overuse; alternatives to the ladder include the Bothar na Gige \"Zig Zag\" track (the north-east spur of Cnoc na Toinne 845 m (2,772 ft)). The full route back to \"Cronin's Yard\" is 12–kilometres and takes 4–5 hours. Other popular, but more serious, routes to Carrauntoohil from the \"Hag's Glen\" are via the \"Hag's Tooth Ridge\" up to Beenkeragh, and then across the \"Beenkeragh Ridge\" to Carrauntoohil; or via the \"Eagle's Nest\" route to Lough Cummeenoughter, Ireland's highest lake, and up to the summit via \"Brother O'Shea's Gully\" or \"Curved Gully\".\n\nInstead of descending via the \"Devil's Ladder\", some climbers use a route known as the \"Heavenly Gates\", which starts above the col of the \"Devil's Ladder\" but takes a small stone path that cuts across the east-face of Carrauntoohil, through a narrow gap, known as the \"Heavenly Gates\" (see photo), and then heads diagonally down a deep gully to the base of the \"first level\" of \"Eagle's Nest\" corrie, where the Mountain Rescue Hut is situated. This route, however, is hazardous, difficult to find as it is not marked, and particularly dangerous in poor visibility; it has been the source of several serious accidents on Carrauntoohil.\n\nA strenuous undertaking is the 15–kilometre \"Coomloughra Horseshoe\", which takes 6–8 hours and is described as \"one of Ireland’s classic ridge walks\". It starts from the north-west up the \"Hydro-Track\" (), and is usually done clockwise, first climbing Skregmore , and then to Beenkeragh , across the famous \"Beenkeragh Ridge\", at the centre of which is The Bones , and on to the summit of Carrauntoohil itself. The horseshoe is completed by continuing to Caher , Caher West Top , and descending to the starting point.\n\nAlthough the Reeks are not particularly known for their advanced rock climbing (e.g. unlike Ailladie in Clare, or Fair Head in Antrim), the east face of Carrauntoohil, looking into the \"Hag's Glen\", and the north-east face, looking into \"Brothers O'Shea's Gully\", have a number of multi-pitch, mixed route, rock climbing routes. The most well-known is the 450 m \"Howling Ridge\" (grade V–Diff) which starts at the base of the \"Heavenly Gates\", and takes the arete between Carrauntoohil's east and north-east faces. The same faces are used for winter snow and ice climbing, conditions permitting, and 7 routes of Grade V are marked amongst almost 80 in total.\n\n\n"}

The trio had started exploring together during the summer of 1985–1986.\n\nAlfred Saddlier, a worker for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW), is often cited as an inspiration to the Cave Clan's founders. During construction on Melbourne’s drains in the 1940s and 1950s, Saddlier would leave his name and the date in tar paint before the last section of tunnel was put in place. After Saddlier was mentioned in an article in Melbourne’s \"The Herald Sun\" his sister wrote to the Cave Clan explaining that her brother was in fact a \"builder of drains\", and not an explorer.\n\nCave Clan members explore natural or artificial tunnels and caves, along with rooftops and abandoned buildings. Their most frequent activities involve exploring underground stormwater drains, bunkers, tunnels and forts. Each chapter of the Cave Clan has its favourite locations with each city, each having a different history, with therefore different types of locations to explore. For example, in Sydney, sites the Cave Clan explore include an underground ex-naval oil reservoir in Sydney.Members of the Cave Clan come from various backgrounds including tradespersons, shop owners, teachers, government workers, writers, students, scientists, and mechanics; with the Cave Clan acting as a uniting group for people who are interested in urban exploration in Australia. Amongst other things, members are attracted by the appeal of entering locations that the public rarely sees.\n\nThe Cave Clan does not advocate entering drains when it is raining, exploring alone, or removing a manhole from beneath if the above location is unknown. This is due to the potential hazard of the exit being on a road and thus has the risk of being struck by a vehicle. The golden rule of the Cave Clan is, \"When it rains, no drains!\".\n\nAs with urban exploration-related topics, by entering into locations or drains without permission, the members of the Cave Clan can be described as \"recreational trespassers\". In 2005 it was revealed that the NSW State Government had asked for the Cave Clan's help in finding tunnels that could become terrorist targets.\n\nCoroner Hugh Dillon investigating the death of two graffiti artists in a Sydney stormwater drain in 2008 has recommended police investigate a group known as the Sydney Cave Clan. Delivering his findings into the deaths, Dillon said he was concerned about the counter-cultural message by the group, which he said consisted of \"shadowy characters\".\n\nDillon said he would recommend to police that they investigate the group and shut the website down after it was revealed that it publicised the drain and encouraged risk-taking activity. Malinowsky, the sole survivor of the trio, alleged at the inquest that he was encouraged by a website from the so-called \"Cave Clan\"—a group which he alleged dared people to explore urban underground spaces.\n\nThe Cave Clan has long officially distanced itself from graffiti, despite the historical practice of discreet tagging as a historical documentation practice. Drain tagging is discouraged, especially in historically significant areas; there are clear examples, however, of the Cave Clan name, logo and other specific material related to the Cave Clan and/or their members, being used in graffiti, by unknown sources. The group accepts leaving details of an expedition in a plain section of the drain, tunnel or cavity to mark the place and time, and placing stickers above ground for promotional purposes.\n\n\"Cave Clan\" is the subject and title of a song released on the Mick Thomas album \"Spin! Spin! Spin!\". \n<br>\n\"Cave Clan\" is also a song by Neatly Folded Goat<br>\nIn 2016, Australian record label Superconscious Records released \"Cave Clan\" by Melbourne producer Bjorn This Way. The song was a nostalgic tribute to the producer's experiences exploring drains and tunnels in the south eastern suburbs of Melbourne as a teenager.\n\n\n"}

The pan also is referred to as \"Dooie Vlei\" which is the (presumably original) fully Afrikaans name. In Google there are many references to the site, its name often being translated erroneously in terms such as \"dead valley\"; a vlei is not a valley (which in Afrikaans is \"vallei\"). Nor is the site a valley; the pan is a desiccated vlei.\n\nDead Vlei has been claimed to be surrounded by the highest sand dunes in the world, the highest reaching 300–400 meters (350m on average, named \"Big Daddy\" or \"Crazy Dune\"), which rest on a sandstone terrace.\n\nThe clay pan was formed after rainfall, when the Tsauchab river flooded, creating temporary shallow pools where the abundance of water allowed camel thorn trees to grow. When the climate changed, drought hit the area, and sand dunes encroached on the pan, which blocked the river from the area.\n\nThe trees died, as there no longer was enough water to survive. There are some species of plants remaining, such as salsola and clumps of nara, adapted to surviving off the morning mist and very rare rainfall. The remaining skeletons of the trees, which are believed to have died 600–700 years ago (ca. 1340-1430), are now black because the intense sun has scorched them. Though not petrified, the wood does not decompose because it is so dry.\n\nFilms partly shot there include \"The Cell\" (starring Jennifer Lopez), \"The Fall\", and \"Ghajini\".\n\n\n"}

In Islamic jurisprudence it often refers to a part of the world.\n\nThe notions of \"houses\" or \"divisions\" of the world in Islam such as \"Dar al-Islam\" and \"Dar al-Harb\" does not appear in the Quran or the Hadith. According to Abou El Fadl, the only \"dar\" the Qur'an speaks of are \"the abode of the Hereafter and the abode of the earthly life, with the former described as clearly superior to the latter\". \n\nIn classical Islamic law, the major division are \"dar al-islam\" (lit. territory of Islam), denoting regions where Islamic law prevails, \"dar al-sulh\" (lit. territory of treaty) denoting non-Islamic lands which have concluded an armistice with a Muslim government, and \"dar al-harb\" (lit. territory of war), denoting adjoining non-Islamic lands whose rulers are called upon to accept Islam. \n\nEarly Islamic jurists devised these terms to denote legal rulings for ongoing Muslim conquests almost a century after Muhammad. The first use of the terms was in Iraq by Abu Hanifa and his disciples Abu Yusuf and Al-Shaybani. Among those in the Levant, Al-Awza'i was leading in this discipline and later Shafi'i.\n\nThe concept of \"dar al-harb\" has been affected by the political fragmentation of the Muslim world and has little significance today.\n\nDar al-Islam ( literally \"house/abode of Islam\"; or Dar as-Salam, \"house/abode of Peace\"; or Dar al-Tawhid, \"house/abode of monotheism\") is a term used by Muslim scholars to refer to those countries where Muslims can practice their religion as the ruling sect. It is the area of the world under the rule of Islam, literally, \"the home of Islam.\" These are usually Islamic cultures wherein Muslims represent the majority of the population, and so the government promises them a privileged status. Most \"Dar al-Islam\" areas are surrounded by other Islamic societies to ensure public protection.\n\nSome modern Muslim scholars believe that the labeling of a country or place as being a part of \"Dar al-Islam\" revolves around the question of religious security. This means that if a Muslim practices Islam freely in his place of abode, even though that place happens to be secular or un-Islamic, then he will be considered as living in the \"Dar al-Islam\". Yet, the majority opinion, which relies on tradition, claims that only countries ruled by Sharia can be considered true \"abodes of peace.\"\n\n\"Dar al-Islam\", or house/abode of Submission, is also known and referred to as \"Dar al-Salam\", or house/abode of Peace. The term appears in the Quran in 10.25 and 6.127 as a name of Paradise.\n\nAccording to Abu Hanifa, considered to be the originator of the concept, the requirements for a country to be part of \"Dar al-Islam\" are:\n\nDar al-Harb ( \"house of war\". Dar al-Harb is a term classically referring to those countries which do not have a treaty of nonaggression or peace with Muslims (those that do are called Dar al-'Ahd or Dar al-Sulh). \n\nAccording to Majid Khadduri, the fundamental distinction between \"Dar al-Islam\" and \"Dar al-Harb\" was introduced after the defeat of the Umayyad Caliphate at Battle of Tours in 732 which prevented the expansion of Islam to the north, while at the same time the expansion of the caliphate to the east had been halted.\n\nWahbah al-Zuhayli argues that the concept of Dar al-Harb is mostly historical: \"The existence of Dār al-Islām and Dār al-Ḥarb in contemporary times is rare or extremely limited. This is because Islamic countries have joined the United Nations covenant that stipulates relationship between nations is peace and not war. Therefore non-Muslim countries are Dār al-‘Ahd …\"\n\nDar al-'Ahd ( \"house of truce\") or Dar al-Sulh ( \"house of conciliation/treaty\") are terms used for territories that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims. \n\nThis designation can be found in the Quran, where Muslims are directed on how they should act in war:\n\n\"Excepting those who join a people between whom and you there is a treaty, or such as come to you with hearts reluctant to fight you, or to fight their own people. Had Allah wished, He would have imposed them upon you, and then they would have surely fought you. So if they keep out of your way and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah does not allow you any course [of action] against them.\" Quran 4:90\n\n\n\n"}

Three major industrial areas are located within the catchment area which is mostly dominated by forests with minor open grasslands. North of the lake is a deciduous forest containing herbaceous plants and rocks covered with brushwoods and lichen. Additionally, there is a fluvio-glacial deposit with a broad irrigated marsh and a scenic pine forest; and a wetland which is the remnant of a former stream.\n\nStormwater from several suburbs empties into the lake around which are three allotment-gardens. Potentially hazardous activities in the area include a petrol station, an asphalt works, concrete industry, small scale industries, and a closed stock pile covering 9 hectare containing excavated material from the demolition of a major area in central Stockholm in the 1960s. Several traffic routes and a metro track passes through the catchment area.\n\nDuring summers phytoplankton are dominated by cyanobacteria and occasionally diatoms, most commonly \"Aphanizomenon cf gracile\" but also \"Pseudanabaena limnetica\", \"Planktolyngbya sp.\" and various species of \"Anabaena\", of whom only \"Aphanizomenon\" is potentially poisonous and \"Anabaena\" frequently causes algal bloom. Carapace flagellates such as \"Ceratium hirundinella\" and various dinoflagellates, are few but important to the lake's biomass. Various rotifers are common zooplankton but cyclopoid copepods can also be found. An inventory of aquatic plants in the lake in 1998 resulted in a list of some 30 species, including branched bur-reed and Nuttall's waterweed (the latter introduced in Europe during the 20th century and relatively new in Sweden.)\n\nA list of Dragonfly larvae produced in 2000 included red-eyed, variable, and blue-tailed damselflies. Sample fishing in 1997 documented a dozen species, most notably roach and zander but also northern pike, perch, eel, trout, - of which some have been introduced into the lake - and many others. The lake was struck by crayfish plague in 1950 but crayfish was reintroduced around 1970. North-east of the lake smooth newt, common frog, and common toad were documented in 1996. Noctule bats documented in the area, previously assigned the status near-threatened, are now considered least concern. Soprano pipistrelle has also been seen along the northern shore of the lake. Couples of great crested grebes and common terns are breeding by the lake together with colonies of black-headed gulls, mute swans, Canada geese, herring gulls, and lesser black-backed gulls.\n\n\n\n"}

The forest biomes consist of temperate deciduous forests, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, temperate coniferous forests and riparian forests. Specialists estimate that in the 8th-9th centuries the forest cover was around 30-35%, most of it situated in mountainous areas.\n\nWhile as a whole, Azerbaijan is a country with modest forest cover, the forest cover is unevenly spread across the country. In the low-lying areas, the forest cover is very sparse, also due to the fact that the precipitation is too low for trees and forests to grow in most of these areas; whereas in many mountainous areas, the forest cover is much greater especially in wetter areas.\n\n49% of the country's forests are located in the Greater Caucasus Mountains, 34% in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, 15% in the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region, 2% in the Kur-Araz Lowland, and 0.5% in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\nThe forests are classified into two major ecoregions in Azerbaijan: the Caucasus mixed forests of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, and the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests of the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region. \n\nAzerbaijan preserves many endemic tree and shrub species, relicts of the Tertiary period which were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations.\n\nThe forests of Azerbaijan account for 150 endemic species of trees and bushes out of 435 species of trees and bushes. Some endemic tree species are, the Hyrcanian box tree (\"Buxus hyrcana\"), Caucasian pear (\"Pyrus communis subsp. caucasica\"), Lenkoran acacia (\"Albizia julibrissin\"), chestnut-leaved oak (\"Quercus castaneifolia\"), Caucasian oak (\"Quercus macranthera\"), Caucasian ash (\"Fraxinus angustifolia\" subsp. \"oxycarpa\"), European ash (\"Fraxinus excelsior\"), European hornbeam (\"Carpinus betulus\"), Oriental hornbeam (\"Carpinus orientalis\"), Oriental beech (\"Fagus orientalis\"), Caucasian persimmon (\"Diospyros lotus\"), Caspian locust tree (\"Gleditsia caspica\"), Caucasian alder (\"Alnus subcordata\"), black alder (\"Alnus glutinosa\" subsp.\" barbata\"), white poplar (\"Populus alba\") Caucasian wingnut (\"Pterocarya fraxinifolia\"), Persian ironwood (\"Parrotia persica\"), Caucasian zelkova (\"Zelkova carpinifolia\"), butcher's broom (\"Ruscus aculeatus\"), velvet maple (\"Acer velutinum\"), Cappadocian maple (\"Acer cappadocicum\"), wych elm (\"Ulmus glabra\"), Caucasian lime tree (\"Tilia dasystyla\" subsp. \"caucasica\"), wild cherry (\"Prunus avium\"), wild service tree (\"Sorbus torminalis\"), sweet chestnut (\"Castanea sativa\"), Nordmann fir (\"Abies nordmanniana\") among many others.\n\nExtensive territories are covered with wormwood ephemeral and halophytic vegetation in Absheron peninsular, Kobustan, Kura-Araxinskaya lowlands, and foothills and plains of Nakhchivan. There are different kinds of shrubs and bushes on salinized soils such as Salsola arbuscular, Kolidium, Salicornia, and Holocnemum strobelaceum. Tamarix and wild sorghum bushes spread along the lowlands.\n\nIn the west region of Azerbaijan, of which lands are dry-plain and semi-dessert, there exist sparse forests. Those forests include Juniperus oblonga, Pinus eldarica, and pistachio. Since the groundwater is highly available in the Samur – Davachi lowlands, Alazan – Agritchay valley, and Karabakh plains, lowland forests in those areas are widespread. Oak, apsen, and poplar can be found in those forests.\n\nThere are broadleaf forests on the slopes of the mountains in the Greater Caucasus and Lesser Caucasus, which include beech, white beech, ash, maple, eastern oak, and Iberian oak. The Talysh mountains have relic flora with broadleaf forests. Albizia jilibrissin, Zelkova, and Parrotia persika can be found in the forests of the Talysh mountains.\n\nMountain forests of Gakh region are located in the southern side of the Greater Caucasus in west of Azerbaijan. There are forests territories from 350 to 2000 meters above sea level on the mountains. Caucasian Hornbeam (Carpinus caucasica) Georgian Oak (Quercus iberica) are dominant trees on the dry and warm areas of the mountains. Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis) are widespread on the dry lands of the mountains. The timberline includes Trautvetter’s Maple (Acer trautvetteri) and Persian Oak (Quercus macranthera). In the mountain forests of Gakh, there can be found Tree Hazel (Corylus iberica), which is an endemic species, and only specific to the western territories of the country.\n\nMountain forests in Oguz are situated in the eastern Greater Caucasus. From 650 to 1900 meters above sea level, forests areas are located. The trees that are specific to Oguz forests are Caucasian Oak (Quercus iberica), Persian Oak (Quercus macranthera), Caucasian Hornbeam (Carpinus caucasica), and Oriental Beech (Fagus orientalis). \n\nScrublands and sparse forests are particular for the region that is located in the eastern Greater Caucasus. Juniper shrubs can be found in Altiaghaj. Their height reaches to 4 meters. There are other ligneous types of plants such as Viburnum lantana, Spirea crenata, and Berberis vulgaris. 1300 meters above sea level, hornbeam forests are distributed.\n\nForests are situated in the Shamkirchay valley, which is the part of the northern side of Lesser Caucasus. They are mainly distributed along the riversides, where water resources are rich. There are different maple species, walnut, and hackberry in these forests. Christ’s Thorn, pomegranate, and juniper also can be found on the slope areas. In Shamkir, there are different type of forests such as beech and beech-hornbeam forests, pear-maple forests, and Georgian Oak-hornbeam forests. Plum, hawthorn, apple, medlar, and pear can be found on scrublands.\n\nHirkanian forests cover the territories of both Azerbaijan and Iran. The area of Hirkanian forests is approximately 0.1 million ha in Azerbaijan. Hirkan National Park was settled in the Talysh mountains, which covers about 38000 ha territory enclosing different zones of forest.\n\nThe Caspian forests is a part of Hirkanian forest province. In these forests, there can be found some endemic trees such as Albizzia julibrissin, Parrotia persica, Quercus castaneifolia, and Gleditsia capsica. Peculiarity of this forest is that, there are various species of plants that include 211 species of shrub and semi-shrub, 90 species of tree, and approximately 1500 vascular plant species. Other than that, Chestnut-leaved Oak, Date Plum, Zelkovie, Caucasian Wing-nut, Velvet maple, Oriental Beech, and Perian Oak can be found in Hirkanian forest. There are also various evergreen species of trees exist such as Ilex spingera, Buxus hyrcana, and Danae racemose. \n\nZuvand region is situated near Lerik district. The area is semi-desert, therefore, the vegetation in Zuvand is durable for drought. In the large areas of Zuvan forests, there is Frigana vegetation, which has three groups. First group includes Astragalus meyerii, aureus, and persicus. The second group is Acantholymon and the third group is Onobrychus. Quercus macrantera and Fagus orientalis are also specific to these forests. \n\nAll forests are owned by the state and are under the management of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan, and forest land usage is limited by law and industrial cutting is forbidden. The \"Forest Code\" of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the \"Law of the Azerbaijan Republic on Environmental Protection\" are the main legal documents regulating the protection and management of forests in the country.\n\nThe \"National Program on restoration and expansion of forests in the Azerbaijani Republic\" adopted for the period 2003-2008 contributed partially to the improvement of the situation: over the last 6 years forest restoration actions were carried out on more than 71,634 hectares of forest land, and a large number of trees were planted. According to the Forest Development Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan during the 2013 large-scale forest restoration activities were carried out at the territory of 1031 ha.\n\nThere are two main departments that are dealing with forestry issues under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources in Azerbaijan. Forestry Development Department deals with the management of the lands and resources of forests, and Department of Biodiversity and Protected Natural Ares manages the protected forests.\n\nThe responsibilities of the department include restoration and preservation of forests. There are five divisions within the department. The department has 33 enterprises that deal with rehabilitation and protection of forests, 2 enterprises of afforestation, and 6 forests nurseries. Forestry Scientific Research Institute is a unit of the departments and deals with forestry. \n\nThe Azerbaijani forests experience problems of different characters. Most of them are linked with the lack of awareness among the local population on issues of sustainable forest management, impact of climate change on the forests and the insufficient enforcement of existing laws on forest protection.\n\nThe occupation of the part of the country's territory by Armenia (Nagorno-Karabakh and the territories surrounding it) caused a significant damage to the forests, especially those located in the mountainous areas. \n\nAnother critical problem is the continuous practice of illegal grazing for firewood in the forests which are damaging the biodiversity and are resulting in economic and social losses. Illegal logging remains a challenge for the Azerbaijani forest sector since country’s independence. \n\nDue to the poor management in many regions, and especially villages located in proximity to the forests, acts of illegal logging exist and pose a significant threat to the forests. The same threat comes from the unsustainable tourism and recreation practices. At the same time the forests of Azerbaijan feel the impact of the global climate change with an increase of forest fires during the summer. \n\n"}
{"id": "10799349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10799349", "title": "GIS and hydrology", "text": "GIS and hydrology\n\nGeographic information systems (GISs) have become a useful and important tool in the field of hydrology to study and manage Earth's water resources. Climate change and greater demands on water resources require a more knowledgeable disposition of arguably one of our most vital resources. Because water in its occurrence varies spatially and temporally throughout the hydrologic cycle, its study using GIS is especially practical. Whereas previous GIS systems were mostly static in their geospatial representation of hydrologic features, GIS platforms are becoming increasingly dynamic, narrowing the gap between historical data and current hydrologic reality.\n\nThe elementary water cycle has inputs equal to outputs plus or minus change in storage. Hydrologists make use of this hydrologic budget when they study a watershed. The inputs in a hydrologic budget include precipitation, surface flow, and groundwater flow. Outputs consist of evapotranspiration, infiltration, surface runoff, and surface/groundwater flows. All of these quantities can be measured or estimated based on environmental data and their characteristics can be graphically displayed and studies using GIS.\n\nIn the field of hydrological modeling, analysis generally begins with the sampling and measurement of existing hydrologic areas. In this stage of research, the scale and accuracy of measurements are key issues. Data may either be collected in the field or through online research. The United States Geological Survey ((USGS)) is a publicly available source of remotely sensed hydrological data. Historical and real-time streamflow data are also available via the internet from sources such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A benefit of using GIS softwares for hydrological modeling is that digital visualizations of data can be linked to real-time data.\nFor surface water modeling, digital elevation model are often layered with hydrographic data in order to determine the boundaries of a watershed . Understanding these boundaries is integral to understanding where precipitation runoff will flow. For example, in the event of snowmelt, the amount of snowfall can be input into GIS to predict the amount of water that will travel downstream . This information has applications in local government asset management, agriculture and environmental science.\nAnother useful application for GIS regards flood risk assessment. Using digital elevation models combined with peak discharge data can predict which areas of a floodplain will be submerged depending on the amount of rainfall. In a study of the Illinois River watershed, Rabie (2014) found that a decently accurate flood risk map could be generated using only DEMs and stream gauge data. It should be noted that analysis based on these two parameters alone does not account for manmade developments including levees or drainage systems, and therefore should not be considered a comprehensive result. \n\nThe use of GIS to analyze groundwater falls into the field of hydrogeology. Since 98% of available freshwater on Earth is groundwater, the need to effectively model and manage these resources is apparent. As the demand for groundwater continues to increase with the world’s growing population, it is vital that these resources be properly managed. Indeed, when groundwater usage is not monitored sufficiently, it may result in damage to aquifers or groundwater-related subsidence, as occurred in the Ogallala aquifer in the United States. In some cases, GIS can be used to analyze drainage and groundwater data in order to select suitable sites for groundwater recharge. \n\n\n\n"}

The islands form a semicircular group with an open sea towards the east. The largest, Diego Garcia, is located at the southern extreme end. It measures and accounts for almost three-quarters of the total land area of the territory. Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island and is home to the joint UK-US naval support facility. Other islands within the archipelago include Danger Island, Three Brothers Islands, Nelson Island, and Peros Banhos, as well as the island groups of the Egmont Islands, Eagle Islands, and the Salomon Islands.\n\nBIOT is an archipelago of 55 islands. They were annexed by the UK in 1965 under the Treaty of Paris from a much larger archipelago which in 1804 consisted of 2,300 independent islands. BIOT is situated in the Indian Ocean near the Equator. It is roughly halfway between Africa and Indonesia, about southwest of India. It is situated approximately from South India and to the south of the Maldives With a coastline stretching , it is the southern extension of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. The Chagos Islands archipelago are northeast of Mauritius, while Agalega Islands are due north. The islands are characterised as coral atolls whose formation occurred at the summits of volcanic mountains these being submerged. The terrain is flat and low, with most areas not exceeding above sea level.\n\nThe climate is tropical marine; hot, humid, and moderated by trade winds. It is located outside the route of the cyclones.\n\nThe lagoon that surrounds the atoll has an area of about . The maximum water depth in the lagoon is about . The width of the coral reef varies from with a shallow depth of about on the seaward side. The area covered by the fringing seaward reef shelf is about . The bed slope noted at the outer edge of the reef shelf is steep towards the deeper end; the depth drops to more than in some areas within distance from the shore.\n\nIn 2010, the whole territory, as well as of ocean around the islands, was declared a marine reserve. It is known formally as the Chagos Marine Protected Area, because it is a \"pristine ocean ecosystem now representing 16% of the world's fully protected coral reef.\" Fishing is banned within the reserve area. Diego Garcia is a Ramsar site.\n\nOf the 55 islands of the Chagos Archipelago, Diego Garcia is the largest. Aside from this, the main islands are the Egmont Islands, Danger Island, Aigle (Eagle) Islands, Three Brothers, Nelson Island, Salomon Islands, and Peros Banhos at the northern end of the Chagos Archipelago.7478\n\nThe coral atoll of Diego Garcia is approximately east of the coast of Africa (at Tanzania), south-southwest of the southern tip of India (at Kanyakumari) and west-northwest of the west coast of Australia (at Cape Range National Park, Western Australia). Diego Garcia lies at the southernmost tip of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge — a vast submarine range in the Indian Ocean. The total area encompassed by the atoll is . At the entrance to the lagoon, there are three small islands, and these are East Island (), Middle Island (), and West Island (). In some areas, the atoll has both marshes and wetlands. The ecosystem consists of undisturbed tropical forests.\nThe Peros Banhos Islands, which are the largest group on the Chagos Bank, consists of 27 islands scattered around the rim of an immense lagoon, which has a perimeter of and enclosed some 310 square km of water. They consist of several groups of islets and reefs; deep channels separate them. They had a population of some 400 islanders before the evacuation in 1965, the largest number living on Île du Coin in the southwest corner of the atoll (in the previous century, the dominant island was Île Diamant in the northwest corner of the atoll); in all, there were seven inhabited islands.\n\nSome 25 km east of Peros Panhos Atoll, the smaller Salomon group comprises eleven islands clustered around a lagoon measuring 8 km long and 5 km wide. Prior to the removal of its population, six of the islands were inhabited with a total of about 250 islanders. Île Boddam in the southwest was the principal settlement, while Île Takamaka in the east wasc the centre of boatbuilding for the archipelago.\n\nLying between Diego Garcia in the south, and the Peros Banhos and Salomon Atolls in the north, the remaining coralline islands are scattered over a wide area of the Great Chagos Bank, an area of atolls, reefs and shoals with an average depth of water of some 20 metres. Uninhabited Île Nelson lies 35 km south of Salomon Atoll. A hundred km to the southwest of Nelson are the 3 islands of Trois Frères, which were briefly inhabited in the 19th century. Further west lies the Île d'Aigle, which was inhabited until 1935. Île Vache Marine, the southernmost of the Eagle Islands, lies south.\n\nÎle Danger, 20 km south of Île d'Aigle, has never been inhabited; it is a long and flat island with a maximum width of . It is covered with tall coconut trees and shrubs.\n\nFinally, Six Îles Atoll (also called Egmont), further south of Danger, was also occupied for short periods during the mid 19th century until 1935. Besides the six named islands, the atoll also includes a seventh unnamed island. The atoll, in the form of “U”, is a small strip of land with width varying from to a maximum of at its northern extremity. The total land area of the atoll is . A fringing reef circumscribes the atoll. There are two openings into the ocean. It almost encompasses a large lagoon. The lagoon itself is in length and is more than in width. Rounded pumic stones found on the eastern beach of the island by one of the explorers of the island have been inferred as debris from the Krakatoa volcanic eruption of 1883 The atoll is to the northwest of Diego Garcia, on the Great Chagos Bank. The islands are connected by reefs which are steep and there are no locations for anchorage on its shores.\n\nIn the late 18th century, coconut palm plantations were established on the island to produce copra for which slave labourers were brought in from Africa. A small population lived in the archipelago, descendents of Mauritian laborers working the copra industry. After an agreement was signed in 1966 between Britain and the United States, the US built a military base and forcibly evacuated all indigenous people; 1,200 from Diego Garcia, Ile du Coin, and Île Boddam were relocated to Mauritius, while others went to the Seychelles. In 2000, the Chagos islanders won an appeal which restored their authority to live on the islands, and they received UK citizenship in the following year. A 2008 court decision blocked their return. Further complications arose after the 2010 establishment of the world's largest marine reserve as the islanders' commercial fishing capabilities, if they returned to the archipelago, would be curtailed, thus hampering their traditional livelihood.\n\n"}
{"id": "4951472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4951472", "title": "Georeferencing", "text": "Georeferencing\n\nGeoreferencing means that the internal coordinate system of a map or aerial photo image can be related to a ground system of geographic coordinates. The relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file (GeoPDF and GeoTIFF are examples), though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing georeferencing. The most visible effect of georeferencing is that display software can show ground coordinates (such as latitude/longitude or UTM coordinates) and also measure ground distances and areas. \nIn other words, Georeferencing means to associate something with locations in physical space. The term is commonly used in the geographic information systems field to describe the process of associating a physical map or raster image of a map with spatial locations. Georeferencing may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a geographical location, such as points of interest, roads, places, bridges, or buildings.\n\nGeographic locations are most commonly represented using a coordinate reference system, which in turn can be related to a geodetic reference system such as WGS-84.\n\nExamples include establishing the correct position of an aerial photograph within a map or finding the geographical coordinates of a place name or street address (Geocoding).\n\n\nThere are various GIS tools available that can transform image data to some geographic control framework, like the commercial ArcMap, PCI Geomatica, TNTmips (MicroImages,Inc) or ERDAS Imagine. One can georeference a set of points, lines, polygons, images, or 3D structures. For instance, a GPS device will record latitude and longitude coordinates for a given point of interest, effectively georeferencing this point. A georeference must be a unique identifier. In other words, there must be only one location for which a georeference acts as the reference.\n\nImages may be encoded using special GIS file formats or be accompanied by a world file.\n\nTo georeference an image, one first needs to establish control points, input the known geographic coordinates of these control points, choose the coordinate system and other projection parameters and then minimize residuals. Residuals are the difference between the actual coordinates of the control points and the coordinates predicted by the geographic model created using the control points. They provide a method of determining the level of accuracy of the georeferencing process.\n\nIn situations where data has been collected and assigned to postal or area codes, it is usually necessary to convert these to geographic coordinates by use of a definitive directory or gazetteer file. Such gazetteers are often produced by census agencies, national mapping organizations or postal service providers. At their simplest, these may simply comprise a list of area codes or place names and another list of corresponding codes, names or coordinate locations. The range and purpose of the codes available is country-specific. An example is the UK's National Statistics Postcode Directory which shows each postcode's membership of census, administrative, electoral and other geographical areas. In this case, the directory also provides dates of creation and deletion, address counts and an Ordnance Survey grid reference for each postcode, allowing it to be mapped directly. Such gazetteer files support many web-based mapping systems which will place a symbol on a map or undertaken analysis such as route-finding, on the basis of postal codes, addresses or place names input by the user.\n\n\n"}

Darius the Great had conquered this territory in 516 BC. The Greek colonies in Asia Minor (western Turkey) were already part of the Achaemenid Empre since 546 BC and, thus, the Greeks and Indians came into contact with each other as subjects of the Empire.\n\nAccording to Herodotus 4.44, Scylax of Caryanda, a Greek explorer sailed down the length of the Indus in the service of Darius. Hecataeus of Miletus, around 500 BC, wrote about the geography and peoples of India. The Greek pysician Ctesias also wrote about India. Most of these works have not survived in their original form but fragments are known through transmission by later writers. Not only individual Greeks, but also large groups of Greeks were forced to settle in Bactria (northern Afghanistan), who must have had prolonged contact with Indians. Herodotus's account is believed to be based on these accounts.\n\nThe Greeks (or Persians) were not aware of the geography of India (or Asia in general) east of the Indus basin. Herodotus in 4.40 is explicit about India being on the eastern fringe of the inhabitable world,\nBut he knew of Indians (\"Hindwan\") living beyond the Persian province of \"Hinduš\" (3.101):\n\nIn book 3 (3.89-97), Herodotus gives some account of the peoples of India; he describes them as being very diverse, and makes reference to their dietary habits, some eating raw fish, others eating raw meat, and yet others practicing vegetarianism. He also mentions their dark skin colour. \n\nIn 3.38, Herodotus mentions the Indian tribe of the \"Callatiae\" for their practice of funerary cannibalism; in a striking illustration of cultural relativism, he points out that this people is just as dismayed at the notion of the Greeks practicing cremation as the Greeks are at that of eating their dead parents. In book 7 (7.65,70,86,187) and in 8.113 Herodotus describes the Indian infantry and cavalry employed in Xerxes' army.\n\nOnly after the conquests of Alexander the Great and the emergence of the Indo-Greek kingdoms did the Mediterranean world acquire some first-hand knowledge about the region (conversely, Indians also became aware of the existence of the Greeks during this period, naming them \"Yavana\" in Sanskrit). \nBy the 3rd century BC, Eratosthenes recognized \"India\" as terminating in a peninsula (reflecting a first grasp of the geography of the Indian Subcontinent) instead of just placing it generically at the far eastern end of \"Asia\". Eratosthenes was also the first Greek author to postulate an island Taprobane at the far south of India, later becoming a name of Sri Lanka. European knowledge of the geography of India did not become much better resolved until the end of Antiquity, and remained at this stage throughout the Middle Ages, only becoming more detailed with the beginning of the Age of Sail in the 15th century.\n\n\n\n"}

Here, just short of the Scottish border it becomes the A74(M) which continues to Glasgow as the M74.\n\nAs of 2016, the M6, as well as combining with the length of the A14 from Brampton (Cambridgeshire) from junction with A1(M), the A74(M) and M74 to the junction with the M8 in Glasgow, forms the longest non-stop motorway in the United Kingdom and one of the busiest. It incorporated the Preston By-pass, the first length of motorway opened in the UK and forms part of a motorway \"Backbone of Britain\", running north−south between London and Glasgow via the industrial North of England. It is also part of the east−west route between the Midlands and the east-coast ports. The section from the M1 to the M6 Toll split near Birmingham forms part of the unsigned E-road E 24 and the section from the M6 Toll and the M42 forms part of E 05.\n\nThe M6 motorway runs from junction 19 of the M1 and from the beginning of A14 in Catthorpe near Rugby in central England, passes between Coventry, Bedworth and Nuneaton, through Birmingham, Walsall and Stafford and near the smaller cities of Wolverhampton and Stoke-on-Trent. The motorway has major junctions with the M55 at Junction 32, north of Preston ending just before Blackpool, the M65 at Junction 29, south of Preston, towards Blackburn and then Burnley, the M56 and M62 at Warrington, giving access to Chester, Manchester and Liverpool. The M6 then heads north past Wigan, Preston and Lancaster. After the latter two cities it passes through Cumbria with some parts very close to the edge of the Lake District with a short stretch within the national park boundaries and then passes Carlisle on its way to Gretna, before the motorway becomes the A74(M) a few hundred metres (yards) short of the Scottish border.\n\nThe first section of the motorway and the first motorway in the country was the Preston By-pass. It was built by Tarmac Construction and opened by the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 5 December 1958. In January 1959 the Preston by-pass was closed because of rapid surface deterioration over a stretch of \"due to water freezing and then thawing\". Motorists were diverted to the old road while the UK road research laboratory at Harmondsworth pondered the importance of surface water drainage.\n\nLater, other sections of the motorway were constructed, and finally it was all linked together, giving an uninterrupted motorway length of .\nThe second phase of construction was completed in 1960, forming the Lancaster by-pass. Some south, the Stafford by-pass was completed in 1962. By 1965, the remaining sections of motorway Stafford–Preston and Preston–Lancaster had been completed. 1968 saw the completion of the Walsall to Stafford link as well as the Penrith by-pass some north in Cumberland. In 1970, the Lancaster–Penrith link was completed, along with a short section of motorway by-passing the south of Walsall. The most northerly section of the motorway also opened in 1970, running to the designated terminus north of Carlisle. By 1971, the full route was completed between the junction with the M1 motorway at Rugby and the A38 road several miles north-east of Birmingham city centre, including Bromford Viaduct between Castle Bromwich (J5) and Gravelly Hill (J6), which at 3½ miles is the longest viaduct in Great Britain.\n\nJunction 6 in Birmingham is widely known as Spaghetti Junction because of its complexity and round and curvy like design. On the elevated ground between Shap and Tebay, the north and south-bound carriages split apart. At this point a local road (to Scout Green) runs between the two carriageways without a link to the motorway.\n\nThe section of the M6 that runs over Shap Fell in Cumbria is above sea level, one of the highest points on any motorway in the UK (junction 22 of the M62 on Saddleworth Moor is higher). The motorway engineers here chose to follow the route of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway engineered by Joseph Locke (now part of the West Coast Main Line) where the motorway runs in a split-level cutting above the railway in the descent from Shap Fell through the Lune Gorge into southern Cumbria.\n\nThe northbound entry slip road at Lancaster (junction 34) was unusually short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune at this point and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer slip road. This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design. The construction of the Heysham to M6 Link Road (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning slip roads with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.\n\nThe route was originally intended to replace the old A6, which it does along the northern section starting with the Preston Bypass. However, a much closer approximation to the overall actual route of the M6 (heading north from its southern terminus) is provided by following the A45, A34, A50, A49, then the A6. South of Preston, the A6 route is instead supplemented by the M61 as far as Manchester, with the M60 acting as a bypass around the city. South of Manchester, there is no true motorway replacement for the old road. The M1 acts as a bypass for long-distance traffic in the south, from the Kegworth junction near Nottingham, to Luton and St. Albans near London; but, it is not an alternative for local traffic as the routes diverge by more than 15 miles while passing through Northamptonshire. Across the Pennines, the old road remains the main local through-route, and long-distance fast traffic between Derby and Manchester must instead take either the A50 and M6, or M1 and M62.\n\nIn July 1972 the UK Minister for Transport Industries announced that of UK motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project which \"should be\" completed by 1973. Sections to be illuminated included the M6 between junctions 10 and 11, and between junctions 20 and 27.\n\nIn March 2006, after 15 years of debate, the government authorised the construction of a extension of the M6 from its then northern terminus near Carlisle to the Anglo-Scottish border at Gretna (the so-called \"Cumberland Gap\"), where it links into the existing A74(M). The road opened on 5 December 2008, the 50th anniversary of the M6 Preston By-pass. The project, which was a mixture of new road and upgrade of the existing A74, crosses the West Coast Main Line and had an estimated costs of £174 million. It completed an uninterrupted motorway from just south of Dunblane (via the M9, the recently opened M80 section near Cumbernauld and the M73) in the north to Exeter (via the M5) and to London (via both the M42/M40 and the M1) in the south.\n\nThe M6 Toll, Britain's first toll motorway, which bypasses the West Midlands conurbation to the east and north of Birmingham and Walsall and was built to alleviate congestion through the West Midlands, and opened in December 2003. Before the opening of the toll motorway, this section of the M6 carried 180,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point near Wolverhampton (between the junctions with the M54 and M5 motorways), compared with a design capacity of only 72,000 vehicles. Usage, at about 50,000 vehicles, was lower than expected and traffic levels on the M6 were only slightly reduced as a result. The high toll prices, which were set by the operating company and over which the UK government has no influence until 2054, were blamed for the low usage. Much traffic continues to use the M6 or the continued on the M1 and took the A50 or A52. the road between Junctions 3A and 11A now carries 120,000 motor vehicles every day.\n\nA proposed extension to the M6 Toll known as the 'M6 Expressway', which would have continued from the M6 Toll as far as Knutsford, at which point much of the existing M6 traffic leaves the M6 for Manchester, was abandoned in 2006 due to excessive costs, anticipated construction problems and disappointing levels of use of the M6 Toll.\n\nIn October 2007, following a successful trial on the M42 in the West Midlands, the UK government announced that two stretches of the M6 would be upgraded to allow the hard shoulder to be used as a normal running lane during busy conditions under a scheme called active traffic management. The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway. It was then proposed that the system could be extended onto other stretches of the M6 while the government undertook a feasibility study to determine other likely locations for this technology to be used. The stretch between junctions 4 and 5 was completed during December 2009 while the stretch between junctions 10a and 8 was completed during March 2011.\n\nThe government wishes to improve reliability and capacity between Junctions 11 by Cannock and Junction 19 near Knutsford. In 2004, it favoured a new motorway, 'The Expressway' following a roughly parallel course to the existing M6. In July 2006, the government announced its decision to abandon the Expressway proposal, and favoured widening accompanied by demand-management measures, and have launched a study to consider options for providing additional capacity. The current proposal is in introduce managed motorway between Junction 13 and 19. It was later divided into two separate stretches, between junctions 16 and 19 and junctions 13 and 15. The stretch between junctions 16 and 19 started construction in December 2015 while construction on the stretch between junctions 13 and 15 commenced in March 2018.\n\nData from driver location signs are used to provide distance and carriageway identifier information. Where a junction spans several hundred metres (yards) and the start and end distances are known, both distances are shown.\n\nEach motorway in England requires that a legal document called a Statutory Instrument is published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these Statutory Instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is an incomplete list of the Statutory Instruments relating to the route of the M6.\n\n\n"}

It is based at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe first U.S. astronaut candidates were selected by NASA in 1959, for its Project Mercury with the objective of orbiting astronauts around the Earth in single-man capsules. The military services were asked to provide a list of military test pilots who met specific qualifications. After stringent screening, NASA announced its selection of the \"Mercury Seven\" as its first astronauts. Since then, NASA has selected 20 more groups of astronauts, opening the corps to civilians, scientists, doctors, engineers, and school teachers. As of the 2009 Astronaut Class 61% of the astronauts selected by NASA have come from military service.\n\nNASA selects candidates from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds. From the thousands of applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the \"Original Seven\", 339 candidates have been selected to date.\n\nThe Astronaut Corps is based at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, although members may be assigned to other locations based on mission requirements, e.g. Soyuz training at Star City, Russia.\n\nThe Chief of the Astronaut Office is the most senior leadership position for active astronauts in the Corps. The Chief Astronaut serves as head of the Corps and is the principal adviser to the NASA Administrator on astronaut training and operations. The first Chief Astronaut was Deke Slayton, appointed in 1962. The current Chief Astronaut is Patrick Forrester.\n\nSalaries for newly hired civilian astronauts are based on the federal government's General Schedule pay scale for grades GS-11 through GS-14. The astronaut's grade is based on his or her academic achievements and experience. Astronauts can be promoted up to grade GS-15. As of 2015, astronauts based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, earn between $66,026 (GS-11 step 1) and $158,700 (GS-15 step 8 and above).\n\nMilitary astronauts are detailed to the Johnson Space Center and remain on active duty for pay, benefits, leave, and similar military matters.\n\nThere are no age restrictions for the NASA Astronaut Corps. Astronaut candidates have ranged between the ages of 26 and 46, with the average age being 34. Candidates must be U.S. citizens to apply for the program.\n\nThere are three broad categories of qualifications: education, work experience, and medical.\nCandidates must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. The degree must be followed by at least three years of related, progressively responsible, professional experience (graduate work or studies) or at least 1,000 pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for experience (master's degree = 1 year or a doctoral degree = 3 years). Teaching experience, including experience at the K - 12 levels, is considered to be qualifying experience.\n\nCandidates must have the ability to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical, which includes the following specific requirements:\n\n the corps has 38 active astronauts and 18 \"management astronauts\", who are \"employed at NASA but are no longer eligible for flight assignment\". The highest number of active astronauts at one time, was in 2000 when there were 149. All of the current astronaut corps are from the classes of 1996 (Group 16) or later.\n\nThere are currently 19 \"international active astronauts\", \"who are assigned to duties at the Johnson Space Center\", who were selected by their home agency but trained with and serve alongside their NASA counterparts. International astronauts, Payload Specialists, and Spaceflight Participants are not considered members of the NASA Astronaut Corps.\n\nThe term \"Astronaut Candidate\" (informally \"ASCAN\") refers to individuals who have been selected by NASA as candidates for the NASA Astronaut Corps and are currently undergoing a candidacy training program at the Johnson Space Center. The most recent class of Astronaut Candidates was selected in 2017 after receiving more than 18,300 applications. Upon completion of a two-year training program, they will be promoted to the rank of Astronaut.\n\nSelection as an Astronaut Candidate and subsequent promotion to Astronaut does not guarantee the individual will eventually fly in space. Some have voluntarily resigned or been medically disqualified after becoming astronauts but before being selected for flights.\n\nCivilian candidates are expected to remain with the Corps for at least five years after initial training; military candidates are assigned for specific tours. After these time limits, members of the Astronaut Corps may resign or retire at any time.\n\nThree members of the Astronaut Corps (Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger B. Chaffee) were killed during a ground test accident while preparing for the Apollo 1 mission. Eleven were killed during spaceflight, on Space Shuttle missions STS-51-L and STS-107. Another four (Elliot See, Charles Bassett, Theodore Freeman, and Clifton Williams) were killed in T-38 plane crashes during training for space flight during the Gemini and Apollo programs. Another was killed in a 1967 automobile accident, and another died in a 1991 commercial airliner crash while traveling on NASA business.\n\nTwo members of the Corps have been involuntarily dismissed: Lisa Nowak and William Oefelein.

It lies on the border between Pakistan and Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. It is the highest point in Afghanistan and is the world's westernmost 7,000 meter massif.\n\nNoshaq was first climbed by a Japanese expedition in 1960 led by Professor Sakato. Other members of the expedition were Goro Iwatsabo and Toshiaki Sakai. The climb followed the normal Pakistan approach, the southeast ridge from the Qadzi Deh Glacier. The normal Afghanistan approach route is by the west ridge. \n\nThe first winter ascent was 13 February 1973 by Tadeusz Piotrowski and Andrzej Zawada, members of a Polish expedition, via the north face. It was the world’s first winter climb of any 7000 m peak. Until now it is the only winter ascent to this summit.\n\nThe main peak and Noshaq West (7250 m) are on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border lying within Pakistan but also bordering Afghanistan (the Durand Line), a watershed divide. The other peaks of this massif lie well within Pakistan. These all are easily accessible from Chitral, 64 km away. The west side of the massif is in Afghanistan whereas the south and eastern sides are in Pakistan. The second highest peak in this massif is Noshaq East (7480m), climbed in 1963 by Dr.Gerald Gruber and Rudolf Pischenger from Austria. The third highest peak of the massif is Noshaq Central (7400m) followed by Noshaq West. These peaks were also climbed by the same Austrian expedition of 1963.\n\nThe easiest access to Noshaq is from Chitral, Pakistan which is linked to Islamabad by flights which take 40 minutes. Alternatively a road trip from Pakistani capital Islamabad to Chitral takes about 11 hours and from the provincial capital Peshawar about 8 hours. The mountain is also accessible from Qazi Deh village in Afghanistan, 28km a journey of about five days.

Founded by Dr. Birute Galdikas, one of three anthropologists (The Trimates) to study great apes under the guidance of Dr. Louis Leakey, OFI continues to rescue and rehabilitate orangutans, preparing them for release back into protected areas of the Indonesian rain forest. In addition, OFI promotes the preservation of rain forest, an issue that continues to be of interest in various publications such as the \"New York Times\" (January 25, 2007), \"Los Angeles Times\" (October 19, 2008)\", and National Geographic\" Magazine (November 2008: \"Borneo's Moment of Truth.\")\nOrangutan Foundation International, originally called the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project, was founded by Dr. Biruté Mary Galdikas and former husband Rod Brindamour in 1986. The couple started the project to study the ecology and behavior of wild orangutans. The focus later turned towards conservation, protection, rehabilitation, and education of orangutans, which has been an area of interest in various publications including New York Times (January 25, 2007), Los Angeles Times(October 19, 2008), and National Geographic Magazine (November 2008: \"Borneo's Moment of Truth.\") The OFI's research facilities are located in the Indonesian owned part of Borneo,the third largest island in the world. Camp Leakey is where the research on orangutans is conducted and also where rehabilitated orangutans are released.\n\nThe Orangutan Foundation International's mission is to:\nSupport protection, conservation, and understanding about orangutans and their natural habitat while caring for orphaned orangutans and helping them make the transition back into the rain forest. The OFI also educates the public and the government about orangutans, rain forest, and the issues around conservation and protection of the apes and their environment.\n\nThe Orangutan Foundation International was founded in 1986 by Dr. Birute Galdikas. The precursor to the OFI was the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project (ORCP), founded in 1971 by Galdikas with the help of Louis Leakey as moral and financial support. While working toward her Ph.D at UCLA, Dr. Galdikas went to see Leakey who was a guest speaker at the school. During the presentation Galdikas learned that Leakey had sponsored both Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey who also worked with primates and decided to ask him to sponsor her as well. Leakey agreed, and Galdikas, Goodall, and Fossey became The Trimates. In honor of Leakey, Galdikas' named the base camp Camp Leakey. The first work of the ORCP was taking orangutans that were being kept as pets from government officials and others. The formation of the ORCP gave Dr. Galdikas the opportunity to conduct 100,000 hours of observation of orangutans. In 1986, the ORCP morphed in the OFI. The new insight from Galdikas' research with the Asian Ape (orangutan) drew a lot of media attention. Galdikas' found that she needed something to turn the attention into positive action and created the OFI. The OFI's goals were a little bit different from its mother. The OFI is \"aimed specifically at conservation, rehabilitation, research, and education\". Lawyer John Beal visited Camp Leakey in 1979 and after his return to the United States, aided Galdikas' and others in the establishment of The Orangutan Foundation in Los Angeles, California which is headquarters for the OFI\n\nWhat started out to be just two small huts is now a functional research facility. Camp Leakey is where all of the research the OFI conducts on orangutans is done. Others other than the OFI have studied and researched at Camp Leakey including graduate and undergraduate students from multiple institutions such as Universitas Nasional, a college in Indonesia, and universities in the United States. The camp now consists of about 19 miles of trails, rainforest, and swamp land for the rehabilitated orangutans and the wild orangutans that made their home there. The OFI takes in ex-captive, hurt, and orphaned orangutans. Once the ape is in the care of the Dr. Galdikas and her staff, it is raised (if it is young) or treated for any diseases or injuries in the Care Center. The orangutans in the care center are taken each day by their keepers to Camp Leakey to be allowed to play in their natural habitat. This is done to slowly acclimate the orangutans back into the forest so one day they can be released. Once the orangutan is old enough and deemed suitable, it is released back into the wild. Some orangutans never learn to fend for themselves and for that reason can never leave the care center and the staff. Some orangutans do not want to leave the base of the OFI (where the staff eats and lives) and will venture back from time to time to visit the staff and volunteers.\n\nThe efforts of Dr. Galdikas and staff have brought about some controversy. An article from Nature says, \"The orphaned apes were often psychologically damaged and difficult to control. Some even attacked guests and staffers.\" Some researchers questioned the value of the information gained from studying the orphaned apes. The critics question if the behavior of the apes mirrors that of a wild orangutan or not. Other people began wondering if the released orangutans would transmit diseases brought by people to the wild orangutan population.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is of special importance in safety-critical GPS applications, such as in aviation or marine navigation.\n\nGPS does not include any internal information about the integrity of its signals. It is possible for a GPS satellite to broadcast slightly incorrect information that will cause navigation information to be incorrect, but there is no way for the receiver to determine this using the standard techniques. RAIM uses redundant signals to produce several GPS position fixes and compare them, and a statistical function determines whether or not a fault can be associated with any of the signals. RAIM is considered available if 24 GPS satellites or more are operative. If the number of GPS satellites is 23 or fewer, RAIM availability must be checked using approved ground-based prediction software.\n\nSeveral GPS-related systems also provide integrity signals separate from GPS. Among these is the WAAS system, which uses separate signals broadcast from different satellites to indicate these problems directly.\n\nRAIM detects faults with redundant GPS pseudorange measurements. That is, when more satellites are available than needed to produce a position fix, the extra pseudoranges should all be consistent with the computed position. A pseudorange that differs significantly from the expected value (i.e., an outlier) may indicate a fault of the associated satellite or another signal integrity problem (e.g., ionospheric dispersion). Traditional RAIM uses fault detection (FD) only, however newer GPS receivers incorporate fault detection and exclusion (FDE) which enables them to continue to operate in the presence of a GPS failure.\n\nThe test statistic used is a function of the pseudorange measurement residual (the difference between the expected measurement and the observed measurement) and the amount of redundancy. The test statistic is compared with a threshold value, which is determined based on the required probability of false alarm (Pfa).\n\nReceiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) provides integrity monitoring of GPS for aviation applications. In order for a GPS receiver to perform RAIM or fault detection (FD) function, a minimum of five visible satellites with satisfactory geometry must be visible to it. RAIM has various kind of implementations; one of them performs consistency checks between all position solutions obtained with various subsets of the visible satellites. The receiver provides an alert to the pilot if the consistency checks fail.\n\nRAIM availability is an important issue when using such kind of algorithm in safety-critical applications (such as the aeronautical ones); in fact, because of geometry and satellite service maintenance, RAIM is not always available at all, meaning that the receiver's antenna could have sometimes fewer than five satellites in view.\n\nAvailability is also a performance indicator of the RAIM algorithm. Availability is a function of the geometry of the constellation which is in view and of other environmental conditions. If availability is seen in this way it is clear that it is not an on–off feature meaning that the algorithm could be available but not with the required performance of detecting a failure when it happens. So availability is a performance factor of the algorithm and characterizes each one of the different kinds of RAIM algorithms and methodologies.\n\nAn enhanced version of RAIM employed in some receivers is known as fault detection and exclusion (FDE). It uses a minimum of six satellites to not only detect a possible faulty satellite, but to exclude it from the navigation solution so the navigation function can continue without interruption. The goal of fault detection is to detect the presence of a positioning failure. Upon detection, proper fault exclusion determines and excludes the source of the failure (without necessarily identifying the individual source causing the problem), thereby allowing GNSS navigation to continue without interruption. The availability of RAIM and FDE will be slightly lower for mid-latitude operations and slightly higher for equatorial and high-latitude regions due to the nature of the orbits. The use of satellites from multiple GNSS constellations or the use of SBAS satellites as additional ranging sources can improve the availability of RAIM and FDE.\n\nGNSS differs from traditional navigation systems because the satellites and areas of degraded coverage are in constant motion. Therefore, if a satellite fails or is taken out of service for maintenance, it is not immediately clear which areas of the airspace will be affected, if any. The location and duration of these outages can be predicted with the aid of computer analysis and reported to pilots during the pre-flight planning process. This prediction process is, however, not fully representative of all RAIM implementations in the different models of receivers. Prediction tools are usually conservative and thus predict lower availability than that actually encountered in flight to provide protection for the lowest end receiver models.\n\nBecause RAIM operates autonomously, that is without the assistance of external signals, it requires redundant pseudorange measurements. To obtain a 3D position solution, at least four measurements are required. To detect a fault, at least 5 measurements are required, and to isolate and exclude a fault, at least six measurements are required, however often more measurements are needed depending on the satellite geometry. Typically there are seven to 12 satellites in view.\n\nThe test statistic used is a function of the pseudorange measurement residual (the difference between the expected measurement and the observed measurement) and the amount of redundancy. The test statistic is compared with a threshold value, which is determined based on the requirements for the probability of false alarm (Pfa) and the expected measurement noise. In aviation systems, the Pfa is fixed at 1/15000.\n\nThe \"horizontal integrity limit (HIL)\" or \"horizontal protection level (HPL)\" is a figure which represents the radius of a circle which is centered on the GPS position solution and is guaranteed to contain the true position of the receiver to within the specifications of the RAIM scheme (i.e. which meets the Pfa and Pmd). The HPL is calculated as a function of the RAIM threshold and the satellite geometry at the time of the measurements. The HPL is compared with the \"horizontal alarm limit (HAL)\" to determine if RAIM is available.\n\nTo enable pilots to quickly determine whether en route or approach level RAIM will be available, the FAA and EUROCONTROL have created \"dispatch level\" websites that predict RAIM status to meet pre-flight check requirements.\n\n"}

In 2009 the total area of the national park was 14,260 km, including 6,320 km on the land and 7,940 km of the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe area is the habitat of polar bears and bowhead whales. The area also includes one of the largest bird colonies in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as walrus and seal rookeries.

Knowing the precise location of each soakage was extremely valuable knowledge. It is also sometimes called a native well.\n\nAnthropologist Donald Thomson wrote:\n\nWells were covered to keep them free from fouling by animals. This involved blocking the well with dead branches and uprooted trees. When the wells fell into disrepair, people would bail the well, using the coolamon to throw slush against the wall. This would set like a cement wash and help to hold loose sand, preventing it from falling into the water.\n\nWells could be up to fifteen feet deep, with small toe holds cut into the walls.\n\nDonald Thomson writes:\n\nIn the nineteenth century, both Warburton and Carnegie recorded that they had run down Aborigines with camels and captured and chained them to compel them to reveal their secret sources of water. This action left a lasting impression on the desert Aborigines, who would have handed accounts of this down through successive generations.\n\nIn the 1930s, when H. H. Finlayson made his journeys through the desert by camel, he noted that a gelded male camel, after a hard three-and-a-half-day journey in intense heat without water, drank by actual measure without stopping, and fifteen minutes later, another .\n\nThis sheds light on the resentment built up among desert Aborigines against explorers for the exploitation and, by enlarging well entrances and digging out springs, the devastation of their precious water supplies to satisfy camel teams.\n\nDon McLeod also tells a story of clashes over soak water at the time of the gold rushes in Western Australia:\n\nMcLeod relates a story told to him by an old prospector by the name of Long, observing an Aboriginal man and woman:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1414995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1414995", "title": "St. Brandon", "text": "St. Brandon\n\nSaint Brandon, also known as the Cargados Carajos Shoals, is an Indian Ocean archipelago about northeast of Mauritius consisting of a number of sand banks, shoals and islets. Saint Brandon consists of five island groups, with about 28–40 islands and islets in total, depending on seasonal storms and related sand movements. There are 22 named islands and shoals. The archipelago is low-lying and is prone to substantial submersion in severe weather. It has an aggregate land area estimated variously at and . Economic activity in the region is limited to fishing on the very extensive shallow bank covering approximately around the islands. By the early 19th century, most of the islands were in use as fishing stations. Geographically, the archipelago is part of the Mascarene Islands and is situated on the Mascarene Plateau formed by the separation of the Mauritia microcontinent during the separation of India and Madagascar about 60 million years ago.\n\nPolitically, Saint Brandon is part of the territory of Mauritius and is grouped within the Outer Islands of Mauritius along with Agaléga, Tromelin (sovereignty disputed with France) and the Chagos Archipelago (sovereignty disputed with Britain), including Diego Garcia. The Outer Islands are defined as \"all the islands comprised in the State of Mauritius other than the Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues\". They are administered from Port Louis by the Outer Island Development Corporation (OIDC), which is responsible for their management and development and reports to the prime minister's office. Under a judgment by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 30 July 2008, 13 of the outer islands were deemed to have been a permanent grant to the Raphael Fishing Company Ltd. \nThe reef measures more than from north to south, and is wide, cut by three passes. The reef area is . The islands have a small transient population, mostly fishermen, counted at 63 people on census night in 2001. The bulk of this transitory population, approximately 40 people, live on Île Raphael, with smaller settlements existing on Avocaré, Coco, and Île du Sud. A settlement on Albatross Island was abandoned in 1988. The islands are rich in marine flora and fauna, but on some islands the latter have been severely affected by the uncontrolled presence of rats.\n\nIn the past, Cargados Carajos was a large, volcanic island (part of the Mascarenes, caused by the Réunion hotspot). Over time however, the island eroded until it became submerged and a coral atoll was left behind. The archipelago is part of the Mascarene plateau, a submarine plateau north and east of Madagascar that is the second largest in the Indian Ocean after the Kerguelen Plateau.\n\nIndividual islets on the reef include, roughly north to south, the following:\n\n\nA number of unnamed islands and sand cays complete the Cargados. The total number of islands on the reef is close to 40.\n\nSiren Island, Île du Sud, Pearl Island (Île Perle), and Frigate Island (Île Frégate) are west of the reef, while North Island (Île du Nord) is about northeast of the northern tip of the reef.\n\nAlbatross Island, about north, is geographically a separate single coral island at location 16°15'S, 59°35'E.\n\nAlbatross Island is the highest (its highest point is above sea level) and the largest of the islands in the group, with an area of , followed by Raphael, Tortue, Avocaré, Coco Island and Île du Sud.\n\nThe main settlement is on Île Raphael, which is held by the Raphael Fishing Company together with twelve other islands (l'île du Sud (or l'île Boisées), Petit Fou, l'Avocaire, l'île aux Fous (Fous, Ile Fou), l'île du Gouvernement, Petit Mapou, Grand Mapou, La Baleine, l'île aux Cocos, Verronge, l'île aux Bois and Baleines Rocks) under a permanent lease. Île Raphael can have up to 35 resident employees and a coast guard and meteorological station (with eight residents in 1996). Smaller settlements exist on Avocaré, Coco, and Sud; the settlement on Albatross was abandoned in 1988.\n\nCargados comprises about of reefs. It has perhaps the largest algal ridge in the Indian Ocean. Coconut trees can be found on a few islands as well as bushes and grass. The islands are covered with white granular sand from eroded coral, and a thick layer of guano can be found in most places.\nThe shoreline is principally basalt boulders cemented basally by beachrock. The peripheral fringing reefs are exposed to a considerable south-east swell; accumulated water flows with dangerous velocity through the pass between Le Chaland and Ile des Deux Cocos (Procter and Salm, 1974). The reefs are described by Sabn (1976). The western part of the bay has a coral bank and a fringing reef, dominated by staghorn \"Acropora\", with an irregular front which merges with the coral banks; the reef flat has appreciable coral cover. North of this, or deeper into the bay, are several isolated patches of coral growing in deeper water. The eastern border has reefs with a greater diversity of corals, in particular, enormous hillocks of \"Pavona\" spp. with \"Mycedium tenuicostatum\" which is unusual in \nMauritius. On the sandy substrate, \"Goniopora\" and \"Pontes\" provide hard substrate for several other species, notably \"Acropora\" and \"Pavona\". Large tabular \"Acropora\" corals are also conspicuous, and when dead or overturned, provide substrate for other colonizers. These patches have expanded and fused to provide the numerous, large coral banks found in the Bay. Only twenty-eight coral species have been recorded which is probably due to the uniform habitat. Further offshore lies a peripheral fringing reef. This has not been surveyed, and approach to it is difficult because of the south-easterly swell. Noteworthy fauna and flora include ninety-one species of fish recorded (Procter and Salm, 1974). The Bras de Mer du Chaland has a fringe of mangroves especially along the southern border.\nThis complex of low islands, coral reefs and sand banks arises from a vast shallow submarine platform. The main structure is a large, 100 km long crescent-shaped reef whose convex side faces towards the south-east trades and the South Equatorial \nCurrent. The reef front of the main reef recurves inwards at both ends and is cut by two or three passes. Behind the reef there is a vast area of shallows, sand banks and about twenty islets and cays. Some islets lie near the passes but the majority lie well to leeward of the main reef or on the southernmost recurved end. Many patch reefs lie amongst the several hundred square kilometres of shallow water and banks behind the main crescent \"backbone\" (Faure, 1975). The most northerly island is Albatros, which lies about 12 miles (19.3 km) north of the main reef on the rich fishing grounds of Grandes Cameaux, which link up 150 miles (240 km) further north with the Nazareth Banks, another important fishing area. To the north of Cargados Carajos itself lies Ile du Nord (St Brandon). St Raphael, (Establishment Island) Iles at the northern end of the main reef, the main curve of which shelters Perle, Fregate, and Ile Paul in the central region, and a small chain of over a dozen islands at the southern end. Temperatures are 23-26 °C, with rainfall of 1050 mm a year, most falling in January to April. The climate is dominated by the south-east trades. Cyclones can cause considerable damage. In 1948, Il aux Fous disappeared and Avoquer was submerged by 2 m of water. Petit ile Longue was swept away in a later cyclone, but is now reappearing. The South Equatorial Current is dominant. \n\nThe main reef has a very broad reef flat, extending up to several hundred metres across in parts. At its seaward edge, it is characterized by a massive algal ridge (Gardiner, 1907; Strauss in lilt., 9.7.84) whose dimensions would appear to make it by far the largest such structure that has been reported for the Indian Ocean. Together with much of the broad reef flat it is emergent at low tides. Apart from calcareous red algae it supports a few pocilloporoid corals. The reef slope to seawards is described by Strauss (in litt., 9.7.84) as largely devoid of live corals and with few fish. Down to at least 20 m depth the substrate is swept clear of attached biota, although on the sides of spurs or buttresses a few corals exist. Underwater photographs of some of the numerous knolls and banks behind the reef show that the density of corals and soft corals is typical of many very sedimented areas and shallow lagoons in the Indian Ocean. Sedimentation and turbidity is so high in the lee of the main reef, due to floating and suspended organic matter (Strauss in litt., 26.6.84), that visibility is reduced almost to zero in some places. The vast areas of sand which accumulate in the leeward platform suggest plentiful limestone production on and around the reefs and from the main seaward reef. Four scleractinian coral genera have been recorded from the shoals (Stoddart, 1984) but more will certainly be found. The islands are home to vast numbers of seabirds (Feare, 1984; Gardiner, 1907; Strauss in litt., 9.7.84). Staub and Gueho (1968) found a total of 26 species. Blue-faced Boobies \"Sula dactylatra melanops\" are found on Serpent Island and Ile du Nord. Large populations of Sooty Terns \"Sterna fuscata\" and White Terns \"Gygis alba\" occur on Albatros, St Raphael and Siren Islands. The islands were once important nesting sites for Green \"Chelonia mydas\" and Hawksbill Turtles \"Eretmochelys imbricata\". The Coconut Crab \"Birgus latro\" may occur on the islets but there are no confirmed records. Cargados Carajos is reported to be the only place where the spider shell \"Lambis violacea\" has been found (Robertson, 1974). Scientific Importance and Research Scientific visits were made by Gardiner (1907) and Staub and Gueho (1968), who provided historical notes and whose interest was mainly ornithological and botanical. An expedition including U.S. National Museum scientists visited the shoals in 1976 (Strauss in litt., 26.6.84) and carried out mainly ichthyological studies, but provided the only data which is available on the reef biota. The algal ridge is an important feature of the shoals and appears to be the largest recorded for the Indian Ocean. Meteorological data has been recorded on St Raphael since 1944 and is of value in tracking Indian Ocean cyclones (Staub and Gueho, 1968). Management The Fishing Company is responsible for enforcement of both national and local regulations and to date management appears to have been quite good (UNEP, 1984). \n\nIn the 1960s, a turtle Reserve was established at Ile du Nord by the Raphael Fishing Company and landing on this island was permitted only in the summer (Staub and Gueho, 1968) under the Raphael Fishing Company's Regulations.\n\nThe reefs of Mauritius have been overfished and have suffered from the effects of tourism and other development. Mauritius plans to establish two marine reserves of coral reefs that were proposed for protection in 1974. This may demonstrate the pace of protection of natural resources in the area, slowed by the complications of new independence.\n\nIn 1975, the US Government proposed sending a scientific expedition to St Brandon together with the Smithsonian Institution and The National Geographic but this opportunity appears to have been lost at the time due to 'evasion... and buck passing'.\n\nIn 1984, the proposal was made to designate Perle and Fregate Islands as Nature Reserves (UNEP, 1984).\n\nOn some islands, rats, rabbits and chicken are damaging the native fauna which consist mainly of turtles and birds and it is unclear how much longer the archipelago will remain a refuge without international protection. The Mauritius economy is among the world's fastest growing. However, there is pressure to increase tourism. Sugar, introduced by the French, is Mauritius's main crop and represents 17 percent of the country's exports, but the price of sugar is dropping and increased tourism is seen as an important way to diversify the economy.\n\nIn 2010, a survey of seabirds and turtles of St Brandon was undertaken. \"We estimated that 1 084 191 seabirds comprising seven breeding species and excluding non-breeders were present at the archipelago and we counted 279 turtle tracks and nesting pits of green turtles \"Chelonia mydas\". Hawksbill turtles \"Eretmochelys imbricata\" were also present. Analyses of 30 different islets that make up the atoll showed that the seabird species mostly partitioned their use of islets based on islet size, with four species preferring larger islets and two species preferring smaller islets. Alien species introduced historically are still present and other threats, such as shipwrecks, remain. We propose conservation and other measures that should adequately protect the birds, turtles and coral reef by treating the atoll as a system.\"\n\nSt Brandon has been proposed for a Marine Protected Area by the World Bank, has been identified as an ‘Important Bird Area’ in Africa by BirdLife International, as a Marine Important Bird Area under the Nairobi Convention, and a Key Biodiversity Area by the CEPF.\n\nIn 2011, The Ministry of Environment & Sustainable Development issued the \"Mauritius Environment Outlook Report\" which stated that \"There is an urgent need to allocate more resources for a closer monitoring of the environmental assets of the islands.\" It further recommended that St Brandon be declared a Marine Protected Area.\n\nRaphael Fishing Company and the international conservationist Nathalie Boulle consult with and work closely with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation in protecting and promoting the unique ecology of St. Brandon and, in 2013, the latter was awarded the President's Medal by HIH Princess Takamodo of Japan for being ‘a strong supporter of the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation, encouraging and supporting their application to become a Bird Life Partner, and sponsoring their delegate to the 2013 World Conference’; for 'core contributions and service to the Bird Life Partnership'; for 'being a major contributor to Bird Life's core work through unrestricted gifts as Founder Patron’\n\nIn the President's Report of the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation dated March 2016, St Brandon is declared an official MWF project in order to promote the conservation of the atoll.\n\nIn April 2016, The international conservationist Nathalie Boulle together with the Raphael Fishing Company Ltd., funded and organised a seven-day fact-finding mission by some of the world's experts. Three highly acclaimed international experts (Professor Henk Bauwman (Ecotoxicology, Environmental Pollution, Bird Ecology); Professor Tony Martin (world’s foremost expert on marine mammals) and Dr. Nick Cole (herpetologist; MWF Islands Restoration Manager) inspected the islands to raise awareness about the need to protect the islands and to investigate, for the longer term, the effects of plastic and heavy metal pollution in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn 2016, a documentary was made in French on Conservation on the Raphael Fishing Company islands held on permanent lease.\n\nThe atoll was probably discovered in 975 A.D. by Arabian sailors along with Dina Arobi (\"Abandoned Isand\" - Mauritius) and may be referred to as \"Baixos\" on the 1502 Cantino Planisphere. \n\nIt was named in 1506 by Portuguese sailors who put ashore for provisioning on their way to India. Pirates have used the islands as a refuge. \n\nIn 1598, the Dutch occupied the islands. \n\nOn 12 February 1662, the East India Ship \"Arnhem\" ran aground on the Saint Brandon Rocks Volkert Evertsz, the captain, and other survivors of the wreck came ashore on an islet and are thought to have been the last humans to see live dodos. They survived the three months until their rescue by hunting \"goats, birds, tortoises and pigs\". 80 survivors of the Arnhem were rescued and brought to Mauritius by the English ship Truroe in May 1662. Seven of the survivors chose not to return with the first rescue ship.\n\nMauritius and its associated islands were colonised by the French in about 1715, granted by the King of France to the Compagnie des Judes in 1726 but retroceded to the French Crown in 1765. In the book 'The history of Mauritius, or the Isle of France, and the neighbouring islands; from their first discovery to the present time' by Charles Grant, the author quotes from his father's papers that \"The bank of Corgados Garayos was, in 1742, the first object of the researches made by the boat named the Charles, and the tartan the Elizabeth, dispatched from the Isle of France (Mauritius) by order of M. Mahe de la Bourdonnais, at that time Governor of it. These two vessels having made it on the 27th of August, anchored there, and traced a plan of it, by which it is represented in the form of a horse-shoe, and of six leagues in extent, running north-north-east and south-west. These two boats not having been on the north side, and, consequently, not having perceived the isles which lay off it, its small extent, and the affinity of its latitude and longitude with that of Saint Brandon, on which an English vessel, called the Hawk, (le Faucon) was stranded on her return from Surat to Europe, induced me to consider it as one and the same shoal\" Saint Brandon was referred to as 'Cargados' in Samuel Dunn's world map of 1794.\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon ordered the proclamation of the Civil Code as the Law of Mauritius and its islands. When, in 1810, Mauritius and its islands were taken by force of arms by Britain, the articles of capitulation confirmed to the inhabitants, in accordance with British constitutional practice, the continuance of their own laws, i.e. the Code Napoleon as it then stood.\n\nThe islands became part of a British Crown Colony in 1810. In 1820 the then Governor General of Mauritius granted jouissances in respect of the five groups as follows. He granted to Ozile Majestre alone a joussance exclusive over one group, the Iles Boisées, and to two individuals, Ozile Majestre and Dominique Bétuel, jouissances en partage over another group of six islands (Petits Foux, Lavocaire and four others). He granted three further jouissances exclusives to respectively M. Burceret (La Baleine and l’île aux Cocos), Mme. Veuve Raphaël (l’île Raphaël) and Mr William Stone (Ile Veronge and Ile aux Bois). All these jouissances were unlimited in time. Under a deed of transfer dated 4 September 1900, M. Louis Souchon, apparently the then owner of the jouissances relating to Iles Boisées and the six islands, sold the jouissances to the St Brandon Fish & Manure Co. Ltd. Under a second deed dated 20 September 1900 The Mauritius Cooperative Engrais Chimiques Co. Ltd., acting as owner of the remaining three jouissances, sold these to the St Brandon Fish & Manure Co. Ltd., which thus acquired all five groups of the St Brandon Archipelago. The Colonial Government was asked to give its consent to such sales, and on 19 October 1900 notified the purchaser company that it had no objection to the transfers provided that (in translation) “the jouissance which the said company possesses of the above islands and islets be converted in accordance with section 26 [of the 1874 Ordinance] into a permanent lease”. The Government’s requirement was accepted by the purchaser company and led to the Deed of 11 October 1901. The Deed, described as a “permanent lease by the Colonial Government to the St Brandon Fish & Manure Company Limited” was executed on behalf of the government by the Surveyor-General, M.de Coriolis, who on the government’s behalf ratified the two September 1900 sales to the purchaser company. The Deed formally declared that “… the jouissance currently held by the St Brandon Fish & Manure Company Ltd of the islands and islets referred to above be converted to a permanent lease in accordance with the above Ordinance, [with the company] claiming the rights of those to whom the Government of Mauritius granted it originally” and that the lease was to commence as from 2 October 1901. The “permanent lease” contained a number of conditions. In particular, the St Brandon Company was to export all the guano it found on the islands and to pay the Government a royalty of 5 rupees per ton. All the produce of the islands was to be sent to Mauritius.\nFurthermore, “les clauses & conditions contenues aux actes de concession de la suds: jouissance sont maintenues dans leur intégralité & lieront la Société … envers le Gouvernement Colonial….” The company was also to pay the Government an annual sum of one rupee,\nwhich was due on 2 October each year.\n\nIn more modern times the islands were mined for phosphates derived from guano. Mining ceased in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe St. Brandon archipelago was surveyed by British colonial authorities on 31 March 1911 as part of the Census of Mauritius. This found a total population of 110, made up of 97 men (86 non-Indian and 11 Indian) and 13 women (10 non-Indian and 3 Indian). While the archipelago likely had a resident population at this point, as indicated by the 8 children under the age of 15 and the 5 people over the age of 60, there was also likely a seasonal component, with the largest population segment being men between 20 and 35. 73 men worked in fishing, 11 at the guano mines and 4 were ship's carpenters. Only one (male) person was recorded as having been born on St. Brandon.\n\nThe 1911 census reported that three of St. Brandon's 39 houses were built of stone and eight of wood, with 28 built of thatch. Most of these were single-room dwellings, but 10 had two rooms and one had three. There were also eight shops or stores and a one-room chapel.\n\nDuring October–November 1917, the St. Brandon Islands and, in particular, the lagoon of Cocos Island, were used as a base by the German raiding vessel \"Wolf\", commanded by \"Fregattenkapitän\" Karl August Nerger. At Cocos I., \"Wolf\" transferred stoking coal and stores from a captured Japanese ship, \"Hitachi Maru\", an operation that took three weeks. The coal was necessary for the raider's return to Germany. To do so, \"Wolf\" had to run a gauntlet of Allied warships from near the Cape of the Good Hope to the North Atlantic. On 7 November 1917, the Germans scuttled \"Hitachi Maru\" 16 miles off shore and \"Wolf\" departed. She reached her home port of Kiel on 24 February 1918. Still on board were 467 prisoners of war from captured vessels, as well as substantial quantities of rubber, copper, zinc, brass, silk, copra, cocoa and other materiel.\n\nIn the 1921 census, the population had plummeted to just 22. There were 21 men (ages 19–48) and just one woman, a married Catholic, aged 31. 14 people were identified as part of the \"general population\", with 11 of them born on Mauritius, one on Rodrigues and two in the Seychelles. In addition, there were 3 Indo-Mauritanians and 5 \"other Indians\" from Madras, Calcutta and Colombo.\n\nThe most common employment on St. Brandon in 1922 was agriculture, with a manager, assistant manager and 11 labourers. Only two young men were recorded as working as fishermen. Three men worked as carpenters, one as a mason, one as a shoemaker and another as a domestic servant. There was no indication that the guano mines were operating.\n\nIn 1925 the liquidators of the St Brandon Company sold the right to the permanent lease to France Ulcoq who sold it in 1928 to the Raphael Fishing Co Ltd (“Raphael Fishing”).\n\nMauritius, and its islands, became an independent state within the Commonwealth in 1968 and a republic in 1992.\n\nIn 2011, The Ministry of Environment & Sustainable Development issued the \"Mauritius Environment Outlook Report\" which stated that \"For the Outer Islands of ... St. Brandon, major improvements are required to promote development, environmental protection and judicious use of natural resources.\"\n\nShipwrecks on the low-lying, rocky reefs of St. Brandon have been recorded since as early as 1662.\n\nOn 12 February 1662, the Dutch East Indiaman sailing ship Arnhem wrecked itself on the rocks at St. Brandon.\n\nIn 1780s (?) - The English ship, The Hawk, foundered on Saint Brandon on her return to Europe from Surat.\n\nIn July 1818, the sailing vessel Cabalva, owned by the East India Company, struck the reef at St. Brandon and was destroyed.\n\nOn 15 September 1845, the sailing ship Letitia ran aground on Frigate islet.\n\nOn 3 October 1969, the Russian tugboat Argus itself on the reef at St. Brandon. 38 men were rescued by local fishermen. \nOn 29 November 2014, during the second leg of the 2014–15 Volvo Ocean Race, the sailboat Team Vestas Wind ran aground on St. Brandon. The crew was safely rescued, and a complicated salvage operation succeeded in removing the wreck from the reef. \nOn 1 February 2015, the fishing vessel Kha Yang, with 250,000 litres of fuel in its tanks, ran aground on the reef of St. Brandon. 20 crew were rescued shortly after its grounding, and a salvage operation pumped the fuel from its tanks a few weeks later.\n\nOn 2 February 2017, the 190 meter long bulk carrier Alam Manis ran aground on Cargados Carajos . The bulk carrier was headed to Pipava from Richards Bay when it ran aground.\n\n\n"}

Tiltyards were a common feature of Tudor era castles and palaces. \nThe Horse Guards Parade in London was formerly the tiltyard constructed by Henry VIII as an entertainment venue adjacent to Whitehall Palace; it was the site of the Accession Day tilts in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I.\n\nHenry VIII also constructed a tiltyard at Hampton Court Palace, where one of the towers, known as the Tiltyard Tower, was used for viewing the tournaments below.\n\nThe Tiltyard at Whitehall was \"a permanent structure and apparently had room for 10-12,000 spectators, accommodated in conditions which ranged from the spartan to the opulent.\" Ambitious young aristocrats participated in the Accession Day events for the Elizabeth I in 1595 where \"the whole chivalric nature of the tournament with its mock combat and heroic connotations was peculiarly appealing.\" The aristocrats who attended wore elaborate costumes \"designed and made for themselves and their servants.\"\n\nAnother tiltyard used during the reign of Queen Elizabeth existed at Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire. It was constructed on top of one of the dams that formed part of the water defences between the outer bailey and the bridgehead. Today it forms the main walkway to the castle.\n\nA modern tiltyard was constructed outside the Royal Armouries in Leeds for demonstrations of medieval martial pursuits, including jousting reenactment and falconry.\n"}

Historically, it was one of the three valli of Sicily.\n\nThe oldest recorded settlement in the Val di Noto was the ancient town of \"Akrai\", near Palazzolo Acreide, which was founded in 664 BC. It was the first colony of the Corinthian settlement at Syracuse.\n\nThe settlements of the Val di Noto were completely destroyed by the enormous 1693 Sicily earthquake. Following the earthquake, many towns were rebuilt on entirely new sites, such as Noto and Grammichele. The rulers of the time, the kings of Spain, granted the nobleman Giuseppe Lanza special authority to redesign the damaged towns, which he achieved by sympathetically designing the new towns in a baroque and renaissance style.\n\nThe new settlements were redesigned to have a town square in the centre and to spread out in a radial pattern from there. Major buildings like churches, cloisters and palaces were built as focal points for the new streets, and the streets themselves were laid out in a grid pattern. Many of the individual towns were rebuilt to have a unique character, such as the town of Grammichele which was built in a hexagonal shape with the town square in the centre, consisting of the parish and town hall.\nThe towns were rebuilt in what came to be known as the Sicilian Baroque style; the most notable of which is the town of Noto itself, which is now a popular tourist destination due to its fine Baroque architecture.\n\nArchaeology\nThe ruined town of Angie was rediscovered by the historian Tomas Fuentes in the 16th century.\nFurther excavations in the early 19th century by Baron Gabrielle Ally unearthed important artifacts from the early history of eastern Sicily.\n\nIn June 2002, UNESCO inscribed the towns of the Val di Noto on the World Heritage List as \"representing the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe\". The listed towns are Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.\n"}
