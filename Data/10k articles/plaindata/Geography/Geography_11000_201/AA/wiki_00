Geographically, Cumbria is situated near the centrepoint of the British Isles. The contrasting landscapes between the mountains and the fertile coastal areas and the rich variety of mineral resources available in the county have made it a desirable area for habitation since the Upper Paleolithic, and various ethnic groups have been drawn to the area, leaving their linguistic mark since the Iron Age.\n\nWhaley provides a summary of the history of linguistic influences on, plus a dictionary of, the place-names of the area covered by the Lake District National Park, plus entries for Kendal, Cockermouth and Penrith, Cumbria. The five much earlier volumes of the English Place-Name Society cover the whole of the former counties of Cumberland, and Westmorland. Ekwall covers Lancashire, the northern part of which now lies within Cumbria.\n\nSince at least the Iron Age, the inhabitants of Cumbria would have spoken Common Brittonic, which is also the ancestor of modern Welsh, Cornish and Breton. Evidence of this language is mostly visible in topographical features such as rivers (\"Kent, Eden, Ehen, Levens\") and mountains (\"Blencathra, Helvellyn, Coniston Old Man\").\n\nIn the first millennium AD the Brythonic spoken in north west England and southern Scotland developed into a separate strain called Cumbric, which included some influences from Latin picked up during the Roman occupation of Britain. It is likely that most place names with Brythonic influences have survived from this time (\"Carlisle, Penrith, Penruddock\")\n\nBritish influenced place names exist throughout the whole county, but are particularly common around the river valleys of the Lake District and around the coastal plains of the Solway Firth.\n\nCommon Brythonic elements\n\nAngles from Deira and Bernicia (later Northumbria) would have gradually filtered into Cumbria since the 5th century, but the area retained a distinctly British identity until at least the 8th century. Settlement by the English began in the north, with settlers following the line of Hadrian's Wall and traversing Stainmore Pass then settling the Eden Valley before making their way along the north coast. Some time later they would have begun to move into the Kent Valley, Cartmel and Furness, gradually moving further north along the west coast.\n\nSurviving place names have been taken to show that the Anglo-Saxons stayed out of the mountainous central region and remained in the lowlands, but after the Celtic kingdom of Rheged was annexed to English Northumbria sometime before 730 AD, the Celtic language of Cumbric was slowly replaced by Old English\n. As a result, Old English elements can be found throughout the county, but mostly in the names of towns and villages (\"Workington, Millom\"). Very few rivers or mountains contain Old English elements (\"Eamont, Stainmore\"), but many of the lakes contain the element \"mere\", meaning 'lake'.\n\nCommon Old English elements\n\nThe Norse appear to have arrived in Cumbria in about 925 AD and left a huge impression upon the toponymy of Cumbria. Originally from Norway, it is generally accepted that they would have come here via their colonies in Iceland, Ireland and the Isle of Man, perhaps bringing with them a touch of Gaelic influence. Placenames with \"thwaite\", which are commonplace in Cumbria, are also abundant in the southern counties of Hordaland, Rogaland, Agder and Telemark in Norway proper, and less in use elsewhere (Norwegian: tveit, tvedt).\n\nIt seems they would have arrived around the south west of the county and penetrated into the uplands of the central region where the Old Norse influence is dominant. Many mountains, rivers and valleys have Norse names, as attested by the abundance of the elements \"fell\", \"-ay\" and \"dale\" (\"Mickledore, Scafell, Rothay, Duddon, Langsleddale, Allerdale\"). Many town and villages also contain Norse elements (\"Keswick, Whitehaven, Ravenglass, Silloth, Ulverston, Ambleside\")\n\nCommon Old Norse elements\n\nThere are also a number of Danish influenced place names (\"Allonby, Thursby, Ousby, Milnthorpe\"), but the majority are situated along the Eden Valley and the north coast of the county, suggesting that they might have come across Stainmore around the 9th century AD.\n\nCommon Danish elements\n\nSome names show evidence of Irish or Norse-Gaelic influence (\"Kirksanton, Ireleth, Ireby\"). Several Gaelic Saints are recalled in Cumbrian place names, including St. Bega, St. Brigid, and St. Sanctan. \nThe influence of the early Celtic Church in Northumbria and Cumbria was considerable.\n\nAt the time of the Norman conquest in 1066, it is likely that a mixture of Norse and Old English would have been spoken throughout most of Cumbria, which persisted until the spread of Middle English after the 12th century. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists only a few places in the south of the region, as at this time most of northern and central Cumbria was part of Scotland, but with several battles over the following centuries the whole area became part of England.\n\nThe influence of Anglo-Norman is usually confined to manorial names and residences and often include a personal name to distinguish between two places belonging to different lords (\"Egremont, Beaumont, Maulds Meaburn, Crosby Garret, Ponsonby, Grange\").\n\nAlthough it is often difficult to distinguish between a Middle English name and an earlier one, some places do seem to contain elements (\"Tod Ghyll, Brocklebank, Ladyholme, Cam Spout, Monk Coniston, Newlands, Sweden Bridge\")\n\nCommon Anglo-Norman and Middle English elements\n\nSeveral places in Cumbria have been renamed in more recent times, (\"Belle Island, Maryport, Longtown, Sprinkling Tarn\")\n\nOE Old English\nON Old Norse\nDa Danish\nBr Brythonic Celtic\nGo Goidelic Celtic\nIr Irish\nSc Scottish\nAN Anglo-Norman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While not today an administrative entity in itself, Czech Silesia is, together with Bohemia and Moravia, one of the three historical Czech lands. In this context, it is often mentioned as \"Silesia\" even though it is only around one tenth of the area of the historic land of Silesia. \n\nIt lies in the north-east of the Czech Republic, predominantly in the Moravian-Silesian Region, with a section in the northern Olomouc Region. It is almost identical in extent with the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, also known as Austrian Silesia before 1918; between 1938 and 1945, part of the area was also alluded to as Sudeten Silesia (, , , ): a reference to the Sudetenland.\n\nCzech Silesia borders Moravia in the south, Poland (Polish Silesia) in the north (in the northwest the County of Kladsko, until 1742/48 an integral part of Bohemia) and Slovakia in the southeast. With the city of Ostrava roughly in its geographic center, the area comprises much of the modern region of Moravian-Silesia (save for its southern edges) and, in its far west, a small part of the Olomouc Region around the city of Jeseník. After Ostrava, the most important cities are Opava and Český Těšín. Historically Český Těšín is the western part of the city of Cieszyn which nowadays lies in Poland.\n\nSituated in the Sudetes, it is cornered by the Carpathians in the east. Its major rivers are the Oder (Polish, ), Opava and Olše () (which forms part of the natural border with Poland).\n\nThe first Germanic settlements were built in the second century. Later the Germanic tribes moved west and Slavs came into the country. Modern-day Czech Silesia derives primarily from a small part of Silesia that remained within the Bohemian Crown and the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the First Silesian War in 1742, when the rest of Silesia was ceded to Prussia. It was re-organised as the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, with its capital at Opava (, ). In 1900, the Duchy occupied an area of 5,140 km² and had a population of 670,000.\n\nIn 1918, the former Duchy formed part of the newly created state of Czechoslovakia, except the Cieszyn Silesia, which was split between Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1920, Czechoslovakia gaining its western portion. Hlučín Region (, ), formerly part of Prussian Silesia, also became part of Czechoslovakia under the Treaty of Versailles in 1920.\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of 1938, most of Czech Silesia became part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland and Poland occupied the Zaolzie area on the west bank of the Olza (the Polish gains being lost when Germany occupied Poland the following year).\n\nWith the exception of the areas around Cieszyn, Ostrava and Hlučín, Czech Silesia was predominantly settled by German-speaking populations up until 1945. Following the Second World War, Czech Silesia and Hlučínsko were returned to Czechoslovakia and the ethnic Germans were expelled. The border with Poland was once again set along the Olza (although not confirmed by treaty until 1958).\n\nThe population mainly speaks Czech with altered vowels. Some of the native Slavic population speak Lach, which is classed by \"Ethnologue\" as a dialect of Czech, although it also shows some similarities to Polish. In Cieszyn Silesia a unique dialect is also spoken, mostly by members of the Polish minority there.\n\nNotable people from Czech Silesia include:\n"}

{"id": "12413980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12413980", "title": "Hydraulophone", "text": "Hydraulophone\n\nA hydraulophone is a tonal acoustic musical instrument played by direct physical contact with water (sometimes other fluids) where sound is generated or affected hydraulically. The hydraulophone was described and named by Steve Mann in 2005, and patented in 2011. Typically, sound is produced by the same hydraulic fluid in contact with the player's fingers. It has been used as a sensory exploration device for low vision individuals.\n\nThe term may be applied based on the interface used to play the instrument, in which a player blocks the flow of water through a particular hole in order to sound a particular note, or based on a hydraulic sound production mechanism. Hydraulophones use water-flow sound-producing mechanisms. They have a user interface, which is blocking water jets to produce sound. Those described in Mann's paper \"Hydraulophone design considerations\" use water jets striking perforated spinning disks, shafts, or valves, to create a pulsating water flow, similar to a siren disk. A single disk, shaft, or valve assembly can have rings or passages with different numbers of holes for different notes. Some hydraulophones have reeds (one or more reed for each finger hole) and some are reedless, having one or more fipple mechanism associated with each finger hole, thus having no moving parts to wear out.\n\nBlocking flow through a finger hole directs the water instead to one or more of the above-described sound-production mechanisms, or resulting changes in flow or pressure affect a separate sounding mechanism associated with each finger hole.\n\nBlocking water from coming out of a given hole produces a given note, which, in some embodiments, is electrically amplified by a hydrophone. In one embodiment there is a further processing of each hydrophone signal. Embodiments with various kinds of acoustic or optical pickups are also disclosed.\n\nSome hydraulophones include an underwater hydrophone pickup to allow the sounds produced by the water to be electrically amplified. Electric amplification allows effects to be added (as with an electric guitar) as well as making the hydraulophone a hyper-acoustic instrument (that is, using computation to change the acoustic sound of the water into some other instrument).\n\nThe hydraulophone is similar to a woodwind instrument, but it runs on incompressible (or less compressible) fluid rather than a compressible gas like air. In this context hydraulophones are sometimes called \"woodwater\" instruments regardless of whether or not they are made of wood (as woodwind instruments are often not made of wood).\n\nThe water must be \"blown\" into the hydraulophone by way of a pump which can be hand-operated, wind operated, water powered, or electric. Unlike woodwind instruments in which there is one mouthpiece at the entrance to the flute chamber, hydraulophones have mouthpieces at every exit port from the chamber.\n\nWhereas internal ducted flutes have one fipple mechanism for the mouth of the player, along with several finger holes that share the one fipple mechanism, the hydraulophone has a separate mouth/mouthpiece for each finger hole. A typical park-hydraulophone for installation in public spaces has 12 mouths, whereas a concert hydraulophone typically has 45 mouths.\n\nEmbouchure is controlled by way of the instrument's mouths, not the player's mouth such that the player can sing along with the hydraulophone (i.e. a player can sing and play the instrument at the same time). Moreover, the instrument provides the unique capability of polyphonic embouchure, where a player can dynamically \"sculpt\" each note by the shape and position of each finger inserted into each of the mouths. For example, the sound is different when fingering the center of a water jet than when fingering the water jet near the periphery of the circular mouth's opening.\n\nMany diatonic hydraulophones are built with 12 water jets, one for each of the instrument's 12 notes.\nThe standard compass starts on A, extending up an octave and a half to E.\n\nThe standard A to E range, in which it is possible to play with polyphonic embouchure on any or all diatonic notes at the same time, is shown on the left side of the diagram. When playing only monophonically, some additional range is possible on certain hydraulophones, indicated here by small cue notes at the end-points.\n\nLeft, the extended notes come from closing key change valves or flexing key change levers, for sharpener, and flattener. To play a low G, one must be playing in C minor (with A) and close the flattener valve simultaneously. When playing on the high E jet, closing the sharpener valve produces an F.\n\nWith change-valves, the diatonic hydraulophone is polyphonic in the same sense as a so-called \"chromatic harmonica\" – you can play chords and move all members of a chord down one semitone or up one semitone together, but the function of the valves is usually not separated to work on a per-note basis, so for example, you can play an A-minor chord, and flex the entire chord down to A-flat minor, but you can't easily play an A major chord without the use of polyphonic embouchure to bend only the middle note to a C (which requires more skill than the average hydraulist has). Thus the \"diatonic\" hydraulophone is called \"diatonic\" conservatively to \"under promise and over-deliver\".\n\nFinally, on the right, the additional extended range comes from the two octave-change valves (all notes can be shifted as many as two octaves down, or one octave up).\n\nWhereas park and pool hydraulophones are usually 12-jet diatonic, concert-hydraulophones are usually 45-jet chromatic.\n\n45-jet hydraulophones have a 3 octave range of A to E, chromatic, plus an additional A-flat below the lowest A.\nThe playing compass (45 water jets) is the same as the sounding range (45 notes).\n\n12-jet hydraulophones are installed in public spaces, but there is a 45-jet south hydraulophone at the Ontario Science Centre, a concert-hydraulophone having this precise range and compass.\n\nAs public art installations, hydraulophones can be made in various themes and designs.\nAn example of a theme-specific hydraulophone is the Aquatune located at the main entrance to the Legoland waterpark in Carlsbad California. This hydraulophone, which Legoland describes as \"a musical water stand\", is the centerpiece of the entranceway, and is flanked on either side by educational installation exhibits, such as water tables where participants can build water dams from lego blocks, and learn about laminar and turbulent flows through various flow channels.\n\nHydraulophones may be built into hot tubs for use in cold weather. This solves the problem of keeping the hydraulist warm, as well as keeping the hydraulic fluid (e.g. water) heated by way of standard pumping and heating equipment. In this kind of hydraulophone (e.g. balnaphone, from the Greek \"balnea\" meaning \"bath\") the hydraulist is immersed in the hydraulic fluid used by the instrument.\n\nMany hydraulophones include a separate water-filled pipe for each note, and have sound-production means similar to pipe organs (but with water rather than air), while maintaining the flutelike user-interface (finger embouchure holes).\n\nThis form of hydraulophone is similar to an organ, but has water flowing through the pipes instead of air flowing through the pipes.\n\nOn a concert hydraulophone, the finger holes are arranged like the keys on a piano, i.e. there is a row of uniformly spaced holes close to the player, and a row of holes that are in groups of 2, 3, 2, 3, ..., a little further from the player. Whereas the piano and organ both have a similar kind of keyboard layout, the response (\"key action\") is different. Pianos tend to respond to velocity (how quickly a key is struck), whereas organs tend to respond to displacement (whether or not a key is pressed down). Hydraulophones tend to respond to the time-integral of displacement (total water flow), as well as to displacement, velocity, and to some degree jerk and jounce .\n\nThe hydraulophone uses liquid, typically water. It is thus related to the pagophone, an instrument that uses ice, and the calliope, an instrument that uses steam.\n\nPresently the world's largest hydraulophone is the main architectural centerpiece out in front of the Ontario Science Centre, one of Canada's landmark architecture sites. It is also Toronto's only freely accessible aquatic play facility that runs 24 hours a day.\n\nThis hydraulophone is not put on display during winter months.\n\nBecause the water-spray from hydraulophones obscures vision (or because hydraulophones are played underwater where visibility is poor), finger holes are sometimes encoded in Braille. Braille has the added advantage that the one-to-one correspondence between letters and numbers is the same as the standard A-minor hydraulophone, i.e. jet 1 is A, jet 2 is B, jet 3 is C, etc..

A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, often associated with a specific culture. European cuisine (also called \"Western cuisine\") refers collectively to the cuisines of Europe and other Western countries. European cuisine includes cuisines of Europe, including (depending on the definition) that of Russia, as well as non-indigenous cuisines of North America, Australasia, Oceania, and Latin America, which derive substantial influence from European settlers in those regions. The term is used by East Asians to contrast with Asian styles of cooking. This is analogous to Westerners referring collectively to the cuisines of Asian countries as Asian cuisine. When used by Westerners, the term may refer more specifically to cuisine \"in\" Europe; in this context, a synonym is Continental cuisine, especially in British English.\n\nThe cuisines of Western countries are diverse by themselves, although there are common characteristics that distinguishes Western cooking from cuisines of Asian countries and others. Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving-size. Wheat-flour bread has long been the most common sources of starch in this cuisine, along with pasta, dumplings and pastries, although the potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonization of the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each episode usually consists of four to five of these recurring segments plus the regular segment of \"Strange But True\".\n\nIn Strange But True, each team is given three clues regarding a \"strange but true\" news story. The clues are presented in the second round of the show and then revisited in the final round, when the teams must use the clues to determine the story. The first two clues are represented by props, with Robins often forced to wear a humiliating headpiece, mask or costume as his clue. The final clue is a song performed by one of the panellists, a special musical guest act or occasionally McDermott. In the initial presentation of the clues, only a verse and chorus is performed. When revisiting the clues later in the show the song is performed in full, sometimes as a whole musical routine involving other team members or the whole cast.\nPanel segments, listed in alphabetical order, involve games that encourage discussion about possible answers amongst team members. The first round of the show is usually a panel segment.\n3-And-A-Half Corners involves questions about news from around the world.\nIn 5 Second Grab, news stories must be identified from a short quote.\nIn 7 Days In 7 Seconds, teams are shown a quick montage of seven stories from the week. The teams alternate identifying each story until the seventh story which is thrown open to the fastest responding team. At the end of the segment the images from the montage collect on screen as McDermott recounts each story, often obscuring his face as a running gag. In the 2009 finale, the game was played as \"12 Months In 7 Seconds\" using stories from the year.\nA Thousand Words involves each team offering their best captions for images from the week’s news. \nIn Animal Magnetism, each team is shown three images of different animals that they must match to three images of various objects or people to illustrate a story from the week's news.\nIn Buzz Words, teams are required to elaborate on a given term or phrase relating to news from the week.\nGiving Headline involves identifying news stories from their newspaper headline.\nIn Limericks, news stories are presented in the form of a limerick.\nIn Name Game, McDermott asks each panel member a question where the answer is somebody's name.\nNewsflash, previously named \"Fast Money\", is played against a timer, where teams alternate answering questions about stories of the week until the last question which is thrown open to either team.\nIn Spot The Bull, each team is presented with a news story and must identify which of three quotes was the one actually said. A video clip of the person quoted is played to reveal the correct answer.\nSurvey Says is a multiple choice game where each team must identify the correct finding from a conducted survey.\nIn Warren, each team is given three headlines regarding the same subject, but its identity has been concealed by the name “Warren”. In this segment, the audience cries “Warren!” following Paul’s explanation of the game.\nIn What’s The Story, each team is shown a series of clips and images from a news story of the week that they must identify.\n\nThese games, listed in alphabetical order, are played by an individual panellist, or occasionally a specially appearing non-panellist guest, on behalf of their team and usually away from the panel desk. Panellists sometimes play against an opposing team panellist, or are individually quizzed by McDermott. Games from individual segments are typically less news-oriented than the games from panel segments, and as such are more suitable for international guests who are unlikely to be up to date with Australian news.\nBlow Up Your Pants, previously named \"Scattegories\", where the panellist enters an apparently sound-proof booth in which pieces of paper each printed with a letter are blown around the booth. The panellist must catch a letter and is asked questions where all answers must begin with that letter. Questions usually refer to both news of the week and random trivia.\nBorder Insecurity, a game specifically for international guests, is a quiz about Australian culture.\nIn Buzzers Of Death, a panellist from each team competes against the other in the news topic of bizarre, unique deaths or accidents regarding people who \"remove themselves from the gene pool in very special ways\" by pressing their buzzers, which trigger a small explosion in the ends of two broken wires held by McDermott. The only rule of the game is that buzzers cannot be pressed until each multiple choice answer is listed, although panellists often violate this rule much to McDermott’s frustration. At the end of the segment, McDermott brings the broken ends of the wires together, setting off a chain of explosions that usually ends with the destruction of a part of the set or injury to McDermott.\n\nIn Couch Potato, a panellist from each team sits on a lounge chair and is interviewed by McDermott in a mock psychiatrist-type session. The first part of the interview consists of a word association, followed by McDermott suggesting to “go a little deeper” with more structured questions.\nClash Of The Titans is a game where a panellist from each team face off over questions about the news or general knowledge, crying out their own name as their buzzer. However, panellists often challenge this rule, resulting in the use of nicknames to match up the number of syllables in each panellist’s buzzer (as with “Wardo” and “Scottie” in a round between Felicity Ward and Denise Scott), or comically long names and words (such as Adam Spencer’s use of “Adam Barrington Spencer” or Colin Lane’s “disestablishmentarianism”).\nIn Dishing The Dirt, the panellist is given two possible answers for questions regarding entertainment, gossip and other tabloid news. \nKnow Your Enemy involves a panellist from each team facing off over questions about their opponent, which have been referenced from Wikipedia.\nIn Little Pricks, a panellist from each team face off over questions regarding news or general knowledge to throw darts at a wall of balloons, which contains four images of well-known people at the centre. Points are awarded for identifying the person in each image.\nIn Magazine Mastermind, a panellist from each team is given a magazine on an obscure topic to study before the show, then must answer questions about the subject.\nSo You Think You Can Mime, previously named \"Bad Street Theatre\", requires the panellist to mime a news story from the week to their team which is often quite unusual for additional comedic impact. The name of the game refers to the dance show \"So You Think You Can Dance\".\nIn Target Of Opportunity, the panellist from each team are shown images of people making news and discuss the stories in a critical manner.\nUp Cut requires the panellist to rearrange words on a magnet board to make three headlines from the news of the week.\nIn Would You Believe, the panellist must guess which of the three news stories recounted by the opposing panel members is true. The panellist may ask questions, to which the person possessing the real story must answer truthfully while the others are permitted to lie.\nWhat Would an Idiot Say?, previously named \"Are You Stupider Than A 5th Grader?\" is a game where the panellist is given a question from a quiz show and three “superbly dumb” answers, of which one the panellist must identify was actually given as an answer by a contestant.\n\nGroup segments, listed in alphabetical order, involve games where all six panellists participate without formal team division or scoring. \nIn 7 Things For The Bin, panellists sit around a rubbish bin and rant about a news story which they never want to hear of again, then “bin” the story by throwing their magazine and newspaper props into the bin. However, this often extends to any topic annoying the panellist. Despite its name, McDermott only occasionally contributes a seventh “thing” for the bin.\nIn Hot Spot, McDermott stands amongst the audience and asks the panellists on stage questions about the news of the week, to which they must respond with witty one-liners while standing on a large yellow spot.\n\nThese games, listed in alphabetical order, are typically one-off occurrences designed for special guests or occasions.\nGood News Week Kitchen required each team to identify newsmakers from the week as represented by different food dishes, played for the occasion of \"MasterChef Australia\" judges Matt Preston and George Calombaris appearing as panellists.\nMaking Your Mark was a quiz about the environment and sustainability, played for the occasion of Making Your Mark week, Network Ten's environmental initiative.\nPolitical Mastermind involved a quiz about Australian political history, played for the occasion of a special guest appearance by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.\nSporting Mastermind was a sport-themed quiz, played for the occasion of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\nIn The Great Debate, teams captains Mikey Robins and Claire Hooper portrayed opposition leader Tony Abbott and Prime Minister Julia Gillard, respectively, and responded to questions on party policies asked by McDermott in a parody of the 2010 leaders debate. On a second occasion, leaders were portrayed by panellists Peter Berner and Corinne Grant.\n\n"}

{"id": "1986817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986817", "title": "Magnetic deviation", "text": "Magnetic deviation\n\nMagnetic deviation is the error induced in a compass by \"local\" magnetic fields, which must be allowed for, along with magnetic declination, if accurate bearings are to be calculated. (More loosely, \"magnetic deviation\" is used by some to mean the same as \"magnetic declination\". This article is about the former meaning.)\n\nCompasses are used to determine the direction of true North. However, the compass reading must be corrected for two effects. The first is magnetic declination or variation—the angular difference between \"magnetic North\" (the local direction of the Earth's magnetic field) and true North. The second is \"magnetic deviation\"—the angular difference between magnetic North and the compass needle due to nearby sources of interference such as magnetically permeable bodies, or other magnetic fields within the field of influence.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is modified by local magnetic anomalies. These include variations of the magnetization in the Earth's crust caused by geomagnetic reversals as well as nearby mountains and iron ore deposits. Generally, these are indicated on maps as part of the declination. Because the Earth's field changes over time, the maps must be kept up to date for accurate navigation. Short term errors in compass readings are also caused by fields generated in the Earth's magnetosphere, particularly during geomagnetic storms.\n\nIn navigation manuals, \"magnetic deviation\" often refers specifically to compass error caused by magnetized iron within a ship or aircraft. This iron has a mixture of permanent magnetization and an \"induced\" (temporary) magnetization that is induced by the Earth's magnetic field. Because the latter depends on the orientation of the craft relative to the Earth's field, it can be difficult to analyze and correct for it.\n\nThe deviation errors caused by magnetism in the ship's structure are minimised by precisely positioning small magnets and iron compensators close to the compass. To compensate for the induced magnetization, two magnetically soft iron spheres are placed on side arms. However, because the magnetic \"signature\" of every ship changes slowly with location, and with time, it is necessary to adjust the compensating magnets, periodically, to keep the deviation errors to a practical minimum. Magnetic compass adjustment and correction is one of the subjects in the examination curriculum for a shipmaster's certificate of competency.\n\nThe sources of magnetic deviation vary from compass to compass or vehicle to vehicle. However, they are independent of location, and thus the compass can be calibrated to accommodate them.\n\nNon-magnetic methods of taking bearings, such as with gyrocompass, astronomical observations, satellites (as GPS) or radio navigation, are not subject to magnetic deviation. Thus, a comparison of bearings taken with such methods with the bearing given by a compass can be used to compute local magnetic deviation.\n\nSailing ships generally had two kinds of compasses: \"steering compasses\", two of which would be mounted in a binnacle in front of the helm for use in maintaining a course; and a \"bearing compass\" that was used for taking the bearings of celestial objects, landmarks and the ship's wake. The latter could be moved around the ship, and it was soon observed that the bearing could vary from one part of the ship to another. The explorer Joao de Castro was the first to report such an inconsistency, in 1538, and attributed it to the ship's gun. Many other objects were found to be sources of deviation in ships, including iron particles in brass compass bowls; iron nails in a wooden compass box or binnacle; and metal parts of clothing. The two steering compasses themselves could interfere with each other if they were set too close together. The \"bearing compass\" was eventually sited in a fixed position in a binicale with, as far as possible, an all round view and acquired the name \"standard compass\" It would nonetheless have a different deviation to the \"steering compass\" so the compass heading shown on the \"steering compass\" would be different to the compass heading shown on the \"standard compass\".\n\nThe source of deviation could not always be identified. To reduce this source of error, which was due to induced magnetization in the ship, the surveyor John Churchman proposed a solution known as \"swinging the ship\" in 1794. This involved measuring the magnetic deviation as the ship was oriented in several compass directions. These measurements could then be used to correct compass readings. This procedure became standard practice in the 19th century as iron became an increasing component of ships.\n\nCompass Deviation is caused by local magnetic effects. On ships and aircraft the difference between North indicated by the compass, \"Compass North\" and \"Magnetic North\" (i.e. the direction of the Magnetic North Pole) is called Deviation. Variation is the difference between \"Magnetic North\" and \"True North\" and is dealt with elsewhere. The combined result of Deviation and Variation is called Compass Error.\n\n\n"}

At a time of rural protest in Canada from Ontario to the Prairies, the Movement was a broad-based protest demanding better treatment of The Maritimes from the federal government. It was centered in Saint John, New Brunswick, where the city's business leaders politicized the economic crisis and solidified their economic and political leadership.\n\nThe \"movement\" attempted to address issues relating to inter-provincial trade barriers, freight rates on railways, and various other indicators that were believed to be behind an economic decline since the early 20th century and aggravated by World War I.\n\nThe Royal Commission on Maritime Claims was established in 1926 by Prime Minister Mackenzie King. It was chaired by British business person and industrialist Sir Andrew Rae Duncan (thus the nickname the \"Duncan Commission\") and the Commission was provided with a mandate \"... to examine 'from a national standpoint [...] all the factors which peculiarly affect the economic position' of the Maritime provinces and to make 'recommendations to alleviate such grievances' as might exist.\" \n\nThe Duncan Commission attempted to address the issues raised by the Maritime Rights Movement and made various recommendations to lower inter-provincial and international tariffs, decrease railway freight rates, and change other federal policies to help the regional economy.

These structures consist of various functions and architecture, including Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and Italianate architecture. The 15 buildings include ten commercial structures, four houses, and a church. Most of the buildings were built between 1850–1910, and several of them still retain their original purpose. The White Horse Inn, located at 1 East High Street, is promoted as Michigan's oldest continually running restaurant since first opening in 1850.\n\nThe district includes: \n\n\"Barrow's Corners,\" as Metamora was originally known, was first settled in 1839 by Eber Barrows. He constructed a log way station at this site in 1843 to shelter travelers heading north. In 1848 a major territorial road was opened through the settlement, and soon a number of competing hotels were opened in the area. To keep pace, Barrow modernized his way station and renamed it the Northern Exchange Hotel. In 1850, Daniel Ammerman built the first store in Barrow's Corners. Thie building was eventually enlarged into Lorenzo Hoard's House, another establishment for travelers. Around this time, agriculture became more important in the area, as farmers began raising sheep and apples. Metamora became the center of the surrounding agricultural community, with a blacksmith, wagon shop, and soon two doctors.\n\nA number of commercial buildings were constructed by Eber Barrows and the Wilder Brothers in the late 1860s. In 1872, the Detroit and Bay City Railway constructed a line through the village, and Metamora became a hub for the transport of local goods. Brick commercial buildings gradually replaced earlier frame ones, and new churches and schools were constructed. In 1888 the Town Hall and Opera House was built, and a few more structures were built by 1910. As the automobile rose in the 1910s, Metamora began to lose residents to Flint and Pontiac. By the 1920s, new owners in the rural area were breeding horses and running hunt clubs. The village shops continued to provide convenient shopping to residents, and so remained in use. Development of this core area ceased prior to World War I, preserving the early architecture.\n\n"}
{"id": "18717761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18717761", "title": "Modern ruins", "text": "Modern ruins\n\nModern ruins is a neologism referring to ruins of architecture constructed in the recent past, generally in the most recent century, or since the 19th century.\n\nThe term is most frequently used by people performing urban exploration of man-made architecture that is abandoned or no longer accessible to the general public, such as structures abandoned through the process of urban decay. Enough documentation on these sites may have been lost over time that this unscientific exploration resembles archaeology of ancient ruins in the methods used to collect information.\n\nThe archaeological study of modern ruins is most commonly associated with contemporary, urban, and industrial archaeology. The processes and goals involved in the archaeological study of modern ruins is very similar to that of other branches of archaeology that primarily focus on studying sites of earlier time periods. Particular field methods used include meticulous surveying, excavation, and record keeping, all of which are generally similar to archaeology concerning older, buried sites. However, it has been argued that the archaeological approach to modern ruins should be more embodied and visually well rounded, rather than simply communicating information by conventional site descriptions and reports. Photography, for example, is often used as a medium to communicate discoveries made in modern ruins as well as in contemporary archaeological sites in general since most of the artifacts are found above ground level. \n\nModern ruins are often considered to be representative of accelerated rate of change, not only of their material and structural makeup or past purpose but also in many cases of society as a whole. For example, Pyramiden, a former Soviet mining town located in the High Arctic, has frequently been subject of archaeological study. Having over 1,000 inhabitants during its peak, Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998. Today, devoid of all humans, Pyramiden exists as a Soviet-era ghost town with the buildings and their contents remaining largely as they did when the town was inhabited. Elin Andreassen, Hein B. Bjerck, and Bjørnar Olsen, archaeologists who have studied Pyramiden, have written, “as a site of remembrance-or rather unforgetting-the memories it holds become inseparable from its materiality and from things’ unique ability to bring forth these memories.” \n\nUnderstanding why a particular structure was abandoned or has become no longer accessible to the general public is key to interpreting the archaeological material that is exhibited in modern ruins. Archaeologists who study modern ruins focus on understanding several key questions. For example, archaeologists try to answer how materials found at the site got where they were ultimately discovered. Was the material that was found originally part of the same assemblage and context, or did later occupants add to what was found?\n\n\n"}

The island is in a state of \"terra nullius\", since neither Canada nor the United States wants to claim the land and each country says it belongs to the other. (See Bir Tawil for a similar real-life example of this.) Bullwinkle J. Moose serves as Moosylvania's presumed namesake and its governor but only stays two weeks at a time, since (according to Bullwinkle) \"after two weeks here, anyplace else in the \"world\" feels like Heaven!\"\n\nIn the series-ending story arc \"Moosylvania Saved,\" Fearless Leader, the head of state of the Eastern European state of Pottsylvania, attempts to destroy Moosylvania. The plot is foiled when Bullwinkle, who was going to go down with his sinking country, asked Rocky for a stick of gum, which inspired Rocky the Flying Squirrel to raise up Moosylvania with bubble gum balloons. The plan worked and Moosylvania was saved, giving the series a happy ending.\n\nIn the fall of 1962, Jay Ward, producer of the \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" show, decided to campaign for statehood for Moosylvania. Ward sent Skip Craig to Minnesota to buy an island in the Lake of the Woods. Craig wasn't able to find one for sale on the U.S. side of the lake (most of the islands in that lake are claimed by Canada), but managed to lease one for three years. Ward and publicist Howard Brandy conducted a west-to-east cross-country tour in a decorated van, gathering signatures on a petition for statehood for Moosylvania. While in Washington, D.C., they sought an audience with President John F. Kennedy.

These zones are most commonly found in low-income and minority communities. Commentators including Chris Hedges, Joe Sacco, and Stephen Lerner have argued that corporate business practices contribute to producing sacrifice zones.\n\nThe concept of sacrifice zones was first discussed during the Cold War, as a likely result of nuclear fallout. According to Helen Huntington Smith, the term was first used in discussing the long-term effects of strip-mining coal in the American West in the 1970s. The National Academy of Sciences/National Academy of Engineering Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface Mined for Coal in the Western United States produced a 1973 report that introduced the term, finding:In each zone the probability of rehabilitating an area depends upon the land use objectives, the characteristics of the site, the technology available, and the skill with which this technology is applied. At the extremes, if surface mined lands are declared national sacrifice areas, all ecological zones have a high probability of being successfully rehabilitated. If, however, complete restoration is the objective, rehabilitation in each zone has no probability of success.Similarly in 1975, Genevieve Atwood wrote in \"Scientific American\":Surface mining without reclamation removes the land \"forever\" from \"productive use\"; such land can best be classified as a national sacrifice area. With successful reclamation, however, surface mining can become just one of a series of land \"uses\" that merely interrupt a current \"use\" and then return the land to an equivalent potential productivity or an even higher one.Huntington Smith wrote in 1975, \"The Panel that issued the cautious and scholarly National Academy of Sciences report unwitting touched off a verbal bombshell\" with the phrase National Sacrifice Area; \"The words exploded in the Western press overnight. Seized upon by a people who felt themselves being served up as 'national sacrifices,' they became a watchword and a rallying cry.\" The term sparked public debate, including among environmentalists and politicians such as future Colorado governor Richard Lamm.\n\n"}
{"id": "460697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460697", "title": "Sandžak", "text": "Sandžak\n\nSandžak (; , ) or Sanjak is a historical geo-political region, now divided by the border between Serbia and Montenegro. The name Sandžak derives from the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, a former Ottoman administrative district. Between 1878 and 1909 the region was placed under Austro-Hungarian occupation, following which it was ceded back to the Ottoman Empire. In 1912 the region was divided between the kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia. Serbs refer to the northern part of the region by its medieval name Raška. The most populous city in the region is Novi Pazar in Serbia. \n\n\"Sandžak\" is the transcription of Turkish \"sancak\" (sanjak, \"province\"); the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, known in Serbo-Croatian as \"Novopazarski sandžak\". In Serbian, the region is known by its pre-Ottoman name, Raška.\n\nSandžak stretches from the southeastern border of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the borders with Kosovo and Albania at an area of around 8,500 square kilometers. Six municipalities of Sandžak are in Serbia (Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Tutin, Prijepolje, Nova Varoš, and Priboj), and five in Montenegro (Pljevlja, Bijelo Polje, Berane, Rožaje, and Plav). Sometimes the Montenegrin municipality of Andrijevica is also regarded as part of Sandžak.\n\nThe most populated municipality in the region is Novi Pazar (100,410), while other large municipalities are: Pljevlja (31,060), and Priboj (27,133). In Serbia, the municipalities of Novi Pazar and Tutin are part of the Raška District, while the municipalities of Sjenica, Prijepolje, Nova Varoš, and Priboj, are part of the Zlatibor District.\n\nThe Serbian Despotate was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1455. During the Ottoman rule, many inhabitants converted to Islam. The conversions were caused by number of factors, mainly economic as Muslims paid lower taxes. The Muslims were also privileged compared to Christians, who were unable to work in the administration or testify in court against Muslims. The second factor that contributed to the Islamisation were migrations. A large demographic shift occurred as Serbs fought several wars against the Ottoman Empire. The Turks drove the Christian population northwards, while Muslims were driven to the Ottoman territory. The land abandoned by the Serbs was settled by Muslims, mainly ethnic Serbs who confessed Islam and Turks, but also significant population from the Caucasus, the Middle East and the Asia Minor. Large migrations occurred throughout the 18th and 19th century. The third factor of Islamisation was the geographical location of Sandžak, which allowed it to become a trade centre, facilitating conversions amongst merchants.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century was very important in terms of shaping the current ethnic and political situation in Sandžak. Austria-Hungary supported Sandžak's separation from the Ottoman Empire, or at least its autonomy within it. The reason was to prevent Serbia and Montenegro from unifying, and allow Austria-Hungary's further expansion to the Balkans. Per these plans, Sandžak was seen as part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while its Muslim population played a significant role giving Austrian-Hungarians a pretext of protecting the Muslim minority from the Christian Orthodox Serbs.\n\nAdministratively, it was part of the Sanjak of Bosnia until 1790, when it become a separated Sanjak of Novi Pazar. However, in 1867, it become a part of the Bosnia Vilayet that consisted of seven sanjaks, including the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. This led to Sandžak Muslims identifying themselves with other Slavic Muslims in Bosnia.\n\nIn October 1912, Sandžak was captured by Serbian and Montenegrin troops in the First Balkan War, and its territory was divided between Serbia and Montenegro. Many Slavic Muslims and Albanian inhabitants of Sandžak emigrated to Turkey as muhajirs. There are numerous colonies of Sandžak Bosniaks in Turkey, in and around Edirne, Istanbul, Adapazarı, Bursa, and Samsun, among other places. During World War I, Sandžak was occupied by Austria-Hungary between 1915 and 1918, as it had been previously between 1878 and 1908. Following World War I, it was included in the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was a link between the Muslims in the West in Bosnia and Herzegovina and those in the East in Kosovo and Macedonia. Sandžak was the only region in Serbia populated by the Slavic Muslims. The Sandžak Muslims suffered from the loss of their economic status since the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and during the agrarian reform carried out in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This led to the Muslim emigrations to the Ottoman Empire.\nThe new communist regime in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia found Sandžak with the Slavic Muslim minority of 43% and the Serb majority of 56%, along with smaller Albanian and Catholic minorities. During the World War II, until its abolition, Sandžak had an equal status to other federal units. The Muslims, who had generally anti-Partisan attitude, wanted unification of Sandžak with Bosnia and Herzegovina, or at least to be taken as a whole either by Serbia or Montenegro. However, Sandžak was later divided between Serbia and Montenegro, the outcome the Muslims wanted the least.\n\nThe Anti-Fascist Council of People's Liberation of Sandžak (AVNOS) had been founded on 20 November 1943 in Pljevlja. In January 1944, the Land Assembly of Montenegro and the Bay of Kotor cited Sandžak as part of a future Montenegrin federal unit. However, in March, the Communist Party opposed this, insisting that Sandžak's representatives at AVNOJ should decide on the matter. In February 1945, the Presidency of the AVNOJ made a decision to oppose the Sandžak's autonomy. The AVNOJ explained that the Sandžak hadn't a national basis for an autonomy and opposed crumbling of the Serbian and Montenegrin totality. On 29 March 1945 in Novi Pazar, the AVNOS accepted the decision of the AVNOJ and divided itself between Serbia and Montenegro. Sandžak was divided based on the 1912 demarcation line.\n\nEconomically, Sandžak remained undeveloped. It had a small amount of crude and low-revenue industry. Freight was transported by trucks over poor roads. Schools for business students, which remained poor in general education, were opened for working-class youth. The Sandžak had no faculty, not even a department or any school of higher education.\n\nSandžak saw a process of industrialisation, during which factories were opened in several cities, including Novi Pazar, Prijepolje, Priboj, Ivangrad, while the coal mines were opened in the Prijepolje area. The urbanisation caused a major social and economic shift. Many people left villages for towns. The national composition of the urban centres was changed to the disadvantage of the Muslims, as most of those who inhabited the cities were Serbs. The Muslims continued to lose their economic status, continuing the trend inherited from the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the agrarian reform in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The emigration of the Muslims to Turkey also continued, caused by the general underdevelopment of the region, disagreement with the communist authorities and the mistrust with the Serbs and Montenegrins, but also due to the nationalisation and expropriation of property. Serbs from Sandžak also moved to the wealthier regions of the central Serbia or to Belgrade or Vojvodina, while the Muslims moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.\n\nWith the democratic changes in Serbia in 2000, the ethnic Bosniaks were enabled to start participating in the political life in Serbia and Montenegro, including Rasim Ljajić, an ethnic Bosniak, who was a minister in the Government of Serbia and Montenegro, and Rifat Rastoder, who is the Deputy President of the Parliament of Montenegro. Census data shows a general emigration of all nationalities from this underdeveloped region.\n\nSandžak is a very ethnically diverse region. Most Bosniaks declared themselves Muslims by nationality in 1991 census. By the 2002/2003 census, however, most of them declared themselves Bosniaks. There is still a significant minority that identify as Muslims by nationality. There are still some Albanian villages (Boroštica, Doliće and Ugao) in the Pešter region. Factors such as some intermarriage undertaken by two generations with the surrounding Bosniak population along with the difficult circumstances of the Yugoslav wars (1990s) made local Albanians opt to refer to themselves in censuses as \"Bosniaks\".\n\nAccording to the 2011 census in Serbia, a total of 201,728 people live in the Serbian portion of Sandžak. Bosniaks, numbering 142,373 hold an overall majority (59.4%) in this part of region, mainly concentrated in the eastern part of Serbian Sandžak. Serbs, numbering 77,555 (i.e. 32.5%), make up the majority in most of the western part of Serbian Sandžak.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census in Montenegro, the Montenegrin part numbers 151,950 people. The ethnic composition of the Montenegrin part is significantly more mixed than that of the Serbian part. No ethnic groups forms an absolute majority in the Montenegrin part.\n\nA calculation of the two censuses puts Sandžak's total population at just over 390,000. The relative majority is held by the roughly 189,190 Bosniaks, who form 48.4% of the region's population. Serbs form 33.9% (132,345), while Montenegrins form 7.25% (28,323), Muslims by nationality 6.11% (23,900), and Albanians 1.04% (4,062).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40963715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40963715", "title": "Square-rigged caravel", "text": "Square-rigged caravel\n\nThe square-rigged caravel, originally ' in Portuguese (meaning round caravel\"', but of the type with Portuguese origin), also called caravela de armada (generically and also particularly for a largest or strong major sub-type of this ship) was a sailing ship created by the Portuguese in the second half of the fifteenth century. Its use was most notorious from the end of that century. The square-rigged caravel had a notable role in the Portuguese expansion during the age of discovery, especially in the first half of the sixteenth century, for its exceptional maneuverability and combat capabilities. This ship was also sometimes adopted by other European powers. The hull was galleon-shaped, and some experts consider this vessel a forerunner of the fighting galleon.\n\nThe Portuguese square-rigged caravel or round caravel appeared more frequently in the end of the fifteenth century and especially in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Traditionally considered a particular type of the caravel, but also a new and different type of ship due to its significant structural differences, was the result of an evolution in design of the caravel (\"lateen\" caravel) and a structural combination between the carrack and the same caravel, but distinct, however, from both.\nChristopher Columbus, on his voyages to the New World in the service of Castile, used ships also called \"caravelas redondas\" (round caravels) by the combination of sails (Possibly in based \"lateen\" caravels and other traditional ships models), they were however different from the Portuguese models, which differed by the number and arrangement of the sails and by the hull shape, among other features.\nThere were regulations for the construction of caravels of 150 to 180 tons, 110 to 150 tons, and from 100 to 125 tons. Square-rigged caravels and lateen caravels were different types of ships, being only the generic name \"caravel\" the greatest link between both.\nThe squared-rigged caravel possessed aftercastle and forecastle, unlike the lateen caravel, which could not have any structure erected on the bow of the ship, because of the maneuver of the foremast. From this point of view, the square-rigged caravel was closer to the naus and galleons than to its lateen caravel counterpart. She also had a beak apparently quite innovative (for its time) or of \"modern\" style, projecting forward from the bow below the level of the forecastle, somewhat similar to that commonly used later in galleons of the second half of the 16th century. She had taper and narrow hull lines, checking that the relationship between length and width was between 3:1 and 4:1 (some rare, possibly longer), walking roughly in the middle. This relationship goes close to the patache, ship of some similar characteristics, and was slightly higher than the 3:1 ratio stipulated by the regulations for ships of 150 tons.\n\nIf the Portuguese galleon, largely designed for better navigation and for naval defense, would be of more mixed use, warfare and transportation, as would also be the Spanish galleon (among other European ships of this \"class\" or similar style), the square-rigged caravel or \"caravela de armada\", though partly bifunctional, was essentially dedicated to naval warfare and for the defense of armadas.\n\nThe use of these square-rigged caravels for exploration reconnaissance and combat (if necessary), following a more larger number of naus in each fleet, were instrumental in the exploration of North America, South America the East, and particularly in the Portuguese India Armadas - including the discovery of Brazil - from the expedition of Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500 and continuing in the fleets that followed. They were also important, along with naus, in decisive historic battles, as Diu.\n\nThe square-rigged caravels had optimal use in coast guard armadas, in the Strait of Gibraltar, Atlantic Islands, North Africa, Mediterranean, Brazil and Indian Ocean. When D. Manuel I decided to send ships to the Azores in order to protect the ships from India, or when he created the \"Armada do Estreito\" (\"Strait Armada\"), he did so with square-rigged caravels armed for naval military action, also some naus, and later on, galleons (in the North Atlantic); and in the Strait of Gibraltar, joining them to the fustas and galleys. Despite the round caravel has been partially replaced by the galleon, its great qualities allowed its use until the end of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe Portuguese Man o' War was named after this curious type of fighting ship.\n\nHaving been a combination of the carrack and the caravel, the square-rigged caravel was distinguished clearly from both ships by its combined sails (absent in the caravel), with four or more masts, usually three with lateen rigged sails and the fore-mast with two square sails, and by its hull design which was narrower and longer. The square-rigged caravel was proportionally narrower in width and longer than the caravel, distinguished also by the sterncastle, more elongated and usually more projected backwards, and more complex, in two floors or two-deck castle-like, on diagonal gradation in length. It was also distinguished from the caravel by the existence of a lower forecastle and by having a snout or head - a long beak, projecting forward from the bow below the level of the forecastle (both absent in the \"lateen\" caravel).\n\nThe configuration of the square-rigged caravel obeyed to round ships, generally having a more narrow and elongated hull than the vessels of bigger size, more lower lines, aftercastle and forecastle, with two or one floors, and two covers. The ship had four masts, one with two square-rigged sails (the foremast) and lateen sails on the other ones; perfectly adequate morphology tonnage according to the general evolution of sailing vessels since the fifteenth century, which saw firstly a large increase in its superstructures, and came gradually to decrease in volume.\nThe Caravela de Armada, fundamentally similar in design, was a sub-type of square-rigged caravel, created to meet the needs of war and protection of the Portuguese Armadas, especially influential in the sixteenth century. Apparently it was the conjugated need to carry more cargo and have more heavy artillery on board that led to increases in the square-rigged caravel. In order to keep the center of gravity low, so as not to compromise the stability, were increased the draft and the hull of the ship, thus enabling the existence of several decks (covered) inside.\n\nThe Portuguese galleon have arisen probably during the first quarter of the sixteenth century, contributing to the hegemony of Portugal in the East. It was a ship more robust and better armed, with less cargo capacity than the carracks used to transport goods, but proved especially suitable for escort fleets, armadas and convoys, namely in the India run. This ship was a forerunner and a pioneer in its kind, including in the number and arrangement of its sails, and in its shape as a whole.\nIn structural terms the galleon may constitute an evolution (in part) of the square-rigged caravel, although wider and heavier. The galleon had a more lower and discrete forecastle and a more narrower and taper hull than the nau, as the square-rigged caravel, which is substantiated by the higher relation between the length and the bow. Both characteristics, allied to a powerful weaponry and more hydrodynamic lines, made the galleon, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Portuguese warship par excellence. Moreover, its hull had a higher density of beacons and stringers, which made the structure more solid and, above all, more resistant to projectiles of naval artillery.\nInitially, the Portuguese galleon had long beaks and spurs, and operated with three masts, the foremast and the main-mast with two square-rigged sails each, and a lateen rigged sail in the mizzen-mast. Result of the natural evolution of new requirements raised by war, soon they were built with four masts; the larger vessels had this configuration, always with lateen rigged sails in the two mizzen-masts in almost all galleons, and a third square smaller sail at the tops of the fore-mast and the main-mast (the latter in larger ships), which can be seen in the galleon São João Baptista, the \"Botafogo\", and on the galleons illustrated in the \"Roteiro do Mar Roxo\" of D. João de Castro. The galleon was so, also, a combination of the carrack and the square-rigged caravel in its sails.\nAnother detail which differs in the galleon is the presence of a beak of appreciable size, extending horizontally and forwardly the wheel of the bow. This feature, which could already be detected on the square-rigged caravel, appears to be evidence of greater effort required of the bowsprit, which will not be unaware of the fact that both the height of the mast as the sail surface have grown over time.\nOn the other hand, the more lower and narrower lines, the tapered and pointy shape of the hull, and the beak-shaped prow, allow the navigators to achieve greater speed, while the lower height of the forecastle gave her manoeuver qualities, including greater ability to navigate at a more bushy bowline, with advantage to maneuver on confined spaces. The great firepower of these ships tended to unbalance in their favor the outcome of battles fought at sea, having been used in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\n\n\n"}

Eros personifies \"love in all its aspects\".\n\nAccording to Lorde, the erotic has often been confused with the pornographic, resulting in the terms being used interchangeably within western societies. Lorde dismantles this idea and explains that the two are opposites of each other. According to Lorde, \"pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling\". The erotic is defined by our deepest feelings within ourselves while the pornographic \"emphasizes sensation\" and completely dismisses feelings.\n\nCatharine MacKinnon takes Lorde’s concept of pornography being used as a form of oppression and adds to it by asserting that pornography not only works to oppress the erotic power of women, but that it also suppresses women’s freedom of speech. Pornography eroticizes “the unspeakable abuse: the rape, the battery, the sexual harassment, the prostitution, and the sexual abuse of children. Only in the pornography it is called something else: sex, sex, sex, sex, and sex, respectively” which thus contributes to the perpetuation of inequality between men and women and leads to the normalization of these kinds of atrocities. \nThe erotic power that Lorde claims “lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane” becomes twisted, perverted and used against women to maintain female subordination. MacKinnon connects these images and words to actual cases of rape and sexual assault in that it men take what they have seen in porn and then apply it to their own sexual interactions with women. She quotes a study that claims that men who watched pornography that depicted rape and sexual assault were more inclined towards aggressive behavior towards women and self-reported a greater likelihood that they would engage in acts of rape or sexual assault. These images desensitize men to this kind of aggressive behavior and therefore, when women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped, their voices are not heard because being sexually assaulted or raped is an accepted part of culture represented in pornography. Pornography silences women because it steals their credibility and replaces it with mere “eroticism” which was originally a female ascribed power. \n\n"}
{"id": "740705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=740705", "title": "Translations", "text": "Translations\n\nTranslations is a three-act play by Irish playwright Brian Friel, written in 1980. It is set in Baile Beag (Ballybeg), a Donegal village in 19th century agricultural Ireland. Friel has said that \"Translations\" is \"a play about language and only about language\", but it deals with a wide range of issues, stretching from language and communication to Irish history and cultural imperialism. Friel responds strongly to both political and language questions in the modern-day Republic of Ireland. He said that his play \"should have been written in Irish\" but, despite this fact, he crafted carefully the verbal action in English which makes the dynamics of the play come alive, and brings its political questions into true focus.\n\nBaile Beag (\"Small Town\") is a fictional village, created by Friel as a setting for several of his plays, although there are many real places called Ballybeg throughout Ireland.\n\n\"Translations\" was first performed at the Guildhall, Derry, Northern Ireland, on Tuesday, 23 September 1980. It was the first production by the Field Day Theatre Company founded by Friel and Stephen Rea. It was directed by Art Ó Briain and featured the following cast:\n\n\"Translations\" received its American premiere at Cleveland Play House in 1981, starring Richard Halverson as Hugh. The production was directed by Kenneth Albers with scene and lighting design by Richard Gould. The play was staged in New York City later that year by the Manhattan Theatre Club, starring Barnard Hughes. It was briefly revived on Broadway in 1995 in a production starring Brian Dennehy. In 2006–2007, the Manhattan Theatre Club returned it to the stage at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey and the Biltmore Theatre in New York, directed by Garry Hynes.\n\nThe play was published in 1981 by Faber and Faber, who still publish it today. It is published in the United States and performance rights are held by Samuel French Inc. It is a set text on the Leaving Certificate English curriculum in Ireland and, in the United Kingdom, it remains a popular set text among English and Drama & Theatre A-Level students. It won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize for 1985.\n\nAn Irish-language version of the play has been produced. The play has also been translated into Welsh by Elan Closs Stephens. The Welsh version has visited a number of venues in Wales and was first published by Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, under its Welsh title \"Torri Gair\" (\"Breaking the Word\"), in 1982.\n\n\"Translations\" was adapted as a radio play directed by Kirsty Williams, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, on 4 September 2010 (see \"Translations (radio play)\").\n\n\"Translations\" was adapted for a Catalan audience in February, 2014 by Ferran Utzet, and performed at the Biblioteca de Catalunya (Library of Catalonia) in Barcelona. It was produced by Perla 29.\n\nIt was performed at the Olivier Theatre from the 22nd May to the 11th August 2018, starring Colin Morgan as Owen and Ciarán Hinds as his father. It was directed by Ian Rickson. \n\nThe play is set in the quiet community of Baile Beag (later anglicised to Ballybeg), in County Donegal, in 1833. Many of the inhabitants have little experience of the world outside the village. In spite of this, tales about Greek goddesses are as commonplace as those about the potato crops, and, in addition to Irish, Latin and Greek are spoken in the local hedge school. Friel uses language as a tool to highlight the problems of communication — lingual, cultural, and generational. Both Irish and English characters in the play \"speak\" their respective languages, but in actuality it is English that is mostly spoken by the actors. This allows the audience to understand all the languages, as if a translator was provided. However, onstage, the characters cannot comprehend each other. This is due to lack of compromise from both parties, the English and Irish, to learn the others' language, a metaphor for the wider barrier that is between the two parties.\n\nThe action begins with Owen (mistakenly pronounced as Roland by his English friend), younger son of the alcoholic schoolmaster Hugh and brother to lame aspiring teacher Manus, returning home after six years away in Dublin. With him are Captain Lancey, a middle-aged, pragmatic cartographer, and Lieutenant Yolland, a young, idealistic and romantic orthographer, both working on the six-inch-to-the-mile map survey of Ireland for the Ordnance Survey. Owen acts as a translator and go-between for the English and Irish.\n\nYolland and Owen work to translate local placenames into English for purposes of the map: \"Druim Dubh\", which means \"black shoulder\" in Irish, becomes Dromduff in English, and \"Poll na gCaorach\", meaning \"hole of the sheep\" in Irish, becomes Poolkerry. While Owen has no qualms about anglicising the names of places that form part of his heritage, Yolland, who has fallen in love with Ireland, is unhappy with what he perceives as a destruction of Irish culture and language.\n\nA love triangle between Yolland, Manus, and a local woman, Máire, complicates matters. Yolland and Máire manage to show their feelings for each other despite the fact that Yolland speaks only English and Máire only Irish. Manus, however, had been hoping to marry Máire, and is infuriated by their blossoming relationship. When he finds out about a kiss between the two he sets out to attack Yolland, but in the end cannot bring himself to do it.\n\nUnfortunately, Yolland goes missing overnight (it is hinted that he has been attacked, or worse, by the elusive armed resistance in the form of the Donnelly twins), and Manus flees because his heart has been broken but it is made obvious that the English soldiers will see his disappearance as guilt. It is suggested that Manus will be killed as he is lame and the English will catch up with him. Máire is in denial about Yolland's disappearance and remains convinced that he will return unharmed. The English soldiers, forming a search party, rampage across Baile Beag, and Captain Lancey threatens first to shoot all livestock if Yolland is not found within twenty-four hours, then evict the villagers and destroy their homes if he is not found within forty-eight hours. Owen then realizes what he should do and leaves, seemingly to join the resistance. The play ends ambiguously, with the schoolmaster Hugh drunkenly reciting the opening of Virgil's \"Aeneid\", which tells of the inevitability of conquest but also of its impermanence. Yet, Hugh's stumbling attempts at recitation are evidence that our memory is also perennially mutable.\n\nFriel's play tells of the struggle between England and Ireland during this turbulent time. The play focusses mainly on (mis)communication and language to tell of the desperate situation between these two countries with an unsure and questionable outcome.\n\n\na. For much of the play, it is understood that characters are speaking Irish, and the English characters cannot understand them. There are also several passages of Latin and Ancient Greek.\n"}
