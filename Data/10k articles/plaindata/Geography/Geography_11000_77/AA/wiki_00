{"id": "29632093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29632093", "title": "Ancient Chinese states", "text": "Ancient Chinese states\n\nAncient Chinese States () were typified by variously sized city states and territories that existed in China prior to its unification by Qin Shi Huang in 221 BCE. In many cases these were vassal states characterized by tribute paid to the ruling Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE). Such states and fiefdoms would again emerge during later dynasties as a political expedient when required.\n\nAccording to the sinocentric viewpoint and the Mandate of Heaven, China was the center of the world and the incumbent emperor its only ruler; all other would-be potentates and rulers were merely vassals of the Middle Kingdom. As a result, from the earliest times the Chinese viewed the world as a series of concentric spheres of influence emanating outward from their capital. Within the closest circle lay the vassal states who pledged allegiance to the Zhou ruler. Apart from the Zhou dynasty itself, which occupied territory around its capital, each state bore the suffix \"-guó\" (/) meaning state or nation. Of the 150 or so states, some were little more than a small fortified town or city, and others had a capital and other urban areas, controlling significant amounts of territory.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the Shang dynasty in 1046 BCE, the early kings made hereditary land grants to various relatives and descendants. These enfeoffments were accompanied by a title according to the Five Orders of Nobility (五等爵位), with only the Zhou ruler bearing the title of \"King\" (, \"wáng\"). Along with the land and title came a responsibility to support the Zhou king during an emergency and to pay ritual homage to the Zhou ancestors. In the Yellow River Valley, of the earliest vassal states, the State of Cai was founded following a grant of land by the first Zhou King to his younger brother. Other states founded at this time included Cao, Yan, Jin, and Chen. The central State of Song was created as a land grant to the nobility of the defeated Shang dynasty. On the periphery, the states of Yan, Qi, and Jin in the north and northeast had more room to expand and grew into large states. In the south, Xiong Yi was granted the fiefdom of Chu, which grew powerful and its later rulers declared themselves kings. At this time, states (such as Yue) that were considered not as civilized were not eligible for vassaldom. Around the borders of the main states lay many smaller entities which over time would be absorbed by their larger neighbors.\n\nAfter an attack by Quanrong nomads allied with several vassal states including Shen and Zheng, the Zhou ruler King You was killed in his palace at Haojing. His son fled east and was enthroned by several vassal leaders as King Ping of Zhou .Thus began the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when a new capital constructed a capital at Luoyi (雒邑), modern day Luoyang. Since territory around the city was restricted because other states including Han and Wei were already established in the area, it was impossible for the Zhou to expand their territory, a factor that became increasingly important as a survival mechanism for smaller states. New states continued to emerge whilst Chu was by this stage a powerful southern vassal, having shaken off its former “barbarian” image, as was Qin in the West. \n\nBetween the seventh and sixth centuries a four-way balance of power emerged between Qin (west), Jin (west-center), Chu (south) and Qi (east) whilst a number of smaller states continued to exist between Jin and Qi. The State of Deng was overthrown by Chu in 678 BCE followed by Qin’s annexation of State of Hua in 627 BCE, establishing a pattern that would gradually see all smaller states eliminated. Towards the end of the Spring and Autumn Period wars between states became increasingly common and a pattern of alliances developed amongst the more powerful rulers.\n\nAs the power of the Zhou king’s weakened, the Spring and Autumn period saw the emergence of hegemons () who held power over all other vassal states to raise armies and attack mutual enemies. \nMeetings were also held between the current hegemon and the rulers of the vassal states where ritual ceremonies took place that included swearing of oaths of allegiance to the current Zhou king and each other .\n\nIn 704 BCE, Chu state leader Xiong Tong (熊通) was the first vassal ruler to declare himself equal to the Zhou when he adopted the title King Wu of Chu. All the other states gradually followed suit until Zhou rule finally collapsed in 256 BCE. States continued to emerge as in the case of Zhongshan in the north, which was established by the nomadic Bai Di (白翟) in the 5th century BCE and would last until 295 BCE.<br>\n\nBy about 300 BCE, only seven main states remained: Chu, Han, Qi, Qin, Yan, Wei and Zhao. Some of these built rammed earth walls along their frontiers to protect themselves both from the other states and raids by nomadic tribes like the Quanrong and Xiongnu. Smaller states like Zheng and Song were absorbed by their more powerful neighbors. The “non-Chinese” states of Ba and Shu were both conquered by Qin by 316 BCE.\n\nFollowing his unification of China in 221 BCE, the first emperor Qin Shi Huang eliminated noble titles which did not conform to his legalist system of government; one that believed in merit rather than the privileges of birth. He forced all the vassal leaders to attend the capital where he seized their states and turned them into administrative districts classified as either commanderies or counties depending on their size. The officials who ran the new districts were selected on merit rather than by family connections.<br>\n\nIn the early years of the Han Dynasty, the commanderies established during the Qin Dynasty once more became vassal states in all but name. Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195) granted virtually autonomous territories to his relatives and a few generals with military prowess. Over time these vassal states grew powerful and presented a threat to the ruler. Eventually, during the reign of Emperor Jing (r. 156–141 BCE), his political advisor Chao Cuo recommended the abolition of all fiefdoms, a policy that led in 154 BCE to the Rebellion of the Seven Princes. The Prince of Wu Liu Bi (劉濞) revolted first and was followed by the rulers of six further states. The rebellion continued for three months until it was finally quelled. Later, Emperor Wu further weakened the power of the vassal states by eliminating many fiefdoms and restoring central control over their prefectures and counties.\n\n"}

For instance, the general circulation of the atmosphere on a planetary scale broadly determines the location of large deserts or the regions subject to frequent precipitation, which, in turn, greatly determine which organisms can naturally survive in these environments. Furthermore, changes in climates, whether due to natural processes or to human interferences, may progressively modify these habitats and cause overpopulation or extinction of indigenous species.\n\nThe biosphere, for its part, and in particular continental vegetation, which constitutes over 99% of the total biomass, has played a critical role in establishing and maintaining the chemical composition of the Earth's atmosphere, especially during the early evolution of the planet (See History of Earth for more details on this topic). Currently, the terrestrial vegetation exchanges some 60 billion tons of carbon with the atmosphere on an annual basis (through processes of carbon fixation and carbon respiration), thereby playing a critical role in the carbon cycle. On a global and annual basis, small imbalances between these two major fluxes, as do occur through changes in land cover and land use, contribute to the current increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\n"}

They host qualifiers for the most prestigious competitions at Crufts dog show near Birmingham each March, and Olympia in London each December. They also provide a route for winning the three Championship classes needed to gain an agility dog the coveted 'Agility Champion' title.\n\nProgression at KC shows is via a win-based system or a dog can progress on points if the handler chooses. Classes can number anything up to 450 dogs and class sizes vary considerably. They can be as small as 4 or 5 dogs or as large as 200 dogs. If a larger number of entries is received for one class then the organising club will generally split the class into separate parts with a separate set of prizes for each part. Generally classes for small and medium-sized dogs are smaller than for the large dogs. From January 2007, the KC has adopted a new grading system. Dogs with new handlers start in Grade 1 Elementary, and if they gain the wins required move up through Starters, Graduate, Novice, Intermediate and Senior to Grade 7 Advanced level. By the time a dog reaches Advanced (at which point it becomes eligible for Championship classes), it will have won many classes. The new grading system also provides the option to progress as far as Grade 5 Intermediate via a points system, run in conjunction with the Kennel Club's Agility Warrant (AW) agility titles.\n\nThe Kennel Club introduced its International Festival of Agility in 2005, a weekend event that hosts a range of national team and individual competitions and finals, including the British Open. The KC also funds the British agility team that is sent to the FCI world championships each year.\n\nThe British Agility Association (BAA) was launched in 2006 Following the success of EMDAC (East Midlands Dog Agility Club which was the first Independent Agility Association in the UK founded in 2002 by June Bass & Steve Retter) BAA provides its own progression system, with dogs being promoted via a ranking system based on performance at BAA shows. BAA shows are run both by the main EMDAC team and BAA affiliated independent clubs around the country. EMDAC host the BAA National Finals, a 3-day event in August each year.\n\nUK Agility (UKA), launched in 2004, provides two separate progression programmes leading to agility titles. The Performance programme requires points to be gained in a range of Agility, Jumping and Games classes such as Gamblers and Snooker. This titling system has many similarities with that of the USDAA in the United States. The Steeplechase programme is based on Steeplechase classes consisting only of jumps and tunnels. UKA shows are run by both the main UKA team and affiliated independent clubs. UKA runs a weeklong show with its national championships in August each year, and also sends a team to the IFCS world championships.\n\nIn addition, a number of independent clubs and groups around the United Kingdom hold one-off shows or short series of shows that are not affiliated with any of the above organisations.\n\nIn Canada dog agility is largely sanctioned by the Agility Association of Canada (AAC). In western Canada however, it is not uncommon to also see trials sanctioned by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC); in eastern Canada NADAC sanctioned trials are rare. Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) agility trials are uncommon and are mostly associated with specialty shows for purebreds in conjunction with other events.\n\nThe first agility competition in the United States took place around 1986 under the rules of the newly formed United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA).\n\nFor all organizations, dogs can compete provided that they are:\n\nDogs of any size, ancestry, or nationality can compete, except for in TDAA, which limits dogs to those of no more than 17\" at the withers. On April 1, 2010, the AKC began allowing mixed breed dogs to compete in agility along with purebred dogs and dogs with a PAL/ILP listing.\n\nFor most sanctioning organizations, there are a variety of titles that a dog and handler can earn by accruing sufficient qualifying runs—also called legs—that is, runs that have no more than a certain number of faults (typically none) and are faster than the maximum standard course time (SCT).\n\nFor example, under USDAA rules, a dog can earn novice-level titles in Standard, Jumpers, Gamblers, Snooker, and Pairs Relay classes by earning 3 qualifying runs in each of the classes; the dog can also earn intermediate-level titles and masters-level titles in the same classes. After earning all of the masters-level titles—five qualifying runs in each, with some that must be in the top 15% of dogs competing at each trial—the dog earns its Championship. Other organizations have similar schemes; in AKC, to earn the Championship, the dog's qualifying runs must be earned two at a time on the same day; in NADAC, the quantity of qualifying runs is much larger; and so on. Most champion titles have \"CH\" in the title: NATCH (NADAC Agility Trial Champion), ADCH (Agility Dog Champion for USDAA), CATCH (CPE Agility Trial Champion), MACH (Master Agility Champion for AKC), TACH (Teacup Agility Champion), ATCH (ASCA Agility Trial Champion) and so on.\n\nIn addition, each sanctioning organization holds its national championships each year. Dogs must meet certain minimum scoring requirements to qualify to compete in the annual championship; for example, the dog must earn qualifying scores in at least 50% of the runs at each of at least 3 trials during the year; or must place in the top certain percentage of dogs at certain trials; or must have a qualifying run in special regional qualifying events; and so on.\n\nAs with any agility competition, there are national champions in each height category because it is not possible for dogs of greatly different sizes to compete equally.\n\nUSDAA has 12\", 16\", 22\", and 26\" (30, 40, 55, and 66 cm) jump-height categories; it crowns four national Grand Prix champions each year, as well as four Veterans and four Performance (lower-level performance) Grand Prix champions. It also holds championships for its Dog Agility Steeplechase and its Dog Agility Masters Three-Dog Team tournament series.\n\nTo qualify for the AKC Dog Agility Nationals, dogs must obtain \"double Qs\" and points during the preceding year. (The exact number of each has been increasing each year - for 2008 it is 6 \"double Qs\" and 400 MACH points.) A double Q means that the dog has earned qualifying scores in both runs of a single day of competition. Points are earned by the number of seconds under the standard course time that the dog takes to run a course, and are multiplied by various factors based on placement. At Nationals, dogs compete against their height division of 8\", 12\", 16\", 20\", 24\", or 26\". The AKC Nationals are often televised.\n\nThe AKC also runs an annual breed invitational to represent the best dogs from each breed. The invitational qualification and competition are similar to those of the Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome competitions invite qualified entrants from multiple countries, thereby making them international championships. Examples include:\n\nSince the 2002 IMCA (Gyula, Hungary), this championship is organised together with the ParAgility World Cup for disabled competitors.\n\n"}

Proof based on non-electronic navigation is also acceptable.\n\nWhereas other outdoor recreational activities like geocaching have a precise goal, geohashing is mainly fueled by its pointlessness, which is deemed amusing by its players. (However, a variation on geocaching, known as geodashing, features a closely comparable principle.) The resulting geohashing community and culture is thus extremely tongue-in-cheek, supporting any kind of humorous behavior during the practice of geohashing and resulting in a parody of traditional outdoor activities. Navigating to a random point need not be pointless. Some geohashers document new mapping features they find on the OpenStreetMap project.\n\nOn May 21, 2008, the 426th xkcd comic was published. Titled \"Geohashing\", it described a way for a computer to create an algorithm that could generate random Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates each day based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the current date. The algorithm was quickly seized by xkcd community, which used it as intended by xkcd creator Randall Munroe.\n\nOriginally a stub where people willing to try the algorithm in real life were to issue their reports, the geohashing official wiki expanded in the following weeks and was a working website as early as June 2008. The current expedition protocol was then established during the following years, with the creation of humorous awards, regional meetups and a hall of amazingness for the various geohasher achievements.\n\nOver time, geohashing gained fame across the internet and now counts more than 10,000 expedition reports. 19,000 users are registered on the geohashing wiki, with only 23 active as of March 19, 2018. Geohashing has spread mostly in North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nGeohashing divides the earth into a grid made up of graticules which are one degree wide in latitude and longitude. Inside these graticules, a random location is set. Geohashers then have the opportunity to go at the chosen location, either inside their own graticule or in a nearby one. If the location is inaccessible or in a private area, geohashers are advised not to try to reach it, although obviously inaccessible locations have been reached several times. In addition to the repeating location in each graticule, each day there is a single global hashpoint, much more challenging to reach.\n\n"}

It does not include the temperate and polar regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans, nor the Tropical Eastern Pacific, along the Pacific coast of the Americas, which is also a distinct marine realm.\n\nThe term is especially useful in marine biology, ichthyology, and similar fields, since many marine habitats are continuously connected from Madagascar to Japan and Oceania, and a number of species occur over that range, but are not found in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe region has an exceptionally high species richness, including 3000 species of fish, compared with around 1200 in the next richest marine region, the Western Atlantic, and around 500 species of reef building corals, compared with about 50 species in the Western Atlantic.\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy divide the Indo-Pacific into three realms (or subrealms), and each of these into a number of marine provinces.\n\nThe Central Indo-Pacific includes the numerous seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans, including the seas surrounding the Indonesian archipelago (with the exception of Sumatra's northwest coast, which is part of the Western Indo-Pacific), the South China Sea, the Philippine Sea, the north coast of Australia, and the seas surrounding New Guinea, western and central Micronesia, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga. The Central Indo-Pacific, due in part to its central location at the meeting of two oceans, has the greatest diversity of corals and mangroves.\n\nThe Eastern Indo-Pacific surrounds the mostly volcanic islands of the central Pacific Ocean, extending from the Marshall Islands through central and southeastern Polynesia to Easter Island and Hawaii.\n\nThe Western Indo-Pacific covers the western and central portion of the Indian Ocean, including Africa's east coast, the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Andaman Sea, as well as the coastal waters surrounding Madagascar, the Seychelles, Comoros, Mascarene Islands, Maldives, and Chagos Archipelago.\n\nWith the rising involvement of US in the new growth areas of Asia, the idea of the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor was conceptualized during the US-India Strategic Dialogue of 2013, where Secretary of State John Kerry referred to the potential of the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor, in transforming the prospects for development and investments as well as for trade and transit between the economies of South and Southeast Asia Indo-Pacific economic corridor. \n\nK. YHome in his scholarly study has mapped out the potential for various emerging trans-regional corridors in Asia along with the challenges of linking IPEC into the larger web of regional economic integration initiatives taking shape in the region in 2017.\n\nSince 2011, the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ is being used increasingly in the global strategic/ geo-political discourse. So, in its way, the term \"Indo-Pacific\" can be thought of in the same way as using terms like \"Post-Rock\" or \"World Fusion.\" The term was first used in an article authored by Gurpreet Khurana, which was carried in the January 2007 issue of the \"Strategic Analysis\" journal (Routledge/ IDSA) titled \"Security of Sea Lines: Prospects for India-Japan Cooperation\". In the article, the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ refers to the maritime space stretching from the littorals of East Africa and West Asia, across the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean, to the littorals of East Asia. The spirit of the term was picked up by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, as reflected in his speech to the Indian Parliament in August 2007 that talked about the \"Confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\" as \"the dynamic coupling as seas of freedom and of prosperity\" in the \"broader Asia\". From 2010 onwards, the term Indo-Pacific acquired salience within the Indian government and has since been used often by India's apex political leadership. From about 2011 onwards, the term has been used frequently by strategic analysts and high-level government/ military leadership in Australia, Japan and the US to denote said region. However, a formal/ official documented articulation of the term first appeared in Australia’s Defence White Paper, 2013.\n\nIt has been argued that the concept of the Indo-Pacific may lead to a change in popular \"mental maps\" of how the world is understood in strategic terms. Lately, US officials have begun using the term \"Indo-Asia Pacific\". This will enable America to maintain its geographic inclusiveness in the new coinage of 'Indo-Pacific'.\n\nThe term's profile was raised when it found mention in the joint statement issued by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump after the former's state visit to the White House on 26 June 2017. \"As responsible stewards in the Indo-Pacific region, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed that a close partnership between the United States and India is central to peace and stability in the region. In marking 70 years of diplomatic relations between India and the United States, the leaders resolved to expand and deepen the strategic partnership between the countries and advance common objectives. Above all, these objectives include combatting terrorist threats, promoting stability across the Indo-Pacific region, increasing free and fair trade, and strengthening energy linkages\". \n\n\n"}

IDN ccTLDs are specially encoded domain names that are displayed in an end user application, such as a web browser, in their language-native script or alphabet, such as the Arabic alphabet, or a non-alphabetic writing system, such as Chinese characters. IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.\n\nAlthough the domain class uses the term \"code\", some of these ccTLDs are not codes but full words. For example, السعودية \"(as-Suʻūdiyya)\" is not an abbreviation of \"Saudi Arabia\", but the common short-form name of the country in Arabic.\n\nCountries with internationalized ccTLDs also retain their traditional ASCII-based ccTLDs.\n\nAs of August 2018 there are 59 approved internationalized country code top-level domains, of them at least 47 used. The most used are .рф (Russia) with over 900,000 domains names, .台灣 (Taiwan) with around 500,000 and .中国 (China) with over 200,000 domains. Still as of 2018 around 20 countries using non-latin script do not have an internationalized country code top-level domain, including Israel and Japan.\n\nThe ICANN board approved the establishment of an internationalized top-level domain name working group within the Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) in December 2006. They resolved in June 2007 \"inter alia\" to proceed and asked the IDNC Working Group to prepare a proposal, which the group delivered in June 2008, \"to recommend mechanisms to introduce a limited number of non-contentious IDN ccTLDs, associated with the ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes in a short time frame to meet near term demand.\" The group proposed a methodology using ICANN's Fast Track Process based on the ICANN charter to work with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \n\nIn October 2009, ICANN resolved to start accepting applications for top-level internationalized domain names from representatives of countries and territories in November. Starting 16 November 2009, nations and territories could apply for IDN ccTLDs. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Russian Federation were among the first countries to apply for the new internationalized domain name country code top-level domains. In January 2010 ICANN announced that these countries' IDN ccTLDs were the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process. In May 2010, twenty-one different countries representing eleven languages, including Chinese, Russian, Tamil, and Thai, had requested new IDN country codes.\n\nOn 5 May 2010, the first implementations, all in the Arabic alphabet, were activated. Egypt was assigned the مصر. country code, Saudi Arabia السعودية., and the United Arab Emirates امارات., (all reading right to left as is customary in Arabic). ICANN CEO Rod Beckstrom described the launch as \"historic\" and \"a seismic shift that will forever change the online landscape.\" \"This is the beginning of a transition that will make the Internet more accessible and user friendly to millions around the globe, regardless of where they live or what language they speak,\" he added. Senior director for internationalised domain names Tina Dam said it was \"the most significant day\" since the launch of the Internet. According to ICANN, Arabic was chosen for the initial roll out because it is one of the most widely used non-Latin languages on the Internet. There are problems entering a mixed left-to-right and right-to-left text string on a keyboard, making fully Arabic web addresses extra useful.\n\n, four such TLDs have been implemented: three using the Arabic alphabet, codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 (for Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, respectively), and one using Cyrillic, codice_4 (for Russia). Five new IDN ccTLDs using Chinese characters were approved in June 2010:\ncodice_5 with variant codice_6 (for mainland China), codice_7 (for Hong Kong), and with variant (for Taiwan).\n\nThe new country codes were available for immediate use, although ICANN admit they may not work properly for all users initially. According to Egypt's communication and information technology minister, three Egyptian companies were the first to receive domain licenses on the new \"masr\" [مصر transliterated] country code. Egypt's Ministry of Communications was possibly the first functional website with an entirely Arabic address. The ccTLD codice_4 for Russia launched on 13 May. Bulgaria's codice_9 was rejected by the ICANN due to its visual similarity with codice_10.\n\nFive new ccTLDs using Chinese characters, the first using a non-alphabetic writing system, were approved by the ICANN Board on 25 June 2010:\nThe dual domains delegated to each of CNNIC and TWNIC are synonymous, being purely orthographical variations differing only in using simplified forms (国 and 湾), as preferred in mainland China, versus traditional forms of the same characters (國 and 灣), as used in Taiwan.\n\nThe Ukrainian string .укр was approved by the ICANN Board on 28 February 2013. The zone was added to the root servers on March 19, 2013.\nThe Bulgarian string .бг was approved by the ICANN Board in 2014, and the Greek .ελ string in 2015, both after controversies about possibilities of confusion with existing latin strings.\nIndia has applied for top-level domains in each of its local scripts, at first seven, later eight more. The first one, .भारत, was approved 2011 and became active in 2014. The general flow of applications has ceased after 2016. \n\nThe Pakistan string پاکستان. was approved by the ICANN BOARD on 7th January 2011 to represent Pakistan in Arabic Script. On 4th February 2017, IDN CCTLD پاکستان. Delegated to National Telecommunication Corporation and the zone was added to the root servers on February 15, 2017. \n\n"}

{"id": "3171091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3171091", "title": "Jacques le Moyne", "text": "Jacques le Moyne\n\nJacques le Moyne de Morgues ( 1533–1588) was a French artist and member of Jean Ribault's expedition to the New World. His depictions of Native American life and culture, colonial life, and plants are of extraordinary historical importance.\n\nUntil well into the 20th century, knowledge of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues was extremely limited, and largely confined to the footnotes of inaccessible ethnographic bibliographies, where he figures as the writer and illustrator of a short history of Laudonniere's attempt in 1564-5 to establish a Huguenot settlement in Florida. In 1922, however, Spencer Savage, librarian of the Linnean Society, made a discovery that opened the way to the subsequent definition of Le Moyne as an artistic personality; he recognized that a group of fifty-nine watercolors of plants contained in a small volume, purchased by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1856 solely for its fine sixteenth-century French binding, were in fact by Le Moyne. Savage's publications relating to this discovery prepared the way for subsequent attribution to the artist of other important groups of drawings and watercolors, which form the core of his known oeuvre.\n\nLe Moyne was born about 1533, in Morgues, some 7 miles east of Châteaudun, in the Loire Valley, France. The first thirty years of his life are undocumented, but it seems reasonable to suppose that he trained as an artist in his native town, which was at the time a notable center both for cartography and for illumination. Le Moyne probably worked at the court of King Charles IX of France, although there is no documentary record to that effect, nor are there any surviving works by the artist dating from before his departure for Florida in 1564.\n\nLe Moyne accompanied the French expedition of Jean Ribault and René Laudonnière in an ill-fated attempt to colonize northern Florida. They arrived at the St. Johns River in 1564, and soon founded Fort Caroline near present-day Jacksonville. Painting in the Calvinist style, he is mostly known for his artistic depictions of the landscape, flora, fauna, and, most importantly, the inhabitants of the New World. His drawings of the cultures commonly referred to as the Timucua (known through their reproduction by the Dutch publisher Theodor de Bry) are largely regarded as some of the most accessible data about the cultures of the Southeastern Coastal United States; however, many of these depictions and maps are currently being questioned by historians and archaeologists as to their authenticity. During this expedition he became known as a cartographer and an illustrator as he painted landscapes and reliefs of the land they crossed.\n\nRibault explored the mouth of the St. Johns River in Florida and erected a stone monument there before leading the party north and establishing an outpost of two dozen or so soldiers on Parris Island, South Carolina. He then sailed back to France for supplies and settlers. However, he was not able to reinforce the fort because while he had been gone, civil war had broken out in France. A truce in 1564 allowed Laudonniere to lead a new expedition, which founded Fort Caroline on the St. Johns Bluff in what is now Jacksonville. Many of the DeBry engravings depict the French fort and the local Saturiwa tribe, the Timucua group who lived at the mouth of the St. Johns in the area of Fort Caroline. Le Moyne also accompanied several inland expeditions from Ft. Caroline, and he made illustrations of many of the scenes he witnessed.\n\nLaudonniere's expedition, though resulting in the production of the fascinating Le Moyne/de Bry publication and an important map of the coastal regions of Florida, was ultimately a disaster; the good relations initially established with the Indian tribes inhabiting the territories around the settlement site at St. Johns soon soured, in addition to which various members of the French party became disaffected, and revolted against their leaders.\n\nThe final coup de grâce came a year later, when a Spanish force from the Spanish colony of St. Augustine thirty miles to the south, attacked Laudonniere's stronghold at Fort Caroline. The Spanish, under the leadership of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, stormed the colony and killed most of the Huguenots, though Laudonnière, Le Moyne and about two dozen others escaped and were eventually rescued to England. Having lost their way on the return, they sailed half starved into Swansea Bay, England in mid-November 1565, and finally reached Paris early in 1566.\n\nLe Moyne's highly important account of this transatlantic voyage, known today from a Latin edition published in Frankfurt in 1591 by Theodore de Bry under the title 'Brevis narratio eorum quae in Florida Americai provincia Gallis acciderunt,' clearly indicates that it was the King who instructed the artist to accompany the expedition, headed by Jean Ribault and Rene Goulaine de Laudonniere, as official recording artist and cartographer. Although only one original drawing by Le Moyne of an American subject is known today—the depiction of 'Athore showing Laudonniere the Marker Column set up by Ribault,' executed in watercolor and gouache on vellum, now in the New York Public Library—the 'Brevis narratio,' published by de Bry as the second volume of his great series of publications on voyages to the New World, contains forty-two engraved illustrations and maps alleged to have been made on the spot by Le Moyne. The text by de Bry describes and analyses these images, and his book constitutes a major landmark in the literature of the early exploration of the Americas.\n\nLe Moyne fled France after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots in 1572, ultimately settling in England. Le Moyne ended his career as a highly regarded botanical artist in Elizabethan London, where his patrons included Sir Walter Raleigh and Lady Mary Sidney.\n\nAll but one of Le Moyne's original drawings were reportedly destroyed in the Spanish attack on Fort Caroline; most the images attributed to him are actually engravings created by the Belgian printer and publisher Theodor de Bry, which are based on recreations Le Moyne produced from memory. These reproductions, distributed by Le Moyne in printed volumes, are some of the earliest images of European colonization in the New World to be circulated. Le Moyne died in London in 1588, and his detailed account of the voyage, \"Brevis narratio eorum quae in Florida Americai provincia Gallis acciderunt\", was published in 1591. A re-edition of his paintings including critical response has been published in 1977 by the British Museum.\n\nThe images of the Timucua and related maps, said to be based on Le Moyne's drawings by de Bry, have fallen under intense scrutiny and their legitimacy as works related to Le Moyne are considered very questionable. Jerald Milanich, author of books on the Timucua and an archaeologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History has published an article in which he questions whether Le Moyne produced drawings of the Timucua at all, based on the unexplainable lack of any definite documentation or evidence. The one existing painting believed to be by Le Moyne himself (owned by the New York Public Library) has been argued to be a replica of one of de Bry's etchings, rather than a source for it, by anthropologist and ethnohistorian Christian Feest.\n\nThe six documented works by the artist in private hands are exquisite gouaches which embody and combine in a most original manner three diverse artistic traditions: the first is that of manuscript illumination in Le Moyne's native France; the second is the recording of exotic and native flora, fauna and cultures, which was the artistic expression of the late sixteenth-century fascination with exploration and scientific investigation; and the third is the purely aesthetic love of flowers and gardens which was so apparent in Elizabethan court culture. Le Moyne's work represents a transition from the medieval focus on the religious symbolism of plants in art to a Renaissance emphasis on scientific inquiry and beauty when creating botanical illustration. \nThe most extravagant and exquisitely wrought of all Le Moyne's floral works are the six miniature-like gouaches from the Korner collection. Purchased as the work of an anonymous Netherlandish artist of circa 1600, their authorship was recognized by art historians Dr. Rosy Schilling and Mr. Paul Hutton, by comparison with the drawings by Le Moyne in the British Museum. These are generally similar in conception to the watercolors in the British Museum, and must also date from around 1585.\n\n\n"}

Since 1930, court services have been provided by the Viscount's Department () in conjunction with the Judicial Greffe. Until 1973 the Viscount was appointed by the Crown; since 1973 Viscounts have been appointed by the Bailiff of Jersey.\n\nThe principal function of the Viscount (also referred to in Channel Island English by the Jersey Legal French title of the \"Vicomte\") is the execution of the orders of the courts of Jersey. This involves managing fines, bail monies, seizures, confiscations, evictions, service of process, arrests for non-appearance in court and other enforcement procedures.\n\nThe Viscount manages jury selection and exemption, financial assistance to jury members and acts as \"surveillant\" for the jury.\n\nThe Viscount also acts as coroner to deal with matters relating to sudden or unexpected death, and administers estates of deceased persons.\n\nIn cases of insolvency, the Viscount administers \"en désastre\" proceedings.\n\nThe Viscount is amongst those who act as \"autorisé\" (returning officer) for elections in Jersey.\n\nThe Viscount acts as mace-bearer for the Bailiff of Jersey in the States of Jersey and the Royal Court of Jersey, and carries out other ceremonial functions.\n\nThe Viscount carried out other functions historically: till 1885 the Public Markets were under his control. He was Comptroller of Weights and Measures and a member of the Prison Board. He read aloud Royal Proclamations in the Royal Square. A notable action of the Viscount during the exile in Jersey of Charles, Prince of Wales, was the proclamation in the Royal Square of the Prince as King, following the execution of his father.\n\nUntil 1842 the Viscount was a member of the States of Jersey with a right to speak but not to vote. From 1842 until 1948 the Viscount sat as a member of the States without speaking or voting rights. The constitutional reform of 1948 removed the Viscount's membership of the legislature but the Viscount's Department continues to be represented at meetings of the States for the provision of executive services.\n\nThe Biographical Dictionary of Jersey by Balleine says: \nVISCOUNT. \"Vicomte\". In ancient France a very high dignitary, the Vice-Count, who took the place of the Count or Duke, when absent. Later in Normandy a Viscount was appointed over each county, the Viscount of the Cotentin, the Viscount of the Avranchin, etc. A charter of 1179 shows the Viscount holding the King's Court in Guernsey. In time the dignity of the name was forgotten, and the Viscount became a mere Court official. By the 14th century the Viscount in Jersey was the chief executive officer of the Court, appointed by the Crown to see that orders of the Court were carried out, to issue summonses, to make arrests, to keep prisoners in custody, to abate nuisances, to deliver seisin 'by the Viscount's rod'. He also acted as Coroner, and till 1885 the Public Markets were under his control. He read aloud Royal Proclamations in the Royal Square, was Comptroller of Weights and Measures and a member of the Prison Board.\n\n\n"}

It is located within the Manbij and Jarābulus districts of Aleppo Governorate in Syria, and the Nizip and Karkamış districts of Gaziantep Province in Turkey.\n\nThe average elevation of the plain is around 400 m. It gradually slopes up from east to west. The plain can be divided into northern and southern parts. The northern part extends from Nizip to Manbij. This part is surrounded by the Aintab plateau from north and west. It is traversed from west to east by the Nizip, Merzimen (Bozatlı), and Sajur rivers. It is inhabited by a Turkmen density in addition to Arabs and other ethnic minorities. The Turkmen call this plain \"Barak plain\" after the name of a Turkmen tribe. In Syria it is called the northern Manbij plain.\n\nThe southern plain extends from Manbij to Maskanah. It is bounded from west by the Dhahab valley and Lake Jabboul. In the south it is joined by the arid steppe of the northern Syrian Desert.\n\nIrrigation based agriculture has been practiced in the plain since ancient times. Archeological remains from the paleolithic have been discovered in the Sajur valley. The ancient Zeugma on the Euphrates is found in the northern end of the plain.\n\n"}

{"id": "5482230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5482230", "title": "Pei Xiu", "text": "Pei Xiu\n\nPei Xiu (224–271), courtesy name Jiyan, was a Chinese politician, geographer, writer, and cartographer of the state of Cao Wei during the late Three Kingdoms period and Jin dynasty of China. He was very much trusted by Sima Zhao, and participated in the suppression of Zhuge Dan's rebellion. Following Sima Yan taking the throne of the newly established Jin dynasty, he and Jia Chong had Cao Huan deprived of his position to accord to the will of heaven. In the year 267, Pei Xiu was appointed as the Minister of Works in the Jin government.\n\nPei Xiu outlined and analysed the advancements of cartography, surveying and mathematics up until his time. He criticised earlier Han dynasty maps for their lack of precision and quality when representing scale and measured distances, although 20th century archaeological excavations and findings of maps predating the third century prove otherwise. There is also evidence that Zhang Heng (78–139) was the first to establish the grid reference system in Chinese cartography.\n\nPei Xiu is best known for his work in cartography. Although professional map-making and use of the grid had existed in China before him, he was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid reference and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations. Historian Howard Nelson asserts that there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the grid reference from the map of Zhang Heng (78–139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han period. Robert Temple asserts that Zhang Heng should also be credited as the first to establish the mathematical grid in cartography, as evidenced by his work in maps, the titles of his lost books, and the hint given in the \"Book of Later Han\" (i.e. Zhang Heng \"cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it\"). Xiu also created a set of large-area maps that were drawn to scale. He produced a set of principles that stressed the importance of consistent scaling, directional measurements, and adjustments in land measurements in the terrain that was being mapped.\n\nThe preface to Pei Xiu's written work was preserved in the 35th volume of the \"Book of Jin\", which is the official history for the Jin dynasty and one of the Twenty-four Histories. It was written in the \"Book of Jin\" that Pei Xiu made a critical study of ancient texts in order to update the naming conventions of geographic locations described in old texts. His maps – drawn on rolls of silk – were presented to Emperor Wu, who preserved them in the imperial court's archives. Pei Xiu's maps have since been lost, decayed or destroyed. Yet the oldest existing terrain maps from China date to the fourth century BCE, found in a Qin tomb in present-day Gansu in 1986. Han dynasty maps from the second century BCE were found earlier in the 1973 excavation of Mawangdui.\n\nIn 1697, the Qing dynasty cartographer Hu Wei (胡渭) reconstructed Pei Xiu's maps in his \"Yugong Zhuizhui\" (禹貢錐指, \"A Few Points on the Vast Subject of the Yu Gong\"). Modern scholars have also used Pei Xiu's writing to reproduce his works, and historians such as Herrmann have compared Pei Xiu to other great ancient cartographers such as the Greek cartographer Ptolemy (83–161).\n\nPei Xiu wrote a preface to his maps with essential background information regarding older maps in China. He also provided a great deal of criticism about the existing maps from the Han dynasty in his time. Later Chinese ideas about the quality of maps made during the Han dynasty and before stem from the assessment given by Pei Xiu, which was not a positive one. Pei Xiu noted that the extant Han maps at his disposal were of little use since they featured too many inaccuracies and exaggerations in measured distance between locations. However, the Qin maps and Mawangdui maps of the Han dynasty discovered by modern archaeologists were far superior in quality than those examined and criticised by Pei Xiu. It was not until the 20th century that Pei Xiu's third century assessment of earlier maps' dismal quality would be overturned and disproven. The makers of the Han maps were familiar with the use of scale, while the Qin map makers had pinpointed the course of rivers with some accuracy. What these earlier maps did not feature was topographical elevation, which Pei Xiu would outline with his six principles of cartography.\n\nPei Xiu's preface describes geographers in the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, although the earliest known geographical work was the \"Yu Gong\" chapter of the \"Shu Ji\" or \"Book of Documents\", compiled in the fifth century BCE during the mid Zhou period. Pei Xiu also referred to Xiao He (died 193), who assembled the maps made during the fall of the Qin dynasty. This was done after the founder of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang (died 195 BC), had sacked the city of Xianyang. Pei Xiu states:\n\nPei Xiu continues his preface with short background information on the conquests by the Jin dynasty and the impressive maps commissioned by Sima Zhao (211–264). He then described the methods he used to create new maps while examining the ancient text of the \"Yu Gong\" or \"Tribute of Yu\" to create historical maps:\n\nPei Xiu outlined six principles that should be observed when creating a map. He then defended his position and each of the six principles with a short explanation as to how they provide better accuracy in map-making and cartography. The first three principles outlined the use of scale (\"fenlü\"), direction (\"zhunwang\") and road distance (\"daoli\"), while the last three principles are used to properly calculate distances on uneven terrain as represented on a flat, two dimensional map. Pei Xiu states:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14691776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14691776", "title": "Permeability (spatial and transport planning)", "text": "Permeability (spatial and transport planning)\n\nPermeability or connectivity describes the extent to which urban forms permit (or restrict) movement of people or vehicles in different directions. The terms are often used interchangeably, although differentiated definitions also exist (see below). Permeability is generally considered a positive attribute of an urban design, as it permits ease of movement and avoids severing neighbourhoods. Urban forms which lack permeability, e.g. those severed by arterial roads, or with many long culs-de-sac, are considered to discourage movement on foot and encourage longer journeys by car. There is some empirical research evidence to support this view.\n\nPermeability is a central principle of New Urbanism, which favours urban designs based upon the ‘traditional’ (particularly in a North American context) street grid. New Urbanist thinking has also influenced Government policy in the United Kingdom, where the \"Department for Transport Guidance Manual for Streets\" says:\n\nThere are two principal reservations concerning permeability. The first relates to property crime. Although the issue is contested, there is some research evidence to suggest that permeability may be positively correlated with crimes such as burglary.\nNew research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, a) dwelling types, b) unit density (site density) c) movement on the street, d) culs–de-sac or grids and e) the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that a) flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters; b) density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level; c) local movement is beneficial, larger scale movement not so; d) relative affluence and the number of neighbours has a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. \"The over-provision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard.\"\n\nThe second reservation concerns the effects of permeability for private motor vehicles. Melia (2012) proposed the terms \"unfiltered permeability\" and \"filtered permeability\" to distinguish between the two approaches.\n\nUnfiltered permeability is the view supported by the New Urbanists that urban designs should follow \"traditional\" or mixed use streets, where pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles follow the same routes. The principal advantage claimed for this approach is that it \"leads to a more even spread of motor traffic throughout the area and so avoids the need for distributor roads\".\n\nThere are also a range of arguments advanced by the proponents of Shared space that where speeds are low, road users should be mixed rather than segregated.\n\nFiltered permeability is the concept, supported by organisations such as Sustrans, that networks for walking and cycling should be more permeable than the road network for motor vehicles. This, it is argued will encourage walking and cycling by giving them a more attractive environment free from traffic and a time and convenience advantage over car driving. Evidence for this view comes from European cities such as Freiburg, and its rail suburb Vauban, and Groningen which have achieved high levels of walking and cycling by following similar principles, sometimes described as: \"a coarse grain for cars and a fine grain for cyclists and pedestrians\". Filtered permeability requires cyclists, pedestrians (and sometimes public transport) to be separated from private motor vehicles in some places, although it can be combined with shared space solutions, elsewhere in the same town or city. This is the case in Dutch towns such as Drachten.\n\nThe principle of filtered permeability was endorsed for the first time in British Government guidance for the eco-towns programme in 2008 and later that year by an alliance of 70 organisations concerned with public health, planning and transport in their policy declaration: \"Take Action on Active Travel\".\n\nA parallel debate has been occurring in North America, where researchers have proposed and applied the Fused Grid, an urban street network pattern which follows the principles of filtered permeability, to address perceived shortcomings of both the 'traditional' grid and more recent suburban street layouts. A study conducted in Washington State found that the fused grid was associated with significantly higher levels of walking than the other two alternatives. A recent comparison of seven neighbourhood layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a conventional suburban and the traditional grid in a Fused Grid layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of pedestrian-only paths (filtering). It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set.\n\nStephen Marshall has sought to differentiate the concepts of \"connectivity\" and \"permeability\" (see drawing). As defined by Marshall, \"connectivity\" refers solely to the \"number\" of connections to and from a particular place, whereas \"permeability\" refers to the \"capacity\" of those connections to carry people or vehicles.\n\nTraffic studies on the influence of street patterns on travel generally overlook this distinction and two metrics are instead used to characterize a street pattern for trip purposes: connectivity and intersection density, both of which refer to regular city streets. This omission is often the result of unavailability of data for connectors that do not appear on maps and cannot be geo-coded. Consequently, the potential effect of connectors that are accessible only to pedestrians and bicycles on mode choice and extent of travel is missed. The aforementioned study shows that differentiating between normal paved streets and non-vehicular paths yields clear and positive results about the influence of the latter.\n\nThe distinction between permeability and connectivity becomes clearer in practice. Widening roads within a network that lead to destinations would increase the network’s permeability, but leave its connectivity unchanged. Conversely, transforming existing streets that are part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac, as was done in Berkeley, CA and Vancouver, BC, retains their connectivity intact but limits their permeability to pedestrians and bicycles only, while it \"filters\" out motorized transport.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40044058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40044058", "title": "Proteus (video game)", "text": "Proteus (video game)\n\nProteus is a 2013 exploration and walking simulator video game created and designed by Ed Key and David Kanaga for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. It allows the player to freely explore a procedurally-generated environment, without predetermined goals. The world's flora and fauna emit unique musical signatures, combinations of which cause dynamic shifts in audio, based on the player's surroundings.\n\nThe game began development in 2008 under game designer Ed Key, joined by audio designer and composer David Kanaga in 2010. Key first conceived \"Proteus\" as an open-ended role-playing game akin to \"\"; but, because of the work required for such a project, the team redesigned it to be \"nontraditional and nonviolent\". The PlayStation 3 and Vita versions of \"Proteus\" were developed by Curve Studios, whose team added extra features to the Vita edition at Sony's behest.\n\n\"Proteus\" won the prize for Best Audio at the 2011 Indiecade awards, and it was a finalist for the 2012 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo Award. Its original and PlayStation releases were well received by critics, who praised the use of audio. However, certain reviewers disliked the game's brevity and limited replayability.\n\nIn \"Proteus\", players explore an island from a first-person perspective. The island is drawn in a pixel art style and contains hills, trees, structures, and animals such as frogs and rabbits, though the layout is different each time the game is played. The focus of the game is on exploration rather than interaction, as there is no narrative and the player is given no instructions on how to proceed. Possible interactions are limited—for example, animals may run away when players come too close. The soundtrack changes depending on the player's movements and location; it may fall silent when the player is at the top of a hill and sonically dense as they travel down it. The soundtrack includes additional sounds and notes when the player nears objects or animals.\n\nWhen the game begins, players are situated away from the island and must move across an ocean of water to reach it. Upon arrival, players are free to explore the whole island during the initial season of spring. During nighttime, players can enter a cluster of lights to advance time to the next season; going through each until the end of winter, after which the game ends. The landscape changes with the season, such as trees shedding their leaves in autumn.\n\nIn addition to these gameplay elements, the PlayStation Vita version lets the player directly affect the environment with the console's rear touch panel and generate islands based on the current date and location in the real world.\n\nBritish game designer Ed Key began work on \"Proteus\" in 2008 during his evenings and weekends, though the game only neared its final form when David Kanaga joined development in 2010. Key originally envisioned the game as a procedural role-playing game in the same vein as \"\", in which the player would visit towns and complete quests. Realizing the extent of the work that would be needed for such a game, the developers decided to instead make something \"nontraditional and nonviolent\".\n\nKey developed the game using a game engine he had written in the C# programming language. During and after development the developers expressed interest in allowing player-created mods of the game; some such modified versions of the game have since been created by the community. After David Kanaga joined the development team as audio composer, the audio mechanics were refined through the testing of many different ideas, such as allowing players to create their own music within the game. This idea was cut because Key and Kanaga felt it would detract from the exploratory emphasis of the game and turn it into more of a creative tool.\n\"Proteus\" was released on 30 January 2013 for Windows and OS X, and on 8 April of the same year for Linux. When pre-orders were open in 2012, an Artifact Edition was also available; a version which included a boxed version of the game with artwork, the soundtrack, and notes on the game's development. Key apologised when the Artifact Edition hadn't yet shipped at the end of its release year, and offered to refund customers upon request. The Artifact Edition was finally released in July 2016.\n\nAround the time of the game's release, Curve Studios approached, and later worked with, the developers to port the game for release on PlayStation 3 and Vita. These versions of the game use Curve Studio's own game engine. Sony requested that new features be added to the game, though Key said that the company never attempted to steer the direction of the development of these features. Key added location and date-based world generation and a way to interact with the game using the Vita's rear touchpad. He has stated that the location- and date-specific world generation feature could come to the other versions in the future. The PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions were released on 29 October 2013.\n\nA beta version of \"Proteus\" was featured in indie game festivals and received coverage from video game journalists. It won the 2011 Indiecade Award for Best Audio, and was shortlisted for the 2012 GameCity Prize, losing to \"Journey\". \"Proteus\" was a finalist for the 2012 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo Award, a prize aimed at abstract and unconventional game development, and received honorable mentions in the Excellence in Audio and Seumas McNally Grand Prize categories. The game also won the Most Amazing Indie Game prize at the 2012 A MAZE. Indie Connect Festival and in the same year was featured in the Museum of Modern Art's \"Common Senses\" exhibit.\n\nIn an article that discussed 2011's exploration games, Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described \"Proteus\" as \"one of the most charming experiences\" he had had in an indie game. In 2012, Rick Lane of IGN stated that he found the game \"delightfully intoxicating\", unique, and intriguing, and Tom Francis of \"PC Gamer\" responded positively in his game preview, drawing particular attention to the game's changing soundtrack.\n\n\"Proteus\" received generally positive reviews following release, holding aggregate scores of 80% and 78% on Metacritic and GameRankings respectively for the Windows PC version. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh, \"PC Gamer\"s Tom Senior, and IGN writer Nathan Grayson all gave the game's changing audio praise, commenting on how it accompanied them through the game, with Grayson saying, \"It's oddly captivating to just walk around and let [the sounds] wash over your surroundings\". A review in \"Edge\", though generally positive about the soundtrack, said that the music \"never truly gets going\", particularly because of the lack of drums in most seasons. A Shacknews staff poll named \"Proteus\" the seventh best game of 2013; Alice O'Connor, writing for the website, called the game \"delightfully devoid of explanation\".\n\nThe game's length and replay value received mixed reactions. GameSpot's John Robertson thought that the game had little replayability, and \"PC Gamer\"s Senior said that the game felt very similar in subsequent playthroughs. GameTrailers' Daniel Bloodworth, however, thought that the randomly generated islands provided an opportunity to see things players may have missed the first time and Grayson found himself replaying the game many times.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 and Vita versions were also well received. Mike Rose, writing for Pocket Gamer, gave the game 7/10 in his review. He praised the extra features present in the Vita version, though noted performance issues. In \"Metro\"s review, Roger Hargreaves said the Vita's version gave him more reasons to re-play the game due to the addition of PlayStation Trophies, and \"PlayStation Official Magazine\"s Joel Gregory called the PlayStation 3 version \"simple but wonderfully effective\".\n\nSome debated \"Proteus\" status as a video game, citing aspects such as the lack of real goals or objectives. Some called it an anti-game. This description, however, was controversial. Grayson argued that \"Proteus\" does contain an action (walking) and a goal (proceeding through the seasons). \"Edge\"s reviewer contended that the day/night cycle, changeable weather, and a player-triggered change of seasons qualified \"Proteus\" as a legitimate game. Key responded by pointing out that, while the product does include rudimentary game mechanics, interacting with them is optional and they do not usually provide feedback. However, Key went on to argue that \"encouraging a strict definition of 'game' does nothing but foster conservatism and defensiveness\".\n"}

It is planned that she will be replaced by \"Polarstern II\" around the year 2020, after it was decided that the European Research Icebreaker \"Aurora Borealis\" will not be built in her original form.\n\n\"Polarstern\" was built by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Kiel and Nobiskrug in Rendsburg. The ship has a length of 118 metres (387 feet) and is a double-hulled icebreaker. She is operational at temperatures as low as -50°C. (-58°F) \"Polarstern\" can break through ice thick at a speed of 5 knots. Thicker ice up to thick can be broken by ramming.\n\nOn 7 September 1991, \"Polarstern\", assisted by the Swedish arctic icebreaker \"Oden\" reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels. Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common tug of war and a football game on an ice floe. \"Polarstern\" again reached the pole exactly 10 years later together with the USCGC \"Healy\". She returned for a third time on 22 August 22 2011 at exactly 9.42 a.m. This time she reported the most frequently recurring ice thickness at 0.9 m compared with 2 m in 2001, which corresponds to the long-term average.\n\nOn March 2, 2008, one of the vessel's helicopters crashed on a routine flight to the Antarctic Neumayer II base. The German pilot and a Dutch researcher were killed, three other passengers were injured.\n\nOn October 17, 2008, \"Polarstern\" was the first research ship to ever travel through both the Northeast Passage and the Northwest Passage in one cruise, thus circumnavigating the North Pole.\n\nCurrent listings of all cruises on board \"Polarstern\" as well as associated content (e.g., tracklines, weekly reports, cruise reports, publications and data) are presented in AWI's research platform portal.\n\nPolarstern is also the name of the first track of Eisbrecher's (German for \"Icebreaker\") first album, \"Eisbrecher\". Throughout the track in Russian, French and only then in German, narrations are given specifying the dimensions and specifications of an enormous ship, blowing the measurements of the real icebreaker out of proportion (e.g.: length of 236 metres). This way the artist may probably want to reference the international matter of Arctic, the untouchable dominance of Soviet technology pioneers in nuclear-powered icebreakers, and to give the tribute to Russian Arctic researches: Fabian Gottlieb Thaddeus von Bellingshausen, Ferdinand Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Wrangelll, Georgy Alexeyevich Ushakov, Otto Yulyevich Schmidt and Ivan Dmitrievich Papanin.\n\nThe ship plays a central role in German musician Schiller's 2010 album \"Atemlos\". A track is titled after the ship. It is also featured in the DVD of the same title, showing the musician's expedition on the vessel.\n\n"}

In 1870, he traveled in Palestine and Asia Minor, returning to take part in the Franco-Prussian War. In 1874, he received his doctorate of philosophy at the University of Jena.\n\nKiepert prepared maps from data amassed by German explorers of Africa that included Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs (1831–1896) and Heinrich Barth (1821–1865). Two important African geographic works of his were \"Deutscher Kolonialatlas\" and \"Spezialkarte von Deutsch-Ostafrika\".\n\nFrom 1874 until 1878 he worked on the compilation of Ferdinand von Richthofen's atlas of China, and from 1875 to 1887, he was editor of the geographical periodical \"Globus\". From 1902 until 1908 he worked on the \"Spezialkarte von Kleinasien\", a map of Asia Minor that was created on a 1:400,000 scale. After his father's death in 1899, he continued the work on the elder Kiepert's classic \"Formae Orbis Antiqui\".\n\nIn 1908 Kiepert was the recipient of the Carl Ritter Medal of the Geographical Society of Berlin, and in 1913 was given the honorary title of professor.\n"}
