ARINC has installed computer data networks in police cars and railroad cars and also maintains the standards for line-replaceable units.\n\nARINC was formerly headquartered in Annapolis, Maryland, and has two regional headquarters in London, established in 1999 to serve the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, and Singapore, established in 2003 for the Asia Pacific region. ARINC has more than 3,200 employees at over 120 locations worldwide.\n\nThe sale of the company by Carlyle Group to Rockwell Collins was completed on December 23, 2013.\n\nARINC was incorporated in 1929 as Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated. It was chartered by the Federal Radio Commission (which later became the Federal Communications Commission) in order to serve as the airline industry’s single licensee and coordinator of radio communication outside of the government. The corporation's stock was held by four major airlines of the day. Through most of its history, ARINC was owned by airlines and other aviation-related companies such as Boeing until the sale to The Carlyle Group in October 2007.\n\nNot much later ARINC took on the responsibility for all ground-based, aeronautical radio stations and for ensuring station compliance with Federal Radio Commission (FRC) rules and regulations. Using this as a base technology, ARINC expanded its contributions to transport communications as well as continuing to support the commercial aviation industry and U.S. military.\n\nARINC also developed the standards for the trays and boxes used to hold standard line-replaceable units (like radios) in aircraft. These permit electronics to be rapidly replaced without complex fasteners or test equipment.\n\nIn 1978 ARINC introduced ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System), a datalink system that enables ground stations (airports, aircraft maintenance bases, etc.) to upload data (such as flight plans) and download data (such as fuel quantity, weight on wheels, flight management system (FMS) data), via an onboard Communications Management Unit (CMU).\n\nARINC has expanded its business in aerospace and defense through its ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary. With the sale of the company to Rockwell Collins, the ARINC Engineering Services subsidiary split into Commercial Aerospace and Defense Services. The Defense Services branch was then purchased by Booz Allen Hamilton, remaining part of the Carlyle group.\n\nThough known for publishing \"ARINC Standards\", this role is independent of ARINC commercial activities.\n\nARINC Industry Activities involve three aviation committees:\n\nARINC services include:\n\nThe ARINC Standards are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) where Rockwell Collins and other aviation suppliers serve as a contributor in support of their airline customer base.

{"id": "97240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97240", "title": "Aaru", "text": "Aaru\n\nIn ancient Egyptian mythology, the fields of Aaru (; \"Reeds, rushes\"), known also as \"sḫt-jꜣrw\" or the Field of Reeds, are the heavenly paradise where Osiris rules once he had displaced Anubis in the Ogdoad. It has been described as the \"ka\" (a part of the soul) of the Nile Delta.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that the soul resides in the heart, and so, upon death, the Weighing of the Heart occurred. Each human heart is weighed on a giant scale against an ostrich feather, which represents the concept of Maat. Those souls which balance the scales are allowed to start a long and perilous journey to the Field of Reeds, where they will exist in pleasure for all eternity. Hearts heavy with evil tip and fall into the crocodilian jaws of the demon Ammit. After this \"second death\", the soul is doomed to restlessness in Duat.\n\nThe souls who qualify undergo a long journey and face many perils before reaching Aaru. Once they arrive, they enter through a series of gates. The exact number of gates varies according to sources; some say 15, some 21. They are uniformly described as guarded by evil demons armed with knives. Aaru is also known as the home of Osiris.\n\nAaru usually was placed in the east where the Sun rises, and described as boundless reed fields, like those of the earthly Nile Delta. This ideal hunting and farming ground allowed the souls here to live for eternity. More precisely, Aaru was envisaged as a series of islands covered in fields of rushes. The part where Osiris later dwelt is sometimes known as the \"field of offerings\", \"Sekhet Hetepet\" in Egyptian.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "979149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=979149", "title": "Address", "text": "Address\n\nAn address is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using political boundaries and street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers. Some addresses also contain special codes, such as a postal code, to make identification easier and aid in the routing of mail.\n\nAddresses have several functions:\nAddresses may have drawbacks:\n\nUntil the 18th and 19th centuries, most houses and buildings were not numbered.\nStreet naming and numbering began under the age of Enlightenment, also as part of campaigns for census and military conscription, such as in the dominions of Maria Theresa in the mid 18th century.\nNumbering allowed everyone to efficiently receive mail, as the postal system evolved in the 18th and 19th century to reach widespread usage.\n\nComprehensive addressing of all buildings is still not complete, even in developed countries. For example, the Navajo Nation in the United States was still assigning rural addresses as of 2015 and the lack of addresses can be used for voter disenfranchisement in USA. In many cities in Asia, most minor streets were never named, and this is still the case today in much of Japan. A third of houses in Ireland lacked unique numbers until the introduction of Eircode in 2014.\n\nIn most English-speaking countries, the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in each direction along a street, with odd numbers on one side (often west or south or the left-hand side leading away from a main road) and even numbers on the other side, although there is significant variation on this basic pattern. Many older towns and cities in the UK have \"up and down\" numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road, and then sequentially back down the other side. Cities in North America, particularly those planned on a grid plan, often incorporate block numbers, quadrants (explained below), and cardinal directions into their street numbers, so that in many such cities, addresses roughly follow a Cartesian coordinate system. Some other cities around the world have their own schemes.\n\nAlthough house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world, it is also common for houses in the United Kingdom and Ireland to be identified by name, rather than number, especially in villages. In these cases, the street name will usually follow the house name. Such an address might read: \"Smith Cottage, Frog Lane, Barchester, Barsetshire, BZ9 9BA\" or \"Dunroamin, Emo, Co. Laois, Ireland\" (fictional examples).\n\nIn cities with Cartesian-coordinate-based addressing systems, the streets that form the north-south and east-west dividing lines constitute the \"x\" and \"y\" axes of a Cartesian coordinate plane and thus divide the city into quadrants. The quadrants are typically identified in the street names, although the manner of doing so varies from city to city. For example, in one city, all streets in the northeast quadrant may have \"NE\" prefixed or suffixed to their street names, while in another, the intersection of \"North\" Calvert Street and \"East\" 27th Street can be only in the northeast quadrant.\n\nStreet names may follow a variety of themes. In many North American cities, such as, San Francisco USA, and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, streets are simply numbered sequentially across the street grid. Washington, D.C. has its numbered streets running north-south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east-west, while diagonal avenues are typically named after states. In Salt Lake City, and many other Utah cities, streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks. A similar system is in use in Detroit with the Mile Road System. In some housing developments in North America and elsewhere, street names may all follow the same theme (for example, bird species), or start with the same letter. Streets in Continental Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America are often named after famous people or significant dates.\n\nPostal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing, designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality.\n\nFor privacy and other purposes, postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one's physical address or even having a fixed physical address. Examples are post office boxes, service addresses and poste restante (general delivery).\n\nIn most of the world, addresses are written in order from most specific to general, i.e. finest to coarsest information, starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit. For example:\nIn English-speaking countries, the postal code usually comes last. In much of Europe, the code precedes the town name, thus: \"1010 Lausanne\". Sometimes, the country code is placed in front of the postal code: \"CH-1010 Lausanne\".\n\nIf a house number is provided, it is written on the same line as the street name; a house name is written on the previous line. When addresses are written inline, line breaks are replaced by commas. Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ: either before or after the street name. Similarly, there are differences in the placement of postal codes: in the UK, they are written on a separate line at the end of the address; in Australia, Canada and the United States, they usually appear immediately after the state or province, on the same line; in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city, on the same line.\n\nEast Asian addressing systems, including Chinese, Japanese and Korean addressing systems, when written in their native scripts, use the opposite ordering, starting with the province/prefecture, ending with the addressee. However both have the same order as western countries when written in the Latin alphabet. The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units, except that the name of the addressee is put into the first line.\n\nThe Universal Postal Convention strongly recommends the following:\n\nIn Argentina, an address must be mailed this way:\nThe postal code has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format, which is shown in the example. The new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning, which allows it to be identified. As the system has been changes 1961 recently recently, the four digit format can still be used: in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district.\n\nIn common with the rest of the English-speaking world, addresses in Australia put the street number—which may be a range—before the street name, and the placename before the postcode. Unlike addresses in most other comparable places, the city is not included in the address, but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used, usually referred to in Australia as a suburb or town – although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries. Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type, the postcode serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address. As an example, there are around 8000 localities in Victoria (cf. List of localities in Victoria (Australia) and List of Melbourne suburbs), yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes. For certain large volume receivers or post offices, the \"locality\" may be an institution or street name. It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address (unless this happens to be the name of the suburb), and doing so may delay delivery.\n\nAustralia Post recommends that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters. In Australia, subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces; apartments, flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash (/) instead.\n\nApartment, flat and unit numbers, if necessary, are shown immediately prior to the street number (which might be a range), and, as noted above, are separated from the street number by a forward slash. These conventions can cause confusion. To clarify, \"3/17 Adam Street\" would mean Apartment 3 (before the slash) at 17 Adam Street (in the case of a residential address) or Unit 3 at 17 Adam St (in the case of a business park). On the other hand, \"3–17 Adam Street\" would specify a large building (or cluster of related buildings) occupying the lots spanning street numbers 3 to 17 on one side of Adam St (without specifying any particular place within the building(s)). These forms can be combined, so \"3/5–9 Eve Street\" signifies Apartment 3 (before the slash) in a building which spans street numbers 5 to 9 on one side of Eve Street.\n\nAs in the US, the state/territory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different states/territories; it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated. In printed matter, the postcode follows after two spaces; in handwritten matter, the postcode should be written in the boxes provided.\n\nIn addition to PO Boxes, other delivery types (which are typically abbreviated) may include:\n\nAustralian Post Addressing Guidelines\n\n\"Property numbers are worked out based on the distance from the start of the road to the entrance of the property. That distance (in metres) is divided by ten. Even numbers are on the right and odd numbers are on the left. For example: the entrance to a property 5,080 metres from the start of the road on the right hand side becomes number 508. The start of the road is determined as the fastest and safest road accessed from the nearest major road or town. Rural road maps are being drawn up to define the name, the start point and direction of every rural road.\"\n\nIn Austria, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code always consists of four digits.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the format used for rural and urban addresses is different.\n\nUrban Addresses\n\nThe postal code always consists of four digits.\n\nRural Addresses\n\nSome neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don't face a named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, a \"main\" building may have the same number as one or more \"subsidiary\" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as \"vul. Lenina, d. 123\" (\"123 Lenin St\") An address may also cover one or more \"subsidiary buildings\" behind the main building, addressed as \"vul. Lenina, d. 123, bud. 2\" (\"123 Lenin St, unit 2\", where \"bud.\" (abbreviation for будынак, \"budynak\") means a '(subsidiary) building'). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that don't face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g. \"123-а\", \"123-б\", etc., in Cyrillic alphabetical order.\n\nIn some \"microraion\" neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the \"microraion\" (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at \"4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56\", i.e. \"123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56\".\n\nSource: Belposhta\n\nThe address starts with the most specific information (addressee individual identification) and ends with the most general information (postcode and town for domestic mail or country for cross border mail.)\nSpatial information of a physical address (including building, wing, stairwell, floor and door) may be useful for internal path of delivery, but is not allowed in the delivery point location line (i.e. the line containing street, number and box number). If needed, this information will appear on a line above the delivery point location line.\n\nThe street number is placed after the thoroughfare name (unlike in France), separated by a space. Separators such as punctuation (point, comma or other signs) or ‘n°’, or ‘nr’ are not allowed. Extension designation (box numbers), if present, appears in the delivery point location line, preceded by the word for \"box\" (\"bus\" in Dutch, \"bte\" in French). Symbols such as \"b\", \"Bt\", \"#\", \"-\", \"/\" are not allowed as separators between the street number element and the box number element.\n\nExamples of a correctly formatted postal address:\n\nThe Belgian addressing guidelines are registered with the Universal Postal Union (UPU and see the link http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html). These guidelines indicate exactly how to combine the various address components in order to obtain a correctly formatted postal address.\n\nThe complete set of addressing guidelines can be found on the website of the Belgian postal operator (bpost). The correct representation of an address is not limited to the correct structure of address components but also relates to the content of addresses and their position on envelopes (see https://web.archive.org/web/20130420085220/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/residential/letters-cards/send/best_practices.html (in French)).\nIt is also possible to validate a Belgian postal address on bpost's website and to receive feedback on the content and the format of an address. More information can be found on bpost's website (see http://www.bpost.be/validationadresse/ (in French)).\n\nIn Brazil, an address must be written this way:\nStates can have their name written in full, abbreviated in some way, or totally abbreviated to two letters (SP = São Paulo, RJ = Rio de Janeiro, etc.).\n\nOnly towns with 60,000 inhabitants and above have postal codes individualized for streets, roads, avenues, etc. One street can have several postal codes (by odd/even numbers side or by segment). These postcodes range from -000 to -899. Other towns have only a generic postcode with the suffix -000. Recipients of bulk mail (large companies, condos, etc.) have specific postcodes, with a suffix ranging from -900 to -959. P.O. boxes are mailed to \"Correios\" offices, with suffixes ranging from -970 to -979. Some rural settlements have community postboxes with suffix -990.\n\nAddressing guidelines can differ between English- and French-speaking populations in Canada. Here are some formatting rules that are used in common:\n\nSee the example below for a comparison of the English and French address formats:\n\nEnglish (from Canada Post):\n\nFrench (from OQLF):\n\n\nChilean urban addresses require only the street name, house number, apartment number (if necessary) and municipality; however, more information is frequently included, such as neighbourhood, city, region. Postal codes are rarely included by people. All postal codes have seven digits, the first three indicating the municipality, the next four identifying a block or in large and scarcely populated areas a quadrant within the municipal territory.\n\nThe territories of most of the larger cities comprise several adjacent municipalities, so it is important to mention it.\n\nSmaller cities often consist of only one municipality with several unofficial neighbourhoods that are usually mentioned even for official addressing purposes.\n\nSeveral large and mostly rural municipalities contain more than one small town, in such cases, the recipient address must mention either the town, the postal code or both.\n\nThe Postal area when written in Chinese characters (preferably Simplified Chinese characters), has the order of the largest unit first, ending with the addressee, i.e. country, province, municipality, town, street or road, building name, floor/level, house/flat number, company name, addressee. This is the most common language used when posting within China.\nThe whole address is commonly written as a string of characters with no particular format regarding where a new line would start, similar to one long sentence, with any new lines appearing depending on the space available on the envelope. Generally, the district is omitted when posting within China.\n\nCroatia uses five-digit postal code numbers. The Croatian postal service recommends using 2-letter ISO country codes as prefixes before international and domestic postal codes, though the practice is not mandatory.\n\nCommon format in Czech Republic:\n\nPostal codes are in the format \"### ##\" (i.e. 158 00 = Prague 58) or \"CZ-#####\" (especially for international sendings). At pre-printed Czech postcards and envelopes, the postal code is filled into frames at separate last row. If the envelope doesn't have pre-printed rows and frames, the postal code should be before the town (or post office) name.\n\nOn private letters, the first line is usually constituted by a courtesy title (pan, paní, slečna, žák…) For private mails addressed to the workplace, the order is (name + company), while in official mails it is (company + name).\n\nThe basic system of house numbering uses conscription house numbers (čísla popisná, čp. or č. p.). For a temporary or recreational house, an evidentional house number (číslo evidenční, ev. č. or če., or distinguished by initial 0 or E prefix) is used instead. In most larger cities and also in some towns and large villages with street names, there is a double system of house numbering. The first number is the conscription or evidentional number (which corresponds to the chronological order of cadastral registration of the house), and the second number (after a slash) is the orientational number (orientační číslo, č. or., č. o.) which expresses the position in the street. Sometimes only one of the two numbers is used, or the numbers are used in reverse order, and it can be difficult to distinguish which number is which. Generally, orientation numbers (if they exist) are preferred for mail services.\n\nExample: Josef Novák, Brněnská 2256/16, 123 07 Jitrnice\n\nHow to correctly label the consignment\n\nIn Denmark, apartment buildings will usually have two or three apartments per floor. Thus, if the addressee lives in an apartment, the address should contain the floor they live on, and a side (\"t.v.\", \"mf.\" or \"t.h.\", meaning \"to the left\", \"in the middle\" and \"to the right\", respectively) or an alphanumeric character (1, 2, 3... or A, B, C...= starting from left seen from the top most step just before the floor).\n\nAlso, for postal codes 2000 and up, there is a 1:1 relationship between postal code and town.\n\nIf a person's name is written before the company name in the address field of a letter, then that person is considered the recipient. In this case, no other employee is allowed to open the letter but the indicated recipient. If the company name is before the person's name, then the company is the recipient and any employee is allowed to open the letter.\n\n\"* apartment number can formulated as \"as 5\" (as = asunto, 'apartment' in English) or as \"C 55\" (the letter A, B, C ... indicates the correct staircase in apartment blocks with several entrances)\n\nFinland uses a five-digit postal code. Note that some of the larger companies and organizations have their own postal codes.\n\nIn France, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code always consists of five digits. The \"location\" is usually a town, but may be other territorial entities (up to a \"département\")\n\nOrganisations, government agencies, and companies which receive large amounts of mail often have a special \"CEDEX\" address which goes after the last line (for instance, \"75001 PARIS CEDEX\").\n\nIn Germany, the address is generally formatted as follows:\n\nHellenic Post recommends the following format for Greek addresses:\n\nThe most widespread format, shown above, gives on the last line the recipient's five-digit post code (with a single space between the third and fourth digits) and the name of the town or village that is the base of a post office, in capital letters and separated from the postcode by two spaces. When sending mail abroad, or when sending mail from abroad to Greece, Hellenic Post recommends the following format:\n\nAs with domestic mail, mail sent from abroad must contain the postcode in the same manner, but the postcode must be preceded by the international prefix of the country of delivery (for Greece, GR). Below the destination, the country of delivery must be written in capital letters, either in English or French (for Greece, GRÈCE or GREECE).\n\nThe official languages of Hong Kong are Chinese and English. For domestic mail within Hong Kong, the address may be written entirely in either Chinese or English. For overseas mail going out from Hong Kong, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English. However, for an overseas mail from Hong Kong to Mainland China, Macao, Taiwan or Singapore, the address may be written entirely in Chinese. While traditional Chinese characters are commonly used in Hong Kong, simplified Chinese characters are also understood by Hong Kong's postmen. Note that Hong Kong does not use any postal codes, though many rural properties have a property identification code, e.g. HKT-12345.\n\nAn address written in English should begin with the smallest unit and end with the largest unit, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Hong Kong.\nAn address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Hong Kong. Traditional Chinese characters are used in this example.\nFor mail to Hong Kong from overseas, \"Hong Kong\" should be added at the end of an address written in English, and \"香港\" should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.\n\nIn Hungarian mail addresses, the city/town name precedes the street address. The post code then comes after the street address.\n\nHungarian family names precede given names in Hungarian. In this example, Kis is the family name.\n\nSometimes a district number might appear after the name of the city/town.\n\nVarious abbreviations might appear in the precise street/building address: for instance, specifying the street type (út, utca, krt., tér, etc.), or em. for 'emelet' (floor), or hrsz for 'helyrajzi szám' (which means Land Registry number, or lot number), or fszt for 'földszint' (ground floor) and so on.\n\nThe postal code consists of four digits.\n\nGENERAL ADDRESS\nThe format used for rural and urban addresses is different.\n\nRural Addresses\nUrban Addresses\nThe state is optional in both cases, but is typically used.\n\nIn Indonesia, the address format is like this:\nGenerally \"Jalan\" or \"Jl.\" means 'street' and should go before the street name, e.g. Jalan Cemara. More info about Indonesia administrative divisions see Administrative divisions of Indonesia.\n\nPostal addresses in Iran has a standard which should be used by mail or parcel senders. This standard is registered and qualified in Universal Postal Union (UPU). According to the below table, Iran has 4 types of standard address:\n\nIn July 2015 Ireland introduced Eircodes, a seven digit alphanumeric code, consisting of a 3 character routing key and a 4 character unique identifier for the property. Example A65 F4E2. Up until the introduction of Eircode's Dublin was the only county with a form of postal district identifier, these have been incorporated into the Eircode scheme; example Dublin 2 is routing code D02.\n\nRural addresses are specified by the county, nearest post town, and the townland. Urban addresses are specified by county, city or town name, street name, house number, and apartment or flat number where relevant. A house name may be used instead of a number. The Eircode is appended to the bottom of the address.\n\nThe Universal Postal Union recommend the following:\nIn apartment buildings the building number should appear first and than the apartment number separated by a \"/\". In the below example, \"16\" is the building number while \"20\" is the apartment number:\n\nExample of common address with building entrance and apartment number\n\nOr\n\nA seven digit postal code for all addresses was introduced in 2013 which can cover an entire locality for a small town or village. In bigger cities postal areas are divided along streets and neighbourhoods.\n\nAn internal address, in Italy, must be composed of three to five rows.\nUp to six rows can be used if the mail is sent abroad:\nLine ordering may not be changed.\n\nA Japanese postal address, when written in Japanese phonetic and Chinese characters, starts with the largest geographical division, continues with progressively smallers subdivisions before ending with the addressee, i.e. country, prefecture, town, chōme, banchi, building number, building name, floor number, company name, addressee. This is the most common addressing format used when mailing within Japan. It is common practice to add the appropriate honorific to the addressee's name, e.g. 様 for a private individual or 御中 for a company or institution.\n\nWhen written in the Latin alphabet, the address begins with the smallest geographical area and ends with the largest one as in the following example. Macrons (as on ō and ū) may be omitted.\n\nJapanese-style envelopes are vertically aligned and the address is written from top to bottom, then right to left. Western-style envelopes are horizontally aligned and the address is written from left to right, top to bottom.\n\nSouth Korea uses a system similar to Western addressing, but previously used a system similar to Japanese addressing. South Korean addresses start with the largest unit (country, province), like those other East Asian countries.\n\nIn Latvia, the address in generally formatted as follows:\nNotes:\n\nFurther references: Latvijas Pasts\n\nThe official languages of Macau are Portuguese and Cantonese. For domestic mail within Macau, the address may be written entirely in either Portuguese or Chinese. For overseas mail going out from Macau, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English. However, for an overseas mail from Macau to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore, the address may be written entirely in Chinese. While traditional Chinese characters are commonly used in Macau, simplified Chinese characters are also understood by Macau's postmen. Note that Macau does not use any postal codes.\n\nAn address written in Portuguese should begin with the street name and end with the area in Macau, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Macau.\n\nAn address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Macau. Traditional Chinese characters are used in this example.\nFor mail to Macau from overseas, \"Macau\" should be added at the end of an address written in Portuguese, and \"Macao\" at the end of an address written in English; \"澳門\" should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.\n\nPos Malaysia recommends the following formats:\nNotes:\n\n\nCorreos de México recommends the following formats:\nIn the Netherlands, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code is a unique street identifier, and always consists of four numbers followed by a space and then two capital letters. PostNL, which is appointed by the Dutch government to carry out the UPD (Dutch for \"Universal Postal Service\"), recommends putting two spaces between postal code and town. Also, the name of the town should be written in capitals.\n\nBecause the Dutch postal code uniquely identifies a street, a shortened format may also be used. This method only needs the postal code and the number. The ideal format for this method is the number after the postal code, meaning that this: '5631 AV 1092' will still get the letter delivered to the correct location.\n\nIt is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. \"postbus 1200\") or freepost number (e.g. \"antwoordnummer 150\"), which have their own postal code.\n\nNew Zealand Post recommends the following format:\nNote that no space or full stops exists between P and O in PO Box or R and D in RD. One should put only one space between the town/city and the postcode.\n\nNote for Wellington metropolitan area, users should use the city name (i.e. Wellington, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, Porirua), not the metropolitan area name. For example:\nThe city in this case is important, as if Wellington is used instead of Lower Hutt and the postcode is unclear (note only the first digit differs), someone's private mail could accidentally be sent to the New Zealand Parliament Buildings instead (or vice versa).\n\nOne anomaly about this system is the Wellington Mail Centre, which is addressed as \"Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045\", due to its location in the Lower Hutt suburb of Petone.\n\nPostal addresses in Norway are formatted as follows:\nThe first line, \"Recipient (Person or Entity)\", is the legal recipient of the item being sent. The Recipient's name must be marked on the mail box in order for the item to be delivered.\n\nFlat or floor number is not part of Norwegian postal addresses.\n\nThe postal code (always four digits) is mandatory. If a PO box is used (e.g. Postboks 250 Sentrum), it replaces \"Street name + Number\". PO box addresses have postal codes which differ from those used for street addresses. Some areas do not have street names. For these areas, \"Street name + Number\" is replaced by a local designation determined by the Norwegian postal service.\n\nIn the Sultanate of Oman (2012), the address is formatted as follows:\nPhysical addresses only exist in major urban centers like those of Greater Muscat, Sohar, Salalah, Sur and Nizwa.\n\nThe format used in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nOfficial Addresses\nIn Peru, addresses in the Metropolitan Area of Lima and Callao are generally formatted as follows:\nAddresses elsewhere in the country are formatted as follows:\nPhilippine follows Western conventions on addressing. Addresses in the Philippines either uses these formats.\n\nIn Poland, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nul. = Str (Street)<br>\nal. = Ave (Avenue)<br>\npl. = Sq (Square, or Circus)\n\nThe abbreviation \"m.\" (meaning \"mieszkanie\" = \"flat\") can be used instead of \"/\" before the flat number.\n\nThe postal code always consists of five digits separated with a hyphen (in the \"XX-XXX\" format), i.e. 00-486 (00=Warsaw); 20-486 (20=Lublin), etc. The first digit signifies the postal district, the second: the code zone, the third: the code sector, the fourth and fifth signify the post office and its area of operation. Usually the code is unique on the street level for cities and the town level for smaller towns and villages.\n\nPortuguese postal addresses is similar to continental European addresses:\nPostal codes have the NNNN-NNN format. Street name and the number is traditionally separated by a comma, but nowadays CTT recommends just a blank space, or two blank spaces for extra clarity; this is to avoid OCR mistakes. The º after the number is the ordinal for floor number. Usually followed by \"Esq.\" (Left, abbr from \"Esquerdo\") or \"Dir.\" (Right, abbr from \"Direito\"), or an apartment letter (A, B, C, etc.). PO Boxes are called Apartado, followed by a number (e.g., Apartado 1001).\n\nQ-Post recommends the following format:\nNot all of Qatar's roads and buildings are numbered, Q-Post doesn't deliver to any street addresses, and no postal codes are used in Qatar.\n\nIn Romania, the address is generally formatted as follows:\n\nThe address must be written in Cyrillic or Latin alphabet, in usual format (from most specific to general).\n\nExample:\n\"Note: sub-region and region/oblast names are void if the city is Moscow or Saint Petersburg or if it is sub-region administrative center.\"\n\nSome neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings face no named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, such as the historical center of Moscow, a \"main\" building may have the same number as one or more \"subsidiary\" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as, for example, ul. Lenina, d. 123 (that is, 123 Lenin St). An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building, addressed as ul. Lenina, d. 123, str. 2 (123 Lenin St, Unit 2, where str. (abbreviation for строение, stroenie) means a '(subsidiary) building'. In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that face no named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, such as 123-а, 123-б, etc., in alphabetic order.\n\nIn some microraion neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the microraion (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at 4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56, that is, 123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56.\n\nThe address could be written in Arabic or English in the following format:\nSerbian postal addresses conform to rules similar to continental European rules:\nIn addition to 5-digit postal code, another line can be added containing PAK, a six-digit number which encodes the town, street and house number section.\n\nSingPost recommends the following format for addresses:\n\nGenerally, the last line \"SINGAPORE\" is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in the English language.\n\nCommon format in Slovakia:\n\nPostal codes are in the format \"### ##\" (i.e. 851 01 = Bratislava 5).\n\nStreet numbers can be written as orientation numbers (related to street) or descriptive numbers (unique within the town) or as a combination separated by a slash (descriptive/orientation). Descriptive numbers are also used within small villages that do not have named streets.\n\nIf the delivery is intended exclusively for a specific person at a company site, the address should begin with the individual's name and the company name should follow. The standard format of addresses enables anyone at the company to receive the delivery.\n\nhttp://www.posta.sk/potrebujem/spravne-napisat-adresu (\"How to write addresses correctly\", in Slovak, with pictures)\n\nSlovenia uses a four-digit postal number. The first digit indicates the area:\n\nThe simpler the code, the bigger the locality: 1000 Ljubljana, 2000 Maribor (big cities); 1310 Ribnica, 9250 Gornja Radgona (mid-sized towns); 4263 Bohinjska Bela, 8262 Krška vas (smaller settlements, including villages).\n\nSome cities have more than one post office, thus having multiple postcodes (usually in the x1xx format). For example, Ljubljana which has a \"general\" postcode 1000, also has additional ones, ranging from 1101 to 1133 (for some reason, however, omitting 1103 and 1105), Kamnik has 1240 and 1241, etc. Albeit they exist, it is not necessary to use them - usually the \"general\" postcodes are used.\nThe abbreviations are: g. for \"gospod\" (Mr), ga. for \"gospa\" (Mrs), and gdč. for \"gospodična\" (Miss) - all always capitalized if in the beginning of the line.\n\nNumbers can have a suffix like A, B, C, etc.\n\nCommon abbreviations are: c. for \"cesta\" (Street), and ul. for \"ulica\" (Road) - both always capitalised if in the beginning of the line.\n\n5ºB means 5th floor (Spanish: quinto), door B. Also, there may be door number, printed as 1ª (primera-first). Suffixes \"o\" and \"a\" derives from Spanish words piso (floor) which is masculine and puerta (door) which is feminine.\n\nSome doors may be indicated with the abbreviations Izq. or Dcha., to indicate either left (Izquierda) or right (Derecha). Streets and avenues can be indicated with the abbreviations C. (for calle) and Av. (for avenida).\n\nSri Lanka Post recommends the following format:\n\nSri Lanka uses a five-digit postal code. Generally, the last line \"SRI LANKA\" is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in English and Sinhala.\n\nIn Sweden, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nThe postal code is unique, and is always a five-digit number divided into groups of three and two (e.g. SE-414 73) with the prefix SE (ISO-code for Sweden) used only if sent from abroad. It is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. Box 51).\n\nIn Switzerland, the address is generally formatted as follows:\nIn Taiwan, addresses are regulated by the Department of Household Registration, while mails are handled by the Chunghwa Post. As a result, senders are required to write addresses in different formats in different situations.\n\nTurkish addressing system is as follows:\nHowever, in rural areas with decidedly little population and with no street addresses, address format is much simpler:\n\nSome neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don't face a named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, a \"main\" building may have the same number as one or more \"subsidiary\" buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as \"vul. Bandery, d. 123\" (\"123 Bandera St\") An address may also cover one or more \"subsidiary buildings\" behind the main building, addressed as \"vul. Bandery, d. 123, bud. 2\" (\"123 Badera St, unit 2\", where \"bud.\" (abbreviation for будинок, \"budynоk\") means a '(subsidiary) building'). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that don't face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g. \"123-а\", \"123-б\", etc., in Cyrillic alphabetical order.\n\nIn some \"microraion\" neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the \"microraion\" (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at \"4-th microrayon, bud. 123, kv. 56\", i.e. \"123 - 4th Microraion, apt. 56\".\n\nEmirates Post Group recommends the following format:\n\nNot all of the roads and buildings in the UAE are numbered consistently and no postal codes are used in the United Arab Emirates. All mail are delivered only to PO boxes in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe format specified by the postal operator Royal Mail is as follows:\nThe locality is required only where its absence would cause ambiguity, for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets with the same name. Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals. Until 1996 a postal county (or permitted abbreviation) was required after the post town, unless it was a special post town, for example London. The post town and postcode should each be on a separate line. Historically, each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line. Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre. The postcode identifies, from left to right, increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system. The first half of the postcode, known as the outward code, contains the postcode area and postcode district. The second half, known as the inward code, contains the postcode sector and postcode unit.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6645651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6645651", "title": "Ancient Libya", "text": "Ancient Libya\n\nThe Latin name Libya (from Greek Λιβύη, \"Libyē\") referred to the region west of the Nile generally corresponding to the modern Maghreb. Its people were ancestors of the modern Berbers. Berbers occupied the area for thousands of years before the beginning of human records in ancient Egypt. Climate changes affected the locations of the settlements.\n\nMore narrowly, \"Libya\" could also refer to the country immediately west of Egypt, viz Marmarica (\"Libya Inferior\") and Cyrenaica (\"Libya Superior\"). The Libyan Sea or \"Mare Libycum\" was the part of the Mediterranean Sea south of Crete, between Cyrene and Alexandria.\n\nIn the Hellenistic period, the Berbers were known as \"Libyans\", a Greek term for the inhabitants of the Maghreb. Their lands were called \"Libya\" and extended from modern Morocco to the western borders of ancient Egypt. Modern Egypt contains the Siwa Oasis, which was part of ancient Libya. The Siwi language, a Berber language, is still spoken in the area.\n\nThe Greek name is based on the ethnonym \"Libu\" ( \"Líbyes\", ). The name \"Libya\" (in use since 1934 for the modern country formerly known as Tripolitania and Barca) was the Latin designation for the region of the Maghreb, from the Ancient Greek ( \"Libúē\", \"Libúā\"). In Classical Greece, the term had a broader meaning, encompassing the continent that later (second century BC) became known as \"Africa\", which, in antiquity, was assumed to constitute one third of the world's land mass, compared to Europe and Asia combined.\n\nThe \"Libu\" are attested since the Late Bronze Age as inhabiting the region (Egyptian \"R'bw\", Punic: \"lby\"). The oldest known references to the \"Libu\" date to Ramesses II and his successor Merneptah, pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt, during the 13th century BC. \"LBW\" appears as an ethnic name on the Merneptah Stele.\n\nMenelaus had travelled there on his way home from Troy; it was a land of wonderful richness, where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, where ewes lamb three times a year and no shepherd ever goes short of milk, meat or cheese. \n\nHomer names Libya, in \"Odyssey\" (IX.95; XXIII.311). Homer used the name in a geographic sense, while he called its inhabitants \"Lotus-eaters\". After Homer, Aeschylus, Pindar, and other ancient Greek writers use the name. Herodotus (1.46) used Λιβύη \"Libúē\" to indicate the African continent; the \"Líbues\" proper were the light-skinned North Africans, while those south of Egypt (and Elephantine on the Nile) were known to him as \"Aethiopians\"; this was also the understanding of later Greek geographers such Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, etc.\n\nWhen the Greeks actually settled in the real Libya in the 630s, the old name taken from the Egyptians was applied by the Greeks of Cyrenaica, who may have coexisted with the Libu. Later, the name appeared in the Hebrew language, written in the Bible as Lehabim and Lubim, indicating the ethnic population and the geographic territory as well. \nIn the neo-Punic inscriptions, it was written as \"Lby\" for the masculine noun, and \"Lbt\" for the feminine noun of \"Libyan\".\n\nLatin absorbed the name from Greek and the Punic languages. The Romans would have known them before their colonization of North Africa because of the Libyan role in the Punic Wars against the Romans. The Romans used the name Líbues, but only when referring to Barca and the Libyan Desert of Egypt. The other Libyan territories were called \"Africa\".\n\nClassical Arabic literature called Libya \"Lubya\", . Modern Arabic uses \"Libya\". The Lwatae, the tribe of Ibn Battuta, as the Arabs called it, was a Berber tribe that mainly was situated in Cyrenaica. This tribe may have ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to modern Libya, however, and was referred to by Corippius as \"Laguatan\"; he linked them with the Maures. Ibn Khaldun's \"Muqaddimah\" states Luwa was an ancestor of this tribe. He writes that the Berbers add an \"a\" and \"t\" to the name for the plural forms. Subsequently, it became \"Lwat\".\n\nConversely, the Arabs adopted the name as a singular form, adding an \"h\" for the plural form in Arabic. Ibn Khaldun disagrees with Ibn Hazam, who claimed, mostly on the basis of Berber sources, that the Lwatah, in addition to the Sadrata and the Mzata, were from the \"Qibt\"s (Egyptians). According to Ibn Khaldun, this claim is incorrect because Ibn Hazam had not read the books of the Berber scholars.\n\nOric Bates, a historian, considers that the name \"Libu\" or \"LBW\" would be derived from the name \"Luwatah\" whilst the name Liwata is a derivation of the name Libu.\n\nCompared with the history of Egypt, historians know little about the history of Libya, as there are few surviving written records. Information on ancient Libya comes from archaeological evidence and historic sources written by Egyptians neighbors, the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines, and from Arabs of Medieval times.\n\nSince Neolithic times, the climate of North Africa has become drier. A reminder of the desertification of the area is provided by megalithic remains, which occur in great variety of form and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: dolmens and circles like Stonehenge, cairns, underground cells excavated in rock, barrows topped with huge slabs, and step-pyramid-like mounds. Most remarkable are the trilithons, some still standing, some fallen, which occur isolated or in rows, and consist of two squared uprights standing on a common pedestal that supports a huge transverse beam. In the Terrgurt valley, Cowper says, \"There had been originally no less than eighteen or twenty megalithic trilithons, in a line, each with its massive altar placed before it.\"\n\nIn ancient times, the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, the Persian Achaemenid Empire (\"see Libya (satrapy)\"), the armies of Alexander the Great and his Ptolemaic successors from Egypt, then Romans, Vandals, and local representatives of the Byzantine Empire ruled all or parts of Libya. The territory of modern Libya had separate histories until Roman times, as Tripoli and Cyrenaica.\n\nCyrenaica, by contrast, was Greek before it was Roman. It was also known as Pentapolis, the \"five cities\" being Cyrene (near the village of Shahat) with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), Arsinoe (Tocra), Berenice (Bengazi) and Barca (Merj). From the oldest and most famous of the Greek colonies the fertile coastal plain took the name of Cyrenaica.\n\nThese five cities were also known as the \"Western Pentapolis\"; not to be confused with the Pentapolis of the Roman era on the current west Italian coast.\n\nThe exact boundaries of Ancient Libya are unknown. It lay west of Ancient Egypt and was known as \"Tjehenu\" to the Ancient Egyptians. Libya was an unknown territory to the Egyptians: it was the land of the spirits.\n\nTo the Ancient Greeks, Libya was one of the three known continents along with Asia and Europe. In this sense, Libya was the whole known African continent to the west of the Nile Valley and extended south of Egypt. Herodotus described the inhabitants of Libya as two peoples: The Libyans in northern Africa and the \"Ethiopians\" in the south. According to Herodotus, Libya began where Ancient Egypt ended, and extended to Cape Spartel, south of Tangier on the Atlantic coast .\n\nModern geographers suspect that Ancient Libyans may have experienced loss of forests, reliable fresh water sources, and game availability as the area became more desert-like. .\n\nAfter the Egyptians, the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines mentioned various other tribes in Libya. Later tribal names differ from the Egyptian ones but, probably, some tribes were named in the Egyptian sources and the later ones, as well. The Meshwesh-tribe represents this assumption. Scholars believe it would be the same tribe called \"Mazyes\" by Hektaios and Maxyes by Herodotus, while it was called \"Mazaces\" and \"Mazax\" in Latin sources. All those names are similar to the name used by the Berbers for themselves, \"Imazighen\".\n\nLate period sources give more detailed descriptions of Libya and its inhabitants. The ancient historian Herodotus describes Libya and the Libyans in his fourth book, known as \"The Libyan Book\". Pliny the Elder, Diodorus Siculus, and Procopius also contributed to what is now primary source material on ancient Libya and the Libyans.\n\nIbn Khaldun, who dedicated the main part of his book \"Kitab el'ibar\", which is known as \"The history of the Berbers\", did not use the names \"Libya\" and \"Libyans\", but instead used Arabic names: \"The Old Maghreb\", (\"El-Maghrib el-Qadim\"), and the \"Berbers\" (El-Barbar or El-Barabera(h)).\n\nThere were many Berber tribes in ancient Libya, including the now extinct Psylli, with the Libu being the most prominent. The ancient Libyans were mainly pastoral nomads, living off their goats, sheep and other livestock. Milk, meat, hides and wool were gathered from their livestock for food, tents and clothing. Ancient Egyptian sources describe Libyan men with long hair, braided and beaded, neatly parted from different sides and decorated with feathers attached to leather bands around the crown of the head while wearing thin robes of antelope hide, dyed and printed, crossing the shoulder and coming down until mid calf length to make a robe. Older men kept long braided beards. Women wore the same robes as men, plaited, decorated hair and both genders wore heavy jewelry. Depictions of Libyans in Egyptian reliefs show prominent and numerous tattoos, very similar to traditional Berber tattoos still seen today. Weapons included bows and arrows, hatchets, spears and daggers.\n\nThe Libyan script that was used in Libya was mostly a funerary script. It is difficult to understand, and there are a number of variations.\n\nIbn Khaldun divided the Berbers into the Batr and the Baranis.\n\nHerodotus divided them into Eastern Libyans and Western Libyans. Eastern Libyans were nomadic shepherds east of Lake Tritonis. Western Libyans were sedentary farmers who lived west of Lake Tritonis. At one point, a catastrophic change reduced the vast body of fresh water to a seasonal lake or marsh.\n\nIbn Khaldun and Herodotus distinguish the Libyans on the basis of their lifestyles rather than ethnic background. Modern historians tend to follow Herodotus's distinction. Examples include Oric Bates in his book \"The Eastern Libyans\". Some other historians have used the modern name of the Berbers in their works, such as the French historian Gabriel Camps.\n\nThe Libyan tribes mentioned in these sources were: \"Adyrmachidae\", \"Giligamae\", \"Asbystae\", \"Marmaridae\", \"Auschisae\", \"Nasamones\", \"Macae\", \"Lotus-eaters (or Lotophagi)\", \"Garamantes\", \"Gaetulians\", \"Mauri\", and \"Luwatae\", as well as many others.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8225121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8225121", "title": "Canal of the Pharaohs", "text": "Canal of the Pharaohs\n\nThe Canal of the Pharaohs, also called the Ancient Suez Canal or Necho's Canal, is the forerunner of the Suez Canal, constructed in ancient times. It followed a different course than its modern counterpart, by linking the Nile to the Red Sea via the Wadi Tumilat. Work began under the Pharaohs. According to Suez Inscriptions and Herodotus, the first opening of the canal was under Persian king Darius the Great, but later ancient authors like Aristotle, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder claim that he failed to complete the work. Another possibility is that it was finished in the Ptolemaic period under Ptolemy II, when Greek engineers solved the problem of overcoming the difference in height through canal locks.\n\nProbably first cut or at least begun by Necho II, in the late 6th century BC, Darius the Great either re-dug or completed it. Classical sources disagree as to when it was finally completed.\n\nDarius the Great's Suez Inscriptions comprise five Egyptian monuments, including the Chalouf Stele, commemorate the construction and completion of the canal linking the Nile River with the Red Sea by Darius I of Persia. They were located along the Darius Canal through the valley of Wadi Tumilat and probably recorded sections of the canal as well. In the second half of the 19th century, French cartographers discovered the remnants of the north–south section of Darius Canal past the east side of Lake Timsah and ending near the north end of the Great Bitter Lake.\n\nAt least as far back as Aristotle there have been suggestions that perhaps as early as the 12th Dynasty, Pharaoh Senusret III (1878 BC–1839 BC), also called Sesostris, may have started a canal joining the River Nile with the Red Sea. In his \"Meteorology,\" Aristotle wrote:\nOne of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, stopped making the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it.\n\nStrabo also wrote that Sesostris started to build a canal, and Pliny the Elder wrote:\n165. Next comes the Tyro tribe and, on the Red Sea, the harbour of the Daneoi, from which Sesostris, king of Egypt, intended to carry a ship-canal to where the Nile flows into what is known as the Delta; this is a distance of over 60 miles. Later the Persian king Darius had the same idea, and yet again Ptolemy II, who made a trench 100 feet wide, 30 feet deep and about 35 miles long, as far as the Bitter Lakes.\n\nAlthough Herodotus (2.158) tells us Darius I continued work on the canal, Aristotle (Aristot. met. I 14 P 352b.), Strabo (Strab. XVII 1, 25 C 804. 805.), and Pliny the Elder (Plin. n. h. VI 165f.) all say that he failed to complete it, while Diodorus Siculus does not mention a completion of the canal by Necho II. Pliny the Elder also says that Ptolemy II, who took up the work again, also stopped because of the differences of water level. Diodorus, however, reports that it was completed by Ptolemy II after being fitted with a lock.\n\nPtolemy II was the first to solve the problem of keeping the Nile free of salt water when his engineers invented the water lock around 274/273 BC.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy the Astronomer mentions a \"River of Trajan\", a Roman canal running from the Nile to the Red Sea.\n\nIslamic texts also discuss the canal, which they say had been silted up by the seventh century but reopened in 641 or 642 AD by 'Amr ibn al-'As, the conqueror of Egypt, and which was in use until closed in 767 AD in order to stop supplies reaching Mecca and Medina which were in rebellion.\n\nThereafter, the land routes to tranship camel caravans' goods were from Alexandria to ports on the Red Sea or the northern Byzantine silk route through the Caucasian Mountains transhipping on the Caspian Sea and thence to India.\n\nDuring his Egyptian expedition, Napoleon found the canal in 1799.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45642", "title": "Demography", "text": "Demography\n\nDemography (from prefix \"demo-\" from Ancient Greek δῆμος \"dēmos\" meaning \"the people\", and \"-graphy\" from γράφω \"graphō\", implies \"writing, description or measurement\") is the statistical study of populations, especially human beings. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see population dynamics). Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, aging, and death. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.\n\nDemographic analysis can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. Educational institutions usually treat demography as a field of sociology, though there are a number of independent demography departments.\n\nFormal demography limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of social demography or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.\n\nDemographic thoughts traced back to antiquity, and were present in many civilisations and cultures, like Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, China and India. In ancient Greece, this can be found in the writings of Herodotus, Thucidides, Hippocrates, Epicurus, Protagoras, Polus, Plato and Aristotle. In Rome, writers and philosophers like Cicero, Seneca, Pliny the elder, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Cato, and Columella also expressed important ideas on this ground.\n\nIn the Middle ages, Christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the Classical ideas on demography. Important contributors to the field were William of Conches, Bartholomew of Lucca, William of Auvergne, William of Pagula, and Ibn Khaldun.\n\nOne of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was \"Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality\" (1662) by John Graunt, which contains a primitive form of life table. Among the study's findings were that one third of the children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Mathematicians, such as Edmond Halley, developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics. Richard Price was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771, followed later by Augustus de Morgan, ‘On the Application of Probabilities to Life Contingencies’ (1838).\n\nIn 1755, Benjamin Franklin published his essay \"Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.\", projecting exponential growth in British colonies. His work influenced Thomas Robert Malthus, who, writing at the end of the 18th century, feared that, if unchecked, population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see Malthusian catastrophe). Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of overpopulation and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by Benjamin Gompertz and Verhulst.\n\nThe period 1860-1910 can be characterised as a period of transition wherein demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest. This period included a panoply of international ‘great demographers’ like Adolphe Quételet (1796–1874), William Farr (1807–1883), Louis-Adolphe Bertillon (1821–1883) and his son Jacques (1851–1922), Joseph Körösi (1844–1906), Anders Nicolas Kaier (1838–1919), Richard Böckh (1824–1907), Émile Durkheim (1858-1917), Wilhelm Lexis (1837–1914), and Luigi Bodio (1840–1920) contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis.\n\nThere are two types of data collection—direct and indirect—with several different methods of each type.\n\nDirect data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage, divorce, and migration (registration of place of residence). In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.\n\nA census is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the sex ratios from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.\n\nCensuses do more than just count people. They typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship. In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the People's Republic of China gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.\n\nIndirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of historical demography. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.\n\nThere are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include models of mortality (including the life table, Gompertz models, hazards models, Cox proportional hazards models, multiple decrement life tables, Brass relational logits), fertility (Hernes model, Coale-Trussell models, parity progression ratios), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, Page model), disability (Sullivan's method, multistate life tables), population projections (Lee-Carter model, the Leslie Matrix), and population momentum (Keyfitz).\n\nThe United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 National Child Development Study, the 1970 British Cohort Study, and the Millennium Cohort Study, begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.\n\n\nA stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.\n\nNote that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table, which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.\n\nSuppose that a country (or other entity) contains \"Population\" persons at time \"t\".\nWhat is the size of the population at time \"t\" + 1 ?\n\nNatural increase from time \"t\" to \"t\" + 1:\n\nNet migration from time \"t\" to \"t\" + 1:\n\nThis basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations. For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change. When dealing with ethnic groups, however, \"net migration\" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification (assimilation). Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.\n\nMore generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.\n\nThe figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN \"medium\" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070. Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.\n\nPopulations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration. Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential). Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population. Demographers most commonly study mortality using the Life Table, a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.\n\nMigration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent. Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.\n\nDemography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as sociology, economics, epidemiology, geography, anthropology and history, demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the Cicred (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, or a national association such as the Population Association of America in the United States, or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.\n\nSocial surveys:\n\nOrganizations:\n\nScientific journals:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "923965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923965", "title": "Dixon Entrance", "text": "Dixon Entrance\n\nThe Dixon Entrance is a strait about long and wide in the Pacific Ocean at the Canada–United States border, between the U.S. state of Alaska and the province of British Columbia in Canada. It was named by Joseph Banks for Captain George Dixon, a Royal Navy officer, fur trader, and explorer, who surveyed the area in 1787. The Dixon Entrance is part of the Inside Passage shipping route. It forms part of the maritime boundary between the U.S. and Canada, although the location of that boundary here is disputed. A name used in the Haida language is Seegaay, which means only \"ocean\".\n\nThe Dixon Entrance lies between Clarence Strait in the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska to the north, and Hecate Strait and the islands known as Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands) in British Columbia, to the south. Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, is the largest of the Alaskan islands on the north side of the entrance, and is also home to a branch of the Haida, known as the Kaigani Haida. Members of the Haida nation maintain free access across the Strait.\n\nThe so-called \"A–B\" line (approximately 54°40'N), which marks the northern boundary of the Dixon Entrance, was delineated by a court of arbitration set up by the 1903 Alaska Boundary Treaty. The meaning of the line remains in dispute between Canada and the United States. Canada claims the line is the international maritime boundary, while the United States holds that its purpose was only to designate the land masses belonging to each country. Hence, the U.S. does not recognize the \"A–B\" line as an official boundary (to govern, for example, seafloor resources or fishing rights). In 1977 the U.S. defined a maritime boundary as an equidistant line between land masses.\n\nThe two differing boundary lines intersect to create four separate water areas with different claim status. The two areas south of the \"A–B\" line (about 2789 km and 51.5 km in size) are claimed by both countries. The other two water areas are north of the \"A–B\" line and are not claimed by either country. The two unclaimed areas are about 72 km and 1.4 km in size.\n\nIn addition, Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation (LTE) (\"bare at half-tide\") that lies south of the \"A–B\" Line, surrounded by the sea territory claimed by the U.S. The United States has not ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty, although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.\n\nTerritorial fishing disputes between the countries remain today, as the United States has never shown the \"A–B\" line as an official boundary on its government maps.\n\n"}
{"id": "357568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357568", "title": "Dominion Land Survey", "text": "Dominion Land Survey\n\nThe Dominion Land Survey (DLS) is the method used to divide most of Western Canada into one-square-mile (2.6 km) sections for agricultural and other purposes. It is based on the layout of the Public Land Survey System used in the United States, but has several differences. The DLS is the dominant survey method in the Prairie provinces, and it is also used in British Columbia along the Railway Belt (near the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway), and in the Peace River Block in the northeast of the province. (Although British Columbia entered Confederation with control over its own lands, unlike the Northwest Territories and the Prairie provinces, British Columbia transferred these lands to the federal Government as a condition of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The federal government then surveyed these areas under the DLS.)\n\nThe survey was begun in 1871, shortly after Manitoba and the North-West Territories became part of Canada, following the purchase of Rupert's Land from the Hudson’s Bay Company. Covering about , the survey system and its terminology are deeply ingrained in the rural culture of the Prairies. The DLS is the world's largest survey grid laid down in a single integrated system. The first formal survey done in western Canada was by Peter Fidler in 1813.\n\nThe inspiration for the Dominion Land Survey System was the plan for Manitoba (and later Saskatchewan and Alberta) to be agricultural economies. With a large amount of European settlers arriving, Manitoba was undergoing a large change so grasslands and parklands were surveyed, settled, and farmed. The Dominion Land Survey system was developed because the farm name and field position descriptions used in northern Europe were not organized or flexible enough, and the township and concession system used in eastern Canada was not satisfactory. The first meridian was chosen at 97°27′28.4″ west longitude and was established in 1869. Another 6 meridians were established after.\n\nA number of places are excluded from the survey system: these include federal lands such as Indian reserves, federal parks, and air weapon ranges. The surveys do not encroach on reserves because that land was established before the surveys began. When the Hudson's Bay Company relinquished their title to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, via the deed of surrender it received Section 8 and all of Section 26 excluding the northeast quarter. These lands were gradually sold by the company and in 1984 they donated the remaining to the Saskatchewan Wildlife Association.\n\nThe surveying of western Canada was divided into five basic surveys. Each survey's layout was slightly different from the others. The first survey began in 1871 and ended in 1879 and covers some of southern Manitoba and a little of Saskatchewan. The second and smallest survey, in 1880, was used in only small areas of Saskatchewan. This system differs from the first survey because rather than running section lines parallel to the eastern boundary they run true north-south. The largest and most important of these surveys was the third which covers more land than all the others surveys put together. This survey began in 1881. That method of surveying is still used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The fourth and fifth surveys were used only in some townships in British Columbia.\n\nThe reason that the Canadian government was pushing to subdivide Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta was to affirm Canadian sovereignty over these lands. The United States was undergoing rapid expansion in the 1860s, and the Canadian government was afraid that the Americans would expand into Canadian territory. Canada's introduction of a railway and surveying was a means to discourage American encroachment. Sir John A. Macdonald remarked in 1870 that the Americans \"are resolved to do all they can short of war, to get possession of our western territory, and we must take immediate and vigorous steps to counteract them.\"\n\nThe beginning of the Dominion Land Survey marked a new era for western Canada. Railways were making their way to the West and the population of western regions began to increase. The introduction of the survey system marked the end of the nomadic ways for the First Nations and Metis. This did not go over well and was a catalyst to the events of the Red River Rebellion.\n\nBeing a surveyor was not easy. The hours were long, the time away from civilization was longer, and the elements were unforgiving. A survey party generally consisted of up to 20 members, which would include a party chief, chain men, a cook, people to saw trees, a recorder, and people to turn angles. All travel was either on horseback or by foot. To begin surveying a party chief would have to buy approximately $400 worth of instruments. These instruments included an alidade, dumpy level, theodolite, Gunter's chain (which was replaced by a steel tape), and a solar compass or a vernier compass.\n\nThe Dominion Land Survey system was proposed in 1869 by John Stoughton Dennis. The initial plan, though based on the square townships of the American Public Lands Survey System, involved 9 mile townships divided into sixty-four 800 acre sections consisting of four 200 acre lots each. Work to establish the first meridian and few township outlines began and quickly ended in 1869 when a party of Metis symbolically stepped on a survey chain, beginning the Red River Resistance. Work resumed in 1871; however, the system was redesigned to use 6 mile townships with 640 acre sections based on a suggestion from Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories William McDougall, who advocated that most of the settlers would come from the United States, so it was \"advisable to offer them lots of a size to which they have been accustomed.\" The Dominion Land Survey System still differed from the Public Land System because it contained road allowances.\n\nThe Dominion Land Survey was enormous. Around are estimated to have been subdivided into quarter sections, 27 million of which were surveyed by 1883 (14 years after the system's inception). The amount of work undertaken between 1871 and 1930 is given justice by the amount of paper work submitted: the maps, plans and memos transferred by the Canadian government to the provinces filled approximately 200 railway cars. This did not include the closed or dormant files which would be enough to fill 9000 filing cabinets, which would weigh about 227 tons.\n\nUntil very recently, surveying was done with manually controlled instruments to take distance and angular measurements. Distance was measured using either a chain or more recently a transit or range finder. To turn angles a theodolite was used. To find their location they used astronomical observations, and to find elevation levels and barometers were used. In order to see over long distances towers were constructed from timber in flat and wooded areas.\n\nThe most important north–south lines of the survey are the meridians:\n\nThe meridians were determined by painstaking survey observations and measurements, and in reference to other benchmarks on the continent, but were determined using 19th century technology. The only truly accurate benchmarks at that time were near the prime meridian in Europe. Benchmarks in other parts of the world had to be calculated or estimated by the positions of the sun and stars. Consequently, although they were remarkably accurate for the time, today they are known to be several hundred metres in error. Before the survey was even completed it was established that for the purposes of laws based on the survey, the results of the physical survey would take precedence over the theoretically correct position of the meridians. This precludes, for example any basis for a boundary dispute between Alberta and Saskatchewan on account of surveying errors.\n\nThe main east–west lines are the baselines. The First Baseline is at 49° north, which forms much of the Canada–United States border in the West. Each subsequent baseline is about to the north of the previous one, terminating at 60° north, which forms the boundary with Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.\n\nStarting at each intersection of a meridian and a baseline and working west (also working east of the First Meridian and the Coast Meridian), nearly square townships are surveyed, which are about in both north–south and east–west extent. There are two tiers of townships to the north and two tiers to the south of each baseline.\n\nBecause the east and west edges of townships, called \"range lines\", are meridians of longitude, they converge towards the North Pole. Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than the south. Only along the baselines do townships have their nominal width from east to west. The two townships to the north of a baseline gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually widen as one moves south. Halfway between two base lines, wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships. The east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and north–south roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east or west. These east–west lines halfway between baselines are called \"correction lines\".\n\nTownships are designated by their \"township number\" and \"range number\". Township 1 is the first north of the First Baseline, and the numbers increase to the north. Range numbers recommence with Range 1 at each meridian and increase to the west (also east of First Meridian and Coast Meridian). On maps, township numbers are marked in Arabic numerals, but range numbers are often marked in Roman numerals; however, in other contexts Arabic numerals are used for both. Individual townships are designated such as \"Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian,\" abbreviated \"52-25-W4.\" In Manitoba, the First Meridian is the only one used, so the abbreviations are even more terse, e.g., \"3-1-W\" and \"24-2-E.\". In Manitoba legislation, the abbreviations WPM and EPM are used: \"3-1 WPM\" and \"24-2 EPM\".\n\nEvery township is divided into 36 sections, each about square. Sections are numbered within townships, beginning with the southeast section, as follows (north at top):\nIn turn, each section is divided into four quarter sections (square land parcels roughly 1/2 mile on a side): southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast. This quarter-section description is primarily used by the agricultural industry. The full legal description of a particular quarter section is \"the Northeast Quarter of Section 20, Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian\", abbreviated \"NE-20-52-25-W4.\"\n\nA section may also be split into as many as 16 legal subdivisions (LSDs). LSDs are commonly used by the oil and gas industry as a precise way of locating wells, pipelines, and facilities. LSDs can be \"quarter-quarter sections\" (square land parcels roughly on a side, comprising roughly in area)—but this is not necessary. Many are other fractions of a section (a half-quarter section—roughly in area is common.) LSDs may be square, rectangular, and occasionally even triangular. LSDs are numbered as follows (north at top):\nIn order to fully understand how the townships, sections, quarter sections, and legal subdivisions were set out, one should refer to the \"Manual of Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Land\".\n\nOccasionally, resource companies assign further divisions within LSDs such as \"A, B, C, D etc.\" for example, to distinguish between multiple sites within an LSD. These in no way constitute an official change to the Dominion Land Survey system, but nonetheless often appear as part of the legal description.\n\nBetween certain sections of a township run \"road allowances\" (but not all road allowances have an actual road built on them). The road allowances add to the size of the township (they do not cut down the size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are road allowances of surrounding every section. In townships surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in width and in number. They are wide and run north–south between all sections; however, there are only three east–west road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to 12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a north-south road allowance every mile going west, and an east-west road allowance every two miles going north. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but still provides road-access to every quarter-section. Road allowances are one of the differences between the Canadian DLS and the American Public Land Survey System, which leaves no extra space for roads.\n\nCertain sections of townships were reserved for special purposes:\n\nLegal surveys conducted before and after the Dominion Land Survey grid was laid out often have their own legal descriptions and delineations. Early settlement lots still retain their own original legal descriptions, but often have townships superimposed over them for the sake of convenience or for certain tasks. Urban developments superimpose new survey lots and plans over the older section and township grid also.\n\nCertain areas otherwise within the surveys' boundaries were not part of the survey grid, or not available for homesteading. These were Indian reserves, pre-existing \"settlements\" divided into \"river lots\" based on the French system used in Quebec, and lands around Hudson's Bay Company trading posts reserved for the company when it transferred its claim over the West to Canada in 1870.\n\nThe rights of the pre-DLS settlers was a major political issue in the West in the late nineteenth century. The settlers claimed squatters' rights over the land they had already farmed, but the sizes and boundaries of these farms were poorly defined, leading to frequent disputes. As well the Métis in the Southbranch settlements of Saskatchewan were particularly with their land rights given that they had not been well protected by the \"Manitoba Act\" as they had been promised in 1870. In the case of the closely clustered settlements of Edmonton, St. Albert, and Fort Saskatchewan in the Alberta District, a militant \"settlers' rights\" movement developed which demanded action from the federal government to grant the settlers legal title to their land and to end claim jumping. The movement even resorted to vigilante action against suspected claim jumpers. Most of these grievances were resolved by 1885, which is likely one of the reasons the area never joined the North-West Rebellion despite the fact that St. Albert, and to a lesser extent Edmonton, were largely populated by Métis people.\n\n\nDennis, John Stoughton younger (1856-1938).

{"id": "510905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=510905", "title": "Geomatics", "text": "Geomatics\n\nGeomatics is defined in the ISO/TC 211 series of standards as the \"discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information\". Under another definition it \"consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data\".\nIt includes geomatics engineering (and surveying engineering) and is related to geospatial science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).\n\nMichel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced \"geomatics\" as a new scientific term in an article published in 1981 in \"The Canadian Surveyor\" and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the Canadian Institute of Surveying in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.\n\nGeomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), global-navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in Canada, because it is similar in origin to both French and English, but has since been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference for the term \"geospatial technology\".\n\nThe related field of \"hydrogeomatics\" covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of hydrographics was considered too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments.\n\nA \"geospatial network\" is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One example of such a network is the Open Geospatial Consortium's efforts to provide \"ready global access to geographic information\".\n\nA number of university departments which were once titled \"surveying\", \"survey engineering\" or \"topographic science\" have re-titled themselves using the terms \"geomatics\" or \"geomatic engineering\".\n\nThe rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in computer hardware, computer science, and software engineering, as well as by airborne and space observation remote-sensing technologies.\n\nThe science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of geomatics.\n\nGeospatial science is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as surveying, geographic information systems, hydrography and cartography. Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the built environment.\n\nThe term spatial science or spatial sciences is primarily used in Australia.\nAustralian universities which offer degrees in spatial science include Curtin University, the University of Tasmania, the University of Adelaide,Melbourne University and RMIT University.\n\nIn the U.S., Texas A&M University offers a bachelor's degree in Spatial Sciences and is home to its own Spatial Sciences Laboratory. Beginning in 2012, the University of Southern California started to place more emphasis on the spatial science branch of its geography department, with traditional human and physical geography courses and concentrations either not being offered on a regular basis or phased out. In place, the university now offers graduate programs strictly related to spatial science and its geography department offers a spatial science minor rather than the original geography major.\n\nSpatial information practitioners within the Asia-Pacific region are represented by the professional body called the Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute (SSSI).\n\nGeomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering is a rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.\n\nGeomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land surveying engineering along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from data science and cartography to geography. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term \"surveying\" no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.\n\nTherefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.\n\nThe more traditional land surveying strand of geomatics engineering is concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of real property parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land descriptions. The tasks more closely related to civil engineering include the design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping and control surveys for construction projects.\n\nGeomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital theodolite/distance meter total stations, Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment, digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based geographic information systems (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.\n\nGeomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition, processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of interdisciplinary fields.\n\nIn different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum is administered with the name surveying in some, and in others with the names geomatics, geomatics engineering, geospatial (information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in civil engineering education programs, more and more universities include the departments relevant for geo-data sciences under informatics, computer science or applied mathematics. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering.\nThe job of \"geospatial engineer\" is well established in the U.S. military.\n\nApplication areas include: \n\nGeomatics integrates science and technology from both new and traditional disciplines:\n\n\n\n"}

In Leiden, he was also enrolled as a student of Friedrich Spanheim. After a two year's sojourn in England, he returned to Leiden, compiling a history of the events of the ongoing English Civil War (\"Rerum Britannicarum libri VII\", \"De statu ecclesiae Britannicae hodierno\").\n\nIn 1648, he completed a doctorate in Leiden and refused calls to both Frankfurt University and Heidelberg University as professor of theology, instead accepting the position of professor of history, politics and geography at the new University of Harderwijk, where he became rector in 1652. In 1653, he became professor of history at Leiden University, a position he held until his death in 1670.\n\nIn his later life, Horn was also greatly interested in alchemy. In 1665, he was swindled out of the considerable sum of 5,000 guilders by a fraudulent alchemist. \nHis interest in alchemy als resulted in an edition of Pseudo-Geber in 1668.\nFrom about this time, he also began to suffer from intermittent spells of mental distraction, although he remained a prolific writer until his death.\n\nAmong his publications, his Latin works on universal history, intended as a textbook for students, wer especially influential (\"Historia ecclesiastica et politica\", \"Arca Noae\", \"Orbis Politicus\", \"Orbis Imperans\"). These works were re-published long after his death in both the Netherlands and Germany.\nHis treated universal history in a modern manner, no longer divided into the history of the four classical empires (Assyria, Persia, Macedon, Rome) but based on the concept of national history, including the history of the peoples of the New World (\"De originibus Americanis\").\nHe was also one of the earliest historiographers to divide world history into three major epochs, antiquity from earliest times until the Migration period, the middle period from the Migration period to the year 1500, and modern history from 1500 to his own day.\nHis coverage of the Migration period is presented as the history of the \"Scythian\" nation, which is divided into Germans, Huns and Slavs.\n\nIn all his works, Horn presents himself as a pious Protestant and as a patriot of his homeland, considering himself a native of and exile from the Upper Palatinate (which had been annexed by the Catholic Duke of Bavaria in 1628).\n\nposthumous editions:\n\ntranslations:\n\n"}

Agnew, FBA (born Millom, England, August 29, 1949) is a prominent British-American political geographer. Agnew was educated at the Universities of Exeter and Liverpool in England and Ohio State in the United States.\n\nAgnew is currently Distinguished Professor of Geography at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). From 1975 until 1995 he was a professor at Syracuse University in New York. Dr. Agnew teaches courses on political geography, the history of geography, European cities, and the Mediterranean World. From 1998 to 2002 he chaired the Department of Geography at UCLA. He has written widely on questions of territory, place, and political power. He has also worked on issues of \"science\" in geography and how knowledge is created and circulates in and across places. He is best known for his work completely reinventing \"geopolitics\" as a field of study and for his theoretical and empirical efforts at showing how national politics is best understood in terms of the geographical dynamics of \"places\" and how they are made out of both local and long-distance determinants. One of his best known books is \"Place and Politics\" (1987). Another is \"Geopolitics: Re-Visioning World Politics\" (2003). Much of his empirical research involves Italy, Greece, and the United States. For the year 2008–9, John Agnew was President of the Association of American Geographers, the main professional organization for academic geography in the United States. He was associate editor of the flagship journal of the association, Annals of the Association of American Geographers and was co-editor of the international journal \"Geopolitics\" with David Newman from 1998 to 2009. He is now editor-in-chief of the journal, \"Territory, Politics, Governance\" published by Routledge.\n\nIn \"Place and Politics\" (1987), John Agnew contends that for a space to become a 'place', three requirements need to be met : \nThe focus on place reflects an effort to create a multi-scalar political geography. Agnew sees this as an alternative to the long-dominant state-centrism of the field and better suited than it to the evolving global condition. In this work he tries to do two things: (a) offer a conception of places as geographical settings for political action that are structured by the historical accumulation of local, wider-ranging, and sense-of-place influences and (b) relate the changing character of places with respect to the politics they produce to changes in the wider environment (such as changes in the balance between local and national-state governments, changes in the workings of the world economy, changes in social-class, ethnic, and other social affiliations, and shifts in the meaning and attachments to particular places).\n\nBringing together research conducted over the previous fifteen years on Italian politics, \"Place and Politics in Modern Italy\" (2002), is the most significant development of this perspective since his 1987 book, \"Place and Politics\". It engages with contemporary debates in political theory about rational choice, association, difference, and socialization to provide an alternative geographical perspective that is both attentive to theoretical issues yet immersed in empirical specificity at Italy-wide and local geographical scales. More recently,(2003–2007), Agnew and his colleague Michael Shin have collaborated on an NSF-funded project concerning the transformation of Italian electoral politics between 1987 and 2006 that will further the goal of the research by measuring the geographical dynamics of Italian politics in the country as a whole. The book, \"Berlusconi's Italy\" (2008), reports on this particular project.\n\nAgnew has also been actively involved in reformulating on a critical footing the hitherto long-taboo subject among Anglo-American geographers of “geopolitics.” His 1998 book \"Geopolitics\" appeared in a second edition in 2003 and along with the co-authored book \"Mastering Space\" (1995), is part of this enterprise. Perhaps his most polished arguments in this area are in \"Hegemony: The New Shape of Global Power\", which won a Choice Award as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2005, and in “Sovereignty Regimes”, a long article that appeared the same year and has been transformed into a book length project, \"Globalization and Sovereignty\" (2009) which also won a Choice Outstanding Academic Title Award. Perhaps the three most important themes of this work taken as a whole are (a) the historicization of the idealized state of conventional political theory and geopolitics to the modern era; (b) the role of distinctive geopolitical discourses in different epochs of this era in normalizing the worldview associated with what he calls the state-centered “modern geopolitical imagination;” and (c) the need to take seriously the distinctive contributions to the character of “world order” brought by different hegemonic powers. His work on geopolitical discourse has been a major contribution to the geography of media and communication.\n\nThis work has attracted the attention of international relations scholars interested in paying more attention to the ways in which “geography” enters into the theory and practices of “international relations.” Agnew's recent work in this area, specifically on the European origins of the modern state and what this signifies for contemporary statehood in southeastern Europe, was helped by the award of a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for the academic year 2003–2004. The recent article \"No Borders, No Nations: Making Greece in Macedonia\" (\"Annals of the Association of American Geographers\", 2007) is an important statement of Agnew's perspective on international borders, an important element in the field of geopolitics. His article \"Sovereignty Regimes: Territoriality and State Authority in Contemporary World Politics\" was published by the Annals of Association of American Geographers\", 2005) on the various geographical ways, both territorial and networked, in which sovereignty works other than just the simple mapping of territorial blocs of space long assumed by international relations and international law.\n\nIn September 2008 Agnew and a group from UCLA evaluated the relative success of the so-called US military surge in Baghdad using night-light satellite information (\"Baghdad Nights\", Environment and Planning A (2008)). Claiming that the surge merely sealed the fate of Sunni and mixed Sunni/Shia neighborhoods already reduced in population by previous violence, this research received an enormous amount of coverage in the press and the blogosphere, not least from right-wing bloggers in the US defending the Bush-McCain claim that the surge \"had worked\" but without any sort of empirical information to justify their politically inspired arguments (S. Tavernise and A.W. Lehren, \"A grim portrait of civilian deaths in Iraq\" New York Times, 22 October 2010) During early 2009, a team led by Thomas W. Gillespie and Agnew of UCLA used satellite-aided geographical analysis to pinpoint three compounds in Parachinar [Pakistan] as likely hideouts of the Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2001. This too received considerable media coverage. Much of this, however, failed to note the ironic tone of the MIT International Review paper (2009), \"Finding Bin Laden\", reporting the research with its emphasis on why so little effort seemingly had been put into finding the al-Qaeda leader after 2001 and the stake of US governments in keeping the myth of Islamic terrorism going as a basis for an endless new war recapitulating the \"success\" of the Cold War in mobilizing US identity and formulating a US foreign policy to which others could be recruited.\n\nJohn Agnew has two daughters: Katherine Agnew Sommer, a deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County and Dr. Christine Agnew Brune, an epidemiologist at the CDC in Atlanta.\n\n\nIn July 2017, Agnew was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.\n\n\n"}

In the broadest sense, the chain forms the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau south of the Tarim Basin.\n\nThe exact definition of this range varies. An old source uses Kunlun to mean the mountain belt that runs across the center of China, that is, Kunlun in the narrow sense: Altyn Tagh along with the Qilian and Qin Mountains. A recent source has the Kunlun range forming most of the south side of the Tarim Basin and then continuing east south of the Altyn Tagh. Sima Qian (\"Shiji\", scroll 123) says that Emperor Wu of Han sent men to find the source of the Yellow River and gave the name Kunlun to the mountains at its source. The name seems to have originated as a semi-mythical location in the classical Chinese text \"Shanhai Jing\".\n\nFrom the Pamirs of Tajikistan, it runs east along the border between Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions to the Sino-Tibetan ranges in Qinghai province. It stretches along the southern edge of what is now called the Tarim Basin, the infamous Takla Makan or \"sand-buried houses\" desert, and the Gobi Desert. A number of important rivers flow from it including the Karakash River ('Black Jade River') and the Yurungkash River ('White Jade River'), which flow through the Khotan Oasis into the Taklamakan Desert.\n\nAltyn-Tagh or Altun Range is one of the chief northern ranges of the Kunlun. Its northeastern extension Qilian Shan is another main northern range of the Kunlun. In the south main extension is the Min Shan. Bayan Har Mountains, a southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, forms the watershed between the catchment basins of China's two longest rivers, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River.\n\nThe highest mountain of the Kunlun Shan is the Kunlun Goddess (7,167 m) in the Keriya area in western Kunlun Shan. Some authorities claim that the Kunlun extends further northwest-wards as far as Kongur Tagh (7,649 m) and the famous Muztagh Ata (7,546 m). But these mountains are physically much more closely linked to the Pamir group (ancient Mount Imeon). The Arka Tagh (Arch Mountain) is in the center of the Kunlun Shan; its highest points are Ulugh Muztagh (6,973 m) and Bukadaban Feng (6,860 m). In the eastern Kunlun Shan the highest peaks are Yuzhu Peak (6,224 m) and Dradullungshong (6,282 m); the latter is the eastern major peak in Kunlun Shan range and is thus considered as the eastern edge of Kunlun Shan range.\n\nThe mountain range formed at the northern edges of the Cimmerian Plate during its collision, in the Late Triassic, with Siberia, which resulted in the closing of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.\n\nThe range has very few roads and in its 3,000 km length is crossed by only two. In the west, Highway 219 traverses the range en route from Yecheng, Xinjiang to Lhatse, Tibet. Further east, Highway 109 crosses between Lhasa and Golmud.\n\nOver 70 volcanic cones form the Kunlun Volcanic Group. They are not volcanic mountains, but cones. As such, they are not counted among the world volcanic mountain peaks. The group, however, musters the heights of above sea level (). If they were considered volcanic mountains, they would constitute the highest volcano in Asia and China and second highest in the Eastern Hemisphere (after Mount Kilimanjaro) and one of Volcanic Seven Summits by elevation. (Mount Damavand is the highest volcano in Asia, not the Kunlun cones.) The last known eruption in the volcanic group was on May 27, 1951.\n\nKunlun is originally the name of a mythical mountain believed to be a Taoist paradise. The first to visit this paradise was, according to the legends, King Mu (976-922 BCE) of the Zhou Dynasty. He supposedly discovered there the Jade Palace of the Yellow Emperor, the mythical originator of Chinese culture, and met Hsi Wang Mu (Xi Wang Mu), the 'Spirit Mother of the West' usually called the 'Queen Mother of the West', who was the object of an ancient religious cult which reached its peak in the Han Dynasty, and also had her mythical abode in these mountains.\n<br>\n\nThe Kunlun mountains (spelled \"Kuen-Lun\" in the book) are described as the location of the Shangri-La monastery in the 1933 novel \"Lost Horizon\" by English writer James Hilton.\n\nThe mountains are the site of the fictional city of K'un Lun in the Marvel Comics Iron Fist series and the TV show of the same name.\n\n\n"}

Further bans are in place but are governed by individual states. Currently all Australian states and territories have banned smoking in vehicles with children, in some enclosed public places, particularly most major company-owned workplaces, and most enclosed restaurants. Tobacco products cannot be sold or supplied to persons under 18 years old, but there is no legal age to use them.\n\nThe Australian Government has made very few laws on electronic cigarettes and leaves it up to the states.\n\nIn 2013, around 13.3% of people aged 18 and older in Australia were daily smokers. By state/territory, the Australian Capital Territory had the lowest percentage of daily smokers in the country at 9.9%, and the Northern Territory the highest at around 22.2% then Tasmania at 21% followed by Queensland at 20%. In 2016, around 17.4% of people aged 18 and older in Australia were daily or occasional smokers, higher than the United States and the UK.\n\nOn 6 December 1995, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government was the first jurisdictional government in Australia to introduce no smoking in cafes and restaurants. Since 1 December 2006 a smoking ban has applied to all enclosed public places.\n\nThe ACT Government introduced laws to prohibit smoking in most outdoor eating areas in the territory starting December 2010. Exceptions to this rule can be made but only under certain guidelines. A \"Designated Outdoor Smoking Area\" (DOSA) requirements include; may not encompass more than 50% of the outdoor area, must be separated from smoke-free areas by no less than 4 metres or a non-transparent fixed wall barrier at least 3 metres high.\n\nThe New South Wales Government introduced a ban on smoking in enclosed public areas in the State, except for bars and in licensed premises, on 6 September 2001. The Government introduced a total \"enclosed space\" ban in New South Wales on 1 July 2007. In this state, a public place is considered substantially enclosed only if the total area of ceiling and wall surfaces are more than 75% of its total notional ceiling and wall area. Windows and doors may be counted as open space only if they are locked open to the outside for the duration of trading hours. 10% of the total ceiling and wall area must remain open to the elements at all times.\n\nSince 1 July 2009, smoking in a car with someone under the age of 16 is against the law. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2008 creates a new offence of smoking in a car with a child under 16 years of age in the vehicle. A $250 on-the-spot fine applies to the driver and any passenger who breaks the law. This is enforced by NSW Police. However licence premises may set aside an outdoor smoking area for drinking only and must be 4 metres away from restaurant tables and no more than 75% enclosed.\n\nSince 7 January 2013, smoking is banned at public (outdoor) playgrounds within 10 m of children's play equipment, in open areas of public swimming pools, at major sports grounds, within 4 m of any building open to the public and at public transport stops (including outdoor parts of railway stations, bus stops, light rail stops and taxi ranks). Bans on smoking within 4 metres of a pedestrian access point to a public building will include seated areas restaurants and cafés since 6 July 2015.\n\nThe New South Wales Government banned smoking at correctional facilities within the state since 10 August 2015.\n\nSmoking is banned in all government buildings, tour buses, taxis and flights to and from Norfolk Island. There is no law on smoking in restaurants, but many are smoke-free; however, they often have a dedicated smoking room for people that wish to smoke. Smoking is permitted in all bars and licensed premises. Resorts and motels have smoking rooms and areas for smokers.\n\nCertain restrictions on smoking in enclosed areas of restaurants, licensed clubs and pubs came into force in the Northern Territory on 2 January 2010. Areas such as pubs, clubs and restaurants can now only have 50% of their premises a smoking room/area. The Northern Territory is also the last jurisdiction In Australia that still allows smoking inside certain areas of schools providing children do not have access to that area. In the Northern Territory it is common for bars in rural areas to disobey the smoking bans that the government has put into place although fines can be issued ranging from $1000 to $8000. The Northern Territory Government became the first jurisdiction to ban smoking in correctional facilities when it introduced a total ban on cigarettes in the institutions on 1 July 2013.\n\nThe Queensland Government prohibits smoking in all pubs, clubs, restaurants and workplaces in Queensland, as well as in commercial outdoor eating and drinking areas and in outdoor public places (e.g., patrolled beaches, children's playground equipment, major sport stadiums, and within 4 metres of non-residential building entrances). Since 1 July 2006, premises holding a hotel, club or casino liquor licence can designate up to 50% of the outdoor liquor licensed area as a smoking and drinking area. In this area no food or drink can be served, no food can be consumed, no entertainment can be offered and there must be no gaming machines provided. A \"buffer\", which can be either a 2-metre-wide area or a 2.1-metre-high screen that is impervious to smoke, must be on the area's perimeter wherever it is adjacent to other parts of the outdoor area usually accessed by patrons. Premises that choose to have such an area must have a smoking management plan for the premises that complies with legislative requirements. For all other outdoor eating or drinking places, smoking has been prohibited since 1 July 2006. Since 1 January 2010, the Queensland Government banned smoking in cars where children under the age of 16 are present. In 2014, the Queensland Government became the first state government to ban tobacco in correctional facilities.\n\nA total enclosed public place smoking ban was introduced in South Australia on 1 November 2007. However, under the SA Tobacco Products Regulation Act 1997, a place or area is only \"enclosed\" if it is fully enclosed or is at least partially covered by a ceiling and has walls such that the total area of the ceiling and wall surfaces exceeds 70 per cent of the total notional ceiling and wall area. It is illegal to smoke in cars while children (under 16) are passengers. Since April 2012, smoking is not allowed beneath covered public transport waiting areas, including bus, tram, train and taxi shelters. Correctional facilities in South Australia banned smoking inside prison cells starting January 1, 2015. Smoking in public outdoor dining areas has been banned in South Australia since July 2016 (the second-to-last state to do so).\n\nTasmania was the first Australian state to introduce a total indoor smoking ban in January 2006. As of 1 January 2008, smoking in cars with passengers under the age of 18 is banned and will incur a $110 on the spot fine. (The laws would be strictly enforced only after a three-month education period.). Smoking has been banned in all outdoor restaurants since 2012, however, outdoor areas of licensed premises are exempted from the ban. Tasmanian Correctional facilities have banned smoking since January 1, 2015.\n\nThe Victorian Government introduced a total enclosed public place smoking ban in Victoria on 1 July 2007. Smoking is permitted in non-enclosed drinking areas if the area has a roof and walls that cover no more than 75% of the total notional wall area (i.e. if the combined wall and roof space is 25% open to the outdoors). Smoking is also allowed in: balconies; verandas; smoking rooms in motels; private business; courtyards; outdoor shopping malls; personal living areas in residential care facilities; marquees; and footpaths. Smoking is permitted in high roller rooms and certain smoking rooms of the Crown Casino. The sale of tobacco products to people under 18 is prohibited but there is no age limit to legally possess these products. A ban on smoking in cars carrying children (aged under 18) became effective since 1 January 2010. Smoking is prohibited on all areas of train stations and raised platform tram stops as of 1 March 2014. A ban on smoking within 4 metres school entrances became effective in May 2015. Victorian Correctional facilities have banned smoking since July 1, 2015.\n\nSince 1 August 2017 within Victoria the \"Tobacco Amendment Act 2016\" will amend the \"Tobacco Act 1987\" to ban smoking at all outdoor dining areas when food is available for consumption.\n\nWestern Australia was the second Australian state to ban smoking in all indoor areas of pubs, bars and clubs since 31 July 2006. Smoking bans apply in outdoor eating areas, where people eat and/or drink sitting at tables (e.g. restaurants, cafes, delis, lunch-bars and hotels). Smoking is banned within 10 meters of any children’s playground equipment. Smoking is prohibited “between the flags” on a beach in patrolled swimming areas. It is also illegal to smoke in a car if a child (aged under 17) is inside. Liquor licensed premises that are not subject to a restaurant licence may set aside up to 50 per cent of outdoor eating areas as smoking zones. Smoking is permitted in the international room and pearl room at the Burswood Casino. The Health Minister has regulated to allow footpath drinking without food to accommodate smokers.\n\n"}

Messner's museum project is designed to educate visitors on \"man's encounter with mountains\" and deals with the science of mountains and glaciers, the history of mountaineering and rock climbing, the history of mythical mountains, and the history of mountain-dwelling people.\n\nThe museum project consists of five museums based at six different locations: Firmian, Juval, Dolomites, Ortles, Ripa and Corones. MMM Firmian at Sigmundskron Castle near Bozen is the centerpiece of the museum and concentrates on man’s relationship with the mountains. The museum includes displays on the geology of the mountains, the religious significance of mountains in the lives of people, and the history of mountaineering and alpine tourism. MMM Juval at Juval Castle in the Burggrafenamt in Vinschgau is dedicated to the \"magic of the mountains\", with an emphasis on mystical mountains and their religious significance. MMM Dolomites at the Cibiana Pass at Monte Rite, housed in an old fort, is dedicated to the subject of rocks, particularly in the Dolomites, with exhibits focusing on the history of the formation of the Dolomites. This museum contains a summit observation platform that offers a 360° panorama of the surrounding Dolomites. MMM Ortles at Sulden on the Ortler is dedicated to the history of mountaineering on ice and the great glaciers of the world. MMM Ripa at Bruneck Castle in South Tyrol is dedicated to the mountain peoples from Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, with emphasis on their cultures, religions, and tourism activities. MMM Corones on the summit plateau of Kronplatz (2,275 m), is dedicated to traditional mountaineering.\n\nThe centrepiece of the Messner Mountain Museum is based in Sigmundskron Castle () near Bolzano, Italy, and addresses the subject of man's encounter with the mountains. The castle dates to the Late Middle Ages and houses the museum's headquarters, administration and event facilities. There is a rock theatre that seats 200 people. The museum was opened on 11 June 2006 after three years of restoration to the virtually ruined castle.\n\nThe concept at \"MMM Firmian\", as this hub of the museum is known, is based on three strands: the castle, the restoration and the exhibitions. The appearance of the castle has not been destroyed by modern alterations. The architect, Werner Tscholl, paid attention to the fact that the historical building had to retain its originality; for example, the new glass roof structures and pipes or cables of any kind are not visible from the outside.\n\nThe \"MMM Firmian\" itself covers an area of 1,100 square metres. The theme of the museum is the history and art of mountaineering. Messner wants to show \"what effect the mountain has on people\". as well as giving an understanding of mountains and mountain peoples. He demonstrates this by means of pictures, sculptures, symbolic objects and memorabilia of various expeditions, which are portrayed as part of a tour through the castle. Messner also displays the history of alpinism and the impact of alpinism and tourism on nature and the environment. A separate exhibition on the history of the castle and the region is in a tower.\n\nThis part of the MMM is housed within Juval Castle () near Naturns, a late-medieval castle, and was opened in 1995. This castle is privately owned by Messner and he uses it as his summer residence.\n\nThis MMM deals with the mountains as places of mystery and spirituality. Its main focus is the sacred mountains of the world such as Kailash, Mount Fuji or Ayers Rock. In addition, Tibetan exhibits such as precious Buddha sculptures and a giant prayer wheel are displayed. There is also an exhibition on Gesar Ling, an epic Tibetan king, a tantric room and an expedition room in the basement. Finally there is a collection of masks, displays on aspects of animism and mountain images in the keep.\n\n\"MMM Dolomites\" is housed in a First World War fort at a height of 2,181 metres on Monte Rite () between Cortina d’Ampezzo and Pieve di Cadore. This \"museum in the clouds\" was opened in 2002 and has the \"vertical world\" of the Dolomites as its theme. It covers the history of the opening up of the Dolomites as well as aspects of Alpine history and its protagonists.\n\nThe fourth part of the MMM is laid out underground below the Ortler in Sulden. Since opening in 2004, subjects such as the eternal ice and the Ortler are covered in an exhibition space of 300 square metres, with exhibitions on skiing, ice climbing, the Arctic and the Antarctic. Visitors are able to go inside the mountain and its glacier.\n\nAlso in Sulden is the museum \"Alpine Curiosa\" () in a twelve square metre little old cottage called \"Flohhäusl\", with portrayals of 13 legendary mountaineering stories (from Yogi Milarepa to Messner himself), which offers a different interpretation of mountaineering and where alpine curiosities are displayed.\n\nThe fifth part of the MMM is \"MMM Ripa\" at Bruneck Castle () above the town of Bruneck. This is planned to open in Spring 2011 and is intended as an interactive museum, which will offer a forum for various mountain peoples to exchange experiences with the local farming community. Guests from other mountain regions will spend a summer here and talk about their lives. Examples that Messner has given include the Sherpas, South American Indians, Tibetans, Mongols or Hunzas.\n\nThe sixth and last museum of the MMM network, the MMM corones, was built on the top of the Kronplatz mountain (\"Plan de Corones\" in Ladin and Italian) at an altitude of 2,275 meters above sea level. Opened in July, 2015, the museum, a modern structure designed by renowned British architect Zaha Hadid, has a floor area of 1,000 square meters and features a permanent exhibition dedicated to traditional climbing.\n\nThe cost of the project is estimated at up to €30 million, split between Messner and the province of South Tyrol. The latter funded the restoration and expansion of the old buildings; in return, Messner has to maintain the exhibitions without subsidy for 30 years. The restoration of the old fort on the Monte Rite was undertaken by the region of Venetia together with the municipality of Pieve di Cadore. For renovating and developing the \"MMM Bergvölker\" costs of between three and four million euros have been suggested, 80% of which will be borne by the province of South Tyrol in order to provide financial support to the municipality of Bruneck.\n\n"}

It is a Javanese term which literally means \"archipelago\" from Old Javanese. In Indonesia it means the Indonesian archipelago, while in Malaysia the term has been similarly adopted to mean the Malay archipelago. \n\nThe word Nusantara was taken from an oath by Gajah Mada in 1336, as written in the Old Javanese \"Pararaton\" and \"Nagarakretagama\". Gajah Mada was a powerful military leader and prime minister of Majapahit who was credited with bringing the empire to its peak of glory. Gajah Mada delivered an oath called \"Sumpah Palapa\", in which he vowed not to eat any food containing spices until he had conquered all of Nusantara under the glory of Majapahit.\n\nToday, Indonesian historians believed that the concept of Nusantara was not an idea coined by Gajah Mada for the first time in 1336. It was coined earlier in 1275 as \"Cakravala Mandala Dvipantara\" by Kertanegara of Singhasari. Dvipantara is a Sanskrit word for the \"islands inbetween\", the synonym to Nusantara as both \"dvipa\" and \"nusa\" mean \"island\". The term is used to describe the Southeast Asian Archipelago. Kertanegara envisioned the union of Southeast Asian maritime kingdoms and polities under Singhasari as a bulwark against the rise of the expansionist Mongol Yuan dynasty in mainland China.\n\nNusantara is a Javanese word which appears in the \"Pararaton\" manuscript. In Javanese, Nusantara means \"outer islands\", and \"antara\", \"within\". Based on the Majapahit concept of state, the monarch had the power over three areas:\n\n\nIn 1920, Ernest Francois Eugene Douwes Dekker (1879–1950), who was also known as Setiabudi, introduced a new name for this proposed independent country (successor state of colonial Dutch East Indies) — which unlike its currently used name of \"Indonesia\" — did not contain any words etymologically inherited from the name of India or the Indies. The new proposed name was the locally developed name \"Nusantara\". This is the first instance of the term \"Nusantara\" appearing after it had been written into Pararaton manuscript.\n\nThe definition of Nusantara introduced by Setiabudi is different to the 14th century definition of the term. During the Majapahit era, Nusantara described vassal areas to be conquered. Setiabudi didn't want this aggressive connotation, so he defined Nusantara as all the Indonesian regions from Sabang as far as Merauke.\n\nToday in Indonesian, Nusantara is synonymous with Indonesian archipelago or the national territory of Indonesia, in this sense the term Nusantara excludes Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines. In 1967, it has transformed into the concept of \"Wawasan Nusantara\" or \"archipelagic outlook\", which regarded the archipelagic realm of Indonesia, the islands and seas surrounding them, as a single unity of several aspects, including political unity, socio-cultural, economic, security and defense unity.\nWhile in Malaysian the term is synonymous and often interchangeable with Malay archipelago or Malay realm () which includes those countries.\n\nIn the 21st century, Nusantara can be referred to as the correct term to represent the Malayo-Polynesian region which consists of all Austronesian nations.\n\nThe Nusantara Society in Moscow conducts studies on the Nusantara region's history, culture, languages and politics.\n\n\n"}

It is the oldest and in terms of area covered, largest of Polish industrial regions. Most of the region is located in Lesser Poland Upland, and its historic center lies along the Kamienna river. Primary industrial cities: Kielce, Radom, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Starachowice and Skarżysko-Kamienna.\n\nIn prehistoric times future Old Polish Industrial Region was the area of flint and later iron tools. In Nowa Slupia, remnants of forty five bloomeries were found (5th - 10th century). In the Middle Ages, the region became the center of Polish industry - mining and steel mills. Various kinds of weapons were manufactured here, iron ore, copper and silver were extracted. In the 17th century, first blast furnaces were opened in the villages of Samsonow and Bobrza. By 1782, out of 34 blast furnaces in Poland-Lithuania, as many as 27 were located in Old Polish Industrial Region. Furthermore, the area was a major glass producer of the country. \n\nFirst half of the 19th century was the time of rapid development of the region, due to efforts of the government of Congress Poland, and such persons as Stanislaw Staszic and Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki. Both officials planned construction of a large metallurgical plant along the Kamienna. Those plans, however, were only partially implemented, due to lack of funds. Still, several new plants were opened at that time.\n\nGrowth of Old Polish Industrial Region stopped in the second half of the 19th century, due to two reasons. First, Congress Poland lost its autonomy and became Vistula Land, integral part of the Russian Empire. Furthermore, another industrial center of Lesser Poland, Zaglebie Dabrowskie, began to develop and compete with Old Polish Industrial Region. As a result, several plants had to close down. \n\nThe region recovered in late years of the Second Polish Republic, when Central Industrial Area was envisaged by Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski. Already-existing factories in Kielce, Skarzysko, Radom, Starachowice and Ostrowiec were modernized, new ones were also built. After World War II, industrialization of the area continued, with such plants, as FSC Star.\n\nMajor urban centers of the region are Kielce, Radom, Starachowice, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and Skarżysko-Kamienna, which is an important railroad junction. Names of several villages indicate their industrial past, even though no traces of former plants remain there (Ruda, Kuźnica, Hucisko, Żelaznica, Górniki, Rudniki, Wąglów, Wólka Smolna, Kurzacze).\n"}

Instead, the two faces are coated to provide mirror surfaces. The two opposite transmitting faces are often coated with an antireflection coating to reduce spurious reflections. The fifth face of the prism is not used optically but truncates what would otherwise be an awkward angle joining the two mirrored faces.\n\nA variant of this prism is the roof pentaprism which is commonly used in the viewfinder of single-lens reflex cameras. The camera lens renders an image that is both vertically and laterally reversed, and the reflex mirror re-inverts it leaving an image laterally reversed. In this case, the image needs to be reflected left-to-right as the prism transmits the image formed on the camera's focusing screen. This lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a \"roof\" section, with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90°, which laterally reverses the image back to normal. Reflex cameras with waist-level finders (viewed from above), including many medium format cameras, display a laterally reversed image directly from the focusing screen which is viewed from above.\n\nIn surveying a double pentaprism (two pentaprisms stacked on top of each other) and a plumb-bob are used to stake out right angles, e.g. on a construction site.\n"}
{"id": "11727969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11727969", "title": "Peruvian Amazonia", "text": "Peruvian Amazonia\n\nPeruvian Amazonia () is the area of the Amazon rainforest included within the country of Peru, from east of the Andes to the borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia. This region comprises 60% of the country and is marked by a large degree of biodiversity. Peru has the second-largest portion of the Amazon rainforest after the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nMost Peruvian territory is covered by dense forests on the east side of the Andes, yet only 5% of Peruvians live in this area. More than 60% of Peruvian territory is covered by the Amazon rainforest, more than in any other country.\n\nAccording to the Research Institute of the Peruvian Amazon (\"Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana\", IIAP), the spatial delineation of the Peruvian Amazon is as follows:\n\nThe Peruvian Amazon is traditionally divided into two distinct ecoregions:\n\nThe lowland jungle (in Spanish \"Selva Baja\") is also known as \"Omagua region\", \"Walla\", \"Anti\", Amazonian rainforest or Amazon basin. This ecoregion is the largest of Peru, standing between 80 and 1,000 meters above sea level. It has very warm weather with an average temperature of 28 °C, high relative humidity (over 75%) and yearly rainfall of approximately . Its soils are very heterogeneous, but almost all have river origins. Because of high temperatures and high rainfall, they are poor soils with few nutrients.\n\nThe jungle contains long and powerful rivers such as the Apurimac, Mantaro, Amazon, Urubamba, Ucayali, Huallaga, Marañón, Putumayo, Yavarí, Napo, Pastaza, Madre de Dios, Manu, Purus, and Tigre. The Apurimac River is the source of the Amazon River. The Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve and the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area are within the forest.\n\nThe highland jungle (in Spanish \"Selva Alta\") is also called \"Rupa Rupa region\", \"Andean jungle\", \"ceja de selva\". This ecoregion extends into the eastern foothills of the Andes, between 1,000 and 3,800 m above the sea level. The eastern slopes of the Andes are home to a great variety of fauna and flora because of the different altitudes and climates within the region. Temperatures are warm in the lowlands and cooler in higher altitudes. There are many endemic fauna because of the isolation caused by the rugged terrain of the area.\n\nThe Peruvian Amazon jungle is one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth. As a nation, Peru has the largest number of bird species in the world and the third-largest number of mammals; 44% of bird species and 63% of mammal species inhabit the Peruvian Amazon. Peru also has a very high number of species of butterflies, orchids, and other organisms.\n\nThis table was elaborated by Edwin Jesús Villacorta Monzón, with data obtained among many sources from years 1997, 2001 and 2006.\n\nAlthough it is the largest region of Peru, the Peruvian Amazon is the least populated. It is home to approximately 5% of the country's population. Many indigenous peoples, such as the Aguaruna, Cocama-Cocamilla and the Urarina, inhabit the jungle, some in relative isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nThe primary cities located in the Peruvian Amazon include:\n\n\nOver the last decades illegal logging has become a serious problem in the Peruvian Amazon. In 2012 the World Bank estimated that 80% of Peru’s timber exports are illegally harvested. This uncontrolled deforestation could negatively affect the habitats of indigenous tribes, the Peruvian biodiversity and of course the climate change. Moreover, illegal deforestation might lead to more violent crimes. This has already been demonstrated on 1 September 2014, when four indigenous leaders were murdered, including the famous environmental activist Edwin Chota. These leaders were asking for governmental protection against illegal loggers, after being threatened several times. Partly due to this, illegal loggers are being blamed for the assassination.\n\nIn an attempt to support local incomes in the Amazon, the Peruvian government granted non-transferable contracts to individual farmers to perform small-scale logging activities. Soon however, big logging companies started paying individual loggers for the use of their contracts and established an illegal, large-scale logging industry. In 1992 the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) was founded to guarantee a more sustainable use of national resources. Yet, this institution has never been able to carry out its task due to several reasons. First of all, INRENA lacked sufficient resources compared with the magnitude of their responsibilities. Next to this, corruption was a problem in several layers of the organisation. Moreover, until recently, INRENA was part of the Ministry of Agriculture. This suggests that INRENA was not completely independent; it was housed in an institution that had to safeguard the interest of the agricultural sector, which could be conflicting with INRENA’s objective.\n\nIn 2000 Peru modified the Forestry and Wildlife Law in order to improve the logging sector. In the subsequent years however, the situation in the Peruvian timber industry only deteriorated. To some extent this can be explained by the fact that Brazil illegalised the exports of mahogany (one of the most valuable and endangered types of wood in the world) from 2001 on. This Brazilian ban is likely to have caused the increase in Peruvian mahogany exports. Soon after the ban, international institutions revealed their severe concerns about the state of the Peruvian timber industry. In particular the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), started paying extra attention to Peru as the trade in mahogany falls under CITES’ regulation. Albeit the fact that from then on, one needed special permits for harvesting and exporting any endangered species, the forestry sector was still far from sustainable.\n\nAlthough it is understandable that illegal logging cannot be stopped easily in the Peruvian Amazons (an inaccessible area bigger than Spain), the illegal exportation of timber is supposed to be more difficult; the shipments are huge and there are very few routes from the Amazons to the coast. Nevertheless, until now it has been relatively easy for companies to ship and export illegal timber. Despite the fact that the Peruvian government claims that it does not know anything about the method used by these companies, it is common-knowledge.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) provided a clear picture of this mechanism in their report The Laundering Machine. According to them, the biggest flaw in the Peruvian system for years has been the granting of logging permits: ‘Concessionaires submit for approval lists that do not exist in the real world, and complicit authorities approve the extraction of this non-existent wood’. These permits allow companies to transport almost all sorts of wood (both legal and illegal) out of the country. There are only two ways to stop illegal loggers: catching them in the act, or, in case of controlling a shipment, environmental prosecutors have to prove that the timber does not come from the place written on the permit (which is only possible by going to this place). With not more than a hundred environmental prosecutors in Peru, it is not surprising that both methods are far from effective.\n\nThe international attention levels increased again in 2007, when Peru and the United States (US) agreed on a new Free Trade agreement (FTA), which was implemented in 2009. According to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) the FTA included a number of binding commitments to ensure environmental protection, focussing on the Peruvian forestry sector. Both parties agreed, amongst others, on the following measures: establishing an independent forestry oversight body, penalising those who committed logging crimes, creating new (and a better implementation of existing) laws, developing an anti-corruption plan and the US would provide monetary help. Yet the results are ambiguous. On the one hand proponents claim that the forestry sector experienced significant improvements. Some (small) improvements are indeed visible. With the formation of the Supervisory Body of Forest and Wildlife Resources (OSINFOR), the first promise was met. Next to this, US officials started training Peruvian law enforcement officers, although only on a minor scale.\n\nOn the other hand, the FTA caused a lot of social unrest as indigenous groups expected the FTA to ‘give incentives for further and irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest’. Local communities were not the only ones who criticised the agreement. In 2010 Public Citizen published an article, which stated that, despite all promises, ‘environmental and labour conditions in Peru have deteriorated rapidly since the congressional passage of the FTA’.\n\nNotwithstanding who was right, the FTA has not prevented illegal timber trade between Peru and the US. At least 35% of the Peruvian timber exports to the US between 2008 and 2010, contained illegal wood. This percentage however, only covers the trade in species that are regulated by the CITES. As only very few types of timber fall under this legislation, the real percentage of illegally harvested timber in Peru is assumed to be significantly higher.\n\nIllegal gold mining is rampant among the Madre de Dios Region of Peru, and is extremely harmful to the environment. Individuals are mining more gold each year because of the exponential price hike in this commodity – a 360% surge in the last ten years. This price surge is driving many people who often are not able to attain jobs into the gold mining business because of the great financial gain. With the Interoceanic Highway available, \"30,000 miners are estimated to be in operation without legal permits.\"\n\nMore mercury is being imported into the country than ever before for mining purposes because of the price increase. In mining, mercury is used to “amalgamate gold particles and then burned off – generally without even rudimentary technology”. The import of mercury for this purpose is shown through atmosphere and water pollution, directly impacting human, animal, and plant lives in the area and beyond Much of this contamination is a result of lack of education by the people directly mining the gold in Peru. The harmful impacts of gold mining in Madre De Dios can be seen from space.\n\nOil extraction is a critical threat to the health of Peruvian Amazonia. While the land is potentially oil-rich, there are also many indigenous peoples living within the Amazon rainforest. The Camisea Gas Project on Lot 88 impacts the daily lives of indigenous residents. Project Camisea has numerous economic benefits, including savings of up to $4 billion in energy costs, however the environmental and cultural payoffs are widespread. In 2008, 150,000 square kilometers was set aside for oil drilling in the Western Amazon, and today that number has grown exponentially to over 730,000 square kilometers Direct destruction and deforestation often comes from the creation of access roads for oil and gas extraction. These roads then become catalysts for other illegal industries such as logging and gold mining \n\nThe plot of land where Camisea is located is on one of the most highly prioritized areas for biodiversity and conservation. In addition, these oil extraction projects impact the country through: fish stock decline, deforestation, pollution, disease and death of indigenous people, and roads and migration. The World Wildlife Federation concluded that the government has very little power over these oil sanctions, and there are countless loopholes in the policy, which makes stopping them in Peru extraction extremely difficult. Additionally, only seven percent of the oil blocs in the Western Amazon have been extracted, so there is potential for further illegal exploration in undiscovered areas.\n\n\n"}

Physiological disorders are distinguished from plant diseases caused by pathogens, such as a virus or fungus. While the symptoms of physiological disorders may appear disease-like, they can usually be prevented by altering environmental conditions. However, once a plant shows symptoms of a physiological disorder it is likely that, that season’s growth or yield will be reduced.\n\nDiagnosis of the cause of a physiological disorder (or disease) can be difficult, but there are many web-based guides that may assist with this. Examples are: \"Abiotic plant disorders: Symptoms, signs and solutions\"; \"Georgia Corn Diagnostic Guide\"; \"Diagnosing Plant Problems\" (Kentucky); and \"Diagnosing Plant Problems\" (Virginia).\nSome general tips to diagnosing plant disorders:\n\nFrost and cold are major causes of crop damage to tender plants, although hardy plants can also suffer if new growth is exposed to a hard frost following a period of warm weather. Symptoms will often appear overnight, affecting many types of plants. Leaves and stems may turn black, and buds and flowers may be discoloured, and frosted blooms may not produce fruit. Many annual plants, or plants grown in frost free areas, can suffer from damage when the air temperature drops below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). Tropical plants may begin to experience cold damage when the temperature is 42 to 48 °F (5 to 9 °C), symptoms include wilting of the top of the stems and/or leaves, and blackening or softening of the plant tissue.\n\nFrost or cold damage can be avoided by ensuring that tender plants are properly hardened before planting, and that they are not planted too early in the season, before the risk of frost has passed. Avoid planting susceptible plants in frost pockets, or where they will receive early morning sun. Protect young buds and bloom with horticultural fleece if frost is forecast.\nCold, drying easterly winds can also severely inhibit spring growth even without an actual frost, thus adequate shelter or the use of windbreaks is important.\n\nDrought can cause plants to suffer from water stress and wilt. Adequate irrigation is required during prolonged hot, dry periods. Rather than shallow daily watering, during a drought water should be directed towards the roots, ensuring that the soil is thoroughly soaked two or three times a week. Mulches also help preserve soil moisture and keep roots cool.\n\nHeavy rains, particularly after prolonged dry periods, can also cause roots to split, onion saddleback (splitting at the base), tomatoes split and potatoes to become deformed or hollow. Using mulches or adding organic matter such as leaf mold, compost or well rotted manure to the soil will help to act as a 'buffer' between sudden changes in\nconditions. Water-logging can occur on poorly drained soils, particularly following heavy rains. Plants can become yellow and stunted, and will tend to be more prone to drought and diseases. Improving drainage will help to alleviate this problem.\n\nHail can cause damage to soft skinned fruits, and may also allow brown rot or other fungi to penetrate the plant. Brown spot markings or lines on one side of a mature apple are indicative of a spring hailstorm.\n\nPlants affected by salt stress are able to take water from soil, due to an osmotic imbalance between soil and plant.\n\nPoor growth and a variety of disorders such as leaf discolouration (chlorosis) can be caused by a shortage of one or more plant nutrients. Poor plant uptake of a nutrient from the soil (or other growing medium) may be due to an absolute shortage of that element in the growing medium, or because that element is present in a form that is not available to the plant. The latter can be caused by incorrect pH, shortage of water, poor root growth or an excess of another nutrient. Plant nutrient deficiencies can be avoided or corrected using a variety of approaches including the consultation of experts on-site, the use of soil and plant-tissue testing services, the application of prescription-blend fertilizers, the application of fresh or well-decomposed organic matter, and the use of biological systems such as cover crops, intercropping, improved fallows, ley cropping, permaculture, or crop rotation.\n\nNutrient (or mineral) deficiencies include:\n\n"}

The book focused on the history of European discovery and colonization of the rest of the world, with a particular focus on the achievements of the British Empire. The book was divided into seven chapters:\nThe book was also well furnished with maps, including a series in which areas of the world were progressively revealed from being obscured with brown ink, showing the different areas of the world that Europeans had explored.

However, the text has been sharply criticized in more recent years. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism chose this textbook by name as a bad example, observing its Anglocentric bias; the commission's reviewers found that the book \"devotes 60 per cent of its text to the achievements of British explorers alone and completely ignores the French.\"\n"}

Many of the indices make use of the inverse relationship between red and near-infra red reflectance associated with healthy green vegetation. Since the 1960s scientists have used satellite remote sensing to monitor fluctuation in vegetation at the Earth’s surface. Measurements of vegetation attributes include leaf area index (LAI), percent green cover, chlorophyll content, green biomass and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR).\n\nVegetation Indices (VIs) have been historically classified based on a range of attributes, including the number of spectral bands (2 or greater than 2); the method of calculations (ratio or orthogonal), depending on the required objective; or by their historical development (classified as first generation VIs or second generation VIs). For the sake of comparison of the effectiveness of different VIs, Lyon, Yuan et al. (1998) classified 7 VIs based on their computation methods (Subtraction, Division or Rational Transform). Due to advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology, high-resolution reflectance spectrums are now available, which can be used with traditional multispectral VIs.
