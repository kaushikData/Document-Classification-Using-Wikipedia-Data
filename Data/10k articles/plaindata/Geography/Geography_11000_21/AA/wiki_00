The term is the Middle Persian equivalent to the Greco-Roman \"Albania\". It was known as \"Aghvania\", \"Alvan-k\" in Armenian, and \"Al-ran\" (Arabized form of \"Arran\") in Arabic. \n\nToday, the term Aran is mainly used in Azerbaijan to indicate territories consisting of Mil and Mughan plains (mostly, Beylaqan, Imishli, Saatli, Sabirabad provinces of the Republic of Azerbaijan). It has also been used by Iranian historian Enayatollah Reza to refer to the country of Azerbaijan, freeing the name \"Azerbaijan\" to refer to a region within Iran. (The bulk of the territory of Rep. of Azerbaijan was the historic Shirvan as well as Kuba/Qubbah).\n\nAccording to some legends and ancient sources, such as Movses Kagankatvatsi, (Albanian) \"Arran\" or \"Arhan\" was the name of the legendary founder of Caucasian Albania, who in some versions was son of Noah's son Yafet (Japheth) and also, possibly the eponym of the ancient Caucasian Albanians (\"Aghvan\"), and/or the Iranian tribe known as Alans (Alani). The nearby Araks (Aras) river was known to Ancient Greek geographers as the \"Araxes\", and has a source near from Mount Ararat. James Darmesteter, in his discussion of the geography of the Avesta's \"Vendidad\" I, observes that the 12th century \"Bundahishn\" (29:12) identified the \"Airyana Vaego by the Vanguhi Daitya\" on the northern border of Azerbaijan, and did so \"probably in order that it should be as near as possible to the seat of the Zoroastrian religion yet without losing its supernatural character by the counter-evidence of facts.\" Darmesteter further associated the Vanguhi Daitya river with the Araxes, and compared the name \"Airyana Vaego\" with that of Arran.\n\nAccording to C.E. Bosworth:\n\nIn pre-Islamic times, Caucasian Albania/Arran was a wider concept than that of post-Islamic Arran. Ancient Arran covered all eastern Transcaucasia, which included most of the territory of modern-day Azerbaijan Republic and part of the territory of Dagestan. However, in post-Islamic times the geographic notion of Arran reduced to the territory between the rivers of Kura and Araks.\n\nIn a medieval chronicle \"Ajayib-ad-Dunya\", written in the 13th century by an unknown author, Arran is said to have been 30 parasangs (200 km) in width, and 40 \"farsakhs\" (270 km) in length. All the right bank of the Kura river until it joined with the Aras was attributed to Arran (the left bank of the Kura was known as Shirvan). The boundaries of Arran have shifted throughout history, sometimes encompassing the entire territory of the present day Republic of Azerbaijan, and at other times only parts of the South Caucasus. In some instances Arran was a part of Armenia.\n\nMedieval Islamic geographers gave descriptions of Arran in general, and of its towns, which included Barda, Beylagan, and Ganja, along with others.\n\nFollowing the Arab invasion of Iran, the Arabs invaded the Caucasus in the 8th century and most of the former territory of Caucasian Albania was included under the name of Arran. This region was at times part of the Abbasid Caliphate based on numismatic and historical evidence. Dynasties of Parthian or Persian descent, such as the Mihranids had come to rule the territory during Sassanian times. Its kings were given title \"Arranshah\", and after the Arab invasions, fought against the caliphate from the late 7th to middle 8th centuries.\n\nEarly Muslim ruling dynasties of the time included Rawadids, Sajids, Salarids, Shaddadids, Shirvanshahs, and the Sheki and Tiflis emirates. The principal cities of Arran in early medieval times were Bardha'a (Partav) and Ganja. Bardha'a reached prominence in the 10th century, and was used to house a mint. Bardha'a was sacked by the Rus and Norse several times in the 10th century as result of the Caspian expeditions of the Rus. Bardha'a never recovered after these raids and was replaced as capital by Baylaqan, which in turn was sacked by the Mongols in 1221. After this Ganja rose to prominence and became the central city of the region. The capital of the Shaddadid dynasty, Ganja was considered the \"mother city of Arran\" during their reign.\n\nThe territory of Arran became a part of the Seljuq Empire, followed by the Ildegizid state. It was taken briefly by the Khwarizmid dynasty and then overran by Mongol Hulagu empire in the 13th century. Later, it became a part of Chobanid, Jalayirid, Timurid, and Iranian Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar states which means at least from 1500 until 1828 when Iran signed the \"Treaty of Turkmenchay\" after losing a major battle to the expending Russian Empire and as a result had to sign The Treaty of Turkmenchay (, ) in which it had to concede all the Caucasus territories to Russia.\n\nThe population of Arran consisted of a great variety of peoples. Greek, Roman and Armenian authors provide the names of the some peoples who inhabited the lands between the Kur and Araxes rivers:\n\n\nIn the late 4th century, when the region passed to Caucasian Albania, its population consisted of Armenians and Armenicized aborigines, though many of the latter were still cited as distinct ethnic entities.\n\nIn pre-Islamic times the population of Arran and most of Caucasian Albania had mostly been Christian who belonged to the Church of Caucasian Albania. Under Arabic rule (7th to 9th centuries) a part of the population was Islamicized and adopted Alevism. Muslim chronicles of the 10th century reported that some of the population of Arran spoke al-rānīya, as well as Arabic and Persian languages. Because there is no written evidence, some scholars have presumed al-rānīya to be an Iranian dialect while others have presumed it to be a remnant of a Caucasian Albanian language. The area in which there was Ganja, during the 9th to 12th century named Arran; its urban population spoke mainly in Persian.\n\nAfter the Turkification of the region, the population became Turkic speaking, and thus referred to by Europeans, particularly the Russians, as Tartars. They were much later called Azerbaijanis.\n\nWith the exception of some Uti, the population of Arran which remained Christian, was ultimately absorbed by the Armenians and in part by the Georgians.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "392113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392113", "title": "Caprivi Strip", "text": "Caprivi Strip\n\nCaprivi, or the Caprivi Strip, is a salient of Namibia which is and has been known by various names.\n\nThe salient protrudes eastward for about from the north-eastern corner of Namibia. It is bordered by Botswana to the south, and by Angola and Zambia to the north. Its eastern tip is only about 1 km from the borders of Zimbabwe. Within Namibia, it is divided administratively between Kavango East and Zambezi regions. It is crossed by the Okavango; the Kwando/Chobe river forms part of its border with Botswana; and the Zambezi river forms a part of its border with Zambia. The strip is about wide, and its area is slightly larger than the US state of Maryland.\n\nIts largest settlement is Katima Mulilo, located at the point where the Zambezi river reaches the Strip.\n\n\nInhabitants of the Caprivi Strip speak a number of African languages, mostly members of the Bantu language family, with speakers of Hukwe, a San language, in the northwest of the strip (on the border with Angola. The Bantu languages include Yeyi (or 'Yei' or 'Yeeyi'), Mbukushu, Gciriku (or 'Dciriku'), Fwe, Totela, and Subiya. Perhaps a majority in the Caprivi Strip, especially in Katima Mulilo, speaks Lozi as a \"lingua franca\". Many also speak some English and Afrikaans.\n\nThe area is rich in wildlife and has mineral resources. Of particular interest to the government of Namibia is that it gives access to the Zambezi River and is thereby a potential trading route to Africa's East Coast. However, the vagaries of the river level, various rapids, the presence of Victoria Falls downstream and continued political uncertainty in the region make this use of the Caprivi Strip unlikely, although it may be used for ecotourism in the future.\n\nWithin Namibia the Caprivi Strip provides significant habitat for the critically endangered Wild African Dog, \"Lycaon pictus\". It is a corridor for African elephant moving from Botswana and Namibia into Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. National parks found in the Caprivi Strip are Bwabwata National Park, Mudumu National Park and Nkasa Rupara National Park. Local communities have organised themselves into communal area conservancies and community forests. People work closely with the Namibian Government to jointly manage natural resources through several programmes set up between the Namibian Government and various donors.\n\nCaprivi was named after German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi (in office 1890–1894), who negotiated the acquisition of the land in an 1890 exchange with the United Kingdom. Caprivi arranged for the Caprivi strip to be annexed to German South West Africa in order to give Germany access to the Zambezi River and a route to Africa's east coast, where the colony of German East Africa (now part of Tanzania) was situated. The river later proved unnavigable and inaccessible to the Indian Ocean due to the Victoria Falls. The transfer of territory was a part of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty of 1890, in which Germany gave up its interest in Zanzibar in return for the Caprivi Strip and the island of Heligoland in the North Sea.\n\nIn 1976, the South African administration established the pseudo-independent Eastern Caprivi homeland with its own flag, national anthem, and coat of arms. It remained under direct \"de facto\" control of the South African government in Pretoria until 1980, when its administration was transferred to South Africa's administration in Windhoek.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the Caprivi Strip attracted attention when Namibia and Botswana took a long-standing dispute over its southern boundary to the International Court of Justice. The core of the territorial dispute concerned which channel of the Chobe River was the thalweg, the \"bona fide\" international boundary. This was important, as, depending on the decision, a large island (known as Kasikili or Seddudu, by Namibia and Botswana respectively) would fall into one or the other's national territory. The Botswana government considered the island as an integral part of the Chobe National Park, whereas the Namibian government, and many inhabitants of the eastern Caprivi Strip, held that not only was the island part of the original German–British agreement, but generations of inhabitants had used it for seasonal grazing, for reed-gathering, and as a burial site. In December 1999, the International Court of Justice ruled that the main channel, and hence the international boundary, lay to the north of the island, thus making the island part of Botswana.\n\nThe Caprivi Strip is of politico-strategic military importance. During the Rhodesian Bush War (1965–1979), African National Congress operations against the South African government (1965–1994) and the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), the Strip saw continual military action and multiple incursions by various armed forces using the Strip as a corridor to access other territories.\n\nThe Caprivi conflict involved an armed conflict in Namibia between the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), a rebel group aiming for the secession of the Caprivi Strip led by Mishake Muyongo, and the Namibian government. Its main eruption occurred on 2 August 1999 when the CLA launched an attack in Katima Mulilo, occupying the state-run radio station and attacking a police station, the Wanella border post, and an army base. Namibian armed forces quashed the attempt at secession within a few days.\n\n"}

So they expressed the idea of a union state, asked to use the symbols of the State flag of the Soviet Union, such as the gold hammer and sickle and the red star, as well as maintain the predominance of red color on the flag of the Union republics. National, historical and cultural features of each republic was instructed to express the other colors and the order of their location, as well as the location based on the national ornament. After the competitions for the best projects in the 1949–1954 years of the new flags of the 16 republics were developed and adopted. The authorities in Ukraine and Byelorussia were the first to adopt the flags on July 5, 1950, and December 25, 1951, respectively. All others followed suit between 1952 and 1953 with the last republic, the Russian SFSR, adopted the flag on January 9, 1954. \n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991, only Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Ukraine retained their Soviet republic flags as independent states until the new official flags were adopted in 1992.\n\nTheir final versions prior to re-adoption of the non-Soviet national flags were as follows:\nOther Union Republics and autonomous republics existed within the Soviet Union, mostly using flags on a similar pattern, or the flag of their \"parent\" Union Republic, further defaced.

{"id": "58921789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58921789", "title": "Geology of Greece", "text": "Geology of Greece\n\nThe geology of Greece is highly structurally complex due to its position at the junction between the European and African tectonic plates. \n\nSome of the oldest rocks in Greece are from the Paleozoic and are usually metamorphosed with no fossils. The Rhodope Massif spans the northern mainland, divided into amphibolite schist and gneiss, with comparatively recent granite intrusions from the Oligocene and Miocene. West of the Strymonas River is the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, covering the Chalkidiki Peninsula with thick marble and gneiss, with granite intrusions. \n\nAlpine cycle sedimentary rocks are situated between the European hinterland in the Rhodope Massif and Serbo-Macedonian Massif and northern fore-region of the African plate. External zones include the Paxi Zone, encompassing the islands in the Ionian Sea with dolomitzed limestone from the Jurassic and Cretaceous-Miocene marl and gypsum. The Ionian Zone spans much of western Greece with Triassic evaporites overlain by Jurassic neritic limestones. During the Toarcian, extensive block faulting differentiated the Ionian Basin. Extensional faults were reactivated during the Eocene Alpine orogeny. The Ionian Zone is thrust westward over the Preapulian Zone and overlain by molasse facies.\nThe Gavrovo-Tripolis Zone underlies Crete, the Dodecanese islands and much of the western mainland. Bauxites indicate a dry time in the Eocene and Oligocene flysch unconformably overlies older carbonates. The Peloponnesus and Crete regions of the zone are overthrust on the Plattenkalk unit. Normal faults with four kilometers of displacement are not uncommon although folding is limited—tectonic activity picked up in the Oligocene. \n\nAdditionally, the Olonos-Pindus Zone extends from Montenegro to Rhodes and is a deep allochthon trough, with clastic Triassic sandstone and the Drymos Limestone. \n\nInternal zones span between the Serbo-Macedonian Massif and external zones:\n\n\nThe Axios Zone, also known as the Vardar Zone, represents the closing of the Axios Ocean and separates the Pelagonian zone from the Serbo-Macedonian Massif. Clastic sediments from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic ophiolites and sediments are common. Geologists subdivide it into the calc-schists, granite, diabase, chert and ophiolite of the Paeonias subzone and the acidic volcanic rocks and limestone of the Triassic-Jurassic Paikon subzone (an old island arc). The silicified ophiolites of the Almopias subzone, bordering the Pelagonian zone to the northeast represents an old ocean trench. \n\nNeogene sediment deposited after the Alpine cycle outcrops widely. The Mesohellene Trough, Epirus-Arkanania basin and Cycladic Basin are all examples of molasse basins from the early Miocene. The Ionian Islands basin is part of the Preapulian Zone and may only have had an interruption in sedimentation in the late Miocene into the Pliocene. Most sediments in other Neogene basins are marine, but the Aegean Islands basin is filled with continental sediments. \nAs the molasse basins filled during Burdigalian and Langhian times, the uplift of the Pindus Cordillera caused nappe formations to slide onto metamorphic rocks of the Cyclades. In the Tortonian, arc fracturing brought subsidence of the Cretan Basin. Inland basins preserved numerous mammal fossils such as the Pikermi site north of Athens in continental clay. \nVolcanic activity in the Aegean began in the Neogene and Quaternary. Volcanoes in western Thrace, Limnos and Samothrace are on the edge of the Rhodope Massif, while the Aegean volcanic arc borders the Menderes Massif and Attico-Cycladic Massif. The Neogene Santorini volcanoes erupted in the Holocene, destroying the Mycenaen civilization. Interior basins hold thick lakebed sediments from the Quaternary, indicating oscillation between cold desert conditions and wet interglacials. Travertine springs often preserve more recent fossil assemblages. Near Corinth, brackish Black Sea water invaded during the Middle Pleistocene, although for the most part, the islands and water area of the Aegean did not change the during the ice ages. \n\nHerodotus recognized a bitumen well at Limin Keri on the southern end of Zakynthos Island. Onshore oil exploration began in 1938 and moved offshore in 1970. The Prinos Anticline offshore was found to contain oil under Miocene rocks. \n"}

Green Hill Zone reappears in \"Sonic Forces\", having partially turned to desert due to resource depletion by Eggman's industries.\n\nIn addition, Green Hill appears as a stage in the 2.5D fighting game \"Sonic Battle\", in the tennis video game \"Sega Superstars Tennis\", in the sports video game \"Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\", in the mobile title \"Sonic Dash\", in the crossover adventure game \"Lego Dimensions\", and in the crossover fighting games \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\", \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\", and \"\".\n\nGreen Hill Zone has received consistently positive opinions from critics, particularly for its music. Craig Snyder at \"MakeUseOf\" named the level as one of the five best levels in video games, calling it \"a great way to prepare for what’s to come\". \"Game Informer\"s Tim Turi found the level's music \"catchy\", and Wong ranked it as the thirteenth greatest piece of gaming music from the 16-bit era. In 2010, Sega's community manager, Aaron Webber, returned from a vacation to find his cubicle redecorated to resemble Green Hill; IGN's Levi Buchanan claimed that \"everyone wants to come back to\" this, and Owen Good of Kotaku exclaimed \"I want to work in Green Hill Zone, too!\" Writing for the \"Sabotage Times\", Carl Anka ranked the original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" as having the greatest music of any video game, largely as a result of Green Hill's theme.\n\nCritics have compared levels, particularly first levels, of later \"Sonic\" games to Green Hill. Turi considers Emerald Hill from \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\", Mushroom Hill from \"Sonic & Knuckles\", and Seaside Hill from \"Sonic Heroes\" to fit the same general mold as Green Hill, noting repetition in \"Sonic\" level design and stating that \"gamers have played Green Hill Zone dozens of times.\" However, he has opined that the \"Sonic Generations\" version of the original Green Hill \"trounces them all\" in both its 2D and 3D incarnations. Justin Baker of Nintendo World Report and Skrebels both analogized Windy Hill from \"Sonic Lost World\" to Green Hill, while Carter thought similarly of \"The Legend of Zelda\" downloadable content levels. The decision to include Green Hill in other titles in the series, such as \"Sonic Forces\", has been a source of debate among some fans, who believe that Sega has overused the stage since its debut.\n\nGreen Hill Zone has also been recognized by critics as a classic, well-known video game level. It has been described as \"classic\" by Samit Sarkar of Polygon and by Jim Sterling and Chris Carter of Destructoid. Comparably, Joe Skrebels of \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" called it \"nostalgic\", while Christopher Grant from Joystiq considered it to have a place \"in the center of your retro-gaming shrine\". Kevin Wong of \"Complex\" stated that the game's and level's popularity were such that \"even if you didn't have a Genesis, this was the level you played at the department store while your parents went shopping.\" Andy Kelly from \"Computer and Video Games\" called the Green Hill theme a \"monumental slice of Sega nostalgia\", and GamesRadar writer Justin Towell also referred to it as classic. Anka has summarized that \"Green Hill Zone in the original game has gone down as an instantly recognisable piece of music in pop culture\".\n\nTo mark Sonic's fifteenth anniversary in 2006, Sega released a papercraft version of Green Hill as a PDF on its website. In 2011, not long after the release of \"Sonic Generations\", Sega held a contest inviting gamers to upload YouTube video playthroughs of the game's 3D version of Green Hill completed in less than one minute and fifty seconds; winners were eligible for \"Sonic\" merchandise.\n\n"}

They used several methods to measure latitude, including the height of the Sun above the horizon at midday, measured using a gnōmōn (a word that originally meant an interpreter or judge); the length of the day at the summer solstice, and the elevation of the Sun at winter solstice.\n\nThe Greek Marinus of Tyre (AD 70–130) was the first to assign a latitude and longitude to every place on his maps.\n\nFrom the late 9th century CE, the Arabian Kamal was used in equatorial regions, to measure the height of Polaris above the horizon. This instrument could only be used in latitudes close to the horizon.\n\nThe Mariner's astrolabe which gives the angle of the Sun from the horizon at noon, or the angle of a known star at night, was used from around the 15th to the 17th century. The observation of the Sun instead of Polaris enabled the measurement of latitude in the Southern hemisphere but required the use of solar declination tables. One of the most famous tables, but certainly not the first one, was published in 1496 by the Castilian Jew Abraham Zacut, then exiled in Portugal.\n\nThe Backstaff, which measures the length of a shadow, was used from the 16th century and saw iterative improvements such as the Davis quadrant. These were in use in parallel with the octant and early sextant; the sextant eventually displaced the others, and is still used to this day. The sextant was mentioned by Isaac Newton (1643–1727) in his unpublished writings, and first implemented about 1730 by John Hadley (1682–1744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704–1749).\n"}

Some of these were later found to be younger, of Carboniferous-Pennsylvanian age. In the Las Lozas valley, this younger unit is thick and dominated by rhyolite. It lies beneath Paleozoic sediments and above a metamorphic basement. This volcanic activity occurred concurrently with crustal extension, which may be associated either with the Famatinian orogeny, the Achalian orogeny or a separate event.\n\nThe Las Lozas unit has been dated at 320 million years, with previous dates for other units being between 336-298 million years. The rocks erupted during this volcanic episode were formed from much older crust of Cryogenian age, based on isotope dating of zircons. This older crust may have formed when Rodinia broke up.\n\nThe structure of the deposits indicates that explosive eruptions involving lava domes were the principal sources of the Las Lozas volcanic deposits. Also present basalts formed lava flows, which may have originated from the lava domes as well. The activity occurred at high temperatures and was issued by fissure vents.\n"}

The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced species are included in the total count for Macau.\n\nThe following tag has been used to highlight introduced species. The commonly occurring native species are untagged.\n\n\nOrder: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae\n\nGrebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

The avifauna of Saint Helena Island include a total of 68 species. Only one endemic species survives today, the Saint Helena plover. Several more endemics are extinct and known only from subfossil remains: the Saint Helena petrel, Olson's petrel, Saint Helena shearwater, Saint Helena crake, Saint Helena rail, Saint Helena dove, Saint Helena cuckoo and Saint Helena hoopoe. At least five non-endemics have been extirpated from Saint Helena but still occur elsewhere. Nine species have been introduced by humans and formed established breeding populations while many more species were introduced in the past but failed to become established. Of these, 43 species are rare or accidental visitors.\n\nThis list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of \"The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World\", 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Saint Helena.\n\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae\n\nThe albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus \"Diomedea\" have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae\n\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae\n\nThe austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae\n\n\nOrder: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae\n\nTropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae\n\nThe sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae\n\nFrigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\n\n\nOrder: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae\n\nThe family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.\n\n\nOrder: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae\n\nStorks are large, long-legged, long-necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory.\n\n\nOrder: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae\n\nFalconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey. They differ from hawks, eagles and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae\n\nThe Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds which consists of quails, partridges, snowcocks, francolins, spurfowls, tragopans, monals, pheasants, peafowls and jungle fowls.

Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae\n\nThe family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae\n\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Chionididae\n\nThe sheathbills are scavengers of the Antarctic regions. They have white plumage and look plump and dove-like but are believed to be similar to the ancestors of the modern gulls and terns.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae\n\nThe family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.\n\n\nOrder: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae\n\nLaridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years.\n\n\nOrder: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae\n\nPigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Hirundinidae\n\nThe family Hirundinidae is adapted to aerial feeding. They have a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings and a short bill with a wide gape. The feet are adapted to perching rather than walking, and the front toes are partially joined at the base.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Sturnidae\n\nStarlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds. Their flight is strong and direct and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country. They eat insects and fruit. Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Ploceidae\n\nThe weavers are small passerine birds related to the finches. They are seed-eating birds with rounded conical bills. The males of many species are brightly coloured, usually in red or yellow and black, some species show variation in colour only in the breeding season.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Estrildidae\n\nThe estrildid finches are small passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They are gregarious and often colonial seed eaters with short thick but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but have wide variation in plumage colours and patterns.\n\n\nOrder: PasseriformesFamily: Fringillidae\n\nFinches are seed-eating passerine birds, that are small to moderately large and have a strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large.

Herod the Great's kingdom was bequeathed to four heirs, of which Herod Antipas received both Perea and Galilee. He dedicated the city Livias in the north of the Dead Sea. In 39 CE, Perea and Galilee were transferred from disfavoured Antipas to Agrippa I by Caligula. With his death in 44 CE, Agrippa's merged territory was made province again, including Judaea and for the first time, Perea. From that time Perea was part of the shifting Roman provinces to its west: Judaea, and later Syria Palaestina, Palaestina and Palaestina Prima. Attested mostly in Josephus' books, the term was in rarer use in the late Roman period. It appears in Eusebius' Greek language geographical work, \"Onomasticon\", but in the Latin translation by Jerome, \"Transjordan\" is used.\n\nGadara of Perea (identified as Tell Jadur near Al-Salt ) was the chief city or metropolis of Perea (not to be confused with Gadara of the Decapolis−a Hellenistic city). Following the Roman conquest of Judea led by Pompey in 63 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts of legal and religious councils known as Sanhedrin and based at Jerusalem, Jericho, Sepphoris (Galilee), Amathus (Perea) and Gadara (Perea—Al-Salt or Decapolis—Umm Qais).\n\n['Greater Judea' or 'Provincia Iudaea', incorporates Samaria and Idumea into an expanded territory.] The part of Judaea adjoining Syria is called Galilee, and that next to Arabia and Egypt Peraea. Peraea is covered with rugged mountains, and is separated from the other parts of Judaea by the river Jordan (in the original Latin: \"Supra Idumaeam et Samariam Iudaea longe lateque funditur. pars eius Syriae iuncta Galilaea vocatur, Arabiae vero et Aegypto proxima Peraea, asperis dispersa montibus et a ceteris Iudaeis Iordane amne discreta.\")\n\nPeraea ...much larger indeed [than Galilee], is generally desert and rugged, and too wild for the growth of delicate fruits. In some parts, however the soil is loamy and prolific, and trees of various kinds cover the plains ; but the olive-tree, the vine, and the palm tree, are those principally cultivated. It is also sufficiently irrigated by mountain streams ; and (should these in the dog-days fail) by ever flowing springs. In length, it extends from Machaerus to Pella : in breadth, from Philadelphia to the Jordan : its northern districts being bounded, as we have already said, by Pella ; and those on the west, by the river. The land of Moab forms its southern limit ; while Arabia and Silbonitis, with Philadelphia and Gerasa, constitute its eastern boundary.\n\nPtolemy does not use the term Perea in his \"Geography\", but rather the periphrasis \"across the Jordan\". And he enumerates the \"Perean\" cities; Cosmas, Libias, Callirhoe, Gazorus, Epicaeros in this district.\n\nPerea was the area inhabited by the Israelite Tribes Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh. New Testament commentators speak of Jesus' \"Perean Ministry\", beginning with his departure from Galilee (Matt 19:1; Mark 10:1) and ending with the anointing by Mary in Bethany (Matt 26:6) or his journey towards Jerusalem commencing from Mark 10:32.\n\nThe Christian Armenians who were deported from Armenia and forcibly settled in the New Julfa/Isfahan region of Iran named a major village \"Perea\" in honor of the important significance of Perea as the resting place of John the Baptist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39984881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39984881", "title": "Phytogeomorphology", "text": "Phytogeomorphology\n\nPhytogeomorphology is the study of how terrain features affect plant growth. It was the subject of a treatise by Howard and Mitchell in 1985, who were considering the growth and varietal temporal and spatial variability found in forests, but recognized that their work also had application to farming, and the relatively new science (at that time) of precision agriculture. The premise of Howard and Mitchell is that landforms, or features of the land's 3D topography significantly affect how and where plants (or trees in their case) grow. Since that time, the ability to map and classify landform shapes and features has increased greatly. The advent of GPS has made it possible to map almost any variable one might wish to measure. Thus, a very increased awareness of the spatial variability of the environment that plants grow in has arisen. The development of technology like airborne LiDAR has enabled the detailed measurement of landform features to better than sub-meter, and when combined with RTK-GPS (accuracies to 1mm) enables the creation of very accurate maps of where these features are. Comparison of these landform maps with mapping of variables related to crop or plant growth show a strong correlation (see below for examples and references for precision agriculture).\n\nWhile phytogeomorphology is a broad term that applies to the relationship between plants and terrain attributes in general (see Howard et al., (1985)), it is also very applicable to the aspect of precision agriculture that studies crop growth temporal and spatial variability within farm fields. There is already a volume of work, although they don't use the term phytogeomorphology specifically, that considers farm field terrain attributes as affecting crop yield and growth, Moore et al. (1991) provide an early overview of the application of terrain features to precision agriculture, but one of the earliest references to this phenomenon in farming is that of Whittaker in 1967. More recent work includes a six-year study of temporal and spatial yield stability over 11 years (Kaspar et al., (2003), and references therein), and a detailed study of the same on a small patch farm in Portugal (and references therein). This variability can be exploited to produce higher yields and reduce the environmental impact of farming - consequently returning a higher profit to the farmer in terms of higher overall yields and lesser amounts of inputs. The new science of Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture which is addressing the need for higher yields from existing fields can be fulfilled by some of the practical applications of phytogeomorphology applied to precision agriculture.\n\nWork in this area has been happening for some years (see Reuter et al., (2005), Marquas de Silva et al., (2008), and especially Moore et al., (1991)), but it is slow and sometimes tedious work that necessarily involves multiple years of data, very specialized software tools, and long compute times to produce the resulting maps.\n\nTypically, the objective of precision agriculture is to divide the farm field into distinct management zones based on yield performance at each point in the field. 'Variable rate technology' is a relatively new term in farming technology that refers to spreaders, seeders, sprayers, etc. that are able to adjust their rates of flow on the fly. The idea is to create a 'recipe map' for variable rate farm machinery to deliver the exact quantity of amendments required at that location (within that zone of the field). The literature is divided on how to properly define management zones.\n\nIn the geomorphological approach to defining management zones it is found that topography aids in at least partially defining how much yield comes from which part of the field. This is true in fields where there are permanently limiting characteristics to parts of the field, but not true in fields where the growth potential is the same all over the field (Blackmore et al., (2003)). It can be shown that an index map of yield (shows areas of consistent over-performance of yield and areas of consistent under-performance) correlates well with a landform classification map (personal communication, Aspinall (2011)). Landforms can be classified a number of ways, but the simplest to use software tool is LandMapR (MacMillan (2003)). An early version of the LandMapR software is available through the Opengeomorphometry project hosted under the Google Code project.\n\n"}

Plants are planted in pots that will accommodate their point-of-sale size, and those pots are placed into slightly larger pots planted in a field. These pots are usually planted in long rows in large fields. The larger pots are usually connected to a central irrigation system, and often fertilized through this system as well. When the plants have grown to their point-of-sale size, they can be removed in their pots and sold immediately. The larger pots (also called socket pots) remain in the field to be reused. This system allows growers to offset labor costs associated with planting and re-planting in the field with a significant initial investment.\n"}

Apartment prices in Gangnam are the highest in South Korea, according to a Kookmin Bank analysis on apartment prices in the seven areas where prices have soared. Songpa-gu and Seocho-gu come second and third respectively followed by Cheongdam-dong, all in Seoul. Many multinational corporations are located in the Gangnam (강남) area.\n\nIt is situated within walking distance of Bukhansan National Park, it boasts fresh air and scenic beauty. Many citizens of Seoul consider the Pyeongchang-dong district in Jongno-gu as one of the wealthiest neighborhoods. The area is lined with two- or three-story houses with a fairytale gable roof, a symbol of upscale homes in Korean society.\n\nA hilly road leading to Bukak Park Hotel on Segumjung road, and Pyeongchang-dong (평창동) is on the left, across the Olympia Hotel Seoul. The road is quiet and tranquil. A few cars are parked on the roadsides lined with houses and buildings. Newcomers, as well as those with an aesthetic sense for architecture, can easily feel a distinct atmosphere because of the calmness, artistic vibes, something which is missing from hectic city life.\n\nHannam-dong (한남동) is the United Nations Village vicinity and contains residences of several high-ranking Korean officials and many foreign ambassadors. The Itaewon (이태원) area, close to the Yongsan Garrison of United States Forces Korea, is dotted with apartments, villas and large houses with gardens.\n\nThe big advantage of living in Seongbuk-dong (성북동) is its beautiful surroundings and cleaner atmosphere, as the hilly area is located near the wooded Mt. Bukhan.\n\nYeouido (여의도) is a large island within Seoul, and the center of Seoul's business district. Its 8.4 square kilometers are home to some 30,988 people. The island is located in the Yeongdeungpo-gu district of Seoul, and largely corresponds to the precinct of Yeoui-dong. Lying on the south edge of the Han River, it contains the National Assembly of South Korea, the Yoido Full Gospel Church, and many office buildings including the 63 Building and the headquarters of LG, and other chaebol.\n\nBundang (분당) is the southernmost district of Seongnam, South Korea. It is considered to be the thriving, beating heart of modern-day Seongnam. In the early 1990s, the Bundang area became a planned community as a response to alleviating the excessive demand for apartments in the similarly affluent, but much older Gangnam district area. Many of Bundang's early residents actually hailed from the Gangnam area, thereby distinguishing Bundang as an affluent burrough in much the same manner as Gangnam. Before this period of expansion however, there was mostly farmland in this area. There are still a few farms in the Bundang area, particularly in the Pangyo area. As the demand for more housing continues, Bundang is expected to continue expanding.\n\nIlsan (일산) is the name of two districts (West and East) in Goyang, Gyeonggi-do. It is more organized and planned than the rest of the city, Goyang (Deogyang-gu), and its residents are generally more affluent. Ilsan is located northwest of Seoul. Like other satellite cities such as Bundang and Pyeongchon, Ilsan was planned in order to alleviate housing shortages in the city of Seoul. Ilsan has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 15 years, usually drawing in younger generations of upper middle-class Koreans.\n\nPangyo (판교) is planned for alleviating the excessive demand for apartments in Gangnam and Bundang.\n\nWhen comparing the rental deposits or \"jeonse\" with the apartment price, the ratio was the lowest for Gangnam apartments. The jeonse to house price ratio is often used as a tool to gauge whether or not the house price is inflated.\n\nThis unique way of renting a house is called \"jeonse\"; a renter makes a lump-sum deposit on a rental space instead of paying monthly rent, at anywhere from 50 to 100% of the market value, and gets back the whole deposit when the rent contract ends. The home-owner is free to invest the deposit as wanted, as long as the same amount of money is returned to the tenant at the end of the contract.\n\nSince the \"jeonse\" price reflects the actual demand of people who reside in the area, the gap between rental deposits for \"jeonse\" and the apartment sales price means there might be an economic bubble in the apartment price.\n\nDepending on the area, \"jeonse\" prices can range as much as 80% of the home's sale price. The expensive Gangnam area's \"jeonse\" is about 30% of the sales price because those properties are so expensive.\n\n"}

Under the patronage of King William IV it later became known as The Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and was granted its Royal Charter under Queen Victoria in 1859.\n\nFrom 1830 to 1840 the RGS met in the rooms of the Horticultural Society in Regent Street, London and from 1854 -1870 at 15 Whitehall Place, London. In 1870, the Society finally found a home when it moved to 1 Savile Row, London – an address that quickly became associated with adventure and travel.\n\nThe Society also used a lecture theatre in Burlington Gardens, London which was lent to it by the Civil Service Commission. However, the arrangements were thought to be rather cramped and squalid.\n\nA new impetus was given to the Society's affairs in 1911, with the election of Earl Curzon, the former Viceroy of India, as the Society's President (1911–1914). The premises in Savile Row were sold and the present site, Lowther Lodge in Kensington Gore, was purchased for £100,000 and opened for use in April 1913. In the same year the Society's ban on women was lifted.\n\nLowther Lodge was built in 1874 for the Hon William Lowther by Norman Shaw, one of the most outstanding domestic architects of his day. Extensions to the east wing were added in 1929, and included the New Map Room and the 750 seat Lecture Theatre. The extension was formally opened by HRH the Duke of York (later King George VI) at the Centenary Celebrations on 21 October 1930.\n\nThe history of the Society was closely allied for many of its earlier years with 'colonial' exploration in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the polar regions, and central Asia especially.\n\nIt has been a key associate and supporter of many notable explorers and expeditions, including those of Darwin, Livingstone, Stanley, Scott, Shackleton, Hunt and Hillary.\n\nThe early history of the Society is inter-linked with the history of British Geography, exploration and\ndiscovery. Information, maps, charts and knowledge gathered on expeditions was sent to the RGS, making up its now unique geographical collections. The Society published its first journal in 1831 and from 1855, accounts of meetings and other matters were published in the Society Proceedings. In 1893, this was replaced by \"The Geographical Journal\" which is still published today.\n\nThe Society was also pivotal in establishing Geography as a teaching and research discipline in British universities, and funded the first Geography positions in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\nWith the advent of a more systematic study of geography, the Institute of British Geographers (IBG) was formed in 1933, by some academic Society fellows, including Andrew Charles O'Dell, as a sister body to the Society. Its activities included\norganising conferences, field trips, seminars and specialist research groups and publishing the journal, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers. The RGS and IBG co-existed for 60 years until 1992 when a merger was discussed. In 1994, members were balloted and the merger agreed. In January 1995, the new Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) was formed.\n\nThe Society also works together with other existing bodies serving the geographical community, in particular the Geographical Association and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society.\n\nIn 2004, The Society's historical Collections relating to scientific exploration and research, which are of national and international importance, were opened to the public for the first time. In the same year, a new category of membership was introduced to widen access for people with a general interest in geography. The new Foyle Reading Room and glass Pavilion exhibition space were also opened to the public in 2004 – unlocking the Society intellectually, visually and physically for the 21st century. For example, in 2012 the RGS held an exhibition, in the glass Pavilion, of photographs taken by Herbert Ponting on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's expedition to the South Pole in 1912.\n\nThe society is governed by its board of trustees called the council, which is chaired by its president. The members of council and the president are elected from its fellowship. The council consists of 36 members, 22 of which are elected by fellows and serve for a three-year term. In addition to the elected trustees, there are honorary members (who include the Duke of Kent as honorary president) who sit on the council.\n\nThe society has five specialist committees that it derives advice from\n\n\nThere are four categories of individual membership:\n\nAnyone with an interest in geography is eligible to apply to become a member of the RGS-IBG.\n\nPeople aged between 14 and 24 currently studying, a recent graduate of geography or a related subject.\n\nIs open to anyone who is a postgraduate student in Geography or an allied subject at a United Kingdom university.\n\nFellows of the Society must either be proposed and seconded by an existing fellow or an individual may submit evidence of his or her own work and academic publications in the field of geography and closely related subjects such as international development and climate change. Applicants must be of at least 21 years of age and provide evidence of a body of relevant work; alternatively, a previous five-year commitment at the regular member level (less, at the council's discretion) is also considered for eligibility. Fellows may use the post-nominal designation \"FRGS\" after their names.\n\nSince 2002 the society has been granted the power to award the status of chartered geographer. The status of can be obtained only by those who have a degree in geography or related subject and at least 6 years' geographical experience, or 15 years' geographical work experience for those without a degree. Being awarded the status allows the use of the post-nominal letters \"CGeog\".\n\nChartered geographer (teacher) is a professional accreditation available to teachers who can demonstrate competence, experience and professionalism in the use of geographical knowledge or skills in and out of the classroom, and who are committed to maintaining their professional standards through ongoing continuing professional development (CPD).\n\nThe Society's Research and Study Groups bring together active researchers and professional geographers in particular areas of geography. There are 27 active research groups, with each group organising their own seminars, conferences, workshops and other activities.\n\nThe society also presents many awards to geographers that have contributed to the advancement of geography.\n\nThe most prestigious of these awards are the Gold Medals (Founder's Medal 1830 and the Patron's Medal 1838). The award is given for \"the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery\", and are approved by Queen Elizabeth II. The awards originated as an annual gift of fifty guineas from King William IV, first made in 1831, \"to constitute a premium for the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery\". The Society decided in 1839 to change this monetary award into two gold medals: Founder’s Medal and the Patron’s. The award has been given to notable geographers including David Livingstone (1855), Nain Singh Rawat (1876), Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen (1878), Alfred Russel Wallace (1892), and Frederick Courtney Selous (1893) to more recent winners including Percy Harrison Fawcett (1916), Professor William Morris Davis (1919), Sir Halford John Mackinder (1945), Professor L. Dudley Stamp (1949), Professor Richard Chorley (1987) and Professor David Harvey (1995). In 2004 Harish Kapadia was awarded the Patron's Medal for contributions to geographical discovery and mountaineering in the Himalayas, making him the second Indian to receive the award in its history. In 2005 the Founder's Medal was awarded to Professor Sir Nicholas Shackleton for his research in the field of Quaternary Palaeoclimatology and the Patron's Medal was awarded to Professor Jean Malaurie for a lifelong study of the Arctic and its people. In 1902 they awarded khan Bahadur Sher Jang a Sword of Honour (the Black Memorial) in recognition of his valuable services to geography\n\nIn total the society awards 17 medals and awards including Honorary Membership and Fellowships. Some of the other awards given by the Society include:\n\nThe Society's Collections consist of over two million documents, maps, photographs, paintings, periodicals, artefacts and books, and span 500 years of geography, travel and exploration. The Society preserves the Collections for the benefit of future generations, while providing public access and promoting Collections-related educational programmes for schools and lifelong learners. The Foyle Reading Room acts as a consultation space for using the Society's collections, and hosts showcases and workshops as well as the \"Be Inspired\" series of talks.\n\nThe artefacts collection includes over a thousand items brought to the Society, consisting mainly of cultural objects from around the world, ranging from Inuit boots (from Canadian Arctic) to ceremonial leopard's claws (from the then Belgian Congo), paraphernalia of exploration, for example oxygen sets used in the various attempts on Everest, and personal items belonging to explorers, such as Shackleton's Burberry helmet. Artefacts from the collection have been loaned to exhibitions around the world and are in continual demand.\n\nThe library collection holds over 150,000 bound volumes which date primarily from the foundation of the Society in 1830 onwards, and focus on the history and geography of places worldwide. Example volumes include information on European migration, a 19th-century guidebook to Berlin, and David Livingstone's account of his search for the source of the Nile. It currently receives around 800 journal titles, as well as many more journal titles that are either not currently subscribed to, or have ceased publication, allowing Society members access to the latest geographical academic literature in addition to the journals published by the RGS-IBG itself.\n\nThe RGS-IBG houses a collection of 4,500 expedition reports. These documents contain details of the achievements and research results of expeditions to almost every country of the world. The catalogue of these reports, and over 8,500 planned and past expeditions, is held on a database which provides contact with a wide variety of sporting, scientific and youth expeditions from 1965 to the present day.\n\nThe Society holds one of the largest private map collections in the world which is continuously increasing. It includes one million sheets of maps and charts, 3000 atlases, 40 globes and 1000 gazetteers. The earliest printed item in the Collection dates back to 1482. The RGS-IBG also holds manuscript materials from the mid sixteenth century onwards, aerial photography from 1919 and contemporary satellite images.\n\nThe Manuscript archive collection consists of material arising out of the conduct of Society business and manuscripts relating to persons or subjects of special interest. The document collection includes a few papers from before the Society's foundation in 1830, and is particularly useful to biographers of nineteenth and early twentieth century travellers and geographers, as well as research into the development of geographical knowledge and the historical development of geography.\n\nSince 1994, the Society has recorded the majority of its Monday night lectures – Society members and Fellows can watch selected lectures from 2006 onwards online.\n\nThe Society's Picture Library holds over half a million photographs, artworks, negatives, lantern slides and albums dating from around 1830. Historic images range from the Antarctic adventures of Scott and Shackleton to the pioneering journeys of Livingstone, Baker, Speke and Burton.\n\nAn important way in which the RGS-IBG develops new knowledge and advances geographical science is by providing funding for geographical research and scientific expeditions. The Society offers a number of grants to researchers, students, teachers and independent travellers. More than 70 projects are supported each year and in excess of £180,000 is awarded annually. Research has been conducted in more than 120 countries, from Namibia to Brazil to Greenland.\n\nEvery year the RGS-IBG helps teams of students and researchers to get into the field with Geographical Fieldwork Grants, the Society's longest running grant scheme. The newest initiative is the RGS-IBG International Field Centre Grants, for work in international field centres in developing nations. Independent travel grants support geographical expeditions.\n\nEach year, the Society supports over 50 student fieldwork projects, from PhD students collecting data for their dissertation to groups of undergraduates looking to get out into the field for the first time. Grants are available for both human and physical geography projects, in any area of the world.\n\nThe Society supports a range of field and desk-based research by academic geographers, from established researchers undertaking fieldwork to early career academics working on smaller projects. The RGS-IBG also supports academics attending geographical conferences around the world. Some awards focus on particular geographical regions or topics, with others open to any aspect of the discipline.\n\nThe Society supports innovation in teaching geography at secondary and higher education level, offering several awards for school teachers to work alongside researchers in geographical research, so to develop educational resources for the classroom, and to create teaching materials.\n\nThe Royal Geographical Society (with IBG)'s scholarly publications provide an outlet and support for the dissemination of research across the breadth of the discipline. In 2012, three main journals alone were accessed online internationally over 1.3 million times.\n\n\"Area\" has an annual prize for new researchers.\n\nA new open access journal to be launched this year.\n\nFocusing on public debates, policy-oriented agendas and notions of 'relevance' the long-running \"GJ\" has international reach.\n\nOne of the international journals of geographical research.\n\nDeveloped in association with the Royal Meteorological Society and Wiley-Blackwell, this review journal provides an important new encyclopaedic reference for climate change scholarship and research.\n\n21st Century Challenges is the Society's discussion series that aims to improve public understanding of, and engagement with, some of the big issues likely to affect our lives and society in the coming years. The talks are held at the Society's headquarters in South Kensington, London, with all talks available to watch online along with additional information.\nDiscovering Britain is a website featuring a series of self-led geographical walks that help explain the stories behind the UK's built and natural landscapes. Each walk explores a particular landscape, finding out about the way in which the forces of nature, people, events and the economy have created and shaped the area. There are now more than 120 walks on the Discovering Britain website, covering all regions of the United Kingdom. Walks are themed according to the landscape in which they are located, including built, prehistoric, historic, working, hidden and changing landscapes. Walks also look at people in the landscape, and shaping, preserving and exploiting the landscape.\n\nHidden Journeys is a public engagement project of the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) that started in 2010. The Hidden Journeys website combines images, stories and maps (many from the Society's geographical collections) into a series of interactive guides of popular flight paths, enabling people to explore the incredible places they fly over and might see from the air. Since launching, online guides have been published for more than 25 flight paths, including London to Johannesburg, New York City to Los Angeles, Sydney to Singapore, Madrid to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe Hidden Journeys project is also integrating its content with the moving maps aboard airliners, as a new form of in-flight entertainment (IFE) that has been termed geo-entertainment or geotainment.\n\nIn December 2013, Singapore Airlines began a trial of an enhanced moving map that featured Hidden Journeys content. Developed in partnership between Hidden Journeys and the IFE software company Airborne Interactive, the enhanced map is available for the Singapore-London route on the airline's brand new Boeing 777-300ER (flight number SQ308 and SQ319), and features a range of geographical facts and highlights, photography and maps, all curated by the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG). Information is delivered in real time, with content changing as the flight progresses, so for example, while a passenger is passing over the United Kingdom, they'll be met with a pop-up that explains the origins and importance of the English Channel.\n\nThe RGS-IBG education department offers courses, resources, accreditation, grants, awards and school membership, all for the benefit of teachers, students and parents. It also runs the Geography Ambassador scheme.\n\nThe Society produces cases studies, lesson plans and activity ideas for an all levels of learning, from KS1 up to post-GCSE. The Geography in the News website is available for Schools Members and Young Geographers. It has more than 300 topical case studies. Many of the Society's other resources are free to use.\n\nThe Geography Ambassadors scheme recruits, trains and supports volunteer undergraduate, postgraduate and graduate geographers from universities and business. Geography Ambassadors deliver lively, activity-based sessions at schools and they engage with more than 30,000 pupils each year. The scheme is aimed at introducing students to the benefits of studying geography beyond a compulsory level in schools, but also into higher education and employment.\n\nGeographical is the official monthly magazine of the Society, and has been published continuously since 1935. The magazine contains illustrated articles on people, places, adventure, travel, and environmental issues, as well as summarising the latest academic research and discoveries in geography. \"Geographical\" also reports news of the Society's latest work and activities to members and the public.\n\n\n"}

It is most famous for its beach located west of Alexandria and some west of Al Alamein. This desert and beach area is located some east of Mersa Matruh and is often a resting point on trips from Alexandria to the Siwa Oasis and to Matruh.\n\nSidi Abdel Rahman is in the Egyptian Western Desert on a bay of the Mediterranean Sea, has a beautiful beach, and is a great place to rest. It is where Mohamed Ibrahim Kamel, Sadat's Foreign Minister, went to rest with his family around August 9, 1978, prior to the historic Camp David Accords.\n\nWhile it is a beautiful place on the Mediterranean Coast, there is the matter of landmines. Estimates have never been accurate but it is well-known and documented that there are a large number of unexploded landmines which have caused human casualties and hindered development in the area, over the years. These landmines date back to World War II and Egypt has not had the capacity to resolve the situation. Specifically \"where\" the landmines are located has not been well-documented, only that they are in the Western desert region including in Sidi Abdel Rahman.\n\nSidi Abdel Rahman is near the site of the famous Battle of El Alamein of World War II in 1942. Mausoleums and a cemetery for the Allies is nearby with at least ninety-nine soldiers laid to rest there. The unmarked remains of thousands of other German soldiers are in that cemetery, as well. On September 30, 1942, the settlement was the site of the death of German \"Luftwaffe\" ace Hans-Joachim Marseille, who claimed an unrivaled total of 158 aircraft destroyed against the Allies.\n\nSidi Abdel Rahman was just a \"modest local resort\". The Gulf of Sidi Abdel Rahman on the Mediterranean including the Al Alamein Hotel were auctioned off by the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels (EGOTH) in 2006, and Emaar Egypt, a subsidiary of Emaar Dubai won the rights to develop the area. The revenue received from the sale was to be used for upgrading historical Egyptian hotels, according to the Minister of Investment Mahmoud Mohieldin involved in the deal.\n\nThe developer, with deep pockets, who purchased Sidi Abdel Rahman proposed to develop a year-round city at a hefty cost of 1.74 billion. As promised during the auction bidding, Emaar immediately built a large resort called Marassi Resort and it is from Al Alamain International Airport. DJ Bob Sinclair performed in August, 2008 at Marassi. Emaar Egypt's initial public offering in Egypt in 2015 was the largest IPO in Egypt, since 2007.\n\n"}

Tujoh, is the westernmost point of Brunei. It is located in the Belait district. The name of the area is derived from two Bruneian Malay words - \"Sungai\", which means river or stream, and \"Tujoh\" or the number seven. Literally, Sungai Tujoh is translated as the \"Seventh River\" or \"Seventh Stream\" in English.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes referred to as \"Kampong Sungai Tujoh\", there is no permanent settlement in the area. There is a custom and excise and immigration post at Sungai Tujoh, staffed by 46 immigration officers, as well as a police control post whose function is to monitor the country's border, to safeguard the security of the country, and to prevent crime.\n\nSungai Tujoh is located at the westernmost point in Brunei, in the Belait district, and lies across the border from Kampong Rentis in the Malaysian state of Sarawak. The area is bounded by the border with Malaysia on the west and south side, the South China Sea to the north and the Sungai Enam area to the east.\n\nIt is one of the four land crossing points from Brunei to Sarawak and the only one in the Belait district. The other 3 are Kuala Lurah in the Brunei-Muara district to Limbang and the Puni and Labu Immigration post in the Temburong district to Limbang and Terusan respectively.\n\nThe Sungai Tujoh area has been long claimed by the sultan of Brunei to constitute a part of the sultanate. It was divided in 1882, when the then sultan ceded the basin of the Baram to the White Rajah of Sarawak, an area of some , on condition of a perpetual annual payment of 6000 dollars.\n\nThe border was delineated in 1958 by the United Kingdom who then had sovereignty over the colony of Sarawak and was responsible for the external relations of the protectorate of Brunei. An immigration post was built in the 1960s to control the movement of goods and people between Miri and points west in Sarawak with Brunei. It has been continually upgraded since then, with the latest upgrade being made just prior to the opening of the ASEAN Bridge across the Baram River.\n\nThe frequent traveller's card (FTC) was first implemented in 2005 at Sungai Tujoh. This enables residents from both countries to use their Mykad/Smart IC as a legal document for travel between the two countries instead of an international passport. As at December 2013 the FTC is no longer accepted. \n\nThe main roads linking the ferry crossing towards the Malaysian border (11 kilometers) and towards Rasau bridge are surfaced.\n\nThere is a scheduled bus service that runs from Kuala Belait and terminates at the immigration post at Sungai Tujoh. Passengers have to clear customs and immigration on foot and take a separate bus to Miri.\n"}

He sold 140 of the stands in the decade 1830-40 and his design was soon imitated by others.\n\nOlder surveying tripods had slightly different features compared to modern ones. For example, on some older tripods, the instrument had its own footplate and did not need to move laterally relative to the tripod head. For this reason, the head of the tripod was not a flat footplate but was simply a large diameter fitting. Threads on the outside of the head engaged threads on the instrument's footplate. No other mounting screw was used.\n\nFixed length legs were also seen on older instruments. Instrument height was adjusted by changing the angle of the legs. Widely spaced tripod feet resulted in a lower instrument while closely spaced legs raised the instrument. This was considerably less convenient than having variable length legs.\n\nMaterials for older tripods were predominantly wood and brass, with some steel for high wear items like the feet or foot points.\n\nThe tripod is placed in the location where it is needed. The surveyor will press down on the legs' platforms to securely anchor the legs in soil or to force the feet to a low position on uneven, pock-marked pavement. Leg lengths are adjusted to bring the tripod head to a convenient height and make it roughly level.\n\nOnce the tripod is positioned and secure, the instrument is placed on the head. The mounting screw is pushed up under the instrument to engage the instrument's base and screwed tight when the instrument is in the correct position. The flat surface of the tripod head is called the foot plate and is used to support the adjustable feet of the instrument.\n\nPositioning the tripod and instrument precisely over an indicated mark on the ground or benchmark requires intricate techniques.\n\nMany modern tripods are constructed of aluminum, though wood is still used for legs. The feet are either aluminum tipped with a steel point or steel. The mounting screw is often brass or brass and plastic. The mounting screw is hollow and has two lateral holes to attach a plumb bob to center the instrument e.g. over a corner or other mark on the ground. After the instrument is centered within a few cm over the mark, the plumb bob is removed and a viewer (using a prism) in the instrument is used to exactly center it.\n\nThe top is typically threaded with a 5/8\" x 11 tpi screw thread. The mounting screw is held to the underside of the tripod head by a movable arm. This permits the screw to be moved anywhere within the head's opening. The legs are attached to the head with adjustable screws that are usually kept tight enough to allow the legs to be moved with a bit of resistance. The legs are two part, with the lower part capable of telescoping to adjust the length of the leg to suit the terrain. Aluminum or steel slip joints with a tightening screw are at the bottom of the upper leg to hold the bottom part in place and fix the length. A shoulder strap is often affixed to the tripod to allow for ease of carrying the equipment over areas to be surveyed.\n\n\n"}
