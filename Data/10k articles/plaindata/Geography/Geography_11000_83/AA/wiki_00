At present, it is 4.8 miles (7.7 km) long and runs from the A41 at Leavesden Green, near Watford, to the A414 at Park Street Roundabout near St Albans. It forms part of the \"North Orbital Road\", an uncompleted outer ring road around London.\n\nThe A405 starts at a grade-separated roundabout junction with the A41 at Leavesden Green. From here, it travels northeast to a crossing with Sheepcot Lane at Woodside, then east to a traffic light junction with the A412 near Garston. This 1.4-mile (2.2-km) section is known as \"Kingsway\".\n\nFrom the A412, the A405 travels north, past West Hertfordshire Crematorium and Penfold Park Golf Course, to junction 6 of the M1 at Waterdale (2.3 miles, 3.7 km).\n\nIt then veers northeast, passing the village of Bricket Wood, before meeting the M25 at junction 21a (3.1 miles, 5 km). Drivers wishing to access the M25 from the M1 northbound, or the M1 southbound from the M25, must use this section of the A405 as the junction between the two motorways, known as Chiswell Interchange, does not feature the corresponding slip roads.\nAfter the M25, the A405 continues northeast, with a roundabout junction with the B4630 for Chiswell Green (3.6 miles, 5.8 km), then another with Tippendell Lane for How Wood (4.2 miles, 6.8 km). The road terminates at Park Street Roundabout, a junction with the A414 and the A5183 (formerly part of the A5); until 2009 this was junction 1 of the M10.\n\nThe A405 originally took up a greater proportion of the \"North Orbital Road\". From Park Street Roundabout, it travelled east, crossing the River Ver and the Midland Main Line before meeting the A6 (now the A1081) at London Colney. It then veered northeast, past Colney Heath, before ending at the A1 near Hatfield. This gave it a total length of 9.7 miles (15.6 km).\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the A405 was extended from Leavesden Green. This extension ran concurrently with the A41 to Hunton Bridge, then continued westwards over the River Gade and past the hamlet of Chandler's Cross. It then veered south to pass between Rickmansworth and Chorleywood, crossing the River Chess, the A404 (with which it had a grade-separated junction) and the London to Aylesbury and London Underground Metropolitan lines. It ended just north of Maple Cross, at the A412, on which the \"North Orbital Road\" continued south to Denham in Buckinghamshire. This took the length of the A405 to 16.3 miles (26.2 km).\n\nAlmost all of this extension was incorporated into the M25 in the mid-1980s, as the section between junction 17 and the spur at junction 19 (the aforementioned junction with the A404 becoming junction 18). At around the same time, the section of the A405 east of Park Street Roundabout was re-designated as part of the A414 (the original St Albans–Hatfield section of that road becoming the A1057), though it continues to be called the \"North Orbital Road\".\n\n"}

When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey is a unitary not a federal system, and the provinces are subordinated to the centre. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the governors and city governors. Besides the governors and the city governors, other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government rather than appointed by mayors or elected by constituents.\n\nWithin this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 923 districts. Turkey is also subdivided into 7 regions and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division.\n\nThe largely centralized structure of decision-making in Ankara is often considered an impediment to good governance, and causes resentment in particular in ethnic minority regions. Steps towards decentralization since 2004 have proved to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey.

{"id": "11863839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11863839", "title": "Chalan Beel", "text": "Chalan Beel\n\nChalan Beel () is a wetland in Bangladesh. It is a large inland depression, marshy in character, with rich flora and fauna. Forty-seven rivers and other waterways flow into the Chalan Beel. As silt builds up in the beel, its size is being reduced.\n\nChalan Beel is an extensive lowland area in the lower Atrai basin, and spreads across Singra and Gurudaspur upazilas on Natore District, Chatmohar, Bhangura and Faridpur upazilas of Pabna District, and Ullahpara, Raiganj and Tarash upazilas of Sirajganj District. It consists of a series of beels connected to one another by various channels to form a continuous water body during the rainy season. Although the beel area expands into a vast water body with dense aquatic vegetation as long as the Jamuna remains flooded during the monsoon months, it dries out in the winter months, leaving only patches of water in the central parts of this zone.\n\nChalan Beel is fast silting up. In the past it covered an area of about 1,085 km² but was reduced to 368 km² in 1909, of which only 85 km² remained underwater throughout the year. It has since shrunk to only 26 km².\n\nThe most important factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, which has been the most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.\n\nThe main volume of water from the Ganges River began flowing through the Padma channel in the sixteenth century. Silt from the Padma helped in building up the southern portion of north Bengal. This is the most plausible explanation for the existence of a depression around Chalan Beel. The Teesta was active in the region until it changed its course in 1787. This territory lies in between the land raised in the north by the Teesta system when it was active and that in the south by the Padma.\n\nHowever, there is another explanation for the creation of the depression. The Padma has been changing its course over the centuries. In Ven den Brouck's map of Bengal, prepared in 1660, the main channel of the Padma is shown as flowing through Faridpur-Bakharganj, but there also is a suggestion of another, possibly earlier channel. This channel runs through Rampur Boalia in Rajshahi, Chalan Beel, Dhaleswari and Buriganga before meeting the Meghna. At that time the Jamuna was virtually non-existent and the Brahmaputra used to flow through its old channel.\n\nAn estimate taken in 1945 found about 47 rivers and other waterways flowed into the Chalan Beel, a watershed of about . In addition to being a crossroads for the many waterways it also served as the origin for the many rivers flowing south or east that eventually meet with the Padma or Jamuna. In the early 1900s, Chalan Beel began to be hemmed in by the construction of the Eastern Bengal Railway main line on the west and the Santahar-Bogra branch line on the north. The natural pattern of the water's drainage channels in this area were disrupted by the obstruction caused by the railway construction since railways in these low lands had to be built on embankments.\n\nThe banks of the beel are covered with dense stands of kash, babla, nol, dhol kolmi, simul, and date palm. Seven species of frogs and one species of toad represent the amphibian fauna. Chalan Beel has a total of 34 species of reptiles include ten turtles and tortoises, nine lizards and various snake species. There are 27 species of mammals from 12 families.\n\nChalan Beel has experienced the negative effects of pesticide use in the surrounding farmlands. In 2010, Bangladesh Agricultural University research, found pesticide use has increased sixfold since 1982, and the fish population of Chalan Beel has halved in the same period. A 25 kilometre highway constructed on the Beel has divided into two and caused havoc on the fish breeding by disrupting their movement. Commercial overfishing, grill and drag net and other destructive fishing have harmed the fish population.\n"}

{"id": "13895240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13895240", "title": "East Coast bias", "text": "East Coast bias\n\nEast Coast bias is the perceived tendency for sports broadcasting and journalism in the United States and Canada to give greater weight and attention to teams and athletes on the East Coast of their respective countries than those on the West Coast.\n\nEast Coast bias is used to explain perceived slights of teams and players relative to their comparable counterparts on the West Coast. It is attributed to East Coast sports stories being more repetitive, comprehensive, and exaggerated. \"In America news still travels from east to west,\" wrote author George Will in \"\". The bias is also used to rationalize the broadcasting of an East Coast team in favor of another compelling team based to the west.\n\nNational coverage of live games is also perceived as favoring certain teams located on the Eastern side of the continent. For example, critics of what \"Hockey Night in Canada\" chooses to program allege that the show particularly favors the Toronto Maple Leafs. Likewise, ESPN's baseball coverage has been the target of criticism because of its perceived bias towards the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees.\n\nThe North American continent is divided into seven time zones, spanning 6½ hours from Alaska to Newfoundland. Most of the continent's population (including all of the major professional sports teams) is concentrated in the four time zones of the contiguous United States and Canada west of the Maritimes; this, however, still poses a significant obstacle in that the easternmost sports teams are a full three hours ahead of their western counterparts. For sports that play in prime time according to local time zones (as is the case with ice hockey, baseball, and basketball), this can result in games played on the West Coast starting after 10 p.m. Eastern time (and not ending until around or after 1 a.m.), while the East is sleeping and after printing deadlines for the next day's newspapers have passed. Gennaro Filice of SI.com wrote that Major League Baseball's West Coast night games are ending as \"the country's most influential scribes are catching Z after Z.\" John Buccigross of ESPN notes that a lot of people in the East are asleep when National Hockey League's West night games are going on, resulting in lower television ratings for those West Coast games, which in turn contributes to the lack of national broadcasts of West games.\n\nIn the United States, the major media hub is the East Coast city of New York, with ESPN and NBC Sports having their hubs in the neighboring state of Connecticut (although Los Angeles also serves as a significant hub on the West Coast). Canada's two major media hubs, Toronto (for English-language media) and Montréal (for French), are also both in the Eastern Time Zone. Buccigross wrote that an imbalance is understandable from Eastern writers, considering they are influenced by their close proximity and easier access to the happenings in the East. The East is home to nearly half of the country's population and is both more densely populated and was settled and developed much earlier than the West.\n\nFox Sports sportscaster Joe Buck attributes the shift to the economics of running a business: \"If you think there is a perceived East Coast bias, guess what? You're right. That's where people are watching, that's where the numbers are.\" ESPN ombudsman Le Anne Schreiber wrote that fans should forget about expecting equity in teams the network selects to broadcast. \"It is long proven in NBA and NFL and MLB that spreading the wealth to 30 or 32 teams is a prescription for deflating ratings,\" said Len DeLuca, ESPN senior vice president for programming.\n\n"}
{"id": "44166769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44166769", "title": "Ecocity Builders", "text": "Ecocity Builders\n\nEcocity Builders is a 501c non profit located in Oakland, California that provides advocacy, consulting, and education in sustainable city planning with a focus on access by proximity and pedestrian-oriented development. Ecocity Builders also implements urban design projects utilizing a large network of alliances with city governments, businesses and NGOs. Ecocity Builders' approach is based the work of founder Richard Register, an American artist, peace activist and urban theorist.\n\nEcocity Builders is primarily concerned with promoting the creation of ecocities, a phrase first coined by Richard Register at the 1st International Ecocity Conference in 1990. Ecocity Builders defines an ecocity as an \"ecologically healthy human settlement modeled on the self-sustaining resilient structure and function of natural ecosystems and living organisms.\" An ecocity can encompass any size of settlement, from neighborhood or village up to metropolis, that functions in harmony with the ecosystems of which it is part. These greater environmental systems include the watershed, bioregion, and ultimately, of the planet, as well as human social systems such as local, regional, national and world economic, governmental, and cultural exchange systems.\n\nBiometrics is central to the Ecocity concept through the analogy of the cities as living organisms. Cities (including their inhabitants) exhibit and require systems for movement (transport), respiration (processes to obtain energy), sensitivity (responding to its environment), growth (evolving/changing over time), reproduction (including education, construction, planning and development, etc.), excretion (outputs and wastes), and nutrition (need for air, water, soil, food for inhabitants, materials, etc.).\n\nEcocities exhibit characteristic design elements such as pedestrian-oriented \"nodes\" or centers of resources and social interaction, mixed-use planning, pervasive natural features (gardens, urban agriculture, parks), de-emphasis on individual vehicular transit, and equitable access to resources. Register's ecocities are influenced by the arcology movement including an emphasis on hyperstructures—large, complex interconnected buildings. Register has published collections of his extensive drawings of ecocity plans and interventions in several books (see “Sources”).\n\nEcocity Builders was founded by Richard Register in 1992 in order to further specific aims of the first International Ecocity Conference (Berkeley, 1990). The first conference was convened by the Urban Ecology group, an organization also founded by Richard Register. Ecocity Builders went on to involve many of the same key actors as Urban Ecology. Ecocity Builders' early years were characterized by a number of local projects in the San Francisco East Bay, primarily Berkeley. These projects included creek daylighting Cordonices Creek, Slow Streets, and community projects.\n\nEcocity Builders flagship project included one of the earliest daylighted and restored creek beds in the United States. The Codornices Creek project, 1994, removed the water channel from its cement culvert along the Albany/Oakland border and created a mile-long park. Ecocity Builders collaborated with the Urban Creeks Council, who applied for and received $25,000 from the Department of Water Resources Board to fund the project.\nThe second lower half of the creek park was restored in 2004 on a budget of $2.1 million under the auspices of the Codornices Creek Watershed Council.\n\nEcocity Builders helped plan and provided support for a variety of small to medium-sized depaving projects in Berkeley. Examples include removing five parking spaces at University Avenue Homes' low income residence for a garden, and Halcyon Commons. The latter converted a 28 space parking lot into a community-designed mini-park featuring a large grassy area surrounded by flowering shrubs and trees, a picnic area, and a tire swing.\n\nStarting in 1979 Richard Register and other Berkeley activists began advocating the City of Berkeley for traffic-calming street plans based on the Australian \"slow ways\" streets. The Milvia Slow Street, part of the City of Berkeley's Bicycle Boulevard network, was finally designed under their guidance in 1990. The design covers roughly six blocks of residential street in which 30 curb bulb-outs were placed to narrow the street at intersections and mid-block locations. These bulb-outs and planted islands create a serpentine design, which requires vehicles to slow and negotiate a winding path along the street. Official studies confirmed the Milvia Slow Street to have a significant calming impact on vehicle speed and volume along the corridor.\n\nRichard Register piloted a method for identifying “urban villages” in large urban areas in his book \"Ecocity Berkeley\" (1987). He proposed the eventual densification of these areas to create more compact, efficient urban entities where goods and services can be accessed via walking and biking. Ecocity Builders conducted early GIS mapping projects to formalize this process. The results identified actual active urban nodes (clusters of commercial, social and transit activity) as opposed to the on-the-book zoning for commercial/transit centers. They also identified barriers in these areas to being “complete” service access, such as a lack of large grocery store in West Oakland, and lack of integrated transit in Montclair Village.\n\nIn Berkeley Ecocity Builders successfully co-authored and lobbied for policies that are currently enforced, including the Ecocity Amendment to the 2001 General Plan, the Solar Greenhouse Ordinance, and the Residential Energy Conservation Ordinance (RECO).\n\nTask Forces, Committees\n\nPolicies, Campaigns\n\nThe British Columbia Institute of Technology's School of Construction and the Environment and Ecocity Builders worked together to develop a scientific rubric for evaluating the Ecocity status of a human settlement. The rubric is based on 12 environmental, social, and resource-based indicators of urban health. The IEFS forms the basis for several other partnerships and projects aiming to measure, map, and act on these indicators.\n\nThe Ecocitizen World Map Project is a suite of tools and methods that uses PUMIS and GIS technology to explore, understand, and measure holistic urban health from a citizen’s perspective. The project provides an online mapping platform allowing residents to access and combine local, community-uploaded data with open-government data on key indicators such as air and water quality, access to transit, crime, and cultural amenities. The indicators measured by mapping align with the IEFS and can be used to evaluate a city or neighborhood’s ecocity status.\n\nThe first Ecocitizen World Map Project pilots were conducted in April 2014 in the cities of Cairo and Casablanca. Students and community members participated in \"bootcamps\" to learn PUMIS surveying techniques and conducted parcel audits in the neighborhoods of Roches Noires and Imbaba. Initial surveying focused on water use.\n\nThe participatory approach to data collection enables stakeholders to acquire previously unknown data and is designed to empower local communities to engage in relevant issues, giving them incentive to become involved in finding solutions to existing problems.\n\nThis Ecocitizen World Map Project is a public-private partnership led by Ecocity Builders in collaboration with principal initial partners the Organization of American States (OAS), Esri, the Association of American Geographers, Eye on Earth (a partnership of UNEP + Abu Dhabi Environmental Data Initiative), along with local academic partners, NGOs and community organizations. The project's initial three pilot cities include Medellín, Colombia (supported by a grant from the OAS’ Sustainable Communities in the Americas Initiative), Cairo, Egypt, and Casablanca, Morocco (supported by a grant from Eye on Earth).\n\nEcocity Builders provides a set of policy development and advocacy tools as well as contracting as an adviser for projects worldwide. Ecocity Builders and Richard Register have consulted on construction, planning and development in Auroville, India; Changwon, South Korea, Willits, California, Dhaka, Bangladesh, Huaibei, China, Kathmandu, Nepal, and Tianjin Ecocity, China.\n\nChief ongoing project of Ecocity Builders is the biennial conference series known as the World Summit (formerly the International Ecocity Conference Series). The series focuses on key actions cities and citizens can take to rebuild human habitat in balance with living systems. The conference focuses on design, planning, data-gathering, and governance of creating sustainable, equitable cities. This Ecocity Summit series, begun in Berkeley, California in 1990, was a first of its kind and is now the longest continuously running conference on ecological towns, cities and villages.\n\nPast World Summits have featured a wide range of leaders and innovators, including environmentalist David Brower; Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell; Rusong Wang, member of the Chinese Peoples Congress and head of the environmental sciences division of the Chinese Academy of Science; India’s animal rights champion Ambika Shukla; CEO and Chairperson of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Dr. Naoko Ishii; former San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom, architect/philosopher Paolo Soleri; and Denis Hayes, director of the original national Earth Day in 1970 and keynote for the first Ecocity Conference.\n\nThe 2015 Summit will take place in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in October 2015.\n\n\"Ecocity Conferences\":\n\n\n"}

It was also intended to raise awareness of the importance of world geography in the modern world.

The first (and so far only) competition took place between 12 November and 31 December 2006 to coincide with Geography Awareness Week, the third week in November.\n\nThe Geography Cup was created in late 2006 by two geography enthusiasts: Roger Andresen from Atlanta, Georgia, and Daniel Raven-Ellison from Reading, Berkshire. Both became committed to expanding public awareness of the importance of geography after seeing the results of polls illustrating Americans' and Britons' startling lack of geographical knowledge. A poll of young Americans conducted in the United States by National Geographic in 2006 found that only 37% of those polled could find Iraq on a map, and half could not even find the state of New York.\nAndresen and Raven-Ellison created the competition for two main reasons. One reason was to determine whether people who live in the United States or people who live in the United Kingdom knew more about world geography. However, the main reason was to encourage people to learn more about world geography and to understand the importance of geography. The two creators plan to hold the competition yearly beginning in the third week in November to coincide with Geography Awareness Week, established in the United States by Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n\nAny citizen of the USA or the UK was eligible to participate in the contest. Upon signup, the website determined which country a user lived in based on their IP address and automatically put the user into the correct team. The quiz consisted of thirteen random, geography-related questions that had to be answered in a total of two minutes. The first ten questions consisted of placing randomly selected countries onto a blank political map. The final three questions consisted of geography-related trivia questions that were answered by selecting the correct country on the blank map. Each user could practice, affect their own score, and learn about geography by playing as many times as they wanted to, but only three plays per 24-hour period could affect their nation's score.\n\nThe randomly selected countries could be any country (or territory) in the world. This included the large and well-known regions (Russia, Canada, United States, etc.) as well as smaller and more obscure nations (Palau, Djibouti, Togo, etc.). Most participants had little trouble recognizing the major European and Asian countries but many people on both teams had trouble locating small Pacific Islands and some African countries.\n\nThe trivia questions were sometimes related directly to geography, e. g., \"Made up of 33 atolls, which country straddles both the equator and the International Date Line?\". However, some were about current events to test if participants knew where, geographically, news stories were taking place, e. g., \"Which Asian country recently made its first test of a nuclear weapon?\".\n\nDue to the large difference in population between the United States and the United Kingdom, the score of each team was determined by an average percentage based on the percentage scores of each individual player. After each game, a player could see how he or she affected their nation's score and their own personal percentage. Because there were 13 questions, each question was worth approximately 7.7%.\n\nThe USA won with a final accuracy score of 62.368% after trailing for a few days, while the UK lagged behind slightly at the end with an accuracy of 57.947%. The USA had 41,885 participants while the UK team had 10,820, indicating about 30% greater per capita participation in the UK.\n\nUsers in Britain using Internet Explorer reported some problems with the website. Also, some US and UK residents were rejected or put into the incorrect team because their internet service provider used overseas servers. Finally, after the surge of media attention following the Reuters and Christian Science Monitor articles, the number of users exceeded the capacity of the servers, causing a temporary suspension of the competition.\n\nThe Geography Cup was sponsored by A Broader View, founded by Roger Andresen to decrease geographical ignorance with geography puzzles and games. It is also sponsored by Give Geography Its Place, founded by Daniel Raven-Ellison and David Rayner to raise awareness of the importance geography in UK media. The third sponsor is Nelson Thornes, a UK-based educational publisher owned by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nThe Geographic Alliance in Nevada (GAIN), part of National Geographic EdNet, encouraged its members to participate in the competition in the belief that \"It is only fitting that these two countries compete in a geography competition, as they both share the same widely-publicized affliction.\" Polls in the United States, including the National Geographic-Roper poll, and similar polls in the UK, which include a magazine poll cited by the BBC, illustrate a glaring lack of geographic knowledge by young people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, a group of geography teachers and enthusiasts from the UK on a Staffordshire Learning Net geography forum supported the competition and encouraged students to try to improve their nation's score.\n\n"}

When his father died in 1830, he had to break off his studies, and spent six years working as a tutor in Courland. He then traveled to St. Petersburg and other parts of Russia. In 1838, he returned to Germany and settled in Dresden from where he visited much of Europe and wrote about his experiences.\n\nKohl's main scientific work, \"Der Verkehr und die Ansiedlungen der Menschen in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der Gestalt der Erdoberfläche\" (Transportation and settlement of people and their dependence on surface terrain) (1841, 1850) is regarded as the founding document of modern transport and urban geography. Using Moscow as an example, he formulated a mathematical theory for the development of spherical cities and how eventually these cities would develop skyscrapers and underground shopping centers. Similarly, also fundamental to the theoretical geography was his \"Die geographische Lage der Hauptstädte Europas\" (The Geographical Location of the Capitals of Europe) (1874).\n\nIn 1842, Kohl visited York. He wrote a lengthy description of the Minster and York's Quaker community \n(see pp.62-69 in Palliser and Palliser \"eds.\" 1979 \"York as They Saw It: From Alcuin to Lord Esher\". William Sessions Limited.\n\nFrom 1854 to 1858, he traveled in the United States. He prepared some valuable maps for the U.S. government, and at the request of the United States Coast Survey prepared two reports: \"History of the Discovery of the U. S. Coast\" and the \"History and Investigation of the Gulf Stream\" (Bremen, 1868). While in Washington and at Harvard, Kohl made friends with many writers (including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Washington Irving) and scholars (including George Bancroft, Charles Bennett Deane and Louis Agassiz). Kohl's book \"Reisen in Canada und durch die Staaten von New York und Pennsylvanien\" (Travels in Canada and the states of New York and Pennsylvania; 1856) is still consulted for historical study into Pennsylvania Dutch. On his return to Europe, he settled in Bremen where he was appointed city librarian in 1863.\n\n\n\n"}

It was established by the Soviet Union on 13 May 1946 and in the beginning used technology, material and scientific support from defeated Germany. Numerous launches of test rockets for the Russian military were carried out at the site, as well as satellite and sounding rocket launches. The town of Znamensk was built nearby to serve the missile test range.\n\nThe 4th Missile Test Range \"Kapustin Yar\" was established by a decree of the Soviet Government \"On Questions of Jet Propelled Weapons\" on 13 May 1946. The test range was created under the supervision of General-lieutenant Vasily Voznyuk (commander of the range 1946-1973) in the desert north end of the Astrakhan region. The first rocket was launched from the site on 18 October 1947; it was one of eleven German A-4s that had been captured.\n\nThe State R&D Test Range No 8 (GNIIP-8, \"test range S\") was established at Kapustin Yar in June 1951.\n\nFive atmospheric nuclear tests of small power (10-40 kt) were performed over the site in 1957-1961.\n\nAs of 1959 Kapustin Yar was the only publicly known Soviet missile test range. Non-Soviet observers believed at first that Sputnik 1 and 2 launched from the site. With the further growth and development, Kapustin Yar became a cosmodrome, serving in this function since 1966. The rate of space launches was very low, usually 1-2 a year and during the Soviet era, it hosted only the two smallest launch vehicles, the R-12 and R-14 derived Kosmos boosters. There were no space launches at all from 1988-1998. The town of Znamensk was established to support the scientists working on the facilities, their families and supporting personnel. Initially this was a secret city, not shown on maps and requiring official permission to visit.\n\nEvidence of the importance of Kapustin Yar was obtained by Western intelligence through debriefing of returning German scientists and spy flights. The first such flight reportedly took place in mid-1953 using a high flying Canberra aircraft of the RAF. The UK Government has never admitted such a flight took place nor have any of the supposed participants provided direct evidence\n\nDue to its role as a development site for new technology, Kapustin Yar is also the site of numerous Soviet-era UFO sightings and has been called \"Russia's Roswell\".\n\n\n\n"}

It was dammed by the terminal moraine that now forms the spine of Long Island and Fishers Island. About 15,000 BP, the moraine dam that impounded Lake Connecticut failed; the outlet, known as The Race for its tidal rip currents, lies between the North Fork of Long Island and Fishers Island. For a time, much of the lake bed was exposed to wind-driven erosion: the cue is found in soundings that reveal regional unconformities in the sediment bed of Long Island Sound.\n\nThe fore-edge lake formed by glacial meltwater expanded to be about the same size as present-day Long Island Sound; it may have been connected at times with similar freshwater lakes in Block Island Sound and Buzzards Bay, while sea level was low. The fairly shallow average depth of 78 feet (24 m) of today's Long Island Sound is the result of fine lake-bottom sediments deposited as glacial outwash slowed in Lake Connecticut. Suspended as rock flour, the fine sediments would have rendered Lake Connecticut a turquoise blue-green.\n\nThe end of Lake Connecticut was marked by a series of intervals of salt water incursion after about 15,000 BP and subsequent refreshening, as rising sea levels and isostatic rebound of land depressed by the former weight of ice sheets adjusted to one another.\n\n"}

Local operations works on individual raster cells, or pixels. Focal operations work on cells and their neighbors, whereas global operations work on the entire layer. Finally, zonal operations work on areas of cells that share the same value. The input and output for each operator being map, the operators can be combined into a procedure or script, to perform complex tasks.\n\nWhen map algebra is performed in cells from local operations, different types of operations can be used:\n\nSeveral major GIS systems use map algebra concepts, including ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS.

It was founded in 1992 by Angus Farquhar, a former member of the group Test Dept. The company's name is an acronym of \"nacionale vitae activa\", a Latin term meaning 'the right to influence public affairs'.\n\nThe company is best known for its dramatic, large-scale environmental artworks in Scottish natural landscapes, building on the site-specific performances that Farquhar created with Test Dept. These works have included \"The Secret Sign\", \"The Path\", \"The Storr\" and \"Half Life\". The works are designed to involve local communities and to incorporate regeneration aspects that will benefit the landscapes in the future. For example, improvements were made to the footpaths around The Storr as part of the preparation for that work.\n\n\"The Secret Sign\" took place at night on 9–16 May 1998 at The Devil's Pulpit, Finnich Glen, near Loch Lomond. Audience members were transported by bus (with the windows blacked out) to the site of the work, where they were given hard hats and wading boots. They were then escorted through the glen by members of the company. Various artistic interventions were visible along the way, including lights, sounds, birds of prey and live performance.\n\n\"The Path\" was a two-hour night-time walk that took place from 19 May – 4 June 2000 at Glen Lyon in Perthshire. Like \"The Secret Sign\" it featured light, sound, performance and music, including Buddhist chant by Ani Choying Drolma.\n\n\"The Storr\" took place at night from 1 August – 17 September 2005 at The Storr, a rocky hill in Trotternish on the Isle of Skye. Audience members were bussed to the site from bases in Portree and Staffin and kitted out with head torches and walking sticks. They were then led up to the base of the Old Man of Storr, a natural rock formation. Like the earlier works, the walk was marked by lights, sounds, music and performance. The work contained music by Geir Jenssen and Paul Mounsey, live performance by Gaelic singer Ann Martin and recordings of the works of Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean. Other elements of \"The Storr\" included a series of LED stars which together made up the largest light sculpture ever seen in the UK. The total cost of mounting the work was £1 million.\n\n\"Half Life\" took place at Kilmartin Glen, Argyll from 4–16 September 2007, and was a collaboration between NVA and the National Theatre of Scotland. It consisted of two parts: a daytime element, where visitors could explore a series of sites and installations based around known and rarely seen prehistoric landmarks; and a night-time element, consisting of an outdoor production staged in a forest location at the entrance to the glen, centred on a sculptural set constructed from felled logs.\n\nIn April 2010 NVA re-enacted Witte Fietsenplan (White Bike Plan), a free transport programme by the Provos, the Dutch counter culture movement of the 1960s. NVA released 50 white bicycles across the city, which were available for the audience of Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art to travel between venues for the duration of the festival.\n\nNVA hosted the first Glasgow Harvest in August 2010 at the Hidden Gardens. Glasgow Harvest was a celebration of urban farming, and encouraged visitors to participate in a mass open-air meal prepared using their home-grown ingredients.\nVisitors were invited to contribute to an immense jam wall, sample edible punk haircuts, and submit to competition the creative containers they had used to grow plants. Glasgow's allotments made 12 different soups and 20 local schools participated in the Double Rubble Chip Challenge - making chips at Harvest from potatoes they had grown from seed in their playgrounds.\n\nSpeed of Light was a major Edinburgh International Festival 2012 commission, one of Scotland's signature contributions to the Olympic cultural programme. Conceived and produced by NVA, the transformation of Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh's iconic mountain, combined innovative public art and sport. Using energy-harvesting technologies to illuminate walkers and specially designed battery-powered light suits worn by runners, Speed of Light harnessed collective action to create a multi-layered night-time animation. NVA's Speed of Light also investigated the physical and emotional aspects to endurance running and the extent to which the power of the mind can override physical pain. A series of related blogs, web portraits, events, lectures and co-commissions were presented in partnership with eight of the Edinburgh Festivals.\n\n\n"}

This firm was a successor to the earlier firm of Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot after the death of their partner Charles Eliot in 1897. The two brothers were among the founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) and played an influential role in creating the National Park Service. Prior to their takeover of the firm, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. had worked as an apprentice under his father, helping to design projects such as Biltmore Estate and the World's Columbian Exposition before graduating from Harvard University. The firm employed nearly 60 staff at its peak in the early 1930s. Notable landscape architects in the firm included James Frederick Dawson and Percival Gallagher. The last Olmsted family member in the firm, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., retired in 1949. The firm itself remained in operation, moving from Brookline in 1980 and continuing in Fremont, NH until 2000. This created one continuous firm from 1858-2000.\n\n\"Fairsted\" -- the firm's 100-year-old business headquarters and design office -- has been carefully preserved as the Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site, located on of landscaped grounds at 99 Warren St., Brookline, Massachusetts. It offers excellent insights into the practice of large-scale landscape design and engineering. The site also houses an archive (access by appointment only) of the firm's designs, plant lists, and photos for hundreds of projects.\n\nThe Olmsted Brothers completed numerous high-profile projects, many of which remain popular to this day, including park systems, universities, exposition grounds, libraries, hospitals, residential neighborhoods and state capitols. Notable commissions include the roadways in the Great Smoky Mountains and Acadia National Parks, Yosemite Valley, Atlanta's Piedmont Park, a residential neighborhood in Oak Bay, British Columbia, Canada: Uplands; entire park systems in cities such as Cleveland, Portland, Seattle, and Washington state's Northern State Hospital. The Olmsted Brothers also co-authored, with Harland Bartholomew, a 1930 report for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce entitled \"Parks, Playgrounds, and Beaches for the Los Angeles Region\" encouraging the preservation of outdoor public space in southern California. The report was largely ignored by the city, but became an important urban planning reference.\n\n\n"}

The sedimentary basin is a large sag in the craton, bordered by the Armorican Massif to the west, the Ardennes-Brabant axis to the north, the Massif des Vosges to the east, and the Massif Central to the south.\n\nThe region usually regarded as the Paris Basin is rather smaller than the area formed by the geological structure. The former occupies the centre of the northern half of the country, excluding Eastern France. The latter extends from the hills just south of Calais to Poitiers and from Caen to the brink of the middle Rhine Valley, east of Saarbrücken.\n\nThe countryside is one of plains and plateaux of limited altitude. In the south-east and east the plain of \"Champagne\" and the \"Seuil de Bourgogne\" (Threshold of Burgundy) differential erosion of the strata has left low scarps with the dip slopes towards the centre. The varying nature of the clays, limestones and chalk gives rise to the characteristics of the regions such as \"Champagne Humide\" (Damp Champagne), \"Champagne Pouilleuse\" (poor Champagne), the \"Pays de Caux\" and the \"Pays de Bray\".\nMap missing\n\nThe Paris Basin is a geological basin of sedimentary rocks. It overlies geological strata disturbed by the Variscan orogeny and forms a broad shallow bowl in which successive marine deposits from throughout periods from the Triassic to the Pliocene were laid down, their extent generally diminishing with time. Based on analysis of fossils recognized in the Paris Basin strata during the 1820s and 1830s, the pioneering geologist Charles Lyell divided the Tertiary into three ages he named the Pliocene, the Miocene and the Eocene.\n\nTo the west, the strata folded by the Variscan rise from below the more recent marine deposits in the hills of Brittany and, to the east, the Ardennes, Hunsrück and Vosges. To the south, it borders on the Massif Central and the Morvan. To the north, its strata link into those of the bed of the English Channel and south-eastern England. Other boundaries lie on ridges in more recent deposits and scarps such as the Côte d'Or (on an Alpine fault line) and the Hills of Artois which overlie the margin of London-Brabant Massif.\n\nTwo large oil fields are located in the basin, one is the Chaunoy Field, the other is the Villeperdue Field, discovered in c limestone]] 1850 m deep.\n\n\n"}

Fountain-head; The head of the Spring), is a place abounding with immense fountains, with reservoirs and aqueducts south of Tyre, and ca. south of Beirut, in the South Governorate (Liban-Sud), in the municipality of Batouliyat. The place lies in a very green and fertile plain, about one kilometer from the sea coast. It is a popular tourist destination, owing to its artesian wells fed by underground springs and collected in stone reservoirs that have been maintained through the ages. It has been the main source of water for ancient Tyre since Phoenician days. One of the reservoirs fed the arched aqueducts of the Roman period, and which once stretched all the way to Tyre. Remains of these aqueducts, exhibiting strong and excellent masonry, with round arches and a continuous cornice above them, can still be seen today, and a short stretch of the original aqueduct is still used today in Tyre's present-day waterworks.\n\nA reference to this place is mentioned in the 3rd century Mosaic of Rehob as \"Rosh Mayya\" (Fountain-head).\n\nIn 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" (SWP) described it: \"A village built of stone, containing about 100 Metawileh, in the plain, surrounded by gardens of figs, pomegranates, mulberries, and olives. Five mills in the village, and near, in working order,a good many ruined.\"\n\nThey further noted about the water-ways: This is the spring-head which supplied ancient Tyre by means of a long aqueduct. The springs are enclosed in four strongly-built reservoirs, as at Tabghah, by means of which the water is raised to a height of from fifteen to twenty feet, in order that an aqueduct with a slight fall should be able to carry it to the neighbourhood of Tyre. The walls of these reservoirs are of large well-dressed ashlar-work, and vary in thickness. The stones are joined and coated on the inside with strong cement. The principal reservoir is octagonal in shape, with sides of irregular length. Its diameter measures sixty-six feet, and it is twenty-five feet above the ground. The retaining walls are very thick, and show traces of modern repairs in one part. They have so gentle a slope that it is not difficult to ride up on to the broad border eight feet wide round the spring.\"\nTyre District\n\n"}

At the time of signature, the borders of the empire were not clear and to remedy the problem an Armenian businessman named Calouste Gulbenkian, took a red pencil to draw in an arbitrary manner the borders of the divided empire.\n\nThe expression remained significant to global diplomacy and was reused during the UN's founding after the WWII, especially in the Anglophone world. Uniquely, in France one would \"cross the yellow line\" (\"franchir la ligne jaune\").\n\nIn Israel, the phrase was notably used as a political metaphor by Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, in 1975, when said that Washington \"has managed to draw a red line which all the Arab countries know they must not cross - that America is not going to sacrifice Israel for the sake of Arab support.\" Yitzhak Rabin later used the phrase to refer to the line past which the Syrian army should not be allowed to cross after the 1976 occupation of Lebanon. On September 27, 2012 at the 67th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York in a speech addressing Iran's nuclear program Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly added a red line to a prepared bomb cartoon.\n\nAccording to Ben Yagoda, a professor of English and journalism at the University of Delaware, in 1987, there are references to \"red lines\" in conflicts between Chad and Libya, and in a 1999 \"New York Times\" article, Muslim clerics in Iran are reported to draw a \"'red line for the revolution' that no one should cross.\" These references occurred earlier as well, appearing a Milwaukee Sentinel article of 26 January 1984 regarding French intervention in Chad and a \"red line\" held by French forces in southern Chad.\n\nThe phrase has been used by U.S. diplomats going back to the 1990s. For example, U.S. officials, quoted by Reuters news agency in May 1994, used the term in reference to negotiations with North Korea over the withdrawal of reactor fuel; and Martin Walker in \"The Guardian\" used the same phrase in June, in reference to statements by United States officials. Secretary of State Warren Christopher used the phrase in reference to NATO control over the peace-keeping mission in Bosnia on the CBS program \"Face the Nation\" on 22 October 1995. Barack Obama used the phrase on August 20, 2012, during the Syrian civil war in relation to chemical weapons, saying that \"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\" \n\nIn the US, the phrase then became a source of contention when political opponent John McCain said the red line was \"apparently written in disappearing ink,\" due to the perception the red line had been crossed with no action. On the one year anniversary of Obama's red line speech the Ghouta chemical attacks occurred. Obama then clarified \"I didn't set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use even when countries are engaged in war,\" in reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nFrom British English, an entirely different figure of speech for an act of great courage against impossible order or thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack, or the \"thin red line\", originates from reports of a red-coated Scottish regiment at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. A journalist described a \"thin red streak tipped with a line of steel\" with the appearance of the 93rd (Highland) Regiment and parts of the Turkish army as they stood before (and repelled) a vastly superior force of Russian cavalry. The reference was soon shortened into the thin red line, and famously described by Rudyard Kipling in the poem \"Tommy\" as \"the thin red line of 'eroes [heroes].\"\n\nNotable literary uses included George Orwell who in \"A Clergyman's Daughter\" invented a book-within-a-book called the \"\"Hundred Page History of Britain\", a 'nasty little duodecimo book' of 1888, which declared anachronistically that Napoleon 'soon found that in the “thin red line” he had more than met his match.'\" American author James Jones later used \"The Thin Red Line\" as the title of his 1962 novel about a World War II battle, helping to further popularize its usage.\n\nIts popularity of this use in the USA has increased since the Andrew Marton's 1964 movie and Terrence Malick's 1998 movie of Jones's novel, the latter of which was ranked as one of the 10 best action and war films of all time.\n\nThe basic idea has been extended in the 20th century to apply to police officers, as The Thin Blue Line, in reference to the frequently blue color of police uniforms.\n\n"}

Properly defined it excludes shoals between seasonally varying flows and may exclude semi-coastal islands such as in deltas. \n\nThese islands result from changes in the course of a river such as interactions with a tributary or the opposing fluvial actions of deposition and/or erosion such as forming a natural cut and meander. Nascent vegetation-free sandbars and mudflats may dissipate and shift or build up into such islands through deposition and which may be assisted through artificial reinforcement or natural factors such as, reeds, palms, evergreen trees or willows, to large examples covering many square kilometers, examples of which are given below.\n\nThe term \"towhead\" implies a little islet or sandbar within a river (most often the Mississippi River) having a grouping or thicket of trees, and is often used in the Midwestern United States. Many rivers, if wide enough, can house considerably large islands. The term \"towhead\" was popularised by Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\".\n\nIn England, a river island in the Thames is referred to as an \"ait\" (or \"eyot\").\n\nMajuli in India, being non-coastal and being between two channels of one river is recognised by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as world's largest example., but Ilha do Bananal meets the same qualifications and is much larger. Umananda is among contenders as the smallest permanently-inhabited river island with fixed dwellings at 0.02 km². Majuli and Umananda lie in the Brahmaputra River. Many as tiny as Umananda or smaller, inhabited, exist in the Amazon basin and Bangladesh. On canalised rivers such as the Thames and the Seine one-home islands of permanent-materials homes exist such as Monkey, Friday, Holm and D'Oyly Carte islands, as canalisation reduces the erosion of the islands and in particular limits the height of flash flooding by maintaining substantial \"heads\" of water through barrages.\n"}

The members of the organisation expect to deliver insights upon climate changes and the underlying mechanisms involved. Emphasis is placed on both the environmental prosperity and equilibrium, as well as on the wellness of the surrounding populations, the depending commerce, the health risks and other parameters believed to be interdependent.\n\nThe activities of the organisation vary among various risks but also emphasise on the importance of sustainable management to lead to effective economic growth, along with environmental prosperity.\n\nSatellite technology has been used for earth observation since the beginning of the first space missions realised. During the past few years this area of research has been gaining a lot of interest, so as to manage environmental risks and natural hazards (tsunamis, floods, volcanoes, etc.). The fear of climate changes, the consideration that most of the complex environmental mechanisms remain still very little explored and understood and the linkage between environmental indicators and health well-being, pose urgent needs for amplifying our monitoring techniques. Many initiatives have been granted in order to support environment-oriented consortiums, while additionally many international collaborations have been formed, namely GEOSS and GMES\n\nSpace Saves Society follows the work of many international organisations which also use space-borne data for gaining insights upon the environment (\n\nand other), and particularly focuses on the importance of water resources.\n\nWater covers the largest percentage of our planet’s surface and it is vital for our survival. However, many areas still suffer from absence of drinking water. The Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) refers that “Today 2.5 billion people, including almost one billion children, live without even basic sanitation. Every 20 seconds, a child dies as a result of poor sanitation. That's 1.5 million preventable deaths each year.”\n\nFishery is estimated being one of the major commerce markets. Worldwide Estimated total international trade in fishery commodities’ total production have shifted from 122.201 (1000 t) in 1999 to 142.287 (1000 t) in 2008. Sufficient management could optimise this commerce but would also ensure that human activities in the water areas do not interfere with the ecosystem’s equilibrium.\nWater resources have not been so widely studied as compared to land and atmosphere, mainly because there exist more difficulties in the first case scenario. That’s the reason why studies in such cases are usually realised via UAVs and in-situ measurements. However, recent developments in water remote sensing allows more detailed analysis and understanding of the status of the water regions studied and of the effects that this can give rise to.\n\nSpace Saves Society makes uses of satellite imagery and satellite radiometer readings. The first, being acquired across a variety of EM spectrums, enables the identification of information otherwise impossible to be perceived, such as changes in recent changes in water volume, pollution, changes in concentration and vegetation, etc. Radiometer readings vary among surface temperatures, currents, salinity and other properties which can be used as indicators for understanding the changes and stresses an area might undergo. \nBased upon the above technology, Space Saves Society focuses its studies on the following six main areas:\n\n\nBeing recently founded, Space Saves Society has yet to create any charitable activities for the public to attend and support. However, the organisation has already announced its first project, named Five Lakes Water Protection Global Project. The project is going to be initiated on July 1, 2011 and will collect and analyse data of five of the most significant (in size, volume and near-by populations) lakes worldwide: \n\n"}

The plant was constructed at the point of intersection of the Yarmouk and the Lower Jordan river, and its purpose was to utilize the flow of water in order to generate electricity for towns and cities of Mandatory Palestine.\n\nIn the vicinity of the power plant, the village of Tel Or was built, being the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. Tel Or was designated for residence of the permanent employees of the power plant and their families, aiming to create an agricultural village at the Eastern border of the Land of Israel. Employees of the power station also farmed thousands of dunams of land and sold some of the produce at a company workers’ supermarket in Haifa. Due to its relative isolation and despite the limited number of resident families, the village included a clinic, a kindergarten, and even a school, established by Yosef Hanani for the children of employees.\n\nDuring the 1947-8 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, because of the difficult security situation, the Naharayim power plant ceased operation for the first time in 15 years. In violation of a November 1947 agreement between Meir and Abdullah, the Arab Legion's 4th Battalion launched a mortar and artillery attack on the Naharayim police fort and Kibbutz Gesher on April 27–29, 1948. On the evening of April 27, the Legion began shelling the fort and kibbutz, stepping up the attack the following day. Many of the kibbutz buildings were destroyed. On the morning of April 29, a Legion officer demanded the evacuation of the Gesher police fort, but was turned down. After protests to the British Mandate administration, the shelling was halted, and Abdullah was reprimanded for \"aggression against Palestine territory.\" The families of the employees were evacuated in April 1948, leaving behind only workers with Jordanian ID cards. Following a prolonged battle between Yishuv forces and the Transjordanian Arab Legion in the area, the residents of Tel Or were given an ultimatum to surrender or leave the village. The village of Tel Or was shortly abandoned by the residents, who fled to Yishuv-controlled areas to the West.\n\nAn Iraqi brigade invaded at Naharayim area on May 15, 1948, in an unsuccessful attempt to take the Gesher kibbutz and fort. The power plant was occupied and looted by the Iraqi forces. After the Tel Or village and the power plant were overran by the Arab forces they were destroyed. To prevent Iraqi tanks from attacking Jewish villages in the Jordan Valley, the sluice gates of the Degania dam were opened. The rush of water, which deepened the river at this spot, was instrumental in blocking the Iraqi-Jordanian incursion.\n\nThe remains of Tel Or are in Jordan not far from the Island of Peace. There is an ongoing project to develop a Jordan River Peace Park, spanning the border with Israel, that will include the site.\n\nThe 1948 war also forced 70 Palestinian families, from a village just meters away on the other side of the Jordan River, to populate the abandoned site.\n"}

After an encounter in the area of the Bermuda Triangle with an unnatural green cloud, the group find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious uncharted island from which they are unable to escape.\n\nThey encounter Varian (Jared Martin), initially disguised as an Arawak native, who is later revealed to be from the year 2230. A 23rd-century pacifist, musician and healer, Varian explains to the travelers that, like he and many before them, they have been caught in a space/time continuum where people from the past, present, future and from other worlds are trapped, co-existing on the island in a series of \"Time Zones\". The only way home can be found in a place called \"Evoland\", which lies \"far to the rising sun\". (It was indicated in interviews of the time that Evoland was also the name of the island.) The only way to travel between Time Zones is via invisible gateways that instantaneously transport individuals or groups from one zone to another. In one episode \"Beyond The Mountain\" the group also encounters a second cloud, which has much the same effect, but which also splits up the group.\n\nAfter the initial pilot story, a steady group of travelers forms around Varian as \"de facto\" leader, and the series then follows this group as they travel across the many Time Zones of the island to find Evoland. On their way, they encounter people from different planets and times who are also trapped on the island and who have adapted to their plight in different ways. The pilot initially suggested the historical past would be explored; however, the producers of the show rapidly adopted a consistently futuristic tone during the series following pressure from the network. They also dropped three characters after the pilot as they wanted a more exotic group of travelers, hence the arrival of Liana and Willoway. Liana disappears from the last two episodes when Katie Saylor fell ill.\n\n\nD. C. Fontana recalled that once the show had been commissioned, she and the producers had a very short period of time to develop and produce the show before filming commenced. Additional scenes were filmed and inserted into the pilot which introduces the Atlanteans who are the focus of Episode 2, but this new material also quickly moves off-screen the characters Paul, Eve and Jill (who were originally intended to be regulars), as the network wanted a more diverse group of travelers. Also, a subplot involving the travelers finding a 1940s Air Force pilot held prisoner by 16th century pirates was removed from the first episode.\n\nThe show benefited from a larger than normal amount of location filming, with familiar sites such as the Hollywood Hills, Zuma Beach, the Bonaventure Hotel in LA and Griffith Park Observatory all appearing in various episodes. The character Willaway was created specifically with Roddy McDowall in mind. Fortunately the actor was interested and took the role when approached.\n\nAlthough airing in a time when the nation's interest in the Bermuda Triangle, UFOs and fantasy was at a height, the show failed to last beyond the ten episodes, having been scheduled as a mid-season replacement (following the failure of another fantasy series, \"Gemini Man\") against \"The Waltons\" and \"Welcome Back, Kotter\", both very popular family shows. NBC ordered 12 episodes to follow the revised pilot, but production ended early when it was apparent that the ratings were low. The show was either pre-empted or its time-slot changed several times during its short run. By its tenth episode, its ratings had dropped, and it was cancelled. The script for an unproduced eleventh episode, \"Romulus\", circulates on the Internet. Within a few months of its abrupt ending, several of the production team would be producing the thematically similar \"Logan's Run\" for the Fall 1977 season.\n\n"}

{"id": "862061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=862061", "title": "Wide Area Augmentation System", "text": "Wide Area Augmentation System\n\nThe Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is an air navigation aid developed by the Federal Aviation Administration to augment the Global Positioning System (GPS), with the goal of improving its accuracy, integrity, and availability. Essentially, WAAS is intended to enable aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of flight, including precision approaches to any airport within its coverage area. It may be further enhanced with the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) also known by the preferred ICAO term Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) in critical areas.\n\nWAAS uses a network of ground-based reference stations, in North America and Hawaii, to measure small variations in the GPS satellites' signals in the western hemisphere. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) and send the correction messages to geostationary WAAS satellites in a timely manner (every 5 seconds or better). Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where WAAS-enabled GPS receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve accuracy.\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) calls this type of system a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS). Europe and Asia are developing their own SBASs, the Indian GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN), the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), respectively. Commercial systems include StarFire and OmniSTAR.\n\nThe WAAS specification requires it to provide a position accuracy of or less (for both lateral and vertical measurements), at least 95% of the time. Actual performance measurements of the system at specific locations have shown it typically provides better than laterally and vertically throughout most of the contiguous United States and large parts of Canada and Alaska. With these results, WAAS is capable of achieving the required Category I precision approach accuracy of laterally and vertically.\n\nIntegrity of a navigation system includes the ability to provide timely warnings when its signal is providing misleading data that could potentially create hazards. The WAAS specification requires the system detect errors in the GPS or WAAS network and notify users within 6.2 seconds. Certifying that WAAS is safe for instrument flight rules (IFR) (i.e. flying in the clouds) requires proving there is only an extremely small probability that an error exceeding the requirements for accuracy will go undetected. Specifically, the probability is stated as 1×10, and is equivalent to no more than 3 seconds of bad data per year. This provides integrity information equivalent to or better than Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM).\n\nAvailability is the probability that a navigation system meets the accuracy and integrity requirements. Before the advent of WAAS, GPS specifications allowed for system unavailability for as much as a total time of four days per year (99% availability). The WAAS specification mandates availability as 99.999% (five nines) throughout the service area, equivalent to a downtime of just over 5 minutes per year.\n\nAs with GPS in general, WAAS is composed of three main segments: the ground segment, space segment, and user segment.\n\nThe ground segment is composed of multiple Wide-area Reference Stations (WRS). These precisely surveyed ground stations monitor and collect information on the GPS signals, then send their data to three Wide-area Master Stations (WMS) using a terrestrial communications network. The reference stations also monitor signals from WAAS geostationary satellites, providing integrity information regarding them as well. As of October 2007 there were 38 WRSs: twenty in the contiguous United States (CONUS), seven in Alaska, one in Hawaii, one in Puerto Rico, five in Mexico, and four in Canada.\n\nUsing the data from the WRS sites, the WMSs generate two different sets of corrections: fast and slow. The fast corrections are for errors which are changing rapidly and primarily concern the GPS satellites' instantaneous positions and clock errors. These corrections are considered user position-independent, which means they can be applied instantly by any receiver inside the WAAS broadcast footprint. The slow corrections include long-term ephemeric and clock error estimates, as well as ionospheric delay information. WAAS supplies delay corrections for a number of points (organized in a grid pattern) across the WAAS service area (see User Segment, below, to understand how these corrections are used).\n\nOnce these correction messages are generated, the WMSs send them to two pairs of Ground Uplink Stations (GUS), which then transmit to satellites in the Space segment for rebroadcast to the User segment.\n\nEach FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center in the 50 states has a WAAS reference station, except for Indianapolis. There are also stations positioned in Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. See List of WAAS reference stations for the coordinates of the individual receiving antennas.\n\nThe space segment consists of multiple communication satellites which broadcast the correction messages generated by the WAAS Master Stations for reception by the user segment. The satellites also broadcast the same type of range information as normal GPS satellites, effectively increasing the number of satellites available for a position fix. The space segment consists of three commercial satellites: \"Inmarsat-4 F3\", Telesat's \"Anik F1R\", and Intelsat's \"Galaxy 15\". A fourth satellite, Eutelsat 117 West B, is currently in testing and is scheduled to go live in 2018.\n\nThe original two WAAS satellites, named \"Pacific Ocean Region\" (POR) and \"Atlantic Ocean Region-West\" (AOR-W), were leased space on Inmarsat III satellites. These satellites ceased WAAS transmissions on July 31, 2007. With the end of the Inmarsat lease approaching, two new satellites (Galaxy 15 and Anik F1R) were launched in late 2005. Galaxy 15 is a PanAmSat, and Anik F1R is a Telesat. As with the previous satellites, these are leased services under the FAA's Geostationary Satellite Communications Control Segment contract with Lockheed Martin for WAAS geostationary satellite leased services, who is contracted to provide up to three satellites through the year 2016. A third satellite was later added to the system. From March to November 2010, the FAA broadcast a WAAS test signal on a leased transponder on the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite. The test signal was not usable for navigation, but could be received and was reported with the identification numbers PRN 133 (NMEA #46). In November 2010, the signal was certified as operational and made available for navigation.\nIn the table above, PRN is the satellite's actual Pseudo-Random Noise code. NMEA is the satellite number sent by some receivers when outputting satellite information. ( NMEA = PRN - 87 ).\n\nThe user segment is the GPS and WAAS receiver, which uses the information broadcast from each GPS satellite to determine its location and the current time, and receives the WAAS corrections from the Space segment. The two types of correction messages received (fast and slow) are used in different ways.\n\nThe GPS receiver can immediately apply the fast type of correction data, which includes the corrected satellite position and clock data, and determines its current location using normal GPS calculations. Once an approximate position fix is obtained the receiver begins to use the slow corrections to improve its accuracy. Among the slow correction data is the ionospheric delay. As the GPS signal travels from the satellite to the receiver, it passes through the ionosphere. The receiver calculates the location where the signal pierced the ionosphere and, if it has received an ionospheric delay value for that location, corrects for the error the ionosphere created.\n\nWhile the slow data can be updated every minute if necessary, ephemeris errors and ionosphere errors do not change this frequently, so they are only updated every two minutes and are considered valid for up to six minutes.\n\nThe WAAS was jointly developed by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the Federal Radionavigation Program (DOT-VNTSC-RSPA-95-1/DOD-4650.5), beginning in 1994, to provide performance comparable to category 1 instrument landing system (ILS) for all aircraft possessing the appropriately certified equipment. Without WAAS, ionospheric disturbances, clock drift, and satellite orbit errors create too much error and uncertainty in the GPS signal to meet the requirements for a precision approach (see GPS sources of error). A precision approach includes altitude information and provides course guidance, distance from the runway, and elevation information at all points along the approach, usually down to lower altitudes and weather minimums than non-precision approaches.\n\nPrior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did not have the ability to provide lateral and vertical navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a precision approach both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge antenna systems at each airport.\n\nFor some time the FAA and NASA developed a much improved system, the microwave landing system (MLS). The entire MLS system for a particular approach was isolated in one or two boxes located beside the runway, dramatically reducing the cost of implementation. MLS also offered a number of practical advantages that eased traffic considerations, both for aircraft and radio channels. Unfortunately, MLS would also require every airport and aircraft to upgrade their equipment.\n\nDuring the development of MLS, consumer GPS receivers of various quality started appearing. GPS offered a huge number of advantages to the pilot, combining all of an aircraft's long-distance navigation systems into a single easy-to-use system, often small enough to be hand held. Deploying an aircraft navigation system based on GPS was largely a problem of developing new techniques and standards, as opposed to new equipment. The FAA started planning to shut down their existing long-distance systems (VOR and NDBs) in favor of GPS. This left the problem of approaches, however. GPS is simply not accurate enough to replace ILS systems. Typical accuracy is about , whereas even a \"CAT I\" approach, the least demanding, requires a vertical accuracy of .\n\nThis inaccuracy in GPS is mostly due to large \"billows\" in the ionosphere, which slow the radio signal from the satellites by a random amount. Since GPS relies on timing the signals to measure distances, this slowing of the signal makes the satellite appear farther away. The billows move slowly, and can be characterized using a variety of methods from the ground, or by examining the GPS signals themselves. By broadcasting this information to GPS receivers every minute or so, this source of error can be significantly reduced.\n\nThis led to the concept of Differential GPS, which used separate radio systems to broadcast the correction signal to receivers. Aircraft could then install a receiver which would be plugged into the GPS unit, the signal being broadcast on a variety of frequencies for different users (FM radio for cars, longwave for ships, etc.). Broadcasters of the required power generally cluster around larger cities, making such DGPS systems less useful for wide-area navigation. Additionally, most radio signals are either line-of-sight, or can be distorted by the ground, which made DGPS difficult to use as a precision approach system or when flying low for other reasons.\n\nThe FAA considered systems that could allow the same correction signals to be broadcast over a much wider area, such as from a satellite, leading directly to WAAS. Since a GPS unit already consists of a satellite receiver, it made much more sense to send out the correction signals on the same frequencies used by GPS units, than to use an entirely separate system and thereby double the probability of failure. In addition to lowering implementation costs by \"piggybacking\" on a planned satellite launch, this also allowed the signal to be broadcast from geostationary orbit, which meant a small number of satellites could cover all of North America.\n\nOn July 10, 2003, the WAAS signal was activated for general aviation, covering 95% of the United States, and portions of Alaska offering minimums.\n\nOn January 17, 2008, Alabama-based Hickok & Associates became the first designer of helicopter WAAS with Localizer Performance (LP) and Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) approaches, and the only entity with FAA-approved criteria (which even FAA has yet to develop). This helicopter WAAS criteria offers as low as 250 foot minimums and decreased visibility requirements to enable missions previously not possible. On April 1, 2009, FAA AFS-400 approved the first three helicopter WAAS GPS approach procedures for Hickok & Associates' customer California Shock/Trauma Air Rescue (CALSTAR). Since then they have designed many approved WAAS helicopter approaches for various EMS hospitals and air providers, within the United States as well as in other countries and continents.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, Seattle-based Horizon Air flew the first scheduled-passenger service flight using WAAS with LPV on flight 2014, a Portland to Seattle flight operated by a Bombardier Q400 with a WAAS FMS from Universal Avionics. The airline, in partnership with the FAA, will outfit seven Q400-aircraft with WAAS and share flight data to better determine the suitability of WAAS in scheduled air service applications.\n\nWAAS addresses all of the \"navigation problem\", providing highly accurate positioning that is extremely easy to use, for the cost of a single receiver installed on the aircraft. Ground- and space-based infrastructure is relatively limited, and no on-airport system is needed. WAAS allows a precision approach to be published for any airport, for the cost of developing the procedures and publishing the new approach plates. This means that almost any airport can have a precision approach and the cost of implementation is dramatically reduced.\n\nAdditionally WAAS works just as well between airports. This allows the aircraft to fly directly from one airport to another, as opposed to following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because of its ability to provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite's information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower en-route altitudes than was possible with ground-based systems, which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on ground-based systems. For unpressurized aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.\n\nThe above benefits create not only convenience, but also have the potential to generate significant cost savings. The cost to provide the WAAS signal, serving all 5,400 public use airports, is just under US$50 million per year. In comparison, the current ground based systems such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS), installed at only 600 airports, cost US$82 million in annual maintenance. Without ground navigation hardware to purchase, the total cost of publishing a runway's WAAS approach is approximately US$50,000; compared to the $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 cost to install an ILS radio system.\n\nFurther savings can come from the nighttime closure of airport towers with a low volume of traffic. The FAA is reviewing 48 towers for such a potential reduction of services, which it estimates will save around US$100,000 per year at each tower, for a total annual savings of nearly US$5 million.\n\nFor all its benefits, WAAS is not without drawbacks and critical limitations:\n\nIn 2007, WAAS vertical guidance was projected to be available nearly all the time (greater than 99%), and its coverage encompasses the full continental U.S., most of Alaska, northern Mexico, and southern Canada. At that time, the accuracy of WAAS would meet or exceed the requirements for Category 1 ILS approaches, namely, three-dimensional position information down to 200 feet (60 m) above touchdown zone elevation.\n\nSoftware improvements, to be implemented by September 2008, significantly improve signal availability of vertical guidance throughout the CONUS and Alaska. Area covered by the 95% available LPV solution in Alaska improves from 62% to 86%. And in the CONUS, the 100% availability LPV-200 coverage rises from 48% to 84%, with 100% coverage of the LPV solution.\n\nBoth Galaxy XV (PRN #135) and Anik F1R (PRN #138) contain an L1 & L5 GPS payload. This means they will potentially be usable with the L5 modernized GPS signals when the new signals and receivers become available. With L5, avionics will be able to use a combination of signals to provide the most accurate service possible, thereby increasing availability of the service. These avionics systems will use ionospheric corrections broadcast by WAAS, or self-generated onboard dual frequency corrections, depending on which one is more accurate.\n\n\n"}
