It was discovered on 21 September 1987, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. The asteroid was named for the Scottish University of Aberdeen.\n\nThe S-type asteroid is a member of the Koronis family, a group consisting of about 200 known bodies with nearly ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,743 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nIn 1954, a first precovery was obtained at Palomar Observatory, extending the body's observation arc by 33 years prior to its official discovery at Anderson Mesa.\n\nIn October 2011, a rotational lightcurve of \"Aberdonia\" was obtained from photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nAccording to the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, \"Aberdonia\" measures 8.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.25, while the \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link\" assumes an albedo of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 8.2 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.6.\n\nThis minor planet was named for the Scottish University of Aberdeen on its 500th anniversary in 1995. James Clerk Maxwell and George Paget Thomson are the university's best known former holders of chairs of natural philosophy.\n\nThe university is also known for its first chair of medicine in the English-speaking world, and for having taught astronomy already in the late 16th century. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 February 1995 .\n\n"}

It follows an approximate east-west route from near Heathfield, East Sussex to the city of Winchester, Hampshire.\n\nThe eastern end of the A272 starts at a junction with the A267, north-west of the village of Cross In Hand, East Sussex. It heads west, crossing the A26 and A22 north of Uckfield, and continues through Newick before going over the border into West Sussex at a point east of Scaynes Hill. It then bypasses the town of Haywards Heath and continues west, crossing the main London-Brighton A23 road at Bolney.\n\nThe route continues, crossing the A24 and passing through a number of villages and small towns in West Sussex, such as Billingshurst, Petworth and Midhurst. It then crosses the county boundary into Hampshire and reaches Petersfield, where it crosses the A3 to the west of the town. The final section passes the National Trust property of Hinton Ampner and rises high on to the Hampshire downs, passing Cheesefoot Head, before descending to merge with the A31 at Chilcomb to the east of Winchester. \n\nIn former years, the A272 continued north-west from Winchester to Stockbridge, but this section has now been redesignated as the B3049. Today, after it re-emerges from the A31 to run north to the Winnall Roundabout, Junction 9 of the M3. Here it merges with the A34, passing east and north of Winchester (with limited access to the A33 northbound), before re-emerging near Littleton. It then runs NW along the Andover Road (formerly B3420), terminating at the A30, an overall length of . To the north the B3420 continues across the River Test to Wherwell and Andover.\n\nThe A272's route is predominantly rural, despite being only from the centre of London at its nearest point. Most of the time it passes through countryside, villages and small towns, and the only built-up area of any size that it traverses is Haywards Heath and its surrounding villages. Also, it has virtually no dual carriageway sections (just three very short sections between Petworth and Midhurst), and therefore gives the driver an experience which is reminiscent of English country roads as they were 50 or more years ago.\n\nWhile it has been said that the A272 follows part of the route that was taken by pilgrims travelling between the cathedral cities of Winchester and Canterbury it is unlikely because, for most of its length, it passes through the low weald of Sussex. Prior to the development of modern roads, this was difficult for travellers, because of the extensive forest and tracts of low-lying marshy ground. The more likely route was the Pilgrims' Way, which followed the chalk escarpment of the North Downs.\n\nThe road is the subject of a book by the Dutch author Pieter Boogaart: \"A272 - An Ode to a Road\" (Pallas Athene, 2000).\n\n"}

{"id": "17271126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17271126", "title": "Britain (place name)", "text": "Britain (place name)\n\nThe term Britain is a linguistic descendant (reflex) of one of the oldest known names for Great Britain, an island off the north-western coast of continental Europe. The terms Briton and British, similarly derived, refer to its inhabitants and, to varying extents, the smaller islands in the vicinity. \"British Isles\" is the only ancient name for these islands to survive in general usage.\n\n\"Britain\" comes from , via Old French ' and Middle English ', possibly influenced by Old English \"\", probably also from Latin \"Brittania\", ultimately an adaptation of the Common Brittonic name for the island, \"*Pritanī\".\n\nAn early written reference to the British Isles may derive from the works of the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia; later Greek writers such as Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo who quote Pytheas' use of variants such as (), \"The Britannic [land, island]\", and , \"Britannic islands\", with \"\" being a Celtic word that might mean \"the painted ones\" or \"the tattooed folk\", referring to body decoration (see below).\n\nThe modern Welsh name for the island is '. This may demonstrate that the original Common Brittonic form had initial P- not B- (which would give **\"Brydain\") and -t- not -tt- (else **\"Prythain\"). This may be explained as containing a stem *\"prit-\" (Welsh ', Old Irish '; < Proto-Celtic '), meaning \"shape, form\", combined with an adjectival suffix. This leaves us with *\"Pritanī\".\n\nThe first known written use of the word was an ancient Greek transliteration of the original P-Celtic term. It is believed to have appeared within a periplus written in about 325 BC by the geographer and explorer Pytheas of Massalia, but no copies of this work survive. The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors, such as those within Diodorus of Sicily's history (c. 60 BC to 30 BC), Strabo's Geographica (c. 7 BC to AD 19) and Pliny's Natural History (AD 77). According to Strabo, Pytheas referred to Britain as \"Bretannikē\", which is treated a feminine noun. Although technically an adjective (\"the Britannic\" or \"British\") it may have been a case of noun ellipsis, a common mechanism in ancient Greek. This term along with other relevant ones, subsequently appeared inter alia in the following works:\n\nAs seen above, the original spelling of the term is disputed. Ancient manuscripts alternated between the use of the \"P-\" and the \"B-\", and many linguists believe Pytheas's original manuscript used \"P-\" (\"Prettania\") rather than \"B-\". Although \"B-\" is more common in these manuscripts, many modern authors quote the Greek or Latin with a \"P-\" and attribute the \"B-\" to changes by the Romans in the time of Julius Caesar; the relevant, attested sometimes later, change of the spelling of the word(s) in Greek, as is also sometimes done in modern Greek, from being written with a double tau to being written with a double nu, is likewise also explained by Roman influence, from the aforementioned change in the spelling in Latin. For example, linguist Karl Schmidt states that the \"name of the island was originally transmitted as Πρεττανία (with Π instead of Β) ... as is confirmed by its etymology\".\n\nAccording to Barry Cunliffe:\n\nFollowing Julius Caesar's expeditions to the island in 55 and 54 BC, \"Brit(t)an(n)ia\" was predominantly used to refer simply to the island of Great Britain. After the Roman conquest under the Emperor Claudius in AD 43, it came to be used to refer to the Roman province of Britain (later two provinces), which at one stage consist of part of the island of Great Britain south of Hadrian's wall.\n\nIn Old English or Anglo-Saxon, the Graeco-Latin term referring to Britain entered in the form of \"Bryttania\", as attested by Alfred the Great's translation of Orosius' \"Seven Books of History Against the Pagans\".\n\nThe Latin name \"Britannia\" re-entered the language through the Old French '. The use of \"Britons\" for the inhabitants of Great Britain is derived from the Old French \"bretun\", the term for the people and language of Brittany, itself derived from Latin and Greek, e.g. the of Procopius. It was introduced into Middle English as ' in the late 13th century.\n\nThere is much conflation of the terms United Kingdom, Great Britain, Britain, and England. In many ways accepted usage allows some of these to overlap, but some common usages are incorrect.\n\nThe term \"Britain\" is widely used as a common name for the sovereign state of the \"United Kingdom\", or UK for short. The United Kingdom includes three countries on the largest island, which can be called \"the island of Britain\" or \"Great Britain\": these are England, Scotland and Wales. However the United Kingdom also includes Northern Ireland on the neighbouring island of Ireland, the remainder of which is not part of the United Kingdom. \"England\" is not synonymous with \"Britain\", \"Great Britain\", or \"United Kingdom\".\n\nThe classical writer, Ptolemy, referred to the larger island as \"great Britain\" (\"megale Bretannia\") and to Ireland as \"little Britain\" (\"mikra Brettania\") in his work, \"Almagest\" (147–148 AD). In his later work, \"Geography\" (c. 150 AD), he gave these islands the names Ἀλουίωνος (\"Alwiōnos\"), Ἰουερνίας (\"Iwernias\"), and \"Mona\" (the Isle of Man), suggesting these may have been native names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing \"Almagest\". The name \"Albion\" appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the Roman conquest of Great Britain, after which \"Britain\" became the more commonplace name for the island called Great Britain.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Saxon period, \"Britain\" was used as a historical term only. Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"c.\" 1136) refers to the\nisland of Great Britain as \"Britannia major\" (\"Greater Britain\"), to distinguish it from \"Britannia minor\" (\"Lesser Britain\"), the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany, which had been settled in the fifth and sixth centuries by Celtic migrants from the British Isles. The term \"Great Britain\" was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily the daughter of Edward IV of England, and James the son of James III of Scotland, which described it as \"this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee\". As noted above it was used again in 1604, when King James VI and I styled himself \"King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland\".\n\nThe term \"Great Britain\" later served to distinguish the large island of Britain from the French region of Brittany (in French \"Grande-Bretagne\" and \"Bretagne\" respectively). With the Acts of Union 1707 it became the official name of the new state created by the union of the Kingdom of England (which then included Wales) with the Kingdom of Scotland, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1801, the name of the country was changed to \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\", recognising that Ireland had ceased to be a distinct kingdom and was incorporated into the union. After Irish independence in the early 20th century, the name was changed to \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\", which is still the official name. In contemporary usage therefore, \"Great Britain\", while synonymous with the island of Britain, and capable of being used to refer politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination, is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole. For example, the term \"Team GB\" and \"Great Britain\" were used to refer to the United Kingdom's Olympic team in 2012 and this usage created controversy as some interpreted it as excluding Northern Ireland. The demonym for a citizen of the United Kingdom is \"British\".\n\n"}

In other words, 1 B is equal to 1 meter in 1,000,000 years, 1 millimeter in 1,000 years, or one micrometer per year. It was defined in 1969.\n\nThe Bubnoff unit is employed in geology to measure rates of lowering of earth surfaces due to erosion and is named after the Russian (German-Baltic) geologist Serge von Bubnoff (1888–1957). An erosion speed of 1 B also means that 1 m³ of earth is being removed from an area of 1 km² in 1 year. Compared to everyday phenomena, erosion is under most circumstances (excluding rapid events like landslides) an extremely slow process, calling for such a specialized unit. For instance, the current average rate of erosion over the Earth's landmasses has been estimated at 30 B (30 m in a million years). There are, however, great regional differences in erosion speed. As an extreme example the watershed area of the Semani River in Albania is eroding at a rate of almost 3000 B (3 millimeters per year), the river having been estimated to transport about 4600 tons of earth per year from the average square kilometer in its watershed.\n\nThe Bubnoff unit was introduced because of a desire for a standard unit to replace the multitude of units in use, such as feet per year, centimeters per year, meters per decade, and so on. One criticism leveled was that by introducing the Bubnoff unit, it would obscure the rate of erosion behind a unit no one besides specialists understood.\n"}

Geoportals are important for effective use of geographic information systems (GIS) and a key element of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI).\n\nGeographic information providers, including government agencies and commercial sources, use geoportals to publish descriptions (geospatial metadata) of their geographic information. Geographic information consumers, professional or casual, use geoportals to search and access the information they need. Thus geoportals serve an increasingly important role in the sharing of geographic information and can avoid duplicated efforts, inconsistencies, delays, confusion, and wasted resources.\n\nThe United States National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), started in 1994 (see OMB Circular A-16), is considered the earliest geoportal concept. The U.S. Federal Geospatial Data Committee (FGDC) coordinated development of the NSDI Clearinghouse Network, the first large geoportal. It has many distributed catalogs that can be searched via a client interface.\n\nFirst released in 2003, the Geospatial One-Stop (GOS) geoportal was developed as part of a U.S. e-government initiative. Unlike the NSDI Clearinghouse Network, GOS was built around a centralized metadata catalog database, with an architecture that links users to data providers through a Web-based geoportal. The user of GOS may employ a simple Web browser (thin client) or may interface directly with a GIS (thick client).\n\nMore recently, there has been a proliferation of geoportals for sharing of geographic information based on region or theme. Examples include the INSPIRE, or Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community geoportal, the NatCarb geoportal, which provides geographic information concerning carbon sequestration in the United States, and UNSDI, the United Nations Spatial Data Infrastructure.\n\nModern web-based geoportals include direct access to raw data in multiple formats, complete metadata, online visualization tools so users can create maps with data in the portal, automated provenance linkages across users, datasets and created maps, commenting mechanisms to discuss data quality and interpretation, and sharing or exporting created maps in various formats. Open portals allow user contribution of datasets as well.\n\nIn September 2011, GOS was retired and the content it included by then became part of the broader open data site (Geo.)Data.gov. At the same time, the United States federal government launched the Geospatial Platform, which represents a shift from focusing on cataloging references to resources, to providing shared web services for national significant datasets, API for developers, and end-user applications (built on those web services and API).\n\n\nFu, P., and J.

Even in Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar, around 62% of the population live in such districts. However, only about 43% of the ger district residents in Ulaanbaatar actually live in gers. Some of the districts in Ulaanbaatar have existed for more than 100 years, for example the one around Gandan, but many of those farther away from the city centre are the result of recent migration and the high price of other accommodation in Ulaanbaatar.\n\nAn oft-cited problem of ger districts in Ulaanbaatar and a number of other larger Mongolian cities is the air pollution (especially in winter) caused by the use of simple iron stoves for cooking and heating.\n"}

{"id": "2333588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2333588", "title": "John Crawfurd", "text": "John Crawfurd\n\nDr John Crawfurd (13 August 1783 – 11 May 1868) was a Scottish physician, colonial administrator and diplomat, and author. He is now best known for his work on Asian languages, his \"History of the Indian Archipelago\", and his role in founding Singapore as the last British Resident of Singapore; the position of Resident was replaced by the Governor of the Straits Settlements.\n\nHe was born on Islay, in Argyll, Scotland, the son of Samuel Crawfurd, a physician, and Margaret Campbell; and was educated at the school in Bowmore. He followed his father's footsteps in the study of medicine and completed his medical course at the University of Edinburgh in 1803, at the age of 20.\nCrawfurd joined the East India Company, as a Company surgeon, and was posted to India's Northwestern Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), working in the area around Delhi and Agra from 1803–1808. He saw service in the campaigns of Baron Lake.\n\nCrawfurd was sent in 1808 to Penang, where he applied himself to the study of the Malay language and culture. In Penang he met Stamford Raffles for the first time.\n\nIn 1811, Crawfurd accompanied Raffles on Lord Minto's Java Invasion, which overcame the Dutch. Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Java by Minto during the 45-day operation, and Crawfurd was appointed the post of Resident Governor at the Court of Yogyakarta in November 1811. There he took a firm line against Sultan Hamengkubuwana II. The Sultan was encouraged by Pakubuwono IV of Surakarta to assume he had support in resisting the British; who sided with his opponents his son the Crown Prince and Pangeran Natsukusuma. The Sultan's palace, the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat, was besieged and taken by British-led forces in June 1812. \n\nAs Resident, Crawfurd also pursued the study of the Javanese language, and cultivated personal relationships with Javanese aristocrats and literati. He was impressed by Javanese music.\n\nCrawfurd was sent on diplomatic missions to Bali and the Celebes (now Sulawesi). His knowledge of the local culture supported Raffles's government in Java. Raffles, however, wanted to introduce land reform in the Cheribon residency. Crawfurd, with his experience of India and the \"zamindari\", was a supporter of the \"village system\" of revenue collection. He opposed Raffles's attempts to introduce individual (\"ryotwari\") settlement into Java.\n\nJava was returned to the Dutch in 1816, and Crawfurd went back to England that year, shortly becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society, and turning to writing. Within a few years he was recalled to South-East Asia, as a diplomat; his missions were of limited obvious success.\n\nIn 1821, the then Governor-General of India, Lord Hastings, sent Crawfurd to the courts of Siam (now Thailand) and Cochinchina (now Vietnam.) Lord Hastings was especially interested in learning more about Siamese policy with regard to the northern Malay states, and Cochinchina's policy with regard to French efforts to establish a presence in Asia. \nCrawfurd travelled with notes from Horace Hayman Wilson on Buddhism, as it was understood at the time. \nCaptain Dangerfield of the Indian army, a skilful astronomer, surveyor and geologist, served as assistant; Lieutenant Rutherford commanded thirty Sepoys; noted naturalist George Finlayson served as medical officer. Mrs. Crawfurd accompanied the Mission.\n\n21 November 1821, the mission embarked on the \"John Adam\" for the complicated and difficult navigation of the Hoogly river, taking seven days to sail the 140 miles (225 km.) from Calcutta to open water. Crawfurd writes that, with the assistance of a steam-boat, ships might be towed down in two days without difficulty; then adds in a footnote: \"The first steam-vessel used in India, was built about three years after this passage was written...\"\n\nThe \"John Adam\" proceeded on what would be the first official visit to Siam since the resurgence of Siam following the Burmese–Siamese War of 1765–1767. Crawfurd soon found the court of King Rama II still embroiled in the aftermath of the Burmese–Siamese War of 1809–1812. On 8 December 1821, near Papra Strait (modern Pak Prah Strait north of Thalang District) Crawfurd finds fishermen \"in a state of perpetual distrust and insecurity\" due to territorial disputes between hostile Burmans and Siamese. 11 December, after entering the Straits of Malacca and arrival at Penang Island, he finds the settlements of Penang and Queda (modern Kedah Sultanate, founded in 1136, but then a tributary state of Siam) in a state of alarm. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II, the Rajah of Quedah had fled the Rajah of Ligor (modern Nakhon Si Thammarat) to claim right of asylum at Prince of Wales's Island (modern Penang.) British claim to the island was based upon payment of a quit-rent accordant with European feudal law, which Crawfurd feared the Siamese would challenge.\n\nCrawfurd's journal entry for 1 April 1822, notes that the Siamese, for their part, were especially interested in the acquisition of arms. Pointedly questioned in this regard in a urgent private meeting with the Prah-klang (future Rama III), the reply was, \"that if the Siamese were at peace with the friends and neighbours of the British nation, they would certainly be permitted to purchase fire-arms and ammunition at our ports, but not otherwise.\" On 19 May, a Chief of Lao (Chao Anu, a king in what is now Laos and soon-to-be rebel) met with Crawfurd, a first diplomatic contact for the UK. This visit was despite the isolation into which the mission had fallen. A Vietnamese embassy had arrived not long before, and tensions were high. Since Crawford's brief opposed the interests of court figures including the Raja of Ligor and Nangklao, there was little prospect of success. By October relations were at a low ebb. Crawfurd moved on to Saigon, but Minh Mạng refused to see him.\n\nCrawfurd was appointed British Resident of Singapore in March 1823. He was under orders to reduce the expenditure on the existing factory there, but instead responded to local commercial representations, and spent money on reclamation work on the river. He also concluded the final agreement between the East India Company, and Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor with the Temenggong, on the status of Singapore on 2 August 1824. It was the culmination of negotiations started by Raffles in 1819, and the agreement is now sometimes called the Crawfurd Treaty. He also had input into the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 dealing with spheres of influence in the East Indies.\n\nCrawfurd was on familiar terms with Munshi Abdullah. He edited and contributed to the \"Singapore Chronicle\" of Francis James Bernard, the first local newspaper that initially appeared dated 1 January 1824. Crawford Street and Crawford Bridge in Singapore are named after him.\n\nCrawfurd was sent on another envoy mission to Burma in 1826, by Hastings's successor Lord Amherst, in the aftermath of the First Anglo-Burmese War. It was to be his last political service for the Company. The party included Adoniram Judson as interpreter and Nathaniel Wallich as botanist. Crawfurd's journey to Ava up the River Irrawaddy was by paddle steamer, the \"Diana\": it had been hired by the East India Company for the war, where it had seen action and travelled 400 miles up the Irrawaddy. There were five local boats, and soldiers making up a party of over 50.\n\nCrawfurd at the court found Bagyidaw temporising despite a weak position with the British forces in Arakan and Tenasserim. The king conceded only a trade agreement, in return for a delay in indemnity payments; and sent his own mission to Calcutta.\n\nThe expedition fortuitously was delayed on the return journey for repairs. Crawfurd collected significant fossils, north of Magwe on the left bank of the river, in seven chests. Back in London, William Clift identified a new species of mastodon (more accurately Stegolophodon) from them; Hugh Falconer also worked on the collection. The finds, of fossil bones and wood, were discussed further in a paper by William Buckland, giving details; and they brought Crawfurd the friendship of Roderick Murchison, Foreign Secretary of the Geological Society. There were also collected 18,000 botanical specimens, many of which went to the Calcutta Botanic Garden.\nIn the United Kingdom, Crawfurd spent around 40 years in varied activities. He wrote as an orientalist, geographer and ethnologist. He tried parliamentary politics, without success; he agitated for free trade; and he was a publicist for and against colonisation schemes, in line with his views. He also represented the interests of British traders based in Singapore and Calcutta.\n\nCrawfurd made several unsuccessful attempts to enter the British Parliament in the 1830s. His campaign literature featured universal suffrage and the secret ballot, free trade and opposition to monopolies, public education and reduction of military spending, and opposition to regressive taxation and the taxation of Dissenters for a state church, with nationalisation of Church of England properties. He joined the Parliamentary Candidate Society, founded by Thomas Erskine Perry (his brother-in-law), to promote \"fit and proper\" Members of Parliament. He also joined the Radical Club, a breakaway from the National Political Union founded in 1833 by William Wallis.\n\nCrawfurd unsuccessfully contested, as an advanced radical, Glasgow in 1832, Paisley in 1834, Stirling Burghs in 1835, and Preston in 1837. At Glasgow he polled fourth (there were two MPs for the borough), with Sir Daniel Sandford third. In March 1834 it was Sandford who was elected at Paisley. \"Alexander's East India and Colonial Magazine\" struck a note of regret after his defeat at Stirling Burghs.\n\nOn 31 January 1834 Crawfurd supported Thomas Perronet Thompson in a meeting agitating against the Corn Laws. Thomas Carlyle alluded, in notes on one of Jane Welsh Carlyle's letters, to Crawfurd speaking at a radical meeting at the London Tavern set up by Charles Buller on 21 November 1834; in which he showed much more originality than John Arthur Roebuck, but lost his thread.\n\nIn Preston in the 1837 general election Crawfurd had the Liberal nomination in a three-cornered fight for two seats, as Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood was regarded as a waverer by the Conservatives who ran Robert Townley Parker against him; but he polled third. He also supported John Temple Leader's candidacy at Westminster against Sir Francis Burdett, being deputy chairman on his election committee (with Thomas Prout, chairman Sir Ronald Craufurd Ferguson). Crawfurd spoke with George Grote at a meeting for Leader at the Belgrave Hotel.\n\nA lifelong advocate of free trade policies, in \"A View of the Present State and Future Prospects of the Free Trade and Colonization of India\" (1829), Crawfurd made an extended case against the East India Company's approach, in particular in excluding British entrepreneurs, and in failing to develop Indian cotton. He had had experience in Java of the export possibilities for cotton textiles. He then gave evidence in March 1830 to a parliamentary committee, on the East India Company's monopoly of trade with China. Robert Montgomery Martin criticised Crawfurd, and the evidence of Robert Rickards, an ex-employee of the Company, for exaggerating the financial burden of the monopoly on tea. Crawfurd put out a pamphlet, \"Chinese Monopoly Examined\". Ross Donnelly Mangles defended the East India Company in 1830, in an answer addressed to Rickards and Crawfurd. When the Company's charter came up for renewal in 1833, the China trade monopoly was broken. Crawfurd's part as parliamentary agent for interests in Calcutta had been paid (at £1500 per year); his publicity work had included facts for an \"Edinburgh Review\" article written by another author.\n\nIn reviewing Edward Gibbon Wakefield's \"New British Province of South Australia\", and subsequent writing in the \"Westminster Review\", Crawfurd gave an opinion against systematic colonisation. He considered that abundant land and individual enterprise were the necessary elements. Robert Torrens, who floated the South Australian Land Company, replied to the \"Westminster Review\" line in \"Colonization of South Australia\" (1835). Part I of the book is a \"Letter\" to Crawfurd.\n\nIn 1843 Crawfurd gave evidence to the Colonial Office on Port Essington, on the north coast of Australia, to the effect that its climate made it unsuitable for settlement. He returned to the topic in a debate in 1858 on settlements on the Victoria River, as had been suggested by Sir George Everest. He generally opposed Sir Roderick Murchison's promotion of European colonisation of Australia, as far as it applied to the north coast.\n\nWhen the Stamp Act 1827 was passed, meaning that all public documents in India would have to pay a stamp tax (including newspapers as well as legal documents), Crawfurd was hired as London agent for a group of British merchants in Calcutta opposing the legislation. Crawfurd involved Joseph Hume, and he obtained newspaper coverage for his cause, including in \"The Examiner\" where the precedents from America were cited. He also wrote pamphlets himself, in which he advocated an end to the East India Company monopoly, and European colonisation. These moves occurred in 1828–9; in 1830 Crawfurd approached William Huskisson directly. His lobbying continued with the free trade issues mentioned above. \"Inquiry into the System of Taxation in India, Letters on the Interior of India, an attack on the newspaper stamp-tax and the duty on paper entitled Taxes on Knowledge\" (1836) is a related work.\n\nIn 1855 Crawfurd went with a delegation to the Board of Control of the East India Company, with representations on behalf of the Straits dollar as an independent currency. Crawfurd lobbied in both Houses of Parliament, with George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle acting to bring a petition to the Lords, and William Ewart Gladstone putting the case in the Commons. Among the arguments put was that the dollar was a decimal currency, while the rupee used by traders, and legal tender in East India Company territories since it was coined in 1835, was not. In 1856 a Bill to change the status quo on coins minted and issued from India was defeated.\n\nIn 1868 Crawfurd with James Guthrie and William Paterson formed the Straits Settlements Association, to protect the colony's interests. Crawfurd was its first President.\n\nHe was elected President of the Ethnological Society in 1861. He died at his home in Elvaston Place, South Kensington, London on 11 May 1868 at the age of 85.\n\nCrawfurd wrote prolifically. His views have been seen as inconsistent: a recent author wrote that \"[...] Crawfurd seemed to embody a complex mixture of elements of coexisting but ultimately contradictory value systems\". A comment about \"hasty general opinions from a few instances\", by George Bennett on the topic of Papuan people, has been taken to be aimed at Crawfurd.\n\nHis 1822 work \"Malay of Champa\" contain a vocabulary of the Cham language.\n\nIn retirement after the Burmese mission, Crawfurd wrote books and papers on Eastern subjects. His envoy experiences from missions were written up in \"Journals\" in 1828 and 1829. This documentation was reprinted nearly 140 years later by Oxford University Press.\n\n\nAccording to Jane Rendall's concept of \"Scottish orientalism\", Crawfurd is a historian of the second generation. His \"History of the Indian Archipelago\" (1820), in three volumes, was his major work. Crawfurd was a critic of much of what the European nations had done in the area of Asia he covered.\n\n\"An Historical and Descriptive Account of China\" (1836) was a joint work in three volumes from the \"Edinburgh Cabinet Library\", with Hugh Murray, Peter Gordon, Thomas Lynn, William Wallace, and Gilbert Thomas Burnett.\n\nCrawfurd and Colin Mackenzie collected manuscripts from the capture of Yogyakarta, and some of these are now in the British Library.\n\nCrawfurd claimed Cham for the Austronesian languages. His suggestion met no favour at the time, but scholars from around 1950 onwards came to agree.\n\nCrawfurd held strong views on what he saw as the backwardness of the economy of India of his time. He attributed it to the weakness of Indian financial institutions, compared to Europe. His opinions were in an anonymous pamphlet \"A Sketch of the Commercial Resources and Monetary and Mercantile System of British India\" (1837) now attributed to him. Like Robert Montgomery Martin, he saw India primarily as a source of raw materials, and advocated investment based on that direction. A harsh critic of the existing Calcutta agencies, he noted the absence of bill broking in India and suggested that an exchange bank should be set up.\n\nHis view that an economy dominated by agriculture was inevitably an absolute government was cited by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his \"On the Constitution of the Church and State\".\n\nWhile Crawfurd produced work that was ethnological in nature over a period of half a century, the term \"ethnology\" had not even been coined when he began to write. Attention has been drawn to his latest work, from the 1860s, which was copious. It met much criticism at the time, and has also been scrutinised in the 21st century.\n\nCrawfurd held polygenist views, based on multiple origins of human groups; and these earned him, according to Sir John Bowring, the nickname \"the inventor of forty Adams\". In \"The Descent of Man\" by Charles Darwin, Crawfurd is cited as believing in 60 races. He expressed these views to the Ethnological Society of London (ESL), a traditional stronghold of monogenism (belief in a unified origin of humankind) where he had come in 1861 to hold office as President.\n\nCrawfurd believed in different races as separate creations by God in specific regional zones, with separate origins for languages, and possibly as different species. With Robert Gordon Latham of the ESL, he also opposed strongly the ideas of Max Müller on an original Aryan race.\n\nCrawford wrote in 1861 in the \"Transactions\" of the ESL a paper \"On the Conditions Which Favour, Retard, and Obstruct the Early Civilization of Man\", in which he argued for deficiencies in the science and technology of Asia. In \"On the Numerals as Evidence of the Progress of Civilization\" (1863) he argued that the social condition of a people correlates with the numeral words of their language. Crawfurd used domestication frequently as a metaphor. His racist views on black people were laughed at, during the British Association meeting at Birmingham in 1865.\n\nA paper by Crawfurd, \"On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of European and Asian Races of Man\", given 13 February 1866, argued for the superiority of Europeans. It particularly laid emphasis on European military dominance as evidence. Its thesis was directly contradicted at a meeting of the Society some weeks later, by Dadabhai Naoroji.\n\nRecent analyses have sought to clarify Crawfurd's agenda in his writings on race and, at this time, when he had become prominent in a young and still fluid field and discipline. Ellingson demonstrates Crawfurd's role in promoting the idea of the noble savage in service of racial ideology. Trosper has taken Ellingson's analysis a step further, attributing to Crawfurd a conscious \"spin\" put on the idea of primitive culture, a rhetorically sophisticated use of a \"straw man\" fallacy, achieved by bringing in, irrelevantly but for the sake of incongruity, the figure of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nCrawfurd dedicated considerable effort to a critique of Darwin's theories of human evolution; as a proponent of polygenism, who believed that human races did not share common ancestors, Crawfurd was an early and prominent critic of Darwin's ideas . Right at the end of his life, in 1868, Crawfurd was using a \"missing link\" argument against Sir John Lubbock, in what Ellingson describes as a misrepresentation of a Darwinist viewpoint based on the idea that a precursor of humans must still be extant.\n\nEllingson points to a work of William Falconer, \"On the Influence of Climate\" from 1781, with an attack on Rousseau, as a possible source of Crawfurd's thinking; while also pointing out some differences. Ellingson also places Crawfurd in a British group among those of his period whose anthropological views not only turned on race, but who also drew conclusions of superiority from those views, others being Luke Burke, James Hunt, Robert Knox, and Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie.\n\nCrawfurd's attitudes were not, however, based on human skin colour; and he was an opponent of slavery, having written an article \"Sugar without Slavery\" with Thomas Perronet Thompson in 1833 in the \"Westminster Review\". In dismissing Crawfurd's notes and suggestions on his work as \"quite unimportant\", Charles Darwin identified Crawfurd's racial views as \"Pallasian\", i.e. the analogue for humankind of the theories of Peter Simon Pallas.\n\nThe predominant approach in the ESL went back to James Cowles Prichard. In the view of Thomas Trautmann, in Crawfurd's attack on the Aryan theory there is a final rejection of the \"languages and nations\" approach, which was Prichard's, and a consequent freeing of (polygenist) racial theory.\n\nCrawfurd married Horatia Ann, daughter of James Perry. From 1821 to 1822, Mrs. Crawfurd had accompanied the Mission to Siam and Cochin China aboard the \"John Adam\". As the ship made way from Bangkok to Hué, Mrs. Crawfurd went ashore on an island in the Gulf of Siam, where she made a considerable impression upon the natives. The writer Oswald John Frederick Crawfurd, born in 1834, was their son. The couple knew John Sterling, and the Carlyles. Thomas Carlyle met Henry Crabb Robinson at dinner at the Crawfurds (25 November 1837, at 27 Wilton Crescent), making a poor impression.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1923993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923993", "title": "Kuttanad", "text": "Kuttanad\n\nKuttanad is a region covering the Alappuzha and Kottayam Districts, in the state of Kerala, India, well known for its vast paddy fields and geographical peculiarities. The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried around below sea level. Kuttanadu is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. \nFarmers of Kuttinad are famous for Biosaline Farming. FAO has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS).\nFour of Kerala's major rivers, the Pamba, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala flow into the region. It is well known for its boat race in the Punnamada Backwaters, known in Malayalam as Vallamkalli.\n\nThis land had been the source of food to Changanacherry market. Later it had been allocated to Allapuzha district on the basis of landscape.\nThe first recorded history on the origin of this land is obtained from Sangam period literature. Additionally the oral history among local people, transferred from generation to generation is a blend of myths and legends is a valuable resource. According to Sangam era documents, Uthiyan Cheralatan (Perum Chorru Udiyan Cheralathan , Athan I), or Udiyanjeral (AD first century\".\") is the first recorded Chera dynasty ruler of the Sangam period in ancient South India. He had his capital at a place called Kuzhumur in Kuttanad (central Kerala) and expanded the kingdom northward and eastward from his original homeland. His lifetime is broadly determined to be between first century BC and 2nd century AD. His queen was Veliyan Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan Venman. Uthiyan Cheralathan was a contemporary of the Chola ruler Karikala Chola. He is praised for his elephant corps and cavalry. Present day Changanacherry end of Kuttanad was the capital of the Chera dynasty king Uthiyan_Cheralathan. His descendant was Senguttavan (Chenguttavan means \"brave-hearted\" in malayalam and his name is carried by the next towns of Chenganacherri and Chengana to the present day). According to sangam literature, Cheralathan was defeated in the Battle of Venni with Karikala Chola and the capital was burnt down. Another local legend says Kuttanad was believed to be forest with dense tree growth. This forest was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire.\n\nIt is a well known fact that burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields) until the recent past. This fact throws some light on this theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. In Kuttanad most of the place names end in kari (meaning burnt residue or charcoal). Some familiar place names are Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary, Kandanakary, Thayamkary, Chathenkary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary.\n\nThe Kuttanad region is categorised into:\n\nLower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of Ambalapuzha, Kuttanadu (excluding Edathua, Thalavady and Muttar, and the northern half of Karthikapally taluk in Alappuzha district).\n\nUpper Kuttanad comprises Veeyapuram and Pallippad in Karthikapally taluk, Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar in Kuttanad taluk; Chennithala village in Mavelikkara, Mannar, Kuruttissery, Budhanur, Ennakkad villages in Chengannur taluk of Alappuzha district; and Parumala, Kadapra, Niranam, Pulikeezhu, chathenkary ,Nedumpuram, villages in Pathanamthitta district.\n\nNorth Kuttanad comprises Vaikom taluk, western parts of Kottayam taluk, and western parts of Changanacherry taluk in Kottayam district.\n\nA few of the major villages which form Kuttanad are: Kainakary, Chathenkary Ramankary, Puthukkary, Chennamkary, Nedumudi, Niranam, Kaipuzha, Edathua, Mampuzhakkary, Neelamperoor, Kainady, Kavalam, Pulincunnoo, Manalady, Kannady Kayalpuram, Veliyanadu, Veeyapuram, Vezhapra, Kunnamkary, Kumaramkary, Valady, Kidangara, Mithrakary, Muttar, Neerattupuram, Thalavadi, Changankary, Champakulam, Nedumudi, Moonnatummukham, Melpadom, Pulincunnu, Pallippad, \nPayippad, Karichal, Ayaparambu, Anary, Vellamkulangara, Pilappuzha, Pandi, Edathua, Pacha, Chekkidikad, Thakazhy, Cheruthana, Karuvatta, Chennithala, Narakathara, Venattukad, Kayalppuram, Mankompu, Chathurthiakary, Koduppunna, Oorukkary, Thayankary, Thiruvarpu, Pullangadi and payattupakka, Kandankary among others.\n\nThe major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of \"The Rice Bowl of Kerala\". Three crops are grown every year now instead of the traditional practice of two crops per year. Large farming areas near Vembanad Lake were reclaimed from the lake. The history of paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the Pamba River. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called \"padasekharams\". Bailing out of water from the fields were done manually using water wheels called \"chakram\". Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.\n\nThere were robberies in Kuttanad in earlier days, which were prohibited by the Travancore Maharajah Moolam Thirunal.\n\nThree distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using \"chakram\", which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first \"Kayal Nilams\" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake. These pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu.\n\nThe second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava Panicker. He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters. The reclaimed kayal was known as ‘ Attumuttu Kayal’. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary.\n\nThe introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. This made farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by Pallithanam Luka Mathai (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the Cherukara Kayal and Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal. But the second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on kayal reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.\n\nIn 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travancore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this scheme kayal land was notified for reclamation in blocks each named with a letter of the English alphabet. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of kayal land, 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. After the removal of the ban in 1913, Pallithanam Luca Matthai along with some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal measuring a total area 2,400 acres. This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu. C.J. Kurian, Ex MLC and Mr. John Illikalam were his main partners in this venture. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920, known as the new reclamations, were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block(Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major Kayal nilams reclaimed during this period.\n\nDuring the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N covering an area of 3600 acres were reclaimed under the leadership of Pallithanam Luca Matthai, Cunnumpurathu Kurien, Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Kunnathusseril Peious, Ettuparayil Xavier and Pattassery PP Mathai. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block Kayal covering 1,400 acres was reclaimed by the joint efforts of eight families led by then member of Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, Pallithanam Luca Matthai. His partners in the reclamation included Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Ettuparayil Xavier, Pattassery PP Mathai, Meledom, Paruthickal and Kandakudy.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1940 reclamation activity came to a halt because of a steep drop in the price of rice.\n\nDue to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated \"Grow More Food\" campaiagn and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan).\nAs farming in the area increased, farmers felt themselves constrained by the two cycles a year for rice cultivation. The reason for which is the limited availability of potable water in Kuttanadu. During the monsoon seasons, the water from the mountains flow through the rivers to the sea, bringing potable water to Kuttanadu. But during summer, due to the low level of the region seawater enters Kuttanadu, significantly increasing the salinity of the water and making it unpotable.\n\nAlso Kuttanad is recognised as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by FAO\n\nThis project was designed as a permanent solution to the flood situation in Kuttanad. This programme was envisaged in such a way that flood waters from Pamba, Manimalayar and Achankovil were diverted to the sea before it reached Vembanad lake. The construction of the Spillway ended by 1959.\n\nIn 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund (Dam) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases, the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo. The farmers who were expecting lots of financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December–June when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon. Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad.that are chambavu and karutha charu.\n\nEven though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the bund like the omniprescence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near by.\n\n\nKuttanad assembly constituency was a part of Alappuzha. After the Lok Sabha delimitation in 2008, it now belongs to the Mavelikkara constituency.\n\n\n\nKT Rammohan. Tales of Rice: Kuttanad, Southwest India.

A mortgage inspection is less expensive, but offers much less protection and value. ALTA/ACSM surveys in Kentucky are typically requested only for commercial activity.\n\nMost land surveying work is acquired through the personal recommendation of satisfied clients, lending institutions, attorneys, real estate companies and title companies who frequently handle real estate transactions.\n\nEach of Kentucky's 120 counties elects a County Surveyor. However, a consumer can seek services from any licensed Kentucky Professional Land Surveyor. The status of a licensee or firm can be verified online, including checking for Disciplinary Actions in the past 5 years. Formal complaints against a Professional Land Surveyor should be made in writing to the Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors.\n\nResidents should be aware of the right of entry on land of others by a land surveyor, which include persons such as employees that are under the supervision of a Professional Land Surveyor. A professional land surveyor shall not be liable to arrest or a civil action by reason of this entry. No owner or occupant of the land shall be liable for any injury or damage sustained by any person entering upon his or her land.\n\nLand Surveying in Kentucky is regulated by the Commonwealth in KRS 322. The Standards of Practice are defined in 201 KAR 18:150. Compliance is maintained by the Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors, which was established by an Act of the Kentucky General Assembly in 1938.\n\nAll chain of title in the Commonwealth traces back to Virginia land patents and Kentucky land patents. The Secretary of State maintains the security and preservation of these historical documents. More recent Deed and Plat records are maintained by Kentucky's County Clerks.\n\nMost of the state utilizes the Metes and bounds land system, which is based on English Common Law and reflects the Commonwealth's original status as a part of Virginia until statehood in 1792. Parts of Western Kentucky, since it was acquired under the Jackson Purchase in 1818, utilizes a rectangular system based on the Public Land Survey System created by the Land Ordinance of 1785.\n\nCommon surveying measures in Kentucky include acre and the survey foot, which are both now referenced in decimal and historically in fraction. For example, a modern survey should list a distance of one-foot and six-inches as 1.50 feet. Historically lengths were also measured as chain (length) and rod (length). A rod is also known as a pole, both being 16.5 feet. A chain is most commonly 66 feet (4 poles) but can also be 33 feet (2 poles).\n\nNotable Surveyors in Kentucky History include Daniel Boone, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Bullitt, George Rogers Clark, and Isaac Shelby.\n\nModern technology used in surveying in Kentucky includes GPS, the Total station, and CAD. A popular CAD system with Kentucky Surveyors is Carlson Software, which is headquartered in Maysville, Kentucky. Surveying is also aided by the development of Geographic information systems, such as LOJIC.\n\nThe Kentucky Association of Professional Surveys (KAPS) maintains and perpetuates an organization for members having common professional problems and interests. The organization provides effective forums for discussion and united action on the part of its members for the enhancement and betterment of professional recognition, status and conditions of employment. KAPS also addresses other matters which contribute to the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, KAPS membership and State Government.\n\nJohnson, E. Polk (1912).

The Lieutenant Governor's official residence (Government House) in St. Saviour was depicted on the Jersey £50 note 1989–2010.\n\nThe duties are primarily diplomatic and ceremonial. The role of the Lieutenant Governor is to act as the \"de facto\" head of state in Jersey. The Lieutenant Governor also liaises between the Governments of Jersey and the United Kingdom. The holder of this office is also ex officio a member of the States of Jersey but may not vote and, by convention, speaks in the Chamber only on appointment and on departure from post.\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor exercises certain executive functions relating broadly to citizenship (passports, deportation and nationality). Jersey passports are British passports issued on behalf of the Lieutenant Governor, in the exercise of the royal prerogative, through the Passport Office which the States fund and from which the States retain any revenue generated. Deportation from Jersey is ordered by the Lieutenant Governor. Certificates of naturalization as a British citizen are issued by the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nThe office of Lieutenant Governor has its origins in the Norman administration of the Channel Islands. The functions of the bailiff and the official who was later to become known as Lieutenant Governor (called variously, Warden or Captain) became separate in the aftermath of the division of Normandy in 1204. However, the respective responsibilities of the two officials were only clearly defined in the 17th century as a result of a power struggle between bailiff and governor. An Order in Council dated 18 February 1617 laid down that \"the charge of military forces be wholly in the Governor, and the care of justice and civil affairs in the Bailiff\"\n\nWhen the monarchy was restored, King Charles II who had escaped to Jersey on his way to exile in France rewarded Jersey with the power to levy customs duties. This power, exercised by the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats, was finally taken over by the States of Jersey in 1921, thereby enabling the States to control the budget independently of the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nThe post of Governor of Jersey became a titular sinecure, and a Lieutenant Governor was appointed to actually carry out the functions of the office. William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford, was the last titular Governor of Jersey; since his death in 1856 the Crown has been formally and constitutionally represented in Jersey by the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nThe States of Jersey Law 2005 abolished any power of the Lieutenant Governor to veto a resolution of the States.\n\nIn 2010 it was announced that the next Lieutenant Governor would be recommended to the Crown by a Jersey panel, thus replacing the previous system of the appointment being made by the Crown on the recommendation of UK ministers.\n\nGovernors have been:\nLieutenant Governors of Jersey have been:\n\n"}
{"id": "11372624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11372624", "title": "Lillsjön (Ulvsunda)", "text": "Lillsjön (Ulvsunda)\n\nLillsjön () is a small lake in the western suburb Bromma in Stockholm, Sweden. It is one of four lakes in the western suburbs, the other being: Kyrksjön, Judarn, and Råcksta Träsk. Located in the small park Lillsjöparken and surrounded by heavily trafficked artery roads on all sides, it is rich in nutrients with high levels of metals in the sediments. Prospects are to improve the water quality to keep the lake as a locale for birds.\n\nLillsjön is a small and shallow lake connected to Ulvsundasjön through a channel, and the flow is periodically reversed with water pouring into the lake. Half of the catchment area is composed of forest and open terrain, part of series of parks constituting a local recreational resource. Heavily trafficked roads take up some 4 per cent and settlements (including allotment-gardens) approximately 20 per cent of the surface. The lake is considered as of great recreational value but of moderate natural importance, except as a breeding locale for many fish species in Lake Mälaren. Motorboats are prohibited in the lake.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by the deciduous forest and lawns of the park Lillsjöparken. Three allotment-gardens are found near the lake and 11 ha of the catchment area is occupied by one-family houses. While the inflow from the surrounding area contributed some 200,000 m³ annually, even small variations in water level in Lake Mälaren are of greater importance. Three major artery roads and a ground-level metro track stretches through the area of which Bromma Airport forms a minor part.\n\nNorth and east of the lake are a petrol station and other operations considered as having a negative environmental impact. Until the mid-1980s, the lake received considerable amounts of spillway overflow which resulted in high levels of coliform bacteria. A waste water accident in 1997 caused considerable amounts of polluted water to leak into the lake, but since 2001 waste water only reach the lake during longer periods with continuous rain. Low levels of oxygen causes levels of phosphorus to rise in the bottom of the lake during winters and during summers when the lake is stratified. Run-off water from surrounding roads reaches the lake through the ditch dug when the park was created. Most of the nitrogen and more than half of the phosphorus stems from settlements in the area, while allotments-gardens, generally lacking sewers, contributes with nutrients and industries and others operations contributes with zinc and copper. Sediments have high levels of copper and nickel, and deeper sediments contain very high levels of organic compounds such as PAHs and PCB.\n\nIn late summers, the lake is dominated by various cyanobacterias. The only zooplankton recorded are rotifers. No inventory of aquatic plants have been made since 1976, but the lake shares are dominated by reed with water lilies found in the southern part. Ten fish species were recorded in 1997-1998, including perch, northern pike, carp bream, and pikeperch. Signal crayfish is occasionally found in the lake. The most commonly breeding bird mallard is accompanied by Eurasian coot and great crested grebe. Several other species are found in the reeds, including reed warbler and reed bunting, and many other regularly uses the lake as a stopover. Common frog has been recorded in the lake.\n\nWhile the lake by itself is mostly local interest, there are various historical structures in the surrounding area making it popular for promenades, including petroglyphs, runestones, the 17th century Ulvsunda Palace, and several 19th century mansions and other buildings considered of great local interest. The nearest metro station is Abrahamsberg.\n\n\n\n"}

Cricket is recorded as having first been played in Tasmania very shortly after the arrival of British settlers on the island on 12 September 1803, however it wasn't until nearly fifty years later that First-class cricket was to be played there.\n\nDespite the long wait since the foundation of the colony, Tasmania played in the first ever first-class cricket match in Australia, which was played on 11 February and 12 February 1851, against Victoria, with Tasmania emerging victorious by 3 wickets. For that first match, Tasmania was captained by John Marshall.\n\nFollowing that first ever First-class match Tasmania endured a long period of isolation, in which the island's cricketers had to content themselves with occasional First-class matches against other colonies, primarily Victoria, and touring or representative sides.\n\nAustralia's elite First-class cricket competition, the Sheffield Shield was established in 1892, however Tasmania was not invited to participate in that elite competition until 1977, and even then, their first four seasons were on a limited fixture list.\n\nThese are lists of the men who have been the official Tasmanian captains in First-class, List A and Twenty20 domestic matches. \nWhere a player has a dagger (†) after his period of captaincy, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain.

The provincial authority is headed by a Governor-General (Persian: \"Ostāndār\"), who is appointed by the Minister of the Interior subject to approval of the cabinet.\n\nIran has held its modern territory since the Treaty of Paris in 1857. From 1906 until 1950, Iran was divided into twelve provinces: Ardalan, Azerbaijan, Baluchestan, Fars, Gilan, Araq-e Ajam, Khorasan, Khuzestan, Kerman, Larestan, Lorestan, and Mazandaran.\n\nIn 1950, Iran was reorganized to form ten numbered provinces with subordinate governorates: Gilan; Mazandaran; East Azerbaijan; West Azerbaijan; Kermanshah; Khuzestan; Fars; Kerman; Khorasan; Isfahan.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1981 the governorates were raised to provincial status one by one. Since then several new provinces have been created, most recently in 2010 when the new Alborz Province was split from Teheran province, and before that in 2004 when the province of Khorasan was divided into three provinces.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44224657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44224657", "title": "Topkhana Forest", "text": "Topkhana Forest\n\nThe Topkhana Forest () is a forest and a state reserve located near Shusha, Azerbaijan (\"de facto\" Republic of Artsakh). Claims of its destruction in 1988 caused tensions over the political future of Nagorno-Karabakh and encouraged civil and inter-ethnic unrest that would eventually erupt into the Nagorno-Karabakh War.\n\nTopkhana is the name of a gently-sloping hillside opposite (and visible from) the town of Shusha, but separated from the town by deep gorge containing the Karkar (also known as the Dashalty) river. Its name derives from it being the location of cannons (\"top\" in Turkic languages) of Mohammad Khan Qajar during his siege of Shusha in 1795. The forest was mentioned in Anar Rzayev's novel \"The Last Night of the Expiring Year\" first published in 1970. Yevgeni Kotlyarov, USSR Master of Sports and specialist on athletic tourism, mentioned \"forested slopes of the Topkhana plateau in Shusha\" in his 1978 publication on mountain tourism in Karabakh. In his book of critical reviews of Soviet literature, published in 1985, writer Elchin Afandiyev, who spent his younger years in Shusha, mentioned \"staring into the dark blue depth of the mighty Topkhana forest\" as a youth and \"dreaming of having [his] first novel published\". In early November 1988, the site was described by Galina Starovoitova as home to \"just one rather spindly tree and some scrubby bushes\".\n\nIn October 1988 Abdurrahman Vazirov, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, announced in a speech that a bridge should be constructed across the Hunot Gorge in order to expand the town of Shusha onto the opposite bank and link it to the surrounding countryside. Shusha was predominantly Azeri-populated but the opposite bank was inhabited exclusively by Armenians, who considered this was an attempt to expand Azeri-inhabited territory in Nagorno Karabakh at the expense of its Armenian population. The Karabakh Committee decided a symbolic Armenian-held structure should be erected on that opposite bank, and on 5 November consulted with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia, who, in return for an assurance that the upcoming October Revolution parade in Yerevan would not be disrupted, agreed to send trucks loaded with building materials for the construction. The trucks and materials arrived in Shusha on 7 November. This (in the Gregorian calendar) was the anniversary of the October 1917 revolution - but Shusha had been placed under curfew and the usual Communist parades and ceremonies had been cancelled. \n\nIn some sources the proposed structure is described as a workshop, in most it is described as a recreational facility for workers at Yerevan's Kanaker aluminium factory.\n\nOn 9 November 1988 construction work began at Topkhana on a vacation resort for workers at Yerevan's Kanaker aluminium factory. Permission for the work had been granted by the civic authorities of nearby Askeran, who had designated 15 acres of land for the project. \n\nThe halting of the construction was accompanied by an \"atmosphere of hysteria\" erupting in Baku, fed by inaccurate information printed in local Baku newspapers, none of which had actually sent a reporter to Shusha. Nationalists had taken control of the Azerbaijani press, publishing stories that a \"sacred grove\" had been destroyed by Armenians who were going to build an aluminium plant. The aim was to stir up popular pro-Azerbaijani and anti-Armenian sentiments. An editorial in Bakinskiy Rabochiy (Baku Worker) called the construction a \"branch of the Kanakerskiy Aluminum Plant\", the location the \"Topkhan Natural History Museum of living nature\", and asserted that for Azerbaijanis, Topkhana was \"the final drop that made the cup of patience overflow\". Azerbaijan radio claimed that Topkhane was a \"historical natural monument\" and the site of an Azerbaijani fortress. The result was an organized Azerbaijani popular movement emerging for the first time in the growing Nagorno-Karabagh crisis and, starting on November 17, large-scale demonstrations began in Baku's Lenin Square to protest against the supposed destruction at Topkhana. The 17 November event is now commemorated as a national holiday in Azerbaijan, known as \"National Revival Day\".\nAzerbaijani sources still maintain that the Baku reports of November 1988 about Topkhana are true, describing the alleged forest as \"a true miracle of nature\", claiming \"here lived plants, bears, wolves, wild boars, foxes, hares, deer, quail, pigeons, a variety of other animals and birds. Along the forest stretched sub-alpine and alpine meadows, deep gorges and springs dazzled the imagination. It is estimated that more than 2,000 oak trees and other rare species of trees have been felled at Topkhana and transported to Armenia. Its rich flora and fauna continue to be destroyed.\"\n"}

This is one of the reasons that Tallinn's old town became a World Heritage Site. The walls were enlarged in the fourteenth century, and citizens of Tallinn were required to turn out for guard duty, which meant to wear their armour and demonstrate their readiness to face off invaders.\n"}
