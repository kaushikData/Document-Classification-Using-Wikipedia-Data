It runs south-west from Bath in Somerset through Wells, Glastonbury, Street and Bridgwater. It then follows the north coast of Somerset, Devon and Cornwall through Williton, Minehead, Porlock, Lynmouth, Barnstaple, Bideford, Stratton, Camelford, Wadebridge and St Columb Major. It then joins the route of the A30 road for around , re-emerging near Zelah to head for the south Cornish coast via Truro and Falmouth.\n\nIn Cornwall and North Devon (until the junction with the A361 \"North Devon Link Road\"), the road is known as the Atlantic Highway, and was classified as a trunk road until 2002.\n\nPorlock Hill is a section of the A39 west of the village of Porlock. The road climbs approximately in less than up onto Exmoor: a very steep hill with gradients of up to 1 in 4 and hairpin bends. \n\nIn Porlock itself you will often smell burning brakes from vehicles who have just descended the hill.\n\nOn 12 January 1899, the ten-ton Lynmouth lifeboat was launched during a storm, but the storm's ferocity meant it could not put out to sea. Instead, it was retrieved and hauled by men and twenty horses over Countisbury and Porlock hills to Porlock Weir where the water in the bay was less rough. The endeavour eventually enabled thirteen seamen to be rescued.\n\nThere is a less steep toll road that small vehicles and cyclists can take as an alternative route. It formed part of the route in the 2007 Tour of Britain cycle race. Another alternative for cyclists, avoiding tolls, is provided by part of Regional Cycle Route 51 (Minehead to Ilfracombe).\n\nAbout to the west of Porlock Hill, the A39 starts its equivalent descent from the hills of Exmoor. Within about , the road descends the it had previously climbed. Unlike Porlock Hill, this section is relatively straight down into Lynmouth village where there is a bridge over the river and a sharp left turn, however the gradient at the foot is also 25% for a short distance. The original road between Lynmouth and Lynton was much more challenging with gradients of around 1 in 3 (33%). It is now the B3234, Lynmouth Hill.\n\nAt Martinhoe Cross in Devon—about west of Lynton and east of Parracombe—on the north side of the A39 lies a once disused but, in 2004, restored and reopened railway station. Woody Bay was once an intermediate stop on, and is now the main operating centre of, the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway a narrow-gauge line built in 1898, which closed in 1935. Over- and under-bridges and other traces of the line can be seen at various locations along this stretch of the road.\n\nAtlantic Highway is the name given to a section of the A39, as it passes from the North Devon Link Road at Barnstaple in Devon until it reaches the A30 at Fraddon in Cornwall.\n\nIt is so called, as it is the main road (it was a trunk road until 2002) from mid-Cornwall to North Devon and follows the line of the Atlantic Ocean's coast. It is also named thus due to the former Southern Railway express that ran in this part of North Devon and North Cornwall (the Atlantic Coast Express). Views of the Atlantic can be seen along its length, although the road does not approach very close to the coastline itself.\n\nThe road is signified as the Atlantic Highway by road signs indicating the route mileage throughout its length, in both directions, in white on brown above the green background of the route mileage boards.\n\nIt passes by Wadebridge, Bude and Bideford, and directly through Camelford.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10661564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10661564", "title": "America (airship)", "text": "America (airship)\n\nThe America was a non-rigid airship built by Mutin Godard in France in 1906 for the journalist Walter Wellman's attempt to reach the North Pole by air. Wellman first conceived of using a balloon to fly to the pole during a failed polar attempt by boat and sledge from Svalbard in 1894. He then visited Paris to review the state of balloon technology but left disappointed by the lack of acceptable steering and propulsion capability. A decade later while at the 1905 Portsmouth Peace Conference he learned of recent innovations in French dirigible design and believed a solution might be at hand for his Arctic aerial plan. After receiving the backing of newspaper publisher Victor F. Lawson, the Wellman Chicago Record-Herald Polar Expedition was announced, and Wellman traveled to Paris in search of a suitable design and manufacturer. In the meantime a public company was established to raise the $US 250,000 required for the expedition and airship (to which Lawson contributed $60,000).\n\nAs originally constructed, the \"America\" was long and wide at its greatest diameter and enclosed a volume of of hydrogen. The envelope was of three layers of fabric and three of rubber, and contained no internal framework. The gondola could hold a crew of five, and power was supplied by three internal-combustion engines delivering a total of to two propellers, one fore and one aft. It was delivered by ship to Spitsbergen on July 8, 1906 where Wellman and his team attempted to erect it. Their efforts met with failure when the engines fell apart. In September, the \"America\" was dismantled and returned by ship to France.\n\nWellman returned to Spitsbergen with the \"America\" in June the following year, 1907. The airship had a new centre-section sewn into it to increase its length to and volume to . The weather was very unfavourable, however, and it was 2 September before the \"America\" could even leave the hangar. Wasting no time, Wellman launched later that day with mechanic Melvin Vaniman and navigator Felix Riesenberg in an attempt to reach the pole. Unfortunately, more bad weather forced this to be abandoned after only a few miles and the \"America\" was deflated to avoid a crash landing. \"America\" once again returned to France for repairs.\n\nShe returned to Spitsbergen one more time in July 1909, and at 10 AM on 15 August, launched with Wellman, Vaniman, Russian balloonist Nicolas Popov and Vaniman's brother-in-law Albert Louis Loud on board. The flight began well enough, but two hours and later, a device Wellman called the \"equilibrator\" failed. This was a long, leather tube filled with ballast that was intended to help gauge and maintain a fixed altitude over the ice. \"America\" gained altitude rapidly, until brought under control at and gradually lowered back to the ground by venting hydrogen. The crew was rescued by the Norwegian steamer \"Farm\". Wellman began plans to extend the hangar so that he could return the following year with a larger airship, but on learning of Dr. Frederick Cook's claim to have reached the pole, abandoned the adventure.\nInstead, Wellman resolved to make the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. He had the \"America\" enlarged again, now to . A spark gap radio set was added to the underhanging life boat and operator Jack Irwin used it during the flight, callsign \"W\", and with the frame of the airship as the antenna. Given the hydrogen used for lifting the craft this was a very dangerous system. The unit made some of the very first air-to-ground transmissions, when the airship's engineer Melvin Vaniman sent one of the first aerial radio transmissions urging the launch boat to \"come and get this goddam cat!\" – the cat Kiddo who was (at first) not happy about being airborne.\n\nOn 15 October 1910, takeoff was made from Atlantic City. Condensing water on the airship's skin added excess weight, and it was difficult to gain height. A passing storm also made forward navigation difficult. The engines failed 38 hours into the flight, apparently due to contamination by beach sand, and \"America\" drifted. The crew jettisoned all excess weight, including one of the defunct engines. The ship had gone as far as a point east of New Hampshire and south of Nova Scotia before floating generally south.\n\nAfter another 33 hours, and having now traveled a total distance of from launching, they sighted the Royal Mail steamship \"Trent\" west of Bermuda. After attracting the ship's attention by a signaling lamp using Morse code, Irwin made the first aerial distress call by radio. The crew, and mascot cat Kiddo, got into the lifeboat and, after opening the gas valves on the airship, abandoned the \"America\". The airship drifted out of sight and was never seen again. \"Trent\", having barely avoided running down the lifeboat in a high crosswind, was able to rescue the crew and returned them to New York. The first successful aerial crossings of the Atlantic came nine years later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32064959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32064959", "title": "American Redoubt", "text": "American Redoubt\n\nThe American Redoubt is a political migration movement first proposed in 2011 by best-selling survivalist novelist and blogger James Wesley Rawles which designates three states in the northwestern United States (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming), and adjoining portions of two other states (eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington) as a safe haven for conservative, libertarian-leaning Christians and Jews. Rawles chose this area due to its low population density and lack of natural hazards. However, several major nuclear war targets are located in the area, like the large ICBM bases in Malstrom, Montana and Warren, Wyoming or the Idaho National Laboratory with its nuclear reactors developing and testing facilities.\n\nKim Murphy, a reporter for \"The Los Angeles Times\", summed up one motivation for the movement: \"For a growing number of people, it's the designated point of retreat when the American economy hits the fan. When banks fail, the government declares martial law, the power grid goes down.\" The same article identified Rawles as \"the guru of the movement\". Summarizing one of his reasons for formulating the relocation strategy, Rawles stated: \"I'm often asked why I make such a 'big deal' about choosing conservative Christians, Messianic Jews, or Orthodox Jews for neighbors. The plain truth is that in a societal collapse there will be a veritable vacuum of law enforcement. In such times, with a few exceptions, it will only be the God-fearing that will continue to be law-abiding. Choose your neighborhood wisely.\"\n\nThe American Redoubt concept is based primarily around the Rawlesian Survivalist Philosophy including the precept \"Racism Ignores Reason\". James Rawles is outspokenly anti-racist and pro-Israel. Rawles published a blog entry in 2010 titled \"Lest Any Man Should Boast: A Christian Survivalist Perspective on Race, Religion, and Reason\", which covered at length his views that people are individuals and that there is no inherent superiority among races. He observed that certain races have different genetics, but those do not matter before God. The only thing that matters when he meets his maker, he contended, was whether he accepted Christ as his Lord and Savior.\n\nIn an interview by G. Jeffrey MacDonald published by the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", Rawles was quoted as saying: \"It's time to distance ourselves from the vile corruptness that we see inside the Washington, D.C., Beltway ... [The American Redoubt movement] is analogous to the Puritan exodus (from Europe). They couldn't fit in and said, 'We're going to move to completely virgin territory and start afresh.' … In effect, we're becoming pistol-packing Amish.\" Rawles advocates a gradual demographic consolidation through political migration to the American Redoubt, but predicts that the federal government will \"hammer\" any states that attempt to secede under the current political order. Rawles also stated: \"People who recognize that they are of the [Christian] remnant, that they are God's elect, will in increasing numbers choose to vote with their feet.\"\n\nIn 2011, the American Redoubt concept was endorsed by 2008 Constitution Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin, who had relocated his entire extended family to western Montana. It also soon inspired the launch of a weekly podcast by Christian Libertarian journalist John Jacob Schmidt, called \"Radio Free Redoubt\", and a volunteer network of amateur radio operators called AmRRON (the American Redoubt Radio Operators Network) established in 2012. It also inspired the launch of the blog and weekly podcast by Alex Barron, called the \"Charles Carroll Society\", Barron, a black Catholic Libertarian journalist, is the self-proclaimed \"Bard of the American Redoubt\" who speaks from a Traditional Catholic, Constitutional Conservative, American Patriot viewpoint. In 2013, he opined:\n\nIn February 2012, \"The Seattle Times\" characterized the American Redoubt movement as appealing to \"a growing number of people\" but concluded that as of that time \"not all that many so far\" had actually moved to the area. In April 2012, the business/arts columnist for \"The Ferry County View\", a weekly newspaper in Republic, Washington (located inside the Redoubt region) was critical of the Redoubt movement, characterizing it as driven by fear. By contrast, in October 2013, The 700 Club aired a news segment that favored the American Redoubt relocation concept. In an aside, the news story mentioned how the growth of the movement has even inspired the minting of silver coins.\n\nOn October 14, 2013, Christian Broadcasting Network completed a featured television news segment and accompanying article on the American Redoubt titled \"Redoubt: Northwest a Haven for Dismayed Americans\". In the article they noted \"... Some conservative American Christians are so dismayed with direction of the country that they're looking for a safe place for their families. They call it the 'American Redoubt.'\" Westbrook continued, \"I think that people recognize that tough times are coming. And it's time to think about their situation, it's time to think about how they live now, and the security of their family, the stability of society and how they are going to relate to that ... But I'm finding something else, too.\" he continued. \"That is that more and more people are resonating with this idea of getting back to the land, of living a simple, more natural way.\n\nIt is unclear how many people have moved because of the American Redoubt concept. In an interview on the Charles Carroll Society podcast in 2014, James Rawles estimated the number \"... well into the thousands, but it is difficult to quantify, because the vast majority of the people who are moving are preppers, who are by their nature very circumspect. However look at admittedly anecdotal evidence such as the growth of Pastor Chuck Baldwin's Liberty Fellowship church in Kalispell, Montana where the growth has been phenomenal, and many of the families are moving from far outside of the Redoubt states.\" Rawles does not provide figures for what he terms \"phenomenal\" growth of the church, which meets at a local Hilton Garden Inn, according to the Church's website, but at his website, Baldwin mentions that some recent meetings were attended by more than 1,000 people.\n\nBy 2016, Chris Carlson, a retired Democratic Party organizer was comparing advocates of the American Redoubt to survivalists, with the difference being that the Redoubters have \"become the shock troops for the Tea Party and openly support certain candidates.\" Carlson also claimed that the political migration to western states like Idaho, Montana and Wyoming has been driven by Redoubters seeking to be free from the federal government and that while they disavow racism, they have chosen a location where there are no minorities.\n\nThe American Redoubt movement continued to grow. An August 2016 article about the movement in \"The Economist\" magazine mentioned that \"thousands of families\" have now migrated to the American Redoubt and that the movement is \"quietly gaining steam.\" Indeed, the election of Donald Trump has spurred on the movement. An urban news outlet says: \"But increasingly, they [Preppers] see more political violence in big cities, and more of a divide between rural and urban environments. The left's reaction to Donald Trump's presidency, they feel, has deepened the divide, making the day they've been preparing for seem ever more imminent.\"\n\nIn a Chicago Tribune article by Kevin Sullivan on August 27, 2016, noted \"It is impossible to know exactly how many people have come over the past few years, but newcomers, real estate agents, local officials and others said it was in the hundreds, or perhaps even a few thousand, across all five states. Here, they live in a pristine place of abundant water and fertile soil, far from urban crime, free from most natural disasters and populated predominantly by conservative, mostly Christian people with a live-and-let-live ethos and local governments with a light regulatory touch and friendly gun laws.\" \n\n, it has been asserted that Republican Party politics in Idaho's northernmost legislative district have been pulled farther to the right in recent years with the arrival of conservative Christian \"preppers\" fleeing more populated states.\n\nBetsy Russel wrote for the Spokesman-Review on May 16, 2016: \"Two years ago, two ultraconservative state legislators were elected from the district: Reps. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, and Sage Dixon, R-Ponderay. In 2016, longtime Sen. Shawn Keough, R-Sandpoint – an 8-time incumbent and a moderate Republican from one of the most conservative areas of Idaho – faced a primary challenge from the right but went on to easily win reelection.\n\nThere are three primary outlets for the American Redoubt movement. James Rawles' blog \"SurvivalBlog.com\" regularly covers Redoubt news and focuses on preparedness \"how to\" guides. John Jacob Schmidt's blog \"Radio Free Redoubt\" and his radio show \"The John Jacob Schmidt Show\" carried on the \"American Christian Network (ACN)\" and KTW 630 AM out of Spokane, Washington carries news and commentary often focused on the American Redoubt. And the \"Charles Carroll Society\" and podcast by Alex Barron which focuses on politics and commentary related to the American Redoubt and the many traditional Catholics located there.\n\n"}

{"id": "9994150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9994150", "title": "Bolečica", "text": "Bolečica\n\nThe Bolečica (Serbian Cyrillic: Болечица) is a short river in north-central Serbia, a 12 km-long right tributary to the Danube. During its entire flow it runs through the suburban section of Belgrade and despite being short it flows through the three Belgrade's municipalities, next to the half dozen of suburbs of Belgrade (giving its name to one of them) with a total population of 35,000 and is a route to important roads.\n\nBolečica originates in the northern, low Šumadija region, between two \"Belgrade mountains\", Avala and Kosmaj, on the slopes of the Begaljica Hill, at an altitude of 105 meters. Originally, it flows to the north along the eastern slopes of the Avala, crossing between the municipalities of Grocka and Voždovac, next to the villages of Vrčin and Zuce, where it receives the \"Vranovac\" creek from the right and enters the valley of Bubanj Potok where it marks the eastern border of the woods of Stepin Lug, turns to the north-east through the southernmost tip of the municipality of Zvezdara (for some 300 meters) and receives two more creeks from the left, \"Bubanj Potok\" and \"Zavojnička reka\". Bolečica continues through the southern section of Leštane, where it receives the creek of \"Kaluđerički potok\" from the left and forms the border between the four suburbs area: Leštane, Boleč, Ritopek and Vinča (where it receives the creek of \"Makački potok\" from the left), where it empties into the Danube by a small estuary at an altitude of 68 meters, just east of Belo Brdo, the archeological find of the Vinča culture.\n\nThe majority of the Bolečica's flow has been channeled, mostly in the Bubanj Potok-Leštane section. For that purpose, the river bed has been concreted and moved to the west, so the river is now further away from Boleč, which was named after the river. It enabled for a usually minor water flow to conduct abundantly larger quantities of water during heavy rains and floods. However, the final 3 kilometers of the river, through Vinča, has not been channeled, so with the growth of the Danube's level, the water overflows the estuary preventing the waters drained by Bolečica to flow into the Danube (inverse flow). As a result, during high levels, Bolečica overspills itself, sometimes causing the traffic breach on a major roads that cross over the river, like \"Kružni put\" and \"Smederevski put\".\n\nDue to the much larger impact the river has on Leštane than it has on Boleč, through which it basically doesn't flow, some of the geographers tend to call the river Leštanska reka (Cyrillic: Лештанска река, Leštane river) but the name has not been accepted officially neither among the local population.\n\nA short valley of Bolečica, which can be divided in two sections, Vrčin-Bubanj Potok and Bubanj Potok- Leštane-Vinča is a natural route for several important transportation lines:\n\n\nBolečica is bridged by the \"Kružni put\" in Leštane and by the \"Smederevski put\", near the crossroad with \"Kružni put\". Works on building additional 3 kilometers of the road from that point to the river's mouth into the Danube are halted in 2006. However, this section of the Bolečica's valley is projected route of the future modern highway which should begin at the Bubanj Potok highway crossroad and continue through the projected bridge Vinča-Omoljica into the province of Vojvodina. Despite frequent discussion by the city government on this subject, no projects have been accepted so far.\n\nThe name of the river means literally \"(the water) that cures the illness\" (Serbian: \"bol\", ilneess, pain and \"lečiti\", to heal, to cure). Today however, the river is highly polluted, becoming merely an open sewage canal. Dumping of the sewage begins already at Vrčin, and the sewages of all the adjoining settlements, even much larger and distant Kaluđerica. As of March 2007, the projected sewage collector is still not finished. In addition, Bolečica flows through two emerging industrial zones, those of Bubanj Potok and Leštane. The dumping of industrial waste contributed to the demise of the wildlife in the river, which until the late 1990s was clear brook with small fishes and frogs, but today is dead, murky and full of waste deposits and not suitable even for the industrial use anymore.\n\n"}

He made observations of the southern stars and possibly contributed to the creation of 12 new southern constellations.\n\nFrederick de Houtman was born in Gouda, Holland, Seventeen Provinces.\n\nHe assisted fellow Dutch navigator Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser with astronomical observations during the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies in 1595–1597 (during which Keyser died). He also sailed in 1598–1599 on a second expedition led by his brother Cornelis de Houtman. Cornelis was killed on that expedition, and Frederick was imprisoned by the Sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra, but used his two years of captivity to study the local Malay language and to make astronomical observations. These observations supplemented those made by Keyser on the first expedition. The constellations formed from their observations were first published in 1597 or 1598 on a globe by Petrus Plancius, and later globes (particularly one published by Willem Blaeu in 1603) incorporated adjustments based on de Houtman's later observations. Today, credit for these constellations is generally assigned jointly to Keyser, de Houtman, and Plancius, though some of the underlying stars were known beforehand. The constellations are also widely associated with Johann Bayer, who included them in his celestial atlas \"Uranometria\" in 1603.\n\nIn 1603, after his return to Holland, de Houtman published his stellar observations in an appendix to his dictionary and grammar of the Malayan and Malagasy languages.\n\nIn 1619 de Houtman sailed in the VOC ship \"Dordrecht\", with Jacob d'Edel in the VOC ship \"Amsterdam\". They sighted the Australian coast near present-day Perth, which they called \"d'Edelsland\". After sailing northwards along the coast he encountered and only narrowly avoided a group of shoals, subsequently called the Houtman Abrolhos. De Houtman then made landfall in the region known as \"Eendrachtsland\", which the explorer Dirk Hartog had encountered earlier. In his journal, de Houtman identified these coasts with Marco Polo's land of Beach, or Locach, as shown on maps of the time (e.g., by Petrus Plancius and Jan Huygen van Linschoten).\n\nDe Houtman died in Alkmaar, Holland, Dutch Republic.\n\n\n"}

The book was published in 1846, and is based on his travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, commanded by captain Robert FitzRoy. HMS Beagle arrived in South America to map out the coastlines and islands of the region for the British Navy. On the journey, Darwin collected fossils and plants, and recorded the continent's geological features.\n\nIt is the third book in a series of geology books written by Darwin, which also includes \"The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs\", published in 1842, and \"Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle\", published in 1844. It took Darwin four years to write and complete the entire series, from 1842 to 1846. According to his diaries, \"Geological Observations of South America\" was written between July 1844 to April 1845.\n\nThe text contains eight chapters along with appendices on Darwin's Mesozoic and Tertiary fossils. It describes his travels through the regions of modern Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, including the Pampas, Patagonia, and the Andes. With this book Darwin became the first to describe and name Navidad Formation, the reference unit for the marine Neogene in Chile. Darwin established relatives ages for rock units in the high Andes near Potillo. Metamorphic rocks were older than intruding red granites found in the area. By establishing, with aid of fossils, a Cretaceous age for some strata in the high Andes Darwin set time constrains for uplift of the Andes. He did further posited that the western part of the Andes (hinterland) rose before the eastern part, an idea later verified to be correct not only for the part of the Andes he visited but for orogenic mountains in general.\n\nDarwin, in a letter to the geologist Charles Lyell, wrote that the book was \"dreadfully dull, yet much condensed.\" He put a great deal of effort into writing the book, but sardonically commented that \"geologists never read each other's works, and that the only object in writing a book is a proof of earnestness, and that you do not form your opinions without undergoing labour of some kind.\"\n\nIn the book, Darwin voiced sceptical support for the \"crater of elevation\" theory. The theory proposed that volcanoes were not the product of lavas, but are pushed up from within. Darwin later rejected the theory when sufficient evidence was demonstrated by the geologist Charles Lyell to disprove it.\n\nFrancis Darwin, a botanist and the son of Charles Darwin, wrote that the book was significant for the \"evidence which it brought forward to prove the slow interrupted elevation of the South American continent during a recent geological period.\" Darwin's geological work is not considered as notable as his work is biology, but nevertheless was important in advancing \"the general reception of Lyell's teaching.\"\n\n"}

In addition to firing Pershing missiles, the complex launched Athena RTV missiles with subscale (test) warheads of the Advanced Ballistic Re-entry System to reentry speeds and impact at the New Mexico range. From 1964 to 1975 there were 244 Green River launches, including 141 Athena launches and a Pershing to 281 kilometers altitude. \"Utah State Route 19 runs through the Green River Launch Complex, which is south of the town and eponym of Green River.\"\n\nOriginally , the installation had several separated areas:\n\nRelated off-post sites included the nearby civilian Atlantic Research Corporation Assembly Area at a 1940s/50s Union Carbide uranium/vanadium facility outside of the Army complex where the company assembled Athenas as the prime contractor. Atlantic's \"support operations and missile assembly area\" of ~ included a \"missile assembly building...payload assembly building, support operations building, balance building and storage area\" (a water tower was also in the fenced compound.) The Athena Booster Drop Zone 1 (FUDS J08UT3006 in San Juan County) was a downrange \"impact zone\" for the Athena 1st-stage booster to nominally land after separation (32 residents in the zone were evacuated for 1/2 hour or less, e.g., ranchers were given per diem.) \"The impact dispersion area lay about 45 miles southeast of Green River, between the Colorado River and the north edge of the Manti-LaSal National Forest [with ~5% in] Canyonlands National Park.\" (The drop zone for Athena stage 2 was located in New Mexico.) Green River complex personnel also oversaw operations at Utah's White Mesa radar complex and a Pershing launch site and safety area in southeast Utah—the Black Mesa Missile Launching Range had 34 firings May 26, 1965 – November 13, 1968, from on Gilson Butte (operations relocated to Green River in 1971.)\n\nWhite Sands Proving Ground began off-range firing with a 1956 Rascal missile launched near Orogrande, New Mexico, to an impact zone on WSPG (cf. a 1960s MGM-29 Sergeant launched from Datil, New Mexico). In Texas, an AN/FPS-78 radar emplaced with the 195x AN/FPS-17 radar at the Laredo Missile Tracking Site for WSMR tests was used in the 1962 Cuban Missile Early Warning System (later used for Athena/ABRES.) Pershing missile launches began at the Atlantic Missile Range in 1960, and in 1961 Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) began the Athena missile program \"as part of the Advanced Ballistic Re-entry System [ABRES] program\". The 1961 Target Tracking Radar was used to create recordings of radar reception from Cape Canaveral warheads, \"chunks of the booster rocket\", and \"nose cone decoys\" during reentry for use as simulated \"ghost\" missile input during WSMR's Zeus \"synthetic intercept\" program:. WSMR LC 38's Discrimination Radar and the 1961 Target Tracking Radar from the Nike-Zeus program were later used \"as part of a re-entry signature studies program\".\n\nSelected by Carlos Bustamante, in September 1962 the Green River site was approved for \"Athena subscale tests of ABRES\"—land acquisition was initiated by the US Army Corps of Engineers' Sacramento District in late December. \"In 1963 the ABRES program became a national effort\", and by July 2, 1963, was granted by the Utah State Land Board—the Bureau of Land Management granted . Support structures, utilities, and roads were built by Olson Construction Company during a $1,235,072 contract; and facilities eventually totalled over $3 million. Off-site, the 1963 Holloman AFB program for Athena/ABRES installed \"two 3 megawatt dual frequency L-band and UHF radar systems\" by Continental Electronics (AFMDC's RAM Site at Rhodes Canyon and the \"Stallion radar site located uprange\" on WSMR were \"used to obtain the crossrange aspect of re-entry data.\") A USAF tenant was assigned to Green River as part of AFSC's Air Force Ballistic Systems Division at Norton Air Force Base. In California, the original \"Atlas 576 SMS ICBM pad\" with gantry became the Vandenberg AFB ABRES complex in September 1964 to launch ICBMs for reentry vehicle (RV) testing (moved from the Eastern Test Range). For the Green River site,\n\nThe 1st Athena launch was February 10, 1964, from Pad 2 which failed \"and fell near Durango, Colo\" (cf. the Pershing launched November 1964 that landed near Creede, Colorado) and the 2nd firing in May \"was destroyed shortly after launch.\" On July 8, 1964, the 1st \"successful Athena/ABRES test missile\" from the site landed at WSMR (at night for optical tracking of reentry). A 1967 Pershing landed in Mexico, as did a 1970 Athena that landed in Durango (Operation Great Sand returned Mexico Cobalt 57 contamination—60 drums—to a WSMR site.)\n\nThe support and maintenance contract for the cantonment area transferred from Dynalectron's Land-Air Division to Bendix Field Engineering Corporation on February 1, 1965. In 1966, the series of test firings was \"rescheduled to last through 1967\"—the new contract extended Athena operations beyond the original 77 launches (contracted for $65 million) to have 36 additional launches for $14 million. On May 13, 196x, from the Geyer Site, a Luftwaffe missile wing () launched the 300th Pershing.\n\nFollowing the Green River complex' last launches (Athena in 1971 & Pershing in 1975), Pershing launches moved to Fort Wingate, New Mexico. For a time the Army leased several cantonment buildings to the city of Green River (to which a Loki Dart missile was given and is exhibited at the city park.) A similar 1970s \"Radar Discrimination Technology (RDT) program\" was begun by the Lincoln Laboratory, and the Green River complex was on caretaker status 1976-86 when the site became \"inactive in 1979\"--\"the base was officially deactivated in 1983\". A March 1983 site inventory was conducted by David G. Buchanan and John P. Johnson, assisted by Sgt. Maj. L. Sexton—the report identified \"of exclusive use\" property and \"of co-use property.\" The \"Green River Test Site was placed on the federal agency hazardous waste compliance docket on June 27, 1997.\" By 2003 when part of \"the original 3,450 acres of land\" was owned/leased by White Sands (some was also state school trustlands and BLM lands), the cantonment area was being considered for declaration as excess property. By 2007, the Annual Intercollegiate Rocket Launch Competition was being held near Crystal Geyser on former Green River complex land, where 37 buildings remained in February 2014, such as the reinforced concrete blockhouse (Building 50207) for Athena Pads 1 & 2 (Buildings 50253 & 50291) which also remain. A draft assessment for demolition of the site's buildings was completed in 2014.\n\nPart of the former launch site now houses the Green River Uranium Disposal Cell , and holds radioactive material from the nearby UMTRA Project in Moab and several other sites.\n\n"}
{"id": "44014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44014", "title": "Henry Hudson", "text": "Henry Hudson\n\nHenry Hudson ( 1565 – 1611) was an English sea explorer and navigator during the early 17th century, best known for his explorations of present-day Canada and parts of the northeastern United States.\n\nIn 1607 and 1608, Hudson made two attempts on behalf of English merchants to find a rumored Northeast Passage to Cathay (China) via a route above the Arctic Circle. In 1609 he landed in North America and explored the region around the modern New York metropolitan area, looking for a Northwest Passage to Asia on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. He sailed up the Hudson River, which was later named after him, and thereby laid the foundation for Dutch colonization of the region.\n\nHudson discovered the Hudson Strait and the immense Hudson Bay on his final expedition, while still searching for the Northwest Passage. In 1611, after wintering on the shore of James Bay, Hudson wanted to press on to the west, but most of his crew mutinied. The mutineers cast Hudson, his son, and seven others adrift; the Hudsons and their companions were never seen again.\n\nBesides being the namesake of numerous geographical features, Hudson is also the namesake of the Hudson's Bay Company that explored and traded in the vast Hudson Bay watershed in the following centuries.\n\nDetails of Hudson's birth and early life are mostly unknown. Some sources have identified Henry Hudson as having been born in about 1565, but others date his birth to around 1570. Other historians assert even less certainty; Peter C. Mancall, for instance, states that \"[Hudson] was probably born in the 1560s,\" while Piers Pennington gives no date at all. Hudson is thought to have spent many years at sea, beginning as a cabin boy and gradually working his way up to ship's captain.\n\nIn 1607, the Muscovy Company of England hired Hudson to find a northerly route to the Pacific coast of Asia. At the time, the English were engaged in an economic battle with the Dutch for control of northwest routes. It was thought that, because the sun shone for three months in the northern latitudes in the summer, the ice would melt and a ship could make it across the \"top of the world\".\n\nOn 1 May 1607, Hudson sailed with a crew of ten men and a boy on the 80-ton \"Hopewell\". They reached the east coast of Greenland on 14 June, coasting it northward until the 22nd. Here the party named a headland \"Young's Cape\", a \"very high mount, like a round castle\" near it \"Mount of God's Mercy\" and land at 73° north latitude \"Hold-with-Hope\". After turning east, they sighted \"Newland\" (i.e Spitsbergen) on the 27th, near the mouth of the great bay Hudson later simply named the \"Great Indraught\" (Isfjorden). On 13 July, Hudson and his crew estimated that they had sailed as far north as 80° 23' N, but more likely only reached 79° 23' N. The following day they entered what Hudson later in the voyage named \"Whales Bay\" (Krossfjorden and Kongsfjorden), naming its northwestern point \"Collins Cape\" (Kapp Mitra) after his boatswain, William Collins. They sailed north the following two days. On the 16th they reached as far north as Hakluyt's Headland (which Thomas Edge claims Hudson named on this voyage) at 79° 49' N, thinking they saw the land continue to 82° N (Svalbard's northernmost point is 80° 49' N) when really it trended to the east. Encountering ice packed along the north coast, they were forced to turn back south. Hudson wanted to make his return \"by the north of Greenland to Davis his Streights (Davis Strait), and so for Kingdom of England,\" but ice conditions would have made this impossible. The expedition returned to Tilbury Hope on the Thames on 15 September.\n\nHudson reported large numbers of whales in Spitsbergen waters during this voyage. Many authors credit his reports as the catalyst for several nations sending whaling expeditions to the islands. This claim is contentious- others have pointed to strong evidence that it was Jonas Poole's reports in 1610 that led to the establishment of English whaling, and voyages of Nicholas Woodcock and Willem Cornelisz. van Muyden in 1612 which led to the establishment of Dutch, French and Spanish whaling. (The industry itself was built by neither Hudson nor Poole- both were dead by 1612.)\n\nIn 1608, English merchants of the East India and Muscovy Companies again sent Hudson in the \"Hopewell\" to attempt to locate a passage to the Indies, this time to the east around northern Russia. Leaving London on 22 April, the ship traveled almost 2,500 miles, making it to Novaya Zemlya well above the Arctic Circle in July, but even in the summer they found the ice impenetrable and turned back, arriving at Gravesend on 26 August.\n\nAccording to Thomas Edge, \"William Hudson\" in 1608 discovered an island he named \"Hudson's Tutches\" (Touches) at 71° N, the latitude of Jan Mayen. However, records of Hudson's voyages suggest that he could only have come across Jan Mayen in 1607 by making an illogical detour, and historians have pointed out that Hudson himself made no mention of it in his journal. There is also no cartographical proof of this supposed discovery. Jonas Poole in 1611 and Robert Fotherby in 1615 both had possession of Hudson's journal while searching for his elusive Hold-with-Hope (which is now believed to have been on the east coast of Greenland), but neither had any knowledge of any discovery of Jan Mayen, an achievement which was only later attributed to Hudson. Fotherby eventually stumbled across Jan Mayen, thinking it a new discovery and naming it \"Sir Thomas Smith's Island\", though the first verifiable records of the discovery of the island had been made a year earlier, in 1614.\n\nIn 1609 Hudson was chosen by merchants of the Dutch East India Company in the Netherlands to find an easterly passage to Asia. While awaiting orders and supplies in Amsterdam, he heard rumors of a northwest route to the Pacific through North America. Hudson had been told to sail through the Arctic Ocean north of Russia, into the Pacific and so to the Far East. Hudson departed Amsterdam on 4 April in command of the Dutch ship \"Halve Maen.\" He could not complete the specified (eastward) route because ice blocked the passage, as with all previous such voyages, and he turned the ship around in mid-May while somewhere east of Norway's North Cape. At that point, acting outside his instructions, Hudson pointed the ship west and decided to try to seek a westerly passage through North America.\n\nThey reached the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on 2 July, and in mid-July made landfall near the LaHave area of Nova Scotia.\nHere they encountered Native Americans who were accustomed to trading with the French; they were willing to trade beaver pelts, but apparently no trades occurred. The ship stayed in the area about ten days, the crew replacing a broken mast and fishing for food. On the 25th a dozen men from the \"Halve Maen\", using muskets and small cannon, went ashore and assaulted the village near their anchorage. They drove the people from the settlement and took their boat and other property (probably pelts and trade goods).\n\nOn 4 August the ship was at Cape Cod, from which Hudson sailed south to the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay. Rather than entering the Chesapeake he explored the coast to the north, finding Delaware Bay but continuing on north. On 3 September he reached the estuary of the river that initially was called the \"North River\" or \"Mauritius\" and now carries his name. He was not the first European to discover the estuary, though, as it had been known since the voyage of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. On 6 September 1609 John Colman of his crew was killed by Indians with an arrow to his neck. Hudson sailed into the upper bay on 11 September, and the following day began a journey up what is now known as the Hudson River. Over the next ten days his ship ascended the river, reaching a point about where the present-day capital of Albany is located.\n\nOn 23 September, Hudson decided to return to Europe. He put in at Dartmouth, England on 7 November, and was detained by authorities who wanted access to his log. He managed to pass the log to the Dutch ambassador to England, who sent it, along with his report, to Amsterdam.\n\nWhile exploring the river, Hudson had traded with several native groups, mainly obtaining furs. His voyage was used to establish Dutch claims to the region and to the fur trade that prospered there when a trading post was established at Albany in 1614. New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island became the capital of New Netherland in 1625.\n\nIn 1610, Hudson obtained backing for another voyage, this time under the English flag. The funding came from the Virginia Company and the British East India Company. At the helm of his new ship, the \"Discovery\", he stayed to the north (some claim he deliberately stayed too far south on his Dutch-funded voyage), reaching Iceland on 11 May, the south of Greenland on 4 June, and then rounding the southern tip of Greenland.\n\nOn 25 June, the explorers reached what is now the Hudson Strait at the northern tip of Labrador. Following the southern coast of the strait on 2 August, the ship entered Hudson Bay. Excitement was very high due to the expectation that the ship had finally found the Northwest Passage through the continent. Hudson spent the following months mapping and exploring its eastern shores, but he and his crew did not find a passage to Asia. In November, however, the ship became trapped in the ice in the James Bay, and the crew moved ashore for the winter.\n\nWhen the ice cleared in the spring of 1611, Hudson planned to use his \"Discovery\" to further explore Hudson Bay with the continuing goal of discovering the Passage; however, most of the members of his crew ardently desired to return home. Matters came to a head and much of the crew mutinied in June.\n\nDescriptions of the successful mutiny are one-sided, because the only survivors who could tell their story were the mutineers and those who went along with the mutiny. Allegedly in the latter class was ship's navigator Abacuk Pricket, a survivor who kept a journal that was to become a key source for the narrative of the mutiny. According to Pricket, the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet. Pricket's narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen—men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson—adrift from the \"Discovery\" in a small shallop, an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The Pricket journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some food, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nAfter the mutiny, Captain Hudson's shallop broke out oars and tried to keep pace with the \"Discovery\" for some time. Pricket recalled that the mutineers finally tired of the David-Goliath pursuit and unfurled additional sails aboard the \"Discovery\", enabling the larger vessel to leave the tiny open boat behind. Hudson and the other seven aboard the shallop were never seen again. Despite subsequent searches/expeditions, including those conducted in 1612 by Thomas Button and in 1668-70 by Zachariah Gillam,\ntheir fate is unknown.\n\nPricket's journal and testimony have been severely criticized for bias, on two grounds. Firstly, prior to the mutiny the alleged leaders of the uprising, Greene and Juet, had been friends and loyal seamen of Captain Hudson. Secondly, Greene and Juet did not survive the return voyage to England. Pricket knew he and the other survivors of the mutiny would be tried in England for piracy, and it would have been in his interest, and the interest of the other survivors, to put together a narrative that would place the blame for the mutiny upon men who were no longer alive to defend themselves.\n\nIn any case, the Pricket narrative became the controlling story of the expedition's disastrous end. Only 8 of the 13 mutinous crewmen survived the return voyage to Europe. They were arrested in England, and some were put on trial, but no punishment was imposed for the mutiny. One theory holds that the survivors were considered too valuable as sources of information to execute, as they had traveled to the New World and could describe sailing routes and conditions. Perhaps for this reason, they were charged with murder—of which they were acquitted—rather than mutiny, of which they likely would have been convicted and executed.\n\nThe gulf or bay discovered by Hudson is twice the size of the Baltic Sea, and its many large estuaries afford access to otherwise landlocked parts of Western Canada and the Arctic. This allowed the Hudson's Bay Company to exploit a lucrative fur trade along its shores for more than two centuries, growing powerful enough to influence the history and present international boundaries of Western North America. Hudson Strait became the entrance to the Arctic for all ships engaged in the historic search for the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic side (though modern voyages take more northerly routes).\n\nAlong with Hudson Bay, many other topographical features and landmarks are named for Hudson. The Hudson River in New York and New Jersey is named after him, as are Hudson County, New Jersey, the Henry Hudson Bridge, the Henry Hudson Parkway, and the town of Hudson, New York.\n\nHudson and his marooned crewmates appear as mythic characters in the famous story \"Rip Van Winkle\" by Washington Irving. He also appears in the time-travel novel \"Torn\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix.\n\n\n"}

It is a synthesizing discipline which shares both topical and methodological similarities with history, anthropology, ecology, geology, environmental studies, literary studies, and other fields. Although the majority of work in historical geography is considered human geography, the field also encompasses studies of geographic change which are not primarily anthropogenic. Historical geography is often a major component of school and university curricula in geography and social studies. Current research in historical geography is being performed by scholars in more than forty countries. \n\nHistorical geography seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding their interaction with their local environment and surroundings.\n\nIn its early days, historical geography was difficult to define as a subject. A textbook from the 1950s cites a previous definition as an 'unsound attempt by geographers to explain history'. Its author, J. B. Mitchell, came down firmly on the side of geography: 'the historical geographer is a geographer first last and all the time'. By 1975 the first number of the \"Journal of Historical Geography\" had widened the discipline to a broader church: 'the writings of scholars of any disciplinary provenance who have something to say about matters of geographical interest relating to past time'.\n\nFor some in the United States of America, the term \"historical geography\" has a more specialized meaning: the name given by Carl Ortwin Sauer of the University of California, Berkeley to his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) along regional lines, beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. To Sauer, a landscape and the cultures in it could only be understood if all of its influences through history were taken into account: physical, cultural, economic, political, environmental. Sauer stressed regional specialization as the only means of gaining sufficient expertise on regions of the world. Sauer's philosophy was the principal shaper of American geographic thought in the mid-20th century. Regional specialists remain in academic geography departments to this day. Despite this, some geographers feel that it harmed the discipline; that too much effort was spent on data collection and classification, and too little on analysis and explanation. Studies became more and more area-specific as later geographers struggled to find places to make names for themselves. These factors may have led in turn to the 1950s crisis in geography, which raised serious questions about geography as an academic discipline in the USA.\n\nThis sub-branch of human geography is closely related to history, environmental history, and historical ecology. \n\n\n\n"}

It has been carefully guarded for most of its history, and it is only since the late 1980s that the area has been open to archaeologists.\n\nAccording to \"The Secret History of the Mongols\", Genghis Khan chose the area when he went hunting near the Burkhan Khaldun mountain in the Khentii Mountains of his homeland. He sat down to rest under a tree, and was so impressed by the scenery that he said: \"What a beautiful view! Bury me here when I pass away.\"\n\nIt is not known whether he really was buried there, but the Mongols took several steps to give the impression that he was. The area, already made difficult to reach by a series of mountains covered in thick forest, was declared sacred, and off limits to everyone except the Darkhad, a group of elite warriors and their families, who were given the task of ensuring that no one else entered under penalty of death. The only legitimate reason for entrance was to bury a relative of Genghis Khan.\n\nThe Darkhads and their descendants faithfully carried out their assignment from the Khan’s death in 1227 until the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, a satellite state of the USSR, in 1924. The Soviets feared that if the region were made publicly accessible memories of Genghis Khan would encourage Mongolian nationalism, so they declared the land a 'Highly Restricted Area' and cordoned off 10,400 square-kilometers of surrounding land.\n\nThe first archeological expedition to the region was the 1989 \"Three Rivers\" expedition, which was carried out by a joint Mongolian–Japanese team with the support of the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. The team worked from 1989 to 1992 using ultrasound technology, which enabled them to find 1380 possible graves of Mongolian nobles.\n"}

Though little is known about his family, he was of noble birth and served in the Spanish military from a young age. He first came to the Americas as a \"gentlemen volunteer\" with Christopher Columbus's second expedition in 1493.\n\nBy the early 1500s, Ponce de León was a top military official in the colonial government of Hispaniola, where he helped crush a rebellion of the native Taíno people. He was authorized to explore the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in 1508 and was named the first Governor of Puerto Rico by appointment of the Spanish crown in 1509. While Ponce de León grew quite wealthy from his plantations and mines, he faced an ongoing legal conflict with Diego Columbus, the late Christopher Columbus's son, over the right to govern Puerto Rico. After a long court battle, Columbus replaced Ponce de León as governor in 1511. Ponce de León decided to follow the advice of the sympathetic King Ferdinand and explore more of the Caribbean Sea.\n\nIn 1513, Ponce de León led the first known European expedition to La Florida, which he named during his first voyage to the area. He landed somewhere along Florida's east coast, then charted the Atlantic coast down to the Florida Keys and north along the Gulf coast, perhaps as far as Charlotte Harbor. Though in popular culture he was supposedly searching for the Fountain of Youth, there is no contemporary evidence to support the story, which all modern historians call a myth.\n\nPonce de León returned to Spain in 1514 and was knighted by King Ferdinand, who also reinstated him as the governor of Puerto Rico and authorized him to settle Florida. He returned to the Caribbean in 1515, but plans to organize an expedition to Florida were delayed by the death of King Ferdinand in 1516, after which Ponce de León again traveled to Spain to defend his grants and titles. He would not return to Puerto Rico for two years.\n\nIn 1521, Ponce de León finally returned to southwest Florida with the first large-scale attempt to establish a Spanish colony in what is now the continental United States. However, the native Calusa people fiercely resisted the incursion, and he was seriously wounded in a skirmish. The colonization attempt was abandoned, and its leader died from his wounds soon after returning to Cuba. Ponce de León was interred in Puerto Rico, and his tomb is located inside of the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista in San Juan.\n\nJuan Ponce de León was born in the village of Santervás de Campos in the northern part of what is now the Spanish province of Valladolid. Although early historians placed his birth in 1460, and this date has been used traditionally, more recent evidence shows he was likely born in 1474. The surname Ponce de León dates from the 13th century. The Ponce de León lineage began with Ponce Vélaz de Cabrera, descendant of count Bermudo Núñez, and Sancha Ponce de Cabrera, daughter of Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera. Before October 1235, a son of Ponce Vela de Cabrera and his wife Teresa Rodríguez Girón named Pedro Ponce de Cabrera married Aldonza Alfonso, an illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso IX of León. The descendants of this marriage added the \"de León\" to their patronymic and were known henceforth as the Ponce de León.\n\nThe identity of his parents is still unknown, but he appears to have been a member of a distinguished and influential noble family. His relatives included Rodrigo Ponce de León, Marquis of Cádiz, a celebrated figure in the Moorish wars.\n\nPonce de León was related to another notable family, the Núñez de Guzmáns, and as a young man he served as squire to Pedro Núñez de Guzmán, Knight Commander of the Order of Calatrava. A contemporary chronicler, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, states that Ponce de León gained his experience as a soldier fighting in the Spanish campaigns that defeated the Moors in Granada and completed the re-conquest of Spain in 1492.\n\nOnce the war against the Emirate of Granada ended, there was no apparent need for his military services at home, so, like many of his contemporaries, Ponce de León looked abroad for his next opportunity. In September 1493, some 1,200 sailors, colonists, and soldiers joined Christopher Columbus for his second voyage to the New World. Ponce de León was a member of this expedition, one of 200 \"gentleman volunteers.\"\n\nThe fleet reached the Caribbean in November 1493. They visited several islands before arriving at their primary destination in Hispaniola. In particular they anchored on the coast of a large island the natives called Borinquen but would eventually become known as Puerto Rico. This was Ponce de León's first glimpse of the place that would play a major role in his future.\n\nHistorians are divided on what he did during the next several years, but it is possible that he returned to Spain at some point and made his way back to Hispaniola with Nicolás de Ovando.\n\nIn 1502 the newly appointed governor, Nicolás de Ovando, arrived in Hispaniola. The Spanish Crown expected Ovando to bring order to a colony in disarray. Ovando interpreted this as authorizing subjugation of the native Taínos. Thus, Ovando authorized the Jaragua Massacre in November 1503. In 1504, when Tainos overran a small Spanish garrison in Higüey on the island's eastern side, Ovando assigned Ponce de León to crush the rebellion. Ponce de León was actively involved in the Higüey massacre, about which friar Bartolomé de las Casas attempted to notify Spanish authorities. Ovando rewarded his victorious commander by appointing him frontier governor of the newly conquered province, then named Higüey also. Ponce de León received a substantial land grant which authorized sufficient Indian slave labor to farm his new estate.\n\nPonce de León prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby Boca de Yuma where Spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 Ovando authorized Ponce de León to establish a new town in Higüey, which he named Salvaleón. In 1508 King Ferdinand (Queen Isabella having opposed the exploitation of natives but dying in 1504) authorized Ponce de León to conquer the remaining Taínos and exploit them in gold mining.\n\nAround this time, Ponce de León married Leonora, an innkeeper's daughter. They had three daughters (Juana, Isabel and Maria) and one son (Luis). The large stone house Ponce de León ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of Salvaleón de Higüey.\n\nAs provincial governor, Ponce de León had occasion to meet with the Taínos who visited his province from neighboring Puerto Rico. They told him stories of a fertile land with much gold to be found in the many rivers. Inspired by the possibility of riches, Ponce de León requested and received permission from Ovando to explore the island.\n\nHis first reconnaissance of the island is usually dated to 1508 but there is evidence that he had made a previous exploration as early as 1506. This earlier trip was done quietly because the Spanish crown had commissioned Vicente Yáñez Pinzón to settle the island in 1505. Pinzón did not fulfill his commission and it expired in 1507, leaving the way clear for Ponce de León.\n\nHis earlier exploration had confirmed the presence of gold and gave him a good understanding of the geography of the island. In 1508, Ferdinand II of Aragon gave permission to Ponce de León for the first \"official\" expedition to the island, which the Spanish then called San Juan Bautista. This expedition, consisting of about 50 men in one ship, left Hispaniola on July 12, 1508 and eventually anchored in San Juan Bay, near today's city of San Juan. Ponce de León searched inland until he found a suitable site about two miles from the bay. Here he erected a storehouse and a fortified house, creating the first settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra. Although a few crops were planted, the settlers spent most of their time and energy searching for gold. By early 1509 Ponce de León decided to return to Hispaniola. His expedition had collected a good quantity of the precious metal but was running low on food and supplies.\n\nThe expedition was deemed a great success and Ovando appointed Ponce de León governor of San Juan Bautista. This appointment was later confirmed by Ferdinand II on August 14, 1509. He was instructed to extend the settlement of the island and continue mining for gold. The new governor returned to the island as instructed, bringing with him his wife and children.\n\nBack on his island, Ponce de León parceled out the native Taínos amongst himself and other settlers using a system of forced labor known as encomienda. The Indians were put to work growing food crops and mining for gold. Many of the Spaniards treated the Taínos very harshly and newly introduced diseases like smallpox and measles took a severe toll on the local population. By June 1511 the Taínos were pushed to a short-lived rebellion, which was forcibly put down by Ponce de León and a small force of troops armed with crossbows and arquebuses.\n\nEven as Ponce de León was settling the island of San Juan, significant changes were taking place in the politics and government of the Spanish West Indies. On July 10, 1509, Diego Colón, the son of Christopher Columbus, arrived in Hispaniola as acting Viceroy, replacing Nicolás de Ovando. For several years Diego Colón had been waging a legal battle over his rights to inherit the titles and privileges granted to his father. The Crown regretted the sweeping powers that had been granted to Columbus and his heirs and sought to establish more direct control in the New World. In spite of the Crown's opposition, Colón prevailed in court and Ferdinand was required to appoint him Viceroy.\nAlthough the courts had ordered that Ponce de León should remain in office, Colón circumvented this directive on October 28, 1509 by appointing Juan Ceron chief justice and Miguel Diaz chief constable of the island, effectively overriding the authority of the governor. This situation prevailed until March 2, 1510, when Ferdinand issued orders reaffirming Ponce de León's position as governor. Ponce de León then had Ceron and Diaz arrested and sent back to Spain.\n\nThe political struggle between Colón and Ponce de León continued in this manner for the next few years. Ponce de León had influential supporters in Spain and Ferdinand regarded him as a loyal servant. However, Colón's position as Viceroy made him a powerful opponent and eventually it became clear that Ponce de León's position on San Juan was not tenable. Finally, on November 28, 1511, Ceron returned from Spain and was officially reinstated as governor.\n\nRumors of undiscovered islands to the northwest of Hispaniola had reached Spain by 1511, and Ferdinand was interested in forestalling further exploration and discovery by Colón. In an effort to reward Ponce de León for his services, Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands outside the authority of Colón. Ponce de León readily agreed to a new venture, and in February 1512 a royal contract was dispatched outlining his rights and authorities to search for \"the Islands of Benimy\".\n\nThe contract stipulated that Ponce de León held exclusive rights to the discovery of Benimy and neighboring islands for the next three years. He would be governor for life of any lands he discovered, but he was expected to finance for himself all costs of exploration and settlement. In addition, the contract gave specific instructions for the distribution of gold, Native Americans, and other profits extracted from the new lands. Notably, there was no mention of a rejuvenating fountain.\n\nPonce de León equipped three ships with at least 200 men at his own expense and set out from Puerto Rico on March 4, 1513. The only near contemporary description known for this expedition comes from Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, a Spanish historian who apparently had access to the original ships' logs or related secondary sources from which he created a summary of the voyage published in 1601. The brevity of the account and occasional gaps in the record have led historians to speculate and dispute many details of the voyage.\n\nThe three ships in this small fleet were the \"Santiago\", the \"San Cristobal\" and the \"Santa Maria de la Consolacion\". Anton de Alaminos was their chief pilot. He was already an experienced sailor, and would become one of the most respected pilots in the region. After leaving Puerto Rico, they sailed northwest along the great chain of Bahama Islands, known then as the Lucayos. On March 27, Easter Sunday, they sighted an island that was unfamiliar to the sailors on the expedition. Because many Spanish seamen were acquainted with the Bahamas, which had been depopulated by slaving ventures, some scholars believe that this \"island\" was actually Florida, as it was thought to be an island for several years after its formal discovery. Other scholars have speculated that this island was one of the northern Bahama islands, perhaps Great Abaco.\n\nFor the next several days the fleet crossed open water until April 2, 1513, when they sighted land which Ponce de León believed was another island. He named it \"La Florida\" in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season, which the Spaniards called \"Pascua Florida\" (Festival of Flowers). The following day they came ashore to seek information and take possession of this new land. The precise location of their landing on the Florida coast has been disputed for many years. Some historians believe it occurred at or near St. Augustine; others prefer a more southern landing at a small harbor now called Ponce de León Inlet; but some also believe that Ponce came ashore even farther south near the present location of Melbourne Beach, a theory that has been criticized by some scholars in recent years. The latitude coordinate recorded in the ship's log closest to the landing site, reported by Herrera (who had the original logbook) in 1601, was 30 degrees, 8 minutes. This sighting was recorded at noon the day before with either a quadrant or a mariner's astrolabe, and the expedition sailed north for the remainder of the day before anchoring for the night and rowing ashore the following morning. This latitude corresponds to a spot north of St. Augustine between what is now the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve and Ponte Vedra Beach.\n\nAfter remaining in the area of their first landing for about five days, the ships turned south for further exploration of the coast. On April 8 they encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards and forced them to seek anchorage. The tiniest ship, the \"San Cristobal\", was carried out of sight and lost for two days. This was the first encounter with the Gulf Stream where it reaches maximum force between the Florida coast and the Bahamas. Because of the powerful boost provided by the current, it would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.\n\nThey continued down the coast hugging the shore to avoid the strong head current. By May 4 the fleet reached and named Biscayne Bay and took on water at an island they named Santa Marta (now Key Biscayne) and explored the Tequesta Miami mound town at the mouth of the Miami River. The Tequesta did not engage the Spanish, they evacuated into the coastal woodlands. On May 15 they left Biscayne Bay and sailed along the Florida Keys, looking for a passage to head north and explore the west coast of the Florida peninsula. From a distance the Keys reminded Ponce de León of men who were suffering, so he named them \"Los Martires\" (the Martyrs). Eventually they found a gap in the reefs and sailed \"to the north and other times to the northeast\" until they reached the Florida mainland on May 23, where they encountered the Calusa, who refused to trade and drove off the Spanish ships by surrounding them with warriors in sea canoes armed with long bows.\nAgain, the exact site of their landfall is controversial. The vicinity of Charlotte Harbor is the most commonly identified spot, while some assert a landing further north at Tampa Bay or even Pensacola. Other historians have argued the distances were too great to cover in the available time and the more likely location was Cape Romano or Cape Sable. Here Ponce de León anchored for several days to take on water and repair the ships. They were approached by Calusa, who might have been initially interested in trading but relations soon turned hostile. Several skirmishes followed with casualties on both sides and the Spaniards took eight Indians captive, including one to become a translator. On June 4, there was another encounter with natives near Sanibel Island and the Calusa in war canoes, with the Spanish sinking a fourth of them. An unsubstantiated claim to justify Spanish retreat.\nOn June 14 they set sail again looking for a chain of islands in the west that had been described by their captives. They reached the Dry Tortugas on June 21. There they captured giant sea turtles, Caribbean monk seals, and thousands of seabirds. From these islands they sailed southwest in an apparent attempt to circle around Cuba and return home to Puerto Rico. Failing to take into account the powerful currents pushing them eastward, they struck the northeast shore of Cuba and were initially confused about their location.\n\nOnce they regained their bearings, the fleet retraced their route east along the Florida Keys and around the Florida peninsula, reaching Grand Bahama on July 8. They were surprised to come across another Spanish ship, piloted by Diego Miruelo, who was either on a slaving voyage or had been sent by Diego Colón to spy on Ponce de León. Shortly thereafter Miruelo's ship was wrecked in a storm and Ponce de León rescued the stranded crew.\n\nFrom here the little fleet disbanded. Ponce de León tasked the \"Santa Maria\" with further exploration while he returned home with the rest of crew. Ponce de León reached Puerto Rico on October 19 after having been away for almost eight months. The other ship, after further explorations returned safely on February 20, 1514.\n\nAlthough Ponce de León is widely credited with the discovery of Florida, he almost certainly was not the first European to reach the peninsula. Spanish slave expeditions had been regularly raiding the Bahamas since 1494 and there is some evidence that one or more of these slavers made it as far as the shores of Florida.\nAnother piece of evidence that others came before Ponce de León is the Cantino Map from 1502, which shows a peninsula near Cuba that looks like Florida's and includes characteristic place names.\n\nAccording to a popular legend, Ponce de León discovered Florida while searching for the Fountain of Youth. Though stories of vitality-restoring waters were known on both sides of the Atlantic long before Ponce de León, the story of his searching for them was not attached to him until after his death. In his \"Historia general y natural de las Indias\" of 1535, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to cure his aging. A similar account appears in Francisco López de Gómara's \"Historia general de las Indias\" of 1551. Then in 1575, Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a shipwreck survivor who had lived with the Native Americans of Florida for 17 years, published his memoir in which he locates the waters in Florida, and says that Ponce de León was supposed to have looked for them there. Though Fontaneda doubted that Ponce de León had really gone to Florida looking for the waters, the account was included in the \"Historia general de los hechos de los castellanos\" of Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas of 1615. Most historians hold that the search for gold and the expansion of the Spanish Empire were far more imperative than any potential search for such a fountain.\n\nThere is a possibility that the Fountain of Youth was an allegory for the Bahamian love vine, which locals brew today as an aphrodisiac. Ponce de León could have been seeking it as a potential entrepreneurial venture. Woodrow Wilson believed Indian servants brewing a \"brown tea\" in Puerto Rico may have inspired Ponce de León's search for the Fountain of Youth. Arne Molander has speculated that the adventurous conquistador mistook the natives' \"vid\" (vine) for \"vida\" (life) – transforming their \"fountain vine\" into an imagined \"fountain of life\".\n\nUpon his return to Puerto Rico, Ponce de León found the island in turmoil. A party of Caribs from a neighboring island had attacked the settlement of Caparra, killed several Spaniards and burned it to the ground. Ponce de León's own house was destroyed and his family narrowly escaped. Colón used the attack as a pretext for renewing hostilities against the local Taíno tribes. The explorer suspected that Colón was working to further undermine his position on the island and perhaps even to take his claims for the newly discovered Florida.\n\nPonce de León decided he should return to Spain and personally report the results of his recent expedition. He left Puerto Rico in April 1514 and was warmly received by Ferdinand when he arrived at court in Valladolid. There he was knighted, and given a personal coat of arms, becoming the first conquistador to receive these honors. He also visited Casa de Contratación in Seville, which was the central bureaucracy and clearinghouse for all of Spain's activities in the New World. The Casa took detailed notes of his discoveries and added them to the Padrón Real, a master map which served as the basis for official navigation charts provided to Spanish captains and pilots.\n\nDuring his stay in Spain, a new contract was drawn up for Ponce de León confirming his rights to settle and govern Bimini and Florida, which was then presumed to be an island. In addition to the usual directions for sharing gold and other valuables with the king, the contract was one of the first to stipulate that the Requerimiento was to be read to the inhabitants of the islands prior to their conquest. Ponce de León was also ordered to organize an armada for the purpose of attacking and subduing the Caribs, who continued to attack Spanish settlements in the Caribbean.\n\nThree ships were purchased for his armada and after repairs and provisioning Ponce de León left Spain on May 14, 1515 with his little fleet. The record of his activities against the Caribs is vague. There was one engagement in Guadeloupe on his return to the area and possibly two or three other encounters. The campaign came to an abrupt end in 1516 when Ferdinand died. The king had been a strong supporter and Ponce de León felt it was imperative he return to Spain and defend his privileges and titles. He did receive assurances of support from Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, the regent appointed to govern Castile, but it was nearly two years before he was able to return home to Puerto Rico.\n\nMeanwhile, there had been at least two unauthorized voyages to \"his\" Florida both ending in repulsion by the native Calusa Tequesta warriors. Ponce de León realized he had to act soon if he was to maintain his claim.\n\nIn early 1521, Ponce de León organized a colonizing expedition consisting of some 200 men, including priests, farmers and artisans, 50 horses and other domestic animals, and farming implements carried on two ships. The expedition landed somewhere on the coast of southwest Florida, likely in the vicinity of Charlotte Harbor or the Caloosahatchee River, areas which Ponce de León had visited in his earlier voyage to Florida.\n\nBefore the settlement could be established, the colonists were attacked by the Calusa, the indigenous people who dominated southern Florida and whose principal town was nearby. Ponce de León was mortally wounded in the skirmish when, historians believe, an arrow poisoned with the sap of the manchineel tree struck his thigh. The expedition immediately abandoned the colonization attempt and sailed to Havana, Cuba, where Ponce de León soon died of his wounds. He was buried in Puerto Rico, in the crypt of San José Church from 1559 to 1836, when his remains were exhumed and transferred to the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "493833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=493833", "title": "Light characteristic", "text": "Light characteristic\n\nA light characteristic is a graphic and text description of a navigational light sequence or colour displayed on a nautical chart or in a Light List with the chart symbol for a lighthouse, lightvessel, buoy or sea mark with a light on it. The graphic indicates how the real light may be identified when looking at its actual light output type or sequence. Different lights use different colours, frequencies and light patterns, so mariners can identify which light they are seeing.\n\nWhile light characteristics can be described in prose, e.g. \"Flashing white every three seconds\", lists of lights and navigation chart annotations use abbreviations. The abbreviation notation is slightly different from one light list to another, with dots added or removed, but it usually follows a pattern similar to the following (see the chart to the right for examples).\n\nAn example of a complete light characteristic is \"Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M\". This indicates that the light is a \"group occulting light\" in which a group of three eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; the light is white; the light is 15 metres above the chart datum and is visible for .\n\nA fixed light, abbreviated \"F\", is a continuous and steady light.\n\nA flashing light is a rhythmic light in which the total duration of the light in each period is clearly shorter than the total duration of the darkness and in which the flashes of light are all of equal duration. It is most commonly used for a single-flashing light which exhibits only single flashes which are repeated at regular intervals, in which case it is abbreviated simply as \"Fl\". It can also be used with a group of flashes which are regularly repeated, in which case the abbreviation is \"Fl.(2)\" or \"Gr Fl.(2)\", for a group of two flashes. Another possibility is a composite group, in which successive groups in the period have different numbers of flashes, e.g. \"Fl. (2+1)\" indicates a group of two flashes, followed by one flash.\n\nA specific case sometimes used is when the flashes are longer than two seconds. Such a light is sometimes denoted \"long flashing\" with the abbreviation \"L.Fl\".\n\nIf the frequency of flashes is large (more than 30 or 50 per minute) the light is denoted as a \"quick light\", see below.\n\nAn occulting light is a rhythmic light in which the duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of flashing off, rather than flashing on. Like a flashing light, it can be used for a single occulting light that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated \"Oc\"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).\n\nAn isophase light, abbreviated \"Iso\", is a light which has dark and light periods of equal length. The prefix derives from the Greek \"iso-\" meaning \"same\".\n\nA quick light, abbreviated \"Q\", is a special case of a flashing light with a large frequency (more than 30 or 50 per minute). If the sequence of flashes is interrupted by regularly repeated eclipses of constant and long duration, the light is denoted \"interrupted quick\", abbreviated \"I.Q\". \n\nGroup notation similar to flashing and occulting lights is also sometimes used (e.g. Q.(9)). \n\nAnother distinction sometimes made is between quick (more than 50 and less than 80 flashes per minute), very quick (more than 80 and less than 160 flashes per minutes, abbreviated \"V.Q\") and ultra quick (no less than 160 flashes per minute, abbreviate \"U.Q\"). This can be combined with notations for interruptions, e.g. I.U.Q. for interrupted ultra quick, or grouping, e.g. V.Q.(9) for a very quick group of nine flashes. Quick characteristics can also be followed by other characteristics, e.g. V.Q.(6)+L.Fl. for a very quick group of six flashes, followed by a long flash.\n\nA Morse code light is light in which appearances of light of two clearly different durations (dots and dashes) are grouped to represent a character or characters in the Morse Code. For example, \"Mo. (A)\" is a light in which in each period light is shown for a short period (dot) followed by a long period (dash), the Morse Code for \"A\".\n\nA fixed and flashing light, abbreviated \"F. Fl\", is a light in which a fixed low intensity light is combined with a flashing high intensity light.\n\nAn alternating light, abbreviated \"Al\", is a light which shows alternating colors. For example, \"Al WG\" shows white and green lights alternately.\n\n\n"}

It corresponds to what is now the Libya and Egypt frontier, including the towns of Bomba (ancient \"Phthia\"), Timimi (ancient \"Paliurus\"), Tobruk (ancient \"Antipyrgus\"), Acroma (ancient \"Gonia\"), Bardiya, As-Salum, and Sidi Barrani (ancient \"Zygra\"). The territory stretched to the far south, encompassing the Siwa Oasis, which at the time was known for its sanctuary to the deity Amun. The eastern part of Marmarica, by some geographers considered a separate district between Marmarica and Aegyptus, was known as Libycus Nomus. In late antiquity, Marmarica was also known as Libya Inferior, while Cyrenaica was known as \"Libya Superior\".\n\n\"Libya\" was considered as the part of Africa west of the Nile, more precisely west of the mouth of the Nile at Canopus. The periplus of Scylax of Caryanda names the Adyrmachidae as the first people of Libya (Africa).\nMarmarica proper was delimited towards the east by the escarpment of \"Catabathmus Magnus\", now known as \"Akabah el-Kebir\", at Salum. The geographers of the Hellenistic period included Egypt in the continent of Asia, and drew the boundary between Asia and Africa (Libya) at this point.\n\nUnder the Roman Empire, Marmarica included the \"Libycus Nomus\", located between the Catabathmus and the Bay of Plinthine (\"Sinus Plinthinetes\"). This area had formerly been considered part of Egypt. The city of \"Paraetonium\" (also \"Ammonia\", modern Mersa Matruh) was the westernmost town of Egypt, for which reason it together with Pelusium was known as the \"horns of Egypt\". About 10 stadia west of Paraetonium was \"Apis\", marking the border to the Libyan Nomos. \"Menelaus Portus\" (near modern Zawiyat Umm Rukbah), according to tradition founded by Menelaus, was known as the site of the death of Agesilaus II.\n\nThe inhabitants of Marmarica were known generically as \"Marmaridae\", but they are given the special names of \n\"Adyrmachidae\" and \"Giligammae\" in the coastal districts, and of \"Nasamones\" and \"Augilae\" in the interior. \nThe Adyrmachidae are said to have differed considerably from the nomadic tribes of the country, strongly resembling the Egyptians.\nThe territory south of the Libyan Nomos was inhabited by the \"Ammonii\", centered on the celebrated and fertile oasis of Ammon (Siwa)\n\nBoth Cyrenaica and Marmarica were included in the diocese of Egypt in the 4th century, within the larger Praetorian prefecture of the East (while Tripolitania was in the Praetorian prefecture of Italy).\n\nAncient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Marmarica or Libya Inferior listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees:\nFor the sees of Libya Superior see Cyrenaica.\n\n\n"}

His research and the work of CASA is focused on computer models of city systems. He was awarded the William Alonso Prize of the Regional Science Association in 2011 for his book Cities and Complexity, the same prize a second time for his book The New Science of Cities in 2017-2018, the University Consortium GIS Research Award in 2012, and the Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud, the so-called 'Nobel for geography', in 2013. In 2015, he was awarded the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society and in 2016, the Gold Medal of the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI). He also received the Senior Scholar Award of the Complex Systems Society in September 2016.\n\nMichael Batty was born in Liverpool and educated at Northway County Primary School \nfrom 1950 to 1956 and then at Quarry Bank High School for Boys from 1956 to 1962. He went to the University of Manchester (1962-1966) where he studied Town and Country Planning gaining the BA degree with First Class Honours in 1966. His PhD is from the University of Wales, Institute of Science and Technology in 1984. The thesis on Pseudo Dynamic Urban Models was made available online in 2012.\n\n\nHe began his academic career in the University of Manchester in 1966 where he was appointed an Assistant Lecturer in Town and Country Planning. He then spent 10 years at the University of Reading as Research Assistant, Lecturer and Reader in Geography. During this time he spent one year as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Transport Planning in the Department of Civil Engineering in the University of Waterloo, Ontario. He moved to the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (now the University of Cardiff) in 1979, where he was Professor of town planning. During this time, he acted as Head of Department, and Dean of the Faculty of Environmental Design. In 1990, he moved to direct the US National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) at the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY-Buffalo) where he was a Professor of geography.\n\nHe has held several visiting appointments in computing, engineering, planning, and geography at the following Universities: University of Illinois; University of Melbourne; University of Hong Kong; University of Bristol; University of Michigan; and he currently has visiting appointments at Cardiff University and Arizona State University.\n\nHis research has focussed on the development of analytical methods and computer models for simulating the structure of cities and regions. Early work involved aggregate land use transport models which are summarised in his first book \"Urban Modelling\". After this early work, he focused on more visual representations of cities and their models and some of these were represented in his second book \"Microcomputer Graphics\". With Paul Longley, he published \"Fractal Cities\". This work established the idea that cities might be regarded as the outcome of self-similar fractal processes generating structure from the bottom up. His work on complexity theory in urban analysis and planning is the focus of his book \"Cities and Complexity\", a summary of which is available on his ComplexCity web site. His most recent book \"The New Science of Cities\". ties many of the ideas together, developing the notion that it is flows rather than locations that are key to an understanding not only of cities but also the processes for their design and planning.\n\nHe has edited several volumes, most recently \"Agent-Based Models of Geographical Systems\" and \"Virtual Geographic Environments\".\n\nDetails of his publications are available from his curriculum vita\nand on his personal web pages.\nLearned Societies: He has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2009, a Fellow of the British Academy in 2001, a Fellow of Academy of Social Sciences in 2001 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1982.\n\nProfessional Institutes: He has been a Member and now Fellow of the Royal Town Planning Institute since 1971, and the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport since 1984.\n\nHe has recently acted as: Member of the Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information - APPSI, Chair of the ESRC Census Advisory Committee, and a Member of the UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2004-2009 Geography Panel.\n\nAt Cardiff, he was a Member of the Computer Board for British Universities and Research Councils, now JISC (1988–1990), a Member of the SERC (Science and Engineering Research Council) Transport Committee (1982–1985), Chair (1980–1982), then Vice-Chair (1982–1984) of the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council) Environment and Planning Committee, and Chair of the Conference of Heads Of Planning Schools (CHOPS) 1986-1980.\n"}

Every producer of nautical publications also provides a system to inform mariners of changes that effect the chart. In the United States, corrections and notifications of new editions are provided by various governmental agencies by way of Notice to Mariners, Local Notice to Mariners, Summary of Corrections, and Broadcast Notice to Mariners. Radio broadcasts give advance notice of urgent corrections.\n\nA convenient way to keep track of corrections is with a \"Chart and Publication Correction Record Card\" system. Using this system, the navigator does not immediately update every publication in the library when a new \"Notice to Mariners\" arrives, instead creating a card for every chart and noting the correction on this card. When the time comes to use the publication, he pulls the publication and its card, and makes the indicated corrections to the publication. This system ensures that every publication is properly corrected prior to use.\n\nVarious and diverse methods exist for the correction of electronic nautical publications.\n\nThe \"United States Coast Guard Light List\" is an American navigation publication in seven volumes made available yearly by the U.S. Coast Guard which gives information on lighted navigation aids, unlighted buoys, radiobeacons, radio direction finder calibration stations, daybeacons, racons, and LORAN stations.\n\n\"The American Practical Navigator\", written by Nathaniel Bowditch, is an encyclopedia of navigation, valuable handbook on oceanography and meteorology, and contains useful tables and a maritime glossary. In 1866 the copyright and plates were bought by the Hydrographic Office of the United States Navy, and as a U.S. Government publication, it is now available for free online. It is not only a notable book but is considered one of America's nautical institutions.\n\n\"United States Coast Pilots\" is a nine-volume American navigation publication distributed yearly by the National Ocean Service. Its purpose is to supplement nautical charts of U.S. waters. Information comes from field inspections, survey vessels, and various harbor authorities. Maritime officials and pilotage associations provide additional information. \"Coast Pilots\" provides more detailed information than \"Sailing Directions\" because the latter is intended exclusively for the oceangoing mariner. Each volume of \"Coast Pilots\" must be regularly corrected using Notice to Mariners.\n\nThe \"List of Lights, Radio Aids, and Fog Signals\" is a navigation publication produced by the United States Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center. The book is usually referred to as the \"List of Lights\", and should not be confused with the U.S. Coast Guard's \"Light List\". The \"List of Lights\" is published in seven volumes, as Publication numbers 110 through 116. Each volume contains lights and other aids to navigation that are maintained by or under the authority of other governments.\n\n\"Sailing Directions\" is a 47-volume American navigation publication published by the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center. It consists of 37 Enroute volumes and 10 Planning Guides. Planning Guides describe general features of ocean basins; Enroutes describe features of coastlines, ports, and harbors. \"Sailing Directions\" is updated when new data requires extensive revision of an existing text. These data are obtained from several sources, including pilots and \"Sailing Directions\" from other countries.\n\nThe \"World Port Index\" (PUB 150) contains a tabular listing of thousands of ports throughout the world, describing their location, characteristics, known facilities, and available services. Of particular interest are the applicable volume of Sailing Directions and the number of the harbor chart. The table is arranged geographically, with an alphabetical index.\n\n\"Distances Between Ports\" (PUB 151) is a publication that lists the distances between major ports. Reciprocal distances between two ports may differ due to different routes chosen because of currents and climatic conditions. To reduce the number of listings needed, junction points along major routes are used to consolidate routes converging from different directions.\n\n"}

Long internodes (which may be the result of over-watering, the over-use of fertilizer, or a seasonal \"growth spurt\") decrease a gardener's ability to induce ramification in a plant.\n\nA high degree of ramification is essential for the creation of topiary as it enables the topiary artist to carve a bush or hedge into a shape with an even surface. Ramification is also essential to practitioners of the art of bonsai as it helps recreate the form and habit of a full-size tree in a small tree grown in a container.\n\nThe pruning practices of coppicing and pollarding induce ramification by removing most of a tree's mass above the root. Fruit tree pruning increases the yield of orchards by inducing ramification and thereby creating many vigorous, fruitful branches in the place of a few less-fruitful ones.\n\n"}

The Saba Conservation Foundation manages the Saba National Marine Park, as well as the island's hyperbaric facility and natural sites on land.\n\nA number of regulations ensure that the park's thriving aquatic life remains healthy. Zones divide the area according to acceptable uses. Commercial fishing is forbidden in certain places to prevent overfishing. The reefs are protected from damage by 36 permanently anchored buoys where boats can moor. Scuba divers are not permitted to dive by themselves; they must dive with guides from one of Saba's three dive shops.\n\nProtecting the Saba National Marine Park is not only an environmental consideration, it is also an economic concern. Tourism currently brings in more money to the island than any other industry, and the Saba National Marine Park is the biggest tourist draw.\n\nIn addition to the fact that Saba's reefs are still flourishing, unlike many others in the region, several unusual natural formations attract divers. Some of these features were formed through volcanic activity, such as the Pinnacles: these peaks rise up to 100 feet (30 m) from the ocean floor, and are covered with corals, sponges, and other invertebrate animals. In the Ladder Bay area, a natural labyrinth was created by flowing lava. Other attractions include underwater caves, tunnels, and rock walls.\n\nMany different species of life inhabit Saba National Marine Park. Soft corals abound. Hard corals live only in the waters on the island's east side. Types of fish found in the park include parrotfish, Atlantic blue tang, black durgon, and barracuda. Sharks and stingrays frequent certain areas. Octopus, turtles, and spiny lobster make the park their home also.\n\nSaba's residents may access the park without charge.

It should not be confused with the South Geomagnetic Pole described later.\n\nFor historical reasons, the \"end\" of a freely hanging magnet that points (roughly) north is itself called the \"north pole\" of the magnet, and the other end, pointing south, is called the magnet's \"south pole\". Because opposite poles attract, the Earth's South Magnetic Pole is physically actually a magnetic \"north\" pole (see also ).\n\nThe South Magnetic Pole is constantly shifting due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field.\nAs of 2005 it was calculated to lie at , placing it off the coast of Antarctica, between Adélie Land and Wilkes Land. In 2015 it lay at (est). That point lies outside the Antarctic Circle. Due to polar drift, the pole is moving northwest by about per year. Its current distance from the actual Geographic South Pole is approximately . The nearest permanent science station is Dumont d'Urville Station. Wilkes Land contains a large gravitational mass concentration.\n\nEarly unsuccessful attempts to reach the magnetic south pole included those of French explorer Dumont d'Urville (1837–40), American Charles Wilkes (expedition of 1838–42) and Briton James Clark Ross (expedition of 1839 to 1843).\n\nThe first calculation of the magnetic inclination to locate the magnetic South Pole was made on January 23, 1838 by the hydrographer , a member of the Dumont d'Urville expedition in Antarctica and Oceania on the corvettes \"L'Astrolabe\" and \"Zélée\" in 1837-1840, which discovered Adelie Land.\n\nOn 16 January 1909 three men (Douglas Mawson, Edgeworth David, and Alistair Mackay) from Sir Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition claimed to have found the South Magnetic Pole, which was at that time located on land. They planted a flagpole at the spot and claimed it for the British Empire. The three men began the expedition to the South Magnetic Pole in a motor car specially adapted for the cold conditions, but abandoned it when it proved useless on soft surfaces. They then walked a total of 1260 miles to reach the South Magnetic Pole while pulling sledges and supplies that weighed approximately 670 lbs. Walking on foot across the coldest place on earth was perilous, and the men faced many dangers such as falling in concealed snow crevasses and acquiring frostbite and snow-blindness. Fearing starvation, they strictly rationed their biscuits down to the crumbs, and hunted seals and penguins. However, there is now some doubt as to whether their location was correct. The approximate position of the pole on 16 January 1909 was .\n\nThe South Magnetic Pole has also been estimated by fits to global sets of data such as the World Magnetic Model (WMM) and the International Geomagnetic Reference Model (IGRF). For earlier years back to about 1600, the model GUFM1 is used, based on a compilation of data from ship logs.\n\nThe Earth's geomagnetic field can be approximated by a tilted dipole (like a bar magnet) placed at the center of the Earth. The South Geomagnetic Pole is the point where the axis of this best-fitting tilted dipole intersects the Earth's surface in the southern hemisphere. As of 2005 it was calculated to be located at , near the Vostok Station. Because the field is not an exact dipole, the South Geomagnetic Pole does not coincide with the South Magnetic Pole. Furthermore, the South Geomagnetic Pole is wandering for the same reason its northern magnetic counterpart wanders.\n\n\n"}
