It runs north from Peterborough via Market Deeping, Bourne, Sleaford and Lincoln along a variety of ancient, Roman, and Turnpike alignments before it is interrupted at its junction with the M180 near Scawby. The road restarts east, and then continues north past Barton-upon-Humber, crossing the Humber on the Humber Bridge before terminating at Hessle near Kingston upon Hull.\n\nAccording to the AA, the route is long, and should take 2 hours. Norman Cross – Bourne takes 33 minutes, Bourne to Lincoln takes 46 minutes and Lincoln to the Humber Bridge takes 54 minutes.\n\nA section of the A15 (between Scampton and the M180) provides the longest stretch of straight road in the UK.\n\nThe A15 is Peterborough's main connecting road from the south to the A1(M), joining near Stilton, at Norman Cross. It begins as \"London Road\" at junction 16 of the A1(M) with the B1043 (former A1) in Cambridgeshire and the district of North West Cambridgeshire. From here to Yaxley it passes the \"Norman Cross Hotel\" and follows the City of Peterborough and Cambridgeshire boundary, where there is a junction with the B1091 (for Farcet).\n\nIt enters the City of Peterborough near Hampton Vale on the left, and meets the A1260 \"The Serpentine\", which leads to two much faster routes around Peterborough. Next is a roundabout for the Cygnet Park business park on the left, home of the new headquarters of News International. It enters Old Fletton near the headquarters of Hotpoint to the left. There is a staggered junction with the A1129 and it crosses the East Coast Main Line. It passes Peterborough United on the right in New Fletton. It meets the start of the A605 at a roundabout and crosses the River Nene.\nThe A15 takes two routes through Peterborough:\nBoth routes head through Werrington (passing either side) before joining again at Glinton with the roundabout with the B1443. There is another roundabout. with the B1443 (for Helpston). It passes Etton and meets a roundabout with the B1524 (former route through Market Deeping), B1162 (for Northborough to the right) and an exit for Maxey to the right.\n\nJust south of the \"Welland Gate\" roundabout on the A1175 and B1166, it crosses the River Welland so entering South Kesteven in Lincolnshire. The roundabout marks the western end of the £7 million Market Deeping bypass, finished in July 1998. The A15 and A1175 roads are now merged in a dual-carriageway stretch. It meets the B1524 (former route) at a roundabout and heads to the left as \"Peterborough Road\" \"Bourne Road\" and \"Deeping Road\".\nNorth of Baston is the Waterside Garden Centre close to where it meets the north-south Roman Road King Street, which it follows until just north of Bourne. It goes over the River Glen at the point it is crossed by the Macmillan Way, at Kate's Bridge.\n\nThere is a left turn for Obthorpe and it goes through Thurlby, passing the \"Horseshoe\" pub, then Northorpe, before coming to the small town of Bourne. It meets the recently diverted A151 at a new roundabout (the A151 leaves to the right further on), where the road becomes \"South Road\". It passes Bourne Grammar School, then after some treacherous bends near Bourne Abbey becomes \"South Street\", with the town's Heritage centre and war memorial gardens on the left by the Bourne Eau. At the crossroads in the centre of town it crosses the B1193 (original route of the A151) in the historic market place(), where are located the \"Nags Head\", \"Angel Hotel\", \"Burghley Arms\". As \"North Street\", it passes the Burghley Centre (shops), and Bourne Bus Station. At the two miniature roundabouts the name changes to North Road, which name it keeps until it reaches Morton.\nJust outside Bourne, at , the route of (Roman) King Street heads off across the fields to Stainfield and Ancaster but the A15 continues north along the line of another Roman road, Mareham Lane. It passes close to Dyke, and goes through Morton as \"Bourne Road\", passing the \"Lord Nelson\" pub. It becomes \"Folkingham Road\" there is a right turn for Haconby and a junction with the B1177 (for Billingborough). Close by are Rippingale and Kirkby Underwood. Between Rippingale and Aslackby a wooded lay-by known locally as 'Turnpike Bar' marks the deviation from the line of the Roman Road Mareham Lane. The A15 passes by Aslackby and the \" Robin Hood and Little John\", and then through the middle of Folkingham.\nThere is the Threekingham Bar roundabout with the east-west A52, and it goes through Osbournby, as \"London Road\" the primary school]. It passes the \"Tally Ho Inn]\" near Aswarby, then there are left turns for Aunsby and Swarby. Sleaford and Silk Willoughby] were on the A15, which slowed traffic down as the traffic went across a level crossing and through Sleaford's shopping area. The £5.7 million bypass opened on 16 September 1993, by Douglas Hogg, where there is a roundabout with the A153 and B1517. The A15 crosses the railway and River Slea, and then leaves the bypass at the \"Holdingham Roundabout\" with the A17 and B1518 (former route).\nAs \"Lincoln Road\", it goes close to Leasingham meeting the B1209. There is a junction Cranwell with the B1429. It meets the B1191 (for Scopwick), B1202 (for Boothby Graffoe to the west and Metheringham to the east) next to the former RAF Coleby Grange, and B1178 (for Harmston), where it passes Dunston Pillar. At Nocton Heath, it passes the \"Kitchen\" cafe. On the route to Lincoln, it goes near to two RAF bases – RAF Digby, which is used for communications rather than as a flying station, and across the end of the runway of RAF Waddington, which flies AWACS and Nimrod aircraft. A parking place and cafe are provided for plane spotters on the eastern side of the road.\nNext to the runway at Waddington is an old Vulcan, carrying the number of the plane that bombed Port Stanley. The A15 and Ermine Street meet at Bracebridge Heath, about north of the traffic lights for Canwick .\n\nAt Bracebridge Heath, it passes the Total \"Sleaford Road Service Station\", just before it passes the \"Blacksmiths Arms\", and meets the end of the A607 at traffic lights at \"The Bull\". Towards Lincoln, it meets the B1131 as \"London Road\", next to \" The Homestead\" (former St John's Hospital). It is crossed by the Viking Way at the moment Lincoln Cathedral comes into full view. The road meets the A1434 \"Newark Road\" from North Hykeham at traffic lights after passing The Priory Academy LSST and a bridge over the former GNR Grantham-Lincoln railway, where it becomes \"St Catherine's Road\", and passes an Eleanor Cross. At a roundabout at the south end of (what becomes) Lincoln's \"High Street\", it exits to the right along \"South Park\", passing the HQ of Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service, and meets the B1188 at traffic lights, where it heads left as \"Canwick Road\".\nAt Pelham Bridge (which was opened by the Queen in 1958), it crosses the railway, with the railway station on the left, the junction with the start of the A57 and Siemens (former Alstom) factory. It crosses the River Witham, before heading up the hill on the north side of the Lincoln Gap, and heading in the direction of the A158 as \"Lindum Road\" (for Skegness), where it is crossed by the Viking Way near Lincoln Minster School. As \"Wragby Road\", it passes Lincoln Christ's Hospital School on the left, then meets the B1308 near the large Carlton Centre Retail Park. The \"Lincolnshire Poacher\" is on the right hand side and there is a right turn for Cherry Willingham and Reepham.\n\nModern traffic routing has taken the road away from the route of Ermine Street as it passes through Lincoln.\n\nNorth of Lincoln, the A15 enters West Lindsey, and meets the start of the A158 at a roundabout, then runs concurrently with the A46 to the \"Riseholme\" roundabout, where it briefly re-enters the City of Lincoln, then follows the Roman road Ermine Street past the Riseholme College of Agriculture on the right, now part of the University of Lincoln, and Lincolnshire Showground to the left. At the end of a section is the \"Tillbridge Lane\" roundabout with the A1500, for Gainsborough. From here, it used to be straight, but with RAF Scampton becoming a base for V bombers in the 1950s, the runway had to be extended and the road now has a curved diversion to the east. It passes the Scampton primary school and continues past a right turn to Normanby by Spital, on its most straight section, also the parish boundary of many local villages. At the roundabout with the A631 at Caenby Corner, there is the Total \"Caenby Corner Garage\" just south of Spital-in-the-Street. Overtaking is difficult as the road, although straight, is undulating with unmarked dips and slow moving farm traffic. There are two right turns for Bishop Norton and Atterby. There is a right turn for Snitterby and a left turn for Blyborough. At the B1205 staggered crossroads (for Waddingham to the east, and Grayingham to the west), it enters North Lincolnshire.\n\nAt the B1206 crossroads, the old route used to go through Hibaldstow and Brigg, with the former road to Redbourne now a cycle route. It passes close to Kirton in Lindsey, home of RAF Kirton in Lindsey much used in the Second World War as a fighter airfield in 12 Group, now home to the Trent Valley Gliding Club. Hibaldstow was a wartime fighter airfield as well, and this is now used as a base for parachuting and parachuting competitions by Target Skysports. The £7 million Brigg and Redbourne bypass was added in December 1989 which follows the old Ermine Street in North Lincolnshire further than previously, with a much flatter, wider and safer road. This section was the upgraded route of an unclassified road. It crosses the Sheffield to Cleethorpes railway line near the deserted village of Gainsthorpe, passes near to Scawby, and joining the M180 at junction 4, near Scunthorpe. It abandons the Roman alignments at a short spur to the A18 at the,\"Briggate Lodge Roundabout\" next to the Forest Pines golf club and hotel at Broughton. Ermine Street continues north as the B1207, meeting the Humber near Winteringham.\n\nThe route of the A15 now becomes part of the three-laned M180, which was opened on 2 September 1977. The A15 section along Ermine Street was planned to be opened at the same time, but it had to wait twelve years. The buildup of traffic to Grimsby prompted calls for the Brigg bypass for many years, but the Flixborough explosion of 1974 made it more of an emergency. This section goes under the A18, over the River Ancholme, over the old route of the A15 (B1206) and over the South Trans-Pennine railway. At junction 5, the A15 reforms at the dual-grade \"Barnetby Top Interchange\", which is crossed by the Viking Way and has an exit to Elsham. It continues north as a dual carriageway which carries about as little traffic as the M180. The M180 drops to two lanes under this roundabout and continues to Grimsby and Immingham as the A180.\n\nThe A15 towards the Humber Bridge, goes directly across the runways of the former RAF Bomber Command airfield at RAF Elsham Wolds (where over 1000 of its aircrew were killed), which is now the Elsham Wolds Industrial Estate. The former route of the A15, pre-1978, is now called B1206, and ends at New Holland, where the A15 formerly connected with the Humber Ferry. The £5.6 million Brigg Bypass to Barton-upon-Humber Bypass (up to where the B1218 crosses) section opened in June 1978.\n\nThe £2 million Barton-upon-Humber Bypass to Humber Bridge (A1077 interchange) section opened in September 1978, although some maps show this being open before the southern section to the M180. When this whole section opened to the GSJ with the A1077 (for South Ferriby) in 1978, there was no longer any access to the B1218. In the early 1990s, a new interchange was added with the B1206 (the former A15), which is crossed by the Viking Way, which follows the road for over a mile. The section across the Humber was opened on 17 July 1981, by the Queen, and was the world's longest single-span bridge until 1997. The tolls are north of the bridge. It crosses the A63 and meets a roundabout with A164 (for Beverley) and A1105, then turns left along a short section of dual-carriageway (former A63) to end at the A63.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "250762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250762", "title": "Anglosphere", "text": "Anglosphere\n\nThe Anglosphere is the set of English-speaking nations that share common cultural and historical roots with the British Isles, and which today maintain close cultural, political, diplomatic and military cooperation. While the nations included in different sources vary, the Anglosphere is usually not considered to include all countries where English is an official language, although the nations that are commonly included were all once part of the British Empire. Most definitions include the five main countries, namely Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The term can also cover the Republic of Ireland and English-speaking Caribbean countries such as The Bahamas, Barbados, and Jamaica.\n\nThe term \"Anglosphere\" was first coined, but not explicitly defined, by the science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his book \"The Diamond Age\", published in 1995. John Lloyd adopted the term in 2000 and defined it as including the United States and the United Kingdom along with English-speaking Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa and the British West Indies. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the Anglosphere as \"the countries of the world in which the English language and cultural values predominate\".\n\nThe five main countries in the Anglosphere (the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) maintain a close affinity of cultural, diplomatic and military links with one another. All are aligned under such programs as:\n\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom retain Elizabeth II as head of state, form part of the Commonwealth of Nations and use of the Westminster parliamentary system of government. In the wake of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union as a result of a referendum held in 2016, there has been mounting political and popular support for a loose free travel and common market area to be formed between them known as CANZUK.\n\nBelow is a table comparing the five main countries of the Anglosphere. Data are for 2018 unless otherwise stated.\nPublic opinion research has found that people in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand consistently rank each other's countries as their country's most important allies in the world. Relations have traditionally been warm between Anglosphere countries, with bilateral partnerships such as those between Australia and New Zealand, the US and Canada and the US and UK constituting among the most successful partnerships in the world.\n\nFavourability ratings tend to be overwhelmingly positive between countries within a subset of the Anglosphere known as CANZUK (consisting of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), whose members form part of the Commonwealth of Nations and retain Elizabeth II as head of state. While the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in 2016 has had little impact on its favourability ratings with other members of the Anglosphere, there has been a marked drop in the United States favourability ratings with other Anglosphere nations since the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States in 2016. In 2017, the United States had negative favourability ratings with the CANZUK countries.\n\nThe American businessman James C. Bennett, a proponent of the idea that there is something special about the cultural and legal traditions of English-speaking nations, writes in his 2004 book \"The Anglosphere Challenge\":\n\nBennett argues that there are two challenges confronting his concept of the Anglosphere. The first is finding ways to cope with rapid technological advancement and the second is the geopolitical challenges created by what he assumes will be an increasing gap between anglophone prosperity and economic struggles elsewhere.\n\nBritish historian Andrew Roberts claims that the Anglosphere has been central in the First World War, Second World War and Cold War. He goes on to contend that anglophone unity is necessary for the defeat of Islamism.\n\nAccording to a 2003 profile in \"The Guardian\", historian Robert Conquest favoured a British withdrawal from the European Union in favour of creating \"a much looser association of English-speaking nations, known as the 'Anglosphere'\".\n\nNew Zealand historian James Belich connected patterns of growth in the industrialisation of the United States and the United Kingdom with former Dominions of the British Empire; New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Africa, and more loosely to growth in former UK constituent country Ireland, as well as British-allied Argentina, during the 19th and early to mid-20th century, in his book \"Replenishing the Earth\". He used the term \"Anglo-World\" to refer to the US, UK and former Dominions, arguing that the experience and present reality of former British colonies like India, Kenya, and Jamaica differ in substantial and important ways from this core group of countries.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Ignatieff wrote in an exchange with Robert Conquest, published by the \"New York Review of Books\", that the term neglects the evolution of fundamental legal and cultural differences between the US and the UK, and the ways in which UK and European norms have been drawn closer together during Britain's membership in the EU through regulatory harmonisation. Of Conquest's view of the Anglosphere, Ignatieff writes: \"He seems to believe that Britain should either withdraw from Europe or refuse all further measures of cooperation, which would jeopardize Europe's real achievements. He wants Britain to throw in its lot with a union of English-speaking peoples, and I believe this to be a romantic illusion\".\n\nIn 2016, Nick Cohen wrote in an article titled \"It’s a Eurosceptic fantasy that the ‘Anglosphere’ wants Brexit\" for \"The Spectator\"’s Coffee House blog: \"‘Anglosphere’ is just the right's PC replacement for what we used to call in blunter times ‘the white Commonwealth’.\" He repeated this criticism in another article for \"The Guardian\" in 2018. Similar criticism was presented by other critics such as Canadian academic Srđan Vučetić.\n\nIn 2018, amidst the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, two British professors of public policy Michael Kenny and Nick Pearce published a critical scholarly monograph titled \"Shadows of Empire: The Anglosphere in British Politics\" (). In one of a series of accompanying opinion pieces, they questioned:\n\nThey stated in another article:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1627510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1627510", "title": "Closed city", "text": "Closed city\n\nA closed city or closed town is a settlement where travel or residency restrictions are applied so that specific authorization is required to visit or remain overnight. They may be sensitive military establishments or secret research installations which require much more space or freedom than is available in a conventional military base. There may also be a wider variety of permanent residents including close family members of workers or trusted traders who are not directly connected with its clandestine purposes.\n\nMany closed cities existed in the Soviet Union. After 1991, a number of them still existed in the CIS countries, especially Russia. In modern Russia, such places are officially known as \"closed administrative-territorial formations\" (, \"zakrytye administrativno-territorial'nye obrazovaniya\", or \"ZATO\" for short).\n\nSometimes closed cities may only be represented on classified maps which are not available to the general public. In some cases there may be no road signs or directions to closed cities, and they are usually omitted from railroad time tables and bus routes.\n\nSometimes closed cities may be indicated obliquely as a nearby insignificant village, with the name of the stop serving the closed city made equivocal or misleading. For mail delivery, a closed city is usually named as the nearest large city and a special postcode e.g. Arzamas‑16, Chelyabinsk‑65. The actual settlement can be rather distant from its namesakes; for instance, Sarov, designated Arzamas-16, is in the federal republic of Mordovia, whereas Arzamas is in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (roughly away). People not living in a closed city were subject to document checks and security checkpoints, and explicit permission was required for them to visit. To relocate to a closed city, one would need security clearance by the organization running it, such as the KGB in Soviet closed cities.\n\nClosed cities were sometimes guarded by a security perimeter with barbed wire and towers. The very fact of such a city's existence was often classified, and residents were expected not to divulge their place of residence to outsiders. This lack of freedom was often compensated by better housing conditions and a better choice of goods in retail trade than elsewhere in the country. Also, in the Soviet Union, people working with classified information received a salary bonus.\n\nClosed cities were established in the Soviet Union from the late 1940s onwards under the euphemistic name of \"post boxes\", referring to the practice of addressing post to them via mail boxes in other cities. They fell into two distinct categories.\n\n\nThe locations of the first category of the closed cities were chosen for their geographical characteristics. They were often established in remote places situated deep in the Urals and Siberia, out of reach of enemy bombers. They were built close to rivers and lakes which were used to provide the large amounts of water needed for heavy industry and nuclear technology. Existing civilian settlements in the vicinity were often used as sources of construction labour. Although the closure of cities originated as a strictly temporary measure which was to be normalized under more favorable conditions, in practice the closed cities took on a life of their own and became a notable institutional feature of the Soviet system.\n\nMovement to and from closed areas was tightly controlled. Foreigners were prohibited from entering them and local citizens were under stringent restrictions. They had to have special permission to travel there or leave, and anyone seeking residency was required to undergo vetting by the NKVD and its successor agencies. Access to some closed cities was physically enforced by surrounding them with barbed wire fences monitored by armed guards.\n\n\"Box\" was the unofficial name of a secret Soviet facility much like the closed city, but smaller, usually the size of a factory. The \"box\" name was usually classified, as were the activities there. Incoming mail was addressed to \"mailbox #XXXX\", thus the name of \"box\". Most Soviet design bureaus for weapons, aircraft, space, military electronics, etc. were \"boxes\".\n\nRussia has the largest number of closed cities. The policy of closing cities underwent major changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some cities, such as Perm, were opened well before the fall of the Soviet Union; others, such as Kaliningrad and Vladivostok, remained closed until as late as 1992. The adoption of a new constitution for the Russian Federation in 1993 prompted significant reforms to the status of closed cities, which were renamed \"closed administrative-territorial formations\" (or ZATO, after the Russian acronym). Municipally all such entities have a status of urban okrugs, as mandated by the federal law.\n\nThere are currently 44 publicly acknowledged closed cities in Russia with a total population of about 1.5 million people. 75% are administered by the Russian Ministry of Defense, with the rest being administered by Rosatom. Another 15 or so closed cities are believed to exist, but their names and locations have not been publicly disclosed by the Russian government.\n\nSome Russian closed cities are open for foreign investment, but foreigners may only enter with a permit. An example is the Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI), a joint effort of the United States National Nuclear Security Administration and Minatom, which involves in part the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk.\n\nThe number of closed cities has been significantly reduced since the mid-1990s. However, on 30 October 2001, foreign travel (without any exceptions) was restricted in the northern cities of Norilsk, Talnakh, Kayerkan, Dudinka, and Igarka. Russian and Belarusian citizens visiting these cities are not required to have any permits, however, local courts are known to deport Belarusian citizens in contradiction with federal Constitution.\n\nKrasnoyarsk-26 in Siberia, researched for the subject of Sidney Sheldon's 2001 fictional murder mystery-romance \"The Sky is Falling\", was planned in 2003 to be shut down by 2011, in co-operation with the U.S, and documented by their Natural Resources Defense Council, but actually closed in 2008.\n\nThe number of closed cities in Russia is defined by government decree (see links further). They include the following cities. Reasons for restrictions are denoted in the descriptions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a list of territories within Russia that do not have closed city status, but require special permits for foreigners to visit. The largest locality within such territory is the city of Norilsk.\n\n\nThere were two closed cities in Estonia: Sillamäe and Paldiski. As with all the other industrial cities, the population of them was mainly Russian-speaking. Sillamäe was the site for a chemical factory that produced fuel rods and nuclear materials for the Soviet nuclear power plants and nuclear weapon facilities, while Paldiski was home to a Soviet Navy nuclear submarine training centre. Sillamäe was closed until Estonia regained its independence in 1991; Paldiski remained closed until 1994, when the last Russian warship left.\n\nTartu, home to Raadi Airfield, was partially closed. Foreign academics could visit the University of Tartu, but had to sleep elsewhere.\n\n\n\nMoldova has one official closed city – the commune Cobasna (Rîbnița District) in the disputed area of Transnistria. The commune, located on the left bank of the Dniester river, still contains military warehouses of the former Soviet 14th Army.\n\nUkraine had eighteen closed cities: among them the Crimean port of Sevastopol and the industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk, though both were restricted to foreigners, not locals.

It promotes multi-national cartographic research in order to solve problems related to web-based cartography. The commission enhances cartographic education related to the Internet. In addition, the commission promotes professional and technical standards for maps available through the Internet.\n\nLike all commissions of the International Cartographic Association, formal members are assigned by individual countries. However, anyone can become a corresponding member. Corresponding members receive all commission correspondence and invitations to meetings. Activities of the commission include e-mails to members, meetings, workshops, promotion of standards, and publications.\n\nThe Internet has redefined how maps are used (see Web mapping). No longer restricted to paper, maps are transmitted almost instantly and delivered to the user in a fraction of the time required to distribute maps on paper. They are viewed in a more timely fashion. Some maps, such as those showing weather patterns, are updated continuously throughout the day. It is the interactive nature of the Internet map that is considered the most important development. Online maps are accessed through a hyperlinking structure that makes it possible to engage the map user on a higher-level than is possible with a map on paper.The Internet is making it possible to more easily distribute cartographic displays such as map animations. The Internet presents the map user with both a faster method of map distribution and different forms of mapping.\n\n\nBroader research questions associated with the commission:\n\nThe commission meets annually. Past meetings have been held in Orleans, France; Orlando, Florida (2010); Valparaiso, Chile (2009); Warsaw, Poland (2007); Seoul, Korea (2006); Madrid, Spain (2005); Tokyo, Japan (2004); Stellenbosch, South Africa (2003); Karlsruhe, Germany (2002); Guangzhou, China (2001); Knoxville, Tennessee (2000) and; Ottawa, Canada (1999).\n\nWith the support of host institutions, the commission offers instructional workshops that cover online mapping. Workshops have been offered at universities or government mapping institutions in Malaysia, Germany, Austria, Cuba, Brazil, China, Canada, South Africa and USA. Workshops can be as short as half a day or up to two weeks.\n\n\nCommission Chair: Rex Cammack, University of Nebraska at Omaha\n\n"}
{"id": "11553912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11553912", "title": "Deep-sea exploration", "text": "Deep-sea exploration\n\nDeep-sea exploration is the investigation of physical, chemical, and biological conditions on the sea bed, for scientific or commercial purposes. Deep-sea exploration is considered as a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of geophysical research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years. The ocean depths still remain as a largely unexplored part of the planet, and form a relatively undiscovered domain.\n\nIn general, modern scientific Deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when French scientist Pierre Simon de Laplace investigated the average depth of the Atlantic ocean by observing tidal motions registered on Brazilian and African coasts. He calculated the depth to be , a value later proven quite accurate by soundings measurement. Later on, with increasing demand for submarine cables installment, accurate soundings was required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were undertaken. First deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when Norwegian researchers obtained a sample of a stalked crinoid at a depth of . The British Government sent out the \"Challenger\" expedition (a ship called ) in 1872 which discovered 715 new genera and 4,417 new species of marine organisms over the space of four years.\n\nThe first instrument used for deep-sea investigation was the sounding weight, used by British explorer Sir James Clark Ross. With this instrument, he reached a depth of in 1840. The \"Challenger\" expedition used similar instruments called Baillie sounding machines to extract samples from the sea bed.\n\nIn 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe \"Trieste\" into the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans, to make the deepest dive in history: . On 25 March 2012, filmmaker James Cameron descended into the Mariana Trench and, for the first time, is expected to have filmed and sampled the bottom.<ref name=\"NYT-03/08/2012\"></ref>\n\nNavy Lieutenant Matthew Maury to aid installation of the first trans-continent telegraph cables in 1858, and a few examples of deep marine creatures.\n\nFrom 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard HMS \"Challenger\", a sailing vessel that was redesigned into a laboratory ship. The \"Challenger\" expedition covered , and shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples, hydrographic measurements, and specimens of marine life. They are also credited with providing the first real view of major seafloor features such as the deep ocean basins. They discovered more than 4,700 new species of marine life, including deep-sea organisms.\n\nDeep-sea exploration advanced considerably in the 1900s thanks to a series of technological inventions, ranging from sonar system to detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound to manned deep-diving submersibles such as . Operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, \"Alvin\" is designed to carry a crew of three people to depths of . The submarine is equipped with lights, cameras, computers, and highly maneuverable robotic arms for collecting samples in the darkness of the ocean's depths.\n\nHowever, the voyage to the ocean bottom is still a challenging experience. Scientists are working to find ways to study this extreme environment from the shipboard. With more sophisticated use of fiber optics, satellites, and remote-control robots, scientists one day may explore the deep sea from a computer screen on the deck rather than out of a porthole.\n\nThe extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies, which has been the main reason why its exploration has a comparatively short history.\nIn the following, important key stones of deep sea exploration are listed.\n\n\nThe sounding weight, one of the first instruments used for the sea bottom investigation, was designed as a tube on the base which forced the seabed in when it hit the bottom of the ocean. British explorer Sir James Clark Ross fully employed this instrument to reach a depth of in 1840.\n\nSounding weights used on were slightly advanced called \"Baillie sounding machine\". The British researchers used wire-line soundings to investigate sea depths and collected hundreds of biological samples from all the oceans except the Arctic. Also used on HMS \"Challenger\" were dredges and scoops, suspended on ropes, with which samples of the sediment and biological specimens of the seabed could be obtained.\n\nA more advanced version of the sounding weight is the gravity corer. The gravity corer allows researchers to sample and study sediment layers at the bottom of oceans. The corer consists of an open-ended tube with a lead weight and a trigger mechanism that releases the corer from its suspension cable when the corer is lowered over the seabed and a small weight touches the ground. The corer falls into the seabed and penetrates it to a depth of up to . By lifting the corer, a long, cylindrical sample is extracted in which the structure of the seabed’s layers of sediment is preserved. Recovering sediment cores allows scientists to see the presence or absence of specific fossils in the mud that may indicate climate patterns at times in the past, such as during the ice ages. Samples of deeper layers can be obtained with a corer mounted in a drill. The drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution is equipped to extract cores from depths of as much as below the ocean bottom. (See Ocean Drilling Program)\n\nEcho-sounding instruments have also been widely used to determine the depth of the sea bottom since World War II. This instrument is used primarily for determining the depth of water by means of an acoustic echo. A pulse of sound sent from the ship is reflected from the sea bottom back to the ship, the interval of time between transmission and reception being proportional to the depth of the water. By registering the time lapses between outgoing and returning signals continuously on paper tape, a continuous mapping of the seabed is obtained. The majority of the ocean floor has been mapped in this way.\n\nIn addition, high-resolution television cameras, thermometers, pressure meters, and seismographs are other notable instruments for deep-sea exploration invented by the technological advance. These instruments are either lowered to the sea bottom by long cables or directly attached to submersible buoys. Deep-sea currents can be studied by floats carrying an ultrasonic sound device so that their movements can be tracked from aboard the research vessel. Such vessels themselves are equipped with state -of-art navigational instruments, such as satellite navigation systems, and global positioning systems that keep the vessel in a live position relative to a sonar beacon on the bottom of the ocean.\n\nBecause of the high pressure, the depth to which a diver can descend without special equipment is limited. The deepest recorded made by a skin diver is . Revolutionary new diving suits, such as the \"JIM suit,\" allows divers to reach depths up to approximately . Some additional suits feature thruster packs that boost a diver to different locations underwater.\n\nTo explore even deeper depths, deep-sea explorers must rely on specially constructed steel chambers to protect them. The American explorer William Beebe, also a naturalist from Columbia University in New York, was the designer of the first practical bathysphere to observe marine species at depths that could not be reached by a diver. The Bathysphere, a spherical steel vessel, was designed by Beebe and his fellow engineer Otis Barton, an engineer at Harvard University. In 1930 Beebe and Barton reached a depth of , and in 1934. The potential danger was that if the cable broke, the occupants could not return to the surface. During the dive, Beebe peered out of a porthole and reported his observations by telephone to Barton who was on the surface.\n\nIn 1948, Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard tested a much deeper-diving vessel he invented called the bathyscaphe, a navigable deep-sea vessel with its gasoline-filled float and suspended chamber or gondola of spherical steel. On an experimental dive in the Cape Verde Islands, his bathyscaphe successfully withstood the pressure on it at , but its body was severely damaged by heavy waves after the dive. In 1954, with this bathyscaphe, Piccard reached a depth of . In 1953, his son Jacques Piccard joined in building new and improved bathyscaphe , which dived to in field trials. The United States Navy acquired \"Trieste\" in 1958 and equipped it with a new cabin to enable it to reach deep ocean trenches. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in \"Trieste\" to the deepest known point on Earth - the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, successfully making the deepest dive in history: .\nAn increasing number of occupied submersibles are now employed around the world. The American-built that is operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is a three-person submarine that can dive to about and is equipped with a mechanical manipulator to collect bottom samples. \"Alvin\" made its first test dive in 1964, and has performed more than 3,000 dives to average depths of . \"Alvin\" has also involved in a wide variety of research projects, such as one where giant tube worms were discovered on the Pacific Ocean floor near the Galápagos Islands.\n\nOne of the first unmanned deep sea vehicles was developed by the University of California with a grant from the Allan Hancock Foundation in the early 1950s to develop a more economical method of taking photos miles under the sea with an unmanned steel high-pressure sphere called a benthograph which contained a camera and strobe light. The original benthograph built by USC was very successful in taking a series of underwater photos until it became wedged between some rocks and could not be retrieved.\n\nROVs, or remote operated vehicles, are seeing increasing use in underwater exploration. These submersibles are piloted through a cable which connects to the surface ship, and they can reach depths of up to . New developments in robotics have also led to the creation of AUVs, or autonomous underwater vehicles. The robotic submarines are programmed in advance, and receive no instruction from the surface. HROV combine features of both ROVs and AUV, operating independently or with a cable. was employed in 1985 to locate the wreck of ; the smaller was also used to explore the shipwreck.\n\nIn 1974, \"Alvin\" (operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Deep Sea Place Research Center), the French bathyscaphe \"Archimède\", and the French diving saucer \"Cyane\", assisted by support ships and , explored the great rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, southwest of the Azores. About 5,200 photographs of the region were taken, and samples of relatively young solidified magma were found on each side of the central fissure of the rift valley, giving additional proof that the seafloor spreads at this site at a rate of about per year (see plate tectonics,).\n\nIn a series of dives conducted between 1979–1980 into the Galápagos rift, off the coast of Ecuador, French, Italian, Mexican, and U.S. scientists found vents, nearly high and about across, discharging a mixture of hot water (up to ) and dissolved metals in dark, smoke-like plumes (see hydrothermal vent,). These hot springs play an important role in the formation of deposits that are enriched in copper, nickel, cadmium, chromium, and uranium.\n\n\n"}

As he had three older brothers, he had to earn a living from a profession and Buchanan studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating MD in 1783. His thesis was on \"febris intermittens\" (malaria). He then served on Merchant Navy ships to Asia, he served in the Bengal Medical Service from 1794 to 1815. He also studied botany under John Hope in Edinburgh. Hope was among the first in Britain to teach the Linnean system of botanical nomenclature although he knew of several others having been trained under Jussieu.\n\nBuchanan's early career was on board ships plying between England and Asia. The first few years were spent as Surgeon aboard the \"Duke of Montrose\" sailing between Bombay and China under Captain Alexander Gray and later Captain Joseph Dorin. He then served on the \"Phoenix\" along the Coromandel Coast again under Captain Gray. In 1794 he served on the \"Rose\", sailing from Portsmouth to Calcutta and reaching Calcutta in September, he joined the Medical Service of the Bengal Presidency. Buchanan's training was ideal as a Surgeon naturalist for a political mission to the Kingdom of Ava in Burma under Captain Symes (as replacement for the previously appointed Surgeon Peter Cochrane). The Ava mission set sail on the \"Sea Horse\" and would pass the Andaman Islands, Pegu and Ava before returning to Calcutta.\nIn 1799, after the defeat of Tipu Sultan and the fall of Mysore, he was asked to survey South India resulting in \"A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar\" (1807). He also wrote \"An Account of the Kingdom of Nepal\" (1819).\n\nHe conducted two surveys, the first of Mysore in 1800 and the second of Bengal in 1807-14. From 1803 to 1804 he was surgeon to the Governor General of India Lord Wellesley in Calcutta, where he also organized a zoo that was to become the Calcutta Alipore Zoo. In 1804, he was in charge of the \"Institution for Promoting the Natural History of India\" founded by Wellesley at Barrackpore.\n\nFrom 1807 to 1814, under the instructions of the government of Bengal, he made a comprehensive survey of the areas within the jurisdiction of the British East India Company. He was asked to report on topography, history, antiquities, the condition of the inhabitants, religion, natural productions (particularly fisheries, forests, mines, and quarries), agriculture (covering vegetables, implements, manure, floods, domestic animals, fences, farms, and landed property, fine and common arts, and commerce (exports and imports, weights and measures, and conveyance of goods). His conclusions are reported in a series of treatises that are retained in major United Kingdom libraries; many have been re-issued in modern editions. They include an important work on Indian fish species, entitled \"An account of the fishes found in the river Ganges and its branches\" (1822), which describes over 100 species not formerly recognised scientifically.\n\nHe also collected and described many new plants in the region, and collected a series of watercolours of Indian and Nepalese plants and animals, probably painted by Indian artists, which are now in the library of the Linnean Society of London \n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1806 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1817\n\nHe succeeded William Roxburgh to become the Superintendent of the Calcutta botanical garden in 1814, but had to return to Britain in 1815 due to his ill health. In an interesting incident the notes that he took of Hope's botany lectures in 1780 were lent to his shipmate Alexander Boswell during a voyage in 1785. Boswell, lost the notes in Satyamangalam in Mysore and the notes went into the hands of Tipu Sultan who had them rebound. In 1800 they were found in Tippu's library by a major who returned them to Buchanan.\n\nBuchanan left India in 1815, and in the same year inherited his mother's estate and in consequence took her surname of Hamilton, referring to himself as \"Francis Hamilton, formerly Buchanan\" or simply \"Francis Hamilton\". However he is variously referred to by others as \"Buchanan-Hamilton\", \"Francis Hamilton Buchanan\" or \"Francis Buchanan Hamilton\".\n\nFrancis Buchanan-Hamilton is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South Asian turtle, \"Geoclemys hamiltoni\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56716", "title": "Geography of Guyana", "text": "Geography of Guyana\n\nThe Geography of Guyana comprises the physical characteristics of the country in Northern South America and part of Caribbean South America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, between Suriname and Venezuela, with a land area of approximately 214,969 square kilometres. The country is situated between 1 and 9 north latitude and between 56 and 62 west longitude. With a 459-kilometre Atlantic coastline on the northeast, Guyana is bounded by Venezuela on the west, Brazil on the west and south, and Suriname on the east. The land comprises three main geographical zones: the coastal plain, the white sand belt, and the interior highlands.\n\nThe coastal plain, which occupies about 5 percent of the country's area, is home to more than 90 percent of its inhabitants. The plain ranges from 26 to 77 kilometers wide and extends from the Corentyne River in the east to the Venezuelan border in the northwest.\n\nThe coastal plain is made up largely of alluvial mud swept out to sea by the Amazon River, carried north by ocean currents, and deposited on the Guyanese shores. A rich clay of great fertility, this mud overlays the white sands and clays formed from the erosion of the interior bedrock and carried seaward by the rivers of Guyana. Because much of the coastal plain floods at high tide, efforts to dam and drain this area have gone on since the 18th century.\n\nGuyana has no well-defined shoreline or sandy beaches. Approaching the ocean, the land gradually loses elevation until it includes many areas of marsh and swamp. Seaward from the vegetation line is a region of mud flats, shallow brown water, and sandbars. Off New Amsterdam, these mud flats extend almost . The sandbars and shallow water are a major impediment to shipping, and incoming vessels must partially unload their cargoes offshore in order to reach the docks at Georgetown and New Amsterdam.\n\nA line of swamps forms a barrier between the white sandy hills of the interior and the coastal plain. These swamps, formed when water was prevented from flowing onto coastal croplands by a series of dams, serve as reservoirs during periods of drought.\n\nThe white sand belt lies south of the coastal zone. This area is 150 to 250 kilometers wide and consists of low sandy hills interspersed with rocky outcroppings. The white sands support a dense hardwood forest. These sands cannot support crops, and if the trees are removed erosion is rapid and severe. Most of Guyana's reserves of bauxite, gold, and diamonds are found in this region.\n\nThe largest of Guyana's three geographical regions is the interior highlands, a series of plateaus, flat-topped mountains, and savannahs that extend from the white sand belt to the country's southern borders. The Pacaraima Mountains dominate the western part of the interior highlands. In this region are found some of the oldest sedimentary rocks in the Western Hemisphere. Mount Roraima, on the Venezuelan border, is part of the Pakaraima range and, at 2,762 meters, is Guyana's tallest peak. Farther south lies the Kaieteur Plateau, a broad, rocky area about 600 meters in elevation; the 1,000-meter high Kanuku Mountains; and the low Acarai Mountains situated on the southern border with Brazil.\n\nMuch of the interior highlands consist of grassland. The largest expanse of grassland, the Rupununi Savannah, covers about 15,000 square kilometers in southern Guyana. This savannah also extends far into Venezuela and Brazil. The part in Guyana is split into northern and southern regions by the Kanuku Mountains. The sparse grasses of the savannah in general support only grazing, although Amerindian groups cultivate a few areas along the Rupununi River and in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains.\n\nGuyana is a water-rich country. Numerous rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean, generally in a northward direction. A number of rivers in the western part of the country, however, flow eastward into the Essequibo River, draining the Kaieteur Plateau. The Essequibo, the country's major river, runs from the Brazilian border in the south to a wide delta west of Georgetown. The rivers of eastern Guyana cut across the coastal zone, making east-west travel difficult, but they also provide limited water access to the interior.\n\nWaterfalls generally limit water transport to the lower reaches of each river. Some of the waterfalls are spectacular; for example, Kaieteur Falls on the Potaro River drops 251 metres, more than four times the height of Niagara Falls. Other enormous waterfalls are King Edward VIII Falls (256 m), Kumerau Falls (190 m), Oshi Falls (160 – 210 m). In the country are known to exist more than 200 rapids and more than 70 large waterfalls. Many waterfalls are little known and most are not measured yet, it is possible that there are waterfalls in excess of 300 m tall.\n\nSee also , .\n\nDrainage throughout most of Guyana is poor and river flow sluggish because the average gradient of the main rivers is only one meter every five kilometers. Swamps and areas of periodic flooding are found in all but the mountainous regions, and all new land projects require extensive drainage networks before they are suitable for agricultural use. The average square kilometer on a sugar plantation, for example, has six kilometers of irrigation canals, eighteen kilometers of large drains, and eighteen kilometers of small drains. These canals occupy nearly one-eighth of the surface area of the average sugarcane field. Some of the larger estates have more than 550 kilometers of canals; Guyana itself has a total of more than 8,000 kilometers. Even Georgetown is below sea level and must depend on dikes for protection from the Demerara River and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nLying near the equator, Guyana has a tropical climate, and temperatures do not vary much throughout the year. The year has two wet seasons, from December to early February and from late April to mid-August.\n\nAlthough the temperature never gets dangerously high, the combination of heat and humidity can at times seem oppressive. The entire area is under the influence of the northeast trade winds, and during the midday and afternoon sea breezes bring relief to the coast. Guyana lies south of the path of Caribbean hurricanes and none is known to have hit the country.\n\nTemperatures in Georgetown are quite constant, with an average high of and an average low of in the hottest month (July), and an average range of in February, the coolest month. The highest temperature ever recorded in the capital was and the lowest . Humidity averages 70 percent year-round. Locations in the interior, away from the moderating influence of the ocean, experience slightly wider variations in daily temperature, and nighttime readings as low as have been recorded. Humidity in the interior is also slightly lower, averaging around 60 percent.\n\nRainfall is heaviest in the northwest and lightest in the southeast and interior. Annual averages on the coast near the Venezuelan border are near , farther east at New Amsterdam, between in southern Guyana's Rupununi Savannah. Areas on the northeast sides of mountains that catch the trade winds average as much as of precipitation annually. Although rain falls throughout the year, about 50 percent of the annual total arrives in the summer rainy season that extends from May to the end of July along the coast and from April through September farther inland. Coastal areas have a second rainy season from November through January. Rain generally falls in heavy afternoon showers or thunderstorms. Overcast days are rare; most days include four to eight hours of sunshine from morning through early afternoon.\n\nGeographic coordinates:\n\n\n\n\nMostly rolling highlands; low coastal plain; savanna in south.\n\nHighest temperature ever recorded in Guyana was .\n\n\nBauxite, gold, diamonds, hardwood timber, shrimp, fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94\n\n\n\n"}

It is a project of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. \n\nThe GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable geographic information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, thereby contributing to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. In this framework, its purposes are:\n\n\nThe GAUL always maintains global geographic layers (in shapefile format) with a unified coding system at the levels of country, first administrative (e.g. regions), and second administrative (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country-by-country basis down to third, fourth and lower levels. The target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, universities, and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. \n\nBecause the GAUL works at global level, controversial boundaries can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain disputed areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries.\n\nThe coastline of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by the UN Cartographic Section except for some countries (e.g. Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. Landsat ETM). For future releases of the GAUL, the process of updating the coastline will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.\n\nThe GAUL keeps track of administrative units that have been changed, added, or deleted in the past. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named the GAUL Set. The GAUL project does not implement changes dated before 1990.\n\nGAUL codes are numeric and unique for all administrative units at any of the administrative hierarchical level. Any GAUL code is independent from the codes of its higher administrative levels. GAUL codes assigned to administrative units of a given country are not necessarily sequential numbers. The main benefit of the GAUL Coding System is that changing in the codes of an administrative unit might not imply a change of codes of the correspondent units at lower levels. This means that the effort to maintain the links between thematic data and associated administrative units is reduced to a minimum.\n\nThe implementation of the GAUL initiative is based on a collaborative work among international agencies and national authorities generating and collecting spatial information on administrative units. The role of FAO is to keep this network of collaborators active, to evaluate and compile data from available sources, to establish procedures for data integration, to generate the GAUL codes and periodically to disseminate the GAUL Set. The overall methodology consists in:\n\n\nThe GAUL has a consistent framework for the delivery of the data. Once a year, an updated version of the GAUL set is released through Geonetwork. A new version includes all updates made in the course of the previous year. The dataset is free of charge and it can be downloaded by login (to receive an account, just send an email to the contacts listed at the bottom of this article).

It is a greater comarca made up of smaller ones. The ties between the people of the region transcend ancient kingdom and later provincial borders.\n\nThe name 'Ilercavonia' to refer to the territory occupied by the Ilercavones Iberian tribe appears in ancient Greek and Roman texts and documents. The northern limits of this territory were in Serra de la Llena, the northeastern in Coll de Balaguer, the western in Mequinensa and the southern in the area of a river mentioned as 'Oduba' in Roman documents, which could be either the Millars River, or another river further south along the coast closer to Sagunt. This geographical zone corresponds roughly to the present-day Maestrat/Maestrazgo, Matarraña/Matarranya and Terres de l'Ebre comarcas.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the territory of Ilercavonia found itself located at the confluence of the kingdoms of Valencia, Catalonia and Aragon. Since that time, and until the mid-20th century, the Diocese of Tortosa would give a certain basic recognition to the people of this ancient region who, despite having had no historic political representation of their own, share common geographic, economic, cultural and linguistic ties. The traditional Aragonese parishes of the Diocese of Tortosa, however, were segregated during General Franco's dictatorship, following the Concordat of 1953 between the Francoist regime and the Vatican.\n\nBesides the lack of recognition and effective representation, this greater comarca has suffered much from a lack of development and investment since the mid-20th century, when the only railway line connecting the region with Aragon, the RENFE line from Tortosa to Alcañiz and Zaragoza, was terminated in 1973. This line was dismantled as a result of a 1962 World Bank report advising the Spanish State to concentrate investment in the great lines and to abandon the less profitable railways connecting rural areas. The bulk of the development in eastern and northeastern Spain was henceforward diverted to the cities of Barcelona and Valencia in detriment of this region.\n\nNowadays the name Ilercavonia is used mainly in academic and scientific circles, as well as in cultural events.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "185842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185842", "title": "Jura Mountains", "text": "Jura Mountains\n\nThe Jura Mountains (; , ; ; ; ) are a sub-alpine mountain range located north of the Western Alps, mainly following the course of the France–Switzerland border. \nThe Jura separates the Rhine and Rhône basins, forming part of the watershed of each. \n\nThe name \"Jura\" is derived from \"juria\", a Latinized form of a Celtic stem \"jor-\" \"forest\". \nThe mountain range gives its name to the French department of Jura, the Swiss Canton of Jura, the Jurassic period of the geologic timescale, and the Montes Jura of the Moon.\n\nThe Jura Mountains are a distinct province of the larger Central European uplands.\n\nIn France, the Jura covers most of the Franche-Comté region, stretching south into the Rhône-Alpes region. The range reaches its highest point at Le Crêt de la Neige in the department of Ain and finds its southern terminus in the northwestern part of the department of Savoie. The north end of the Jura extends into the southern tip of the Alsace region. Roughly of the mountain range in France is protected by the Jura Mountains Regional Natural Park.\n\nThe Swiss Jura is one of the three distinct geographical regions of Switzerland, the others being the Swiss plateau and the Swiss Alps.\nIn Switzerland, the range covers the western border with France in the cantons of Basel-Landschaft, Solothurn, Jura, Bern (i.e., Bernese Jura), Neuchâtel, Vaud. \nMuch of the Swiss Jura region has no historical association with Early Modern Switzerland and was incorporated as part of the Swiss Confederacy only in the 19th century. In the 20th century, a movement of Jurassic separatism developed which resulted in the creation of the canton of Jura in 1979.\n\nThe Swiss Jura has been industrialized since the 18th century and became a major centre of the watchmaking industry. The area has several cities at very high altitudes, such as La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle, and Sainte-Croix (renowned for its musical boxes); however, it generally has had a marked decline in population since 1960. \n\nThe Jura range proper (known as \"folded Jura\", \"Faltenjura\") is continued as the Table Jura in the cantons of Basel-Landschaft and Aargau, and further to Schaffhausen and into southern Germany towards the Swabian and Franconian plateaus.\n\nThe range is built up vertically while decreasing in size laterally (along a rough northwest–southeast line). This deformation accommodates the compression from alpine folding as the main Alpine orogenic front moves roughly northwards. The deformation becomes less pervasive away from the younger, more active Alpine mountain building.\n\nThe geologic folds comprise three major bands (lithological units) of building that date from three epochs: the Lias (Early Jurassic), the Dogger (Middle Jurassic) and the Malm (Late Jurassic) geologic periods. Each era of folding reveals effects of previously shallow marine environments as evidenced by beds with carbonate sequences, containing abundant bioclasts and oolitic divisions between layers (called horizons).\n\nStructurally, the Jura consists of a sequence of geologic folds, the formation of which is facilitated by an evaporitic decollement layer. The box folds are still relatively young, which is evident by the general shape of the landscape showing that they have not existed long enough to experience erosion, thus revealing recent mountain building.\n\nThe highest peak in the Jura range is Le Crêt de la Neige at .\n\n\nThe Jura range offer a variety of tourist activities including hiking, cycling, downhill skiing and cross-country skiing. There are many signposted trails including the Jura ridgeway, a hiking route.\n\nTourist attractions include natural features such as the Creux du Van, lookout peaks such as the Chasseral, caves such as the Grottes de l'Orbe, and gorges such as Taubenloch.\n\nBoth Le Locle and its geographical twin town La Chaux-de-Fonds are recognised as an UNESCO World Heritage Site for their horological and related cultural past. The 11th-century Fort de Joux, famously remodeled and strengthened by Vauban in 1690 and subsequently by other military engineers, is situated on a natural rock outcropping in the middle of the range not far from Pontarlier.\n\nPart of the A40 autoroute crosses through a portion of the southern Jura between Bourg-en-Bresse and Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, which is known as the \"Highway of the Titans\".\n"}

{"id": "19734854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19734854", "title": "Lieu-dit", "text": "Lieu-dit\n\nLieu-dit (plural: \"lieux-dits\") (literally \"said-location\") is a French toponymic term for a small geographical area bearing a traditional name. The name usually refers to some characteristic of the place, its former use, a past event, etc. A lieu-dit may be uninhabited, which distinguishes it from an \"hameau\" (hamlet), which is inhabited.\nIn Burgundy, the term \"climat\" is used interchangeably with \"lieu-dit\".\n\nEnglish speakers seem to have discovered the concept through oenology and have considered it as a wine term which in its typical usage translates as \"vineyard name\" or \"named vineyard\". Typically, a \"lieu-dit\" is the smallest piece of land which has a traditional vineyard name assigned to it. In most cases, this means that a \"lieu-dit\" is smaller than an \"appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC).\n\nIn some cases, \"lieux-dits\" appear on wine labels, in addition to the AOC name. This is most commonly seen for Alsace wine and Burgundy wine. It may not always be easy for consumers to tell if a name on a wine label is a \"lieu-dit\" or a cuvée name created by the producer.\n\nThe only case of mandatory mention of a \"lieu-dit\" is in Alsace, for Alsace Grand Cru AOC. The Grand Cru designation may only be used if a \"lieu-dit\" is indicated. \"Lieux-dits\" may also be indicated on regular Alsace AOC wines, but is not mandatory.\n\nIn Burgundy, the term \"climat\" is used interchangeably with \"lieu-dit\". The use of the \"lieu-dit\" varies with the level of classification of the wine. Although the Grand Cru burgundies are generally considered to be classified on the vineyard level and defined as separate AOCs (with the exception of Chablis Grand Cru), some Burgundy Grand Crus are in fact divided into several \"lieux-dits\". An example is Corton, where it is fairly common to see \"lieux-dits\" such as Les Bressandes, Le Clos de Roi and Les Renardes indicated. For village level burgundies, the \"lieu-dit\" may only be indicated in smaller print than the village name to avoid confusion with Premier Cru burgundies, where the village and vineyard name are indicated in the same size print.\n\nIn Rhône, \"lieux-dits\" are most commonly seen for some of the top wines of the region. Two examples are the \"lieu-dit\" La Landonne or La Chatillonne within Côte-Rôtie. Not all sites have been registered as \"lieux-dits\". For example La Mouline and Les Jumelles are \"les marques\" of individual producers.\n\nIn the United States, the labeling of vineyard designated wines follows the similar practice of highlighting the particular vineyard that the grapes are sourced from.\n"}

The population in 2011 was 2,821,876, of whom 547,733 (19.4%) live in the city of Lisbon. About 26.7% of the total population of Portugal lives in the Lisbon metropolitan area. The area of the Lisbon metropolitan area is 3,015.24 km, which is 3.3% of the total area of Portugal.\n\nThe Lisbon metropolitan area has an active population of about 1.3 million people. With 32.7% of the national employment being located in its territory, the contribution of AML for the gross domestic product surpasses 36%.\n\nToday, the Lisbon metropolitan area territory is almost the same as Lisbon Region territory, being AML a union of metropolitan municipalities, and Lisbon Region a NUTS II region.\n\nThe municipalities north of the Tagus River are from Lisbon District (Grande Lisboa); those south of the river are from Setubal District (Península de Setúbal).\n\nThe metropolitan area of Lisbon was a semiofficial structure. Recently, Portugal has been incrementing the powers held by these territorial organization organs. In the officialization of the Lisbon Great Metropolitan Area, Azambuja left due to being mostly a rustic zone, more kindred to the city of Santarém which lies just 23 km northeast, while Lisbon is 45 km away from Azambuja, southeast.\n\nIn the official AML site is said:\n\nAs stated on the law 10/2003, of the 13 of May, the Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa (Lisbon Great Metropolitan Area) is a public collective person of associative nature, and of territorial scope that aims to reach common public interests of the municipalities that integrate it, that includes (18 City Halls) – Alcochete, Almada, Barreiro, Cascais, Lisboa, Loures, Mafra, Moita, Montijo, Odivelas, Oeiras, Palmela, Sesimbra, Setúbal, Seixal, Sintra and Vila Franca de Xira.\n\nThe Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa was constituted, by public scripture, in 2004, and published on 5 July 2004, in the III series of the Diário da República. It is composed by three organs: ·\n\nJunta Metropolitana, executive organ, composed by the 18 presidents of the city halls that it integrates. They elect among themselves, a president and two vice presidents.\n\nAssembleia Metropolitana, legislative organ, composed by the chosen representatives in the municipal assembly of the city halls, in odd number, over the triple the number of the towns that it integrates, in a maximum of 55.\n\nConselho Metropolitano, consultative organ, composed by representatives of the state and by the members of the Junta Metropolitana.\n\nPortugal has been through a period of administrative changes since the 1974 revolution. More recently, new standards of territorial administration have been implemented to match European Union criteria.\n\nAfter some years of indefinitions, municipalities are now associated in metropolitan areas or intermunicipal communities.\n\nThese new regional divisions are colliding with the traditional Portuguese regional structures: \"Distritos\" (Districts).\nDistricts were implemented in the 19th century by Mouzinho da Silveira after the Liberal Revolution, to replace clerical dioceses (which held the intermediate authority between the absolute monarchy and the municipalities), and still are the official regional authorities in Portugal, thus leaving the new metropolitan authorities with no authority at all.\nFor instance, the District of Lisbon and the District of Setubal collide and interfere with the Lisbon metropolitan area authority.\nEach District is ruled by a \"governador civil\" (civil governor). These governors are empowered by the Prime Minister of Portugal and have most of the administrative power over the municipalities comprised, leaving the metropolitan areas with a passive status and communitarian tasks.\n\nTo definitely end with these anomalies, a national Referendum was held on November 8, 1998, in order to approve a new regionalization (Referendo à Regionalização), which was rejected by over 60% of the voting population on account of disagreements over the loss of sovereignty of some districts to others (e.g. by the time of the referendum it was not known where would be the seat of government of the new \"Estremadura & Ribatejo\" region which was a fusion of the District of Leiria with the District of Santarém, being Leiria and Santarém cities of the same size and importance).\n\nRegionalization experiment in Portugal was only successful among insular regions when in 1976, districts of Angra do Heroísmo, Horta and Ponta Delgada were substituted by the Autonomous Region of Açores with seat of government in Ponta Delgada, while district of Funchal was replaced by the Autonomous Region of Madeira with seat of government in Funchal.\n\nPortuguese cultural regions and their limits were officially drawn during the 19th century after slight variations since the foundation of Portugal and still there is no agreement about where one region ends and other starts. Cultural regions in Portugal have symbolic importance and no kind of authority. Once again there is no exact geographical conformity between cultural regions, districts or between any of those and the metropolitan areas.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50114266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50114266", "title": "MAC address anonymization", "text": "MAC address anonymization\n\nMAC address anonymization performs a one-way function on a MAC address so that the result may be used in tracking systems for reporting and the general public, while making it nearly impossible to obtain the original MAC address from the result. The idea is that this process allows companies like Google, Apple and iInside - which track users movements via computer hardware to simultaneously preserve the identities of the people they are tracking, as well as the hardware itself.\n\nAn example of MAC address anonymization would be to use a simple hash algorithm. Given an address of codice_1, the MD5 hash algorithm produces codice_2 (32 hexadecimal digits).\n\nAn address only one character different (codice_3) produces codice_4, an entirely different hash due to the avalanche effect.\n\nTracking companies rely on the assumption that address anonymization is akin to encryption. Given a message, and an encryption method that is well known to both the encoder and potential decryptor, modern encryption methods (such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or RSA) will yield a result that is unbreakable in practice.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that there are only 2 (281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. Given the encoding algorithm, an index can easily be created for each possible address.\n\nSeveral years ago, the building of such an index would have been difficult due to the compute time involved. With modern, parallel, cloud computing, the index generation can be easily divided among the number of processors desired.\n\nOn a 2.5 GHz processor, a C# program was able to produce the following results: \n\nThus, a million processors could create the entire index in just over five minutes, and 100,000 processors in less than 85 hours. Once the rainbow table is complete, conversions of \"anonymized\" addresses to their actual addresses is almost instantaneous.\n\nOne common way of mitigating such brute force attacks is to append a random salt into the MAC address before hashing. A salt is a secret string of characters that makes the search space for attackers larger. The effect is that the brute force attack can no longer target the valid range of MAC addresses. Lists of salted and hashed MAC addresses would be impossible to translate, given that the salt is long enough and created in a way that is difficult to guess.\n\nThe entity holding the secret salt can still perform deanonymization by attacking the hashed MAC using the technique in the previous chapter. Attackers could also obtain the secret salt through social engineering, phishing or other means.\n\nWhere data protection law requires anonymization, the method used should exclude any possibility of the original MAC address to be identified. Some companies truncate IPv4 addresses by removing the final octet, thus in effect retaining information about the user's ISP or subnet, but not directly identifying the individual. The activity could then originate from any of 254 IP addresses. This may not always be enough to guarantee anonymization.\n"}

{"id": "39239375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39239375", "title": "Pialral", "text": "Pialral\n\nPialrâl () is the ultimate heaven according to the folk myth of the Mizo tribes of Northeast India. The Mizo word literally means \"beyond the world\". Unlike most concepts of heaven, it is not the final resting place of the spirits of the good and the righteous, nor there is a role for god or any supernaturals, but is simply a reservation for extraordinary achievers during their lifetime to enjoy eternal bliss and luxury.\n\nThe concept of \"Pialrâl\" itself sums up very well the entire spiritual belief system in the animistic folk religion of the Mizo ancestors. It encompasses not only the spiritual realm, but also all the pathways for entry and services required to attain access. Although the traditional Mizo religion had been completely overshadowed by Christianity since the turn of the 20th century, the notion of \"Pialrâl\" still survives as a remnant in a Christian metaphor of paradise among modern Mizos, especially vivid in their songs of praise.\n\nThe Mizo ancestors believed in the existence of soul in two worlds beyond life, namely \"Mitthi Khua\" (literal translation: \"land of the dead\") and the higher abode \"Pialral\". It is every human soul's destiny to go to \"Mitthi Khua\", where most would end up eternally, but there is \"Pialral\" at the farther realm that is only for the select few. \"Mitthi Khua\" is an ordinary spiritual place, where all deceased must eventually enter and the hardships of earthly life still remain, forever. There is a tendency of modern evangelists and theologians to misinterpret \"Mitthi Khua\" and \"Pialral\" as synonymous to hell and heaven respectively. But in truth, the similitude is taken out of context. There is no conception of underworld, retribution, relentless suffering, demons or damnation for \"Mitthi Khua\", as is confabulation of hell in most mythology; it is in simple description an inevitable destiny of all souls regardless of sins or virtues. Nor \"Pialral\" is an imperialistic kingdom of god with eternal worship as in other religions, it simply is a place of luxury and comfort for those who had made special deeds in life, called \"thangchhuah\". The ultimate reward is simple: to be relieved from labour and be served with ready-made food. In fact the quintessential element of \"Pialrâl\" is an ever availability of milled rice for eternity (\"faisa ring\", a common metaphorical expression in Mizo even today).\n\nEarning the title of \"thangchhuah\" is the most prestigious honour in the Mizo life and the only sure route to \"Pialrâl\" after death, and to achieve it is no small measure. By the estimate of the achievements imposed, \"Pialrâl\" is clearly an under-populated place. There are two ways by which one can accomplish the deed for being a \"thangchhuah\",\nnamely\n\nThe distinctive entitlement of an accomplished \"thangchhuah\" family in the village was that they had an open window (no other house ever had a window).\n\nWhen a person dies, as the Mizo believed, the spirit immediately emanates from the body, but does not go directly to \"Mithi Khua\". Instead it roams around until a favourable season, generally after the wet monsoon, around the month of August (in fact August is still traditionally named \"Thiṭin Thla\", meaning \"month of the spirit departure\"). The bereaved family then prepare \"thlaichhiah\", a ceremony involving animal sacrifice, so that the very spirit of the slain animal will provide and guide on the way. For example, the most commonly used were pig and dog – pig for the meat and dog to guide.\n\nAccording to the myth, the spirit heads towards the east onwards to a lake called \"Rih Dil\" (a real lake in western Burma). After crossing the lake, the spirit reaches a hill called \"Hringlang Tlâng\", meaning the \"hill from where mortals are visible\". On this hill is a special spring), the water of which erases mortal memories, hence called \"Lungloh Tui\" (\"water of no more sorrow\"). After drinking the water, the spirit plucks the nearby flower called \"Hawilo Pâr\" (which means \"flower of no looking back\") and tucks it to the hair behind the ears. This finally takes away all mortal feelings and worldly longings.\n\nThen the spirit has to confront a physical test just before entering \"Mitthi Khua\" which is a slingshot by a formidable guard named Pâwla. Pâwla is the only supernatural person in the Mizo mythology of afterlife. He is the first human to have died, and he would shoot at all the rank-and-file spirit so that they are doomed to settle in \"Mitthi Khua\" and nowhere else. His pellets were so huge that whoever he shot at could be crippled up to three years. However, there are three groups whom Pâwla never shoot at: firstly, the \"thangchhuah\" personnel; secondly, a young man who had slept either with three virgins or seven women; lastly, an infant below age.\n\nThe death of an infant before reaching an age is called \"hlamzuih\" (\"hlam\" meaning \"placenta\", and \"zuih\" meaning \"failure\" or \"end\") and was treated differently, rather casually. The infant corpse would be stuffed in an earthen pot, along with a hard-boiled egg and a porcupine quill, and be buried near or under the house. The mother's milk soaked in cotton and a pinch of rice in one hand would be all the food pack required for the journey. The egg was a device for navigation for the otherwise unaware baby and would be expected to roll all the way to \"Mitthi Khua\"; and the quill as a weapon of defense.\n\nFor the \"thangchhuah\" laureate there is no stopping by Pâwla or at the \"Mitthi Khua\", for there is another crossing of a river called \"Pial\", which demarcates the limit of the \"Mitthi Khua\". For the honoured one, \"Pial\" is no obstacle. The domestic \"thangchhuah\" would be certified by all his sacrifices of pigs and bison. As for the hunter \"thangchhuah\", he would sit on the head of his slain barking deer, holding its horns; the cobra would coil around him to the horn.

It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.\n\nAccording to the French historian of the environment Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, financial compensation (not named \"polluter pays principle\" at that time) is already the regulation principle of pollution favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century. He wrote that: \"This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves.\"\n\nThe polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an ecotax, which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.\n\nThe state of New South Wales in Australia has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of ecologically sustainable development in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.\n\nThe polluter pays principle is set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the directive into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this. \n\nIn France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):\nIn Ghana, the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.\n\nThe polluter pays principle is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the Swedish government in 1990. EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines extended producer responsibility as: \na concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.\nThe waste management in Switzerland is based on the polluter pays principle. Bin bags (for municipal solid waste) are taxed with pay-per-bag fees in three quarters of the communes (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).\n\nThe Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.\n\nThe principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (solid waste and hazardous waste management), and Superfund (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).\n\nSome eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:\n\nIn 2003, an amendment was passed negating the \"polluter pays\" provision of the Florida Constitution.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in US laws and programs. For example, drinking water and sewage treatment services are subsidized and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Environmental Management Act of 2002 prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the \"Polluter Pays\" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.\n\nIn international environmental law it is mentioned in the principle 16 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992.\n\n"}

Of the forty men on board, only one survived.\n\nIn 1907, Jean-Baptiste Charcot launched a new Antarctic expedition and began work on a new ship, \"Pourquoi-Pas?\" IV, a three-masted barque designed for polar exploration, equipped with a motor and containing three laboratories and a library. It was built at Saint-Malo to plans by Francois Gautier, in his shipyard.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1910, Charcot set out in \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV, wintering at Petermann Island, on his second polar expedition. He returned to France in 1910 laden with scientific discoveries - he had finished the mapping of Alexander Island and discovered a new island, Charcot Land.\n\nIn 1912, \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV became the French Navy's first school ship. From 1918 to 1925, Charcot took \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV on various scientific missions in the North Atlantic, the English Channel, the Mediterranean and the Faroe Islands, mainly to study underwater lithology and geology by means of drag nets, to whose material and use Charcot made major improvements.\n\nFrom 1925 onwards, limited by age, Charcot lost command of the ship (though he remained on board as head of the expedition) for her many voyages around the Arctic glaciers. In 1926, Charcot and \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV explored the eastern coast of Greenland and brought back many fossils and samples of insects and flora.\n\nIn 1928, \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV set out to investigate the disappearance of the large French seaplane \"Latham 47\" with the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen on board, which had itself been looking for the Italian general Umberto Nobile, who had set out to cross the North Pole in the dirigible \"Italia\" and not been heard from since.\n\nIn 1934, Charcot and \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV set up an ethnographic mission in Greenland headed by Paul-Émile Victor, who spent a year in Angmagssalik living amid the Eskimo population. In 1935, Charcot and \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV returned there to look for Victor and his three companions (Gessain, Pérez et Matter) and began the mapping of these regions. On 16 September that year, the ship managed to reach a small port to escape a cyclone which ravaged the coasts of Iceland.\n\nIn September 1936, returning from the mission to Greenland to deliver scientific material to Victor's mission (which had just traversed the ice sheets in 50 days) and after carrying out a survey mission, \"Pourquoi-Pas ?\" IV stopped at Reykjavík to re-provision with fuel on 13 September. They set out for Saint-Malo two days later, on 15 September, but on 16 September the ship was caught in a violent cyclonic storm and lost on the reefs of Álftanes at Mýrar. 23 of the crew were lost in the wreck and 17 survivors died before rescue came, leaving only one survivor, Eugène Gonidec, master steersman. Jean-Baptiste Charcot was one of the dead, aged 69.

{"id": "52121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52121", "title": "Strabo", "text": "Strabo\n\nStrabo (; \"Strábōn\"; 64 or 63 BC AD 24) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.\n\nStrabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (in present-day Turkey) in around 64BC. His family had been involved in politics since at least the reign of Mithridates V. Strabo was related to Dorylaeus on his mother's side. Several other family members, including his paternal grandfather had served Mithridates VI during the Mithridatic Wars. As the war drew to a close, Strabo's grandfather had turned several Pontic fortresses over to the Romans. Strabo wrote that \"great promises were made in exchange for these services\", and as Persian culture endured in Amasia even after Mithridates and Tigranes were defeated, scholars have speculated about how the family's support for Rome might have affected their position in the local community, and whether they might have been granted Roman citizenship as a reward.\n\nStrabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). He moved to Rome in 44 BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31 BC. In 29 BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea. Around 25 BC, he sailed up the Nile until reaching Philae, after which point there is little record of his proceedings until AD 17.\n\nIt is not known precisely when Strabo's \"Geography\" was written, though comments within the work itself place the finished version within the reign of Emperor Tiberius. Some place its first drafts around 7 BC, others around AD 17 or 18. The latest passage to which a date can be assigned is his reference to the death in AD 23 of Juba II, king of Maurousia (Mauretania), who is said to have died \"just recently\". He probably worked on the \"Geography\" for many years and revised it steadily, not always consistently. It is an encyclopaedical chronicle and consists of political, economic, social, cultural, geographic description of almost whole Europe: British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, Gaul, Germania, The Alps, Italy, Greece; and Northern Black Sea region, Anatolia, Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa. The \"Geography\" is the only extant work providing information about both Greek and Roman peoples and countries during the reign of Augustus.\n\nOn the presumption that \"recently\" means within a year, Strabo stopped writing that year or the next (AD 24 ), when he died.\nHe was influenced by Homer, Hecataeus, and Aristotle. The first of Strabo's major works, \"Historical Sketches\" (\"Historica hypomnemata\"), written while he was in Rome (c. 20 BC), is nearly completely lost. Meant to cover the history of the known world from the conquest of Greece by the Romans, Strabo quotes it himself and other classical authors mention that it existed, although the only surviving document is a fragment of papyrus now in possession of the University of Milan (renumbered [Papyrus] 46).\n\nStrabo studied under several prominent teachers of various specialties throughout his early life at different stops along his Mediterranean travels. His first chapter of education took place in Nysa (modern Sultanhisar, Turkey) under the master of rhetoric Aristodemus, who had formerly taught the sons of the very same Roman general who had taken over Pontus. Aristodemus was the head of two schools of rhetoric and grammar, one in Nysa and one in Rhodes, the former of the two cities possessing a distinct intellectual curiosity of Homeric literature and the interpretation of epics. Strabo was an admirer of Homer's poetry, perhaps a consequence of his time spent in Nysa with Aristodemus.\n\nAt around the age of 21, Strabo moved to Rome, where he studied philosophy with the Peripatetic Xenarchus, a highly respected tutor in Augustus's court. Despite Xenarchus's Aristotelian leanings, Strabo later gives evidence to have formed his own Stoic inclinations. In Rome, he also learned grammar under the rich and famous scholar Tyrannion of Amisus. Although Tyrannion was also a Peripatetic, he was more relevantly a respected authority on geography, a fact obviously significant, considering Strabo's future contributions to the field.\n\nThe final noteworthy mentor to Strabo was Athenodorus Cananites, a philosopher who had spent his life since 44 BC in Rome forging relationships with the Roman elite. Athenodorus endowed to Strabo three important items: his philosophy, his knowledge, and his contacts. Unlike the Aristotelian Xenarchus and Tyrannion who preceded him in teaching Strabo, Athenodorus was Stoic in mindset, almost certainly the source of Strabo's diversion from the philosophy of his former mentors. Moreover, from his own first-hand experience, Athenodorus provided Strabo with information about regions of the empire which he would not otherwise have known.\n\nStrabo is most notable for his work \"Geographica\" (\"Geography\"), which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era.\n\nAlthough the \"Geographica\" was rarely utilized in its contemporary antiquity, a multitude of copies survived throughout the Byzantine Empire. It first appeared in Western Europe in Rome as a Latin translation issued around 1469. The first Greek edition was published in 1516 in Venice. Isaac Casaubon, classical scholar and editor of Greek texts, provided the first critical edition in 1587.\n\nAlthough Strabo cited the antique Greek astronomers Eratosthenes and Hipparchus, acknowledging their astronomical and mathematical efforts towards geography, he claimed that a descriptive approach was more practical, such that his works were designed for statesmen who were more anthropologically than numerically concerned with the character of countries and regions.\n\nAs such, \"Geographica\" provides a valuable source of information on the ancient world, especially when this information is corroborated by other sources. He traveled extensively, as he says: \"Westward I have journeyed to the parts of Etruria opposite Sardinia; towards the south from the Euxine to the borders of Ethiopia; and perhaps not one of those who have written geographies has visited more places than I have between those limits.\" We do not know when he wrote \"Geographica\", but we know that he spent a lot of time in the famous library taking notes from his sources and his \"the works of his predecessors\" are most likely to have been noted at the library there. A first edition was published in 7 BC and a final edition no later than 23 AD, in the last year of Strabo's life. \"Geographica\", unfortunately, had an infinitesimal influence in his lifetime. It took about five years for scholars to give him a credit and for it to become a standard.\nIn his last book of \"Geographica\", he wrote quite extensively about the thriving port city of Alexandria. He emphasized that the harbor was well-encompassed by the embankments and that the shore was so deep-watered that even the largest ships could traverse. These ships were sent out to India, Ethiopia to supply them with products. Strabo juxtaposes Dichaiarchia (Naples, one of the largest ports in Europe) and Alexandria ports and says that the ships in Alexandria were clearly bigger. Thus, freight transporting and shipping were essential to foreign trade in products from all over the world, suggesting a highly developed local economy at that time.\nStrabo also describes the city itself. According to him, there were a lot of beautiful public parks and the city was reticulated with perfectly designed streets that were wide enough for chariots and horsemen. \"Two of these are exceeding broad, over a plethron in breadth, and cut one another at right angles ... All the buildings are connected one with another, and these also with what are beyond it.\" Hence, the architecture was also developed in Egypt.\n\nStrabo is pro-Roman politically, but culturally he reserves primacy to Greece: \"... pro-Roman throughout the Geography. But while he acknowledges and even praises Roman ascendancy in the political and military sphere, he also makes a significant effort to establish Greek primacy over Rome in other contexts.\"\n\nIn India, Strabo described small flying reptiles that were long with a snake-like body and bat-like wings. Other historians, such as Herodotus, Aristotle, and Flavius Josephus, mentioned similar creatures.\n\nAs quoted from Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\":\n\nStrabo... enters largely, in the Second Book of his \"Geography\", into the opinions of Eratosthenes and other Greeks on one of the most difficult problems in geology, \"viz\"., by what causes marine shells came to be plentifully buried in the earth at such great elevations and distances from the sea.\n\nHe notices, amongst others, the explanation of Xanthus the Lydian, who said that the seas had once been more extensive, and that they had afterwards been partially dried up, as in his own time many lakes, rivers, and wells in Asia had failed during a season of drought. Treating this conjecture with merited disregard, Strabo passes on to the hypothesis of Strato, the natural philosopher, who had observed that the quantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great, that its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continued to pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He therefore conceived that, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by this means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near Byzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis, and this partial drainage had already, he supposed, converted the left side into marshy ground, and that, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic, and perhaps the abundance of sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, might also be the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a passage and escaped.\n\nBut Strabo rejects this theory as insufficient to account for all the phenomena, and he proposes one of his own, the profoundness of which modern geologists are only beginning to appreciate. 'It is not,' he says, 'because the lands covered by seas were originally at different altitudes, that the waters have risen, or subsided, or receded from some parts and inundated others. But the reason is, that the same land is sometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, and the sea also is simultaneously raised and depressed so that it either overflows or returns into its own place again. We must, therefore, ascribe the cause to the ground, either to that ground which is under the sea, or to that which becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which lies beneath the sea, for this is more moveable, and, on account of its humidity, can be altered with great celerity. It is proper,' he observes in continuation, \"'to derive our explanations from things which are obvious, and in some measure of daily occurrences, such as deluges, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea;\" for the last raise up the sea also, and when the same lands subside again, they occasion the sea to be let down. And it is not merely the small, but the large islands also, and not merely the islands, but the continents, which can be lifted up together with the sea; and both large and small tracts may subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and many others, have been engulfed by earthquakes.'\n\nIn another place, this learned geographer [Strabo], in alluding to the tradition that Sicily had been separated by a convulsion from Italy, remarks, that at present the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by earthquakes, since there were now open orifices whereby fire and ignited matters and waters escaped; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna, the Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others, were closed up, the imprisoned fire and wind might have produced far more vehement movements. The doctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety valves, and that the subterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the volcanic energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.\n\nThe very first written definition/discussion on the fossil formation (mentioning Nummulite quoted from A.M. Celâl Şengör).\n\n\"One extraordinary thing which I saw at the pyramids must not be omitted. Heaps of stones from the quarries lie in front of the pyramids. Among these are found pieces which in shape and size resemble lentils. Some contain substances like grains half peeled. These, it is said, are the remnants of the workmen's food converted into stone; which is not probable. For at home in our country (Amasia), there is a long hill in a plain, which abounds with pebbles of a porus stone, resembling lentils. The pebbles of the sea-shore and of rivers suggest somewhat of the same difficulty [respecting their origin]; some explanation may indeed be found in the motion [to which these are subject] in flowing waters, but the investigation of the above fact presents more difficulty. I have said elsewhere, that in sight of the pyramids, on the other side in Arabia, and near the stone quarries from which they are built, is a very rocky mountain, called the Trojan mountain; beneath it there are caves, and near the caves and the river a village called Troy, an ancient settlement of the captive Trojans who had accompanied Menelaus and settled there.\"\n\nThe very first written definition/discussion of volcanism (effusive eruption) observed at Katakekaumenē (modern Kula, Western Turkey) until Pliny the Younger witnessed to the eruption of Vesuvius on 24 August AD 79 in Pompeii:\n\n\"... There are no trees here, but only the vineyards where they produce the Katakekaumene wines which are by no means inferior from any of the wines famous for their quality. The soil is covered with ashes, and black in color as if the mountainous and rocky country was made up of fires. Some assume that these ashes were the result of thunderbolts and sub-terranean explosions, and do not doubt that the legendary story of Typhon takes place in this region. Ksanthos adds that the king of this region was a man called Arimus. However, it is not reasonable to accept that the whole country was burned down at a time as a result of such an event rather than as a result of a fire bursting from underground whose source has now died out. Three pits are called \"Physas\" and separated by forty stadia from each other. Above these pits, there are hills formed by the hot masses burst out from the ground as estimated by a logical reasoning. Such type of soil is very convenient for viniculture, just like the Katanasoil which is covered with ashes and where the best wines are still produced abundantly. Some writers concluded by looking at these places that there is a good reason for calling Dionysus by the name (\"Phrygenes\")\"\n\n\n"}

He was also principal editor of the \"Nouvelles Annales des Voyage\".\n\nHe died in Marcoussis in the Essonne \"département\" and is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.\n\nHis name was given to the street in Marcoussis where he once lived.\n\nMount Malte-Brun in New Zealand's Southern Alps was named, by Sir Julius von Haast, after him.\n\nHe also published a revised edition of his father's geography (8 vols., 1852–55).\n\n"}

This was a major step in the history of navigation, when an understanding of winds in the age of sail was crucial to success: the European sea empires would never have been established had the Europeans not figured out how the trade winds worked.\n\nThe \"volta do mar\" was a sailing technique discovered in successfully returning from the Atlantic islands, where the pilot first had to sail far to the west in order to catch usable following winds, and return to Europe. This was a counter-intuitive sailing direction, as it required the pilot to steer in a direction that was perpendicular to the ports of Portugal. Lack of this information may have doomed the thirteenth-century expedition of Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, who were headed towards the as yet unknown Canary Islands and were lost; once there, without understanding the Atlantic gyre and the \"volta do mar\", they would have been unable to beat upwind to the Strait of Gibraltar and home. Discovering this technique was crucial for returning from future discoveries; for example Christopher Columbus would never have returned from America without applying the \"volta do mar\" by sailing northwards from the Caribbean through the Horse Latitudes to catch the prevailing mid-latitude westerlies. \n\nSimilarly in the South Atlantic with the exception that the South Atlantic gyre circulates counterclockwise. As India-bound Portuguese explorers and traders crossed the equator with the intention of passing the entire western coast of Africa, their voyages took them far to the West (in the vicinity of Brazil.)\n\nThe route of the Manila Galleon from Manila to Acapulco depended upon successful application of the Atlantic phenomenon to the Pacific ocean: in discovering the North Pacific Gyre, captains of returning galleons had to reach the latitudes of Japan before they could safely cross. The discovery, upon which the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade was based was owing to the Spanish Andrés de Urdaneta, who, sailing in convoy under Miguel López de Legazpi, discovered the return route in 1565: the fleet split up, some heading south, but Urdaneta reasoned that the trade winds of the Pacific might move in a gyre as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the \"Volta do mar\" to the west to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to the west coast of North America. Though he sailed to 38 degrees North before turning east, his hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near Cape Mendocino, California, then followed the coast south to Acapulco. Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned.\n\n"}

It defines a set of objects, ECMAScript standard compliant, that executing in the client application give the client's device location through the consulting of Location Information Servers, which are transparent for the application programming interface (API). The most common sources of location information are IP address, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth MAC address, radio-frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi connection location, or device Global Positioning System (GPS) and GSM/CDMA cell IDs. The location is returned with a given accuracy depending on the best location information source available.\n\nWeb pages can use the Geolocation API directly if the web browser implements it. Historically, some browsers could gain support via the Google Gears plugin, but this was discontinued in 2010 and the server-side API it depended on stopped responding in 2012.\n\nThe Geolocation API is ideally suited to web applications for mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA) and smartphones. On desktop computers, the W3C Geolocation API works in Firefox since version 3.5, Google Chrome, Opera 10.6, Internet Explorer 9.0, and Safari 5. On mobile devices, it works on Android (firmware 2.0+), iOS, Windows Phone and Maemo. The W3C Geolocation API is also supported by Opera Mobile 10.1 — available for Android and Symbian devices (S60 generations 3 & 5) since November 24, 2010.\n\nGoogle Gears provided geolocation support for older and non-compliant browsers, including Internet Explorer 7.0+ as a Gears plugin, and Google Chrome which implemented Gears natively. It also supported geolocation on mobile devices as a plugin for the Android browser (pre version 2.0) and Opera Mobile for Windows Mobile. However, the Google Gears Geolocation API is incompatible with the W3C Geolocation API and is no longer supported.\n\nThe result of W3C Geolocation API will usually give 4 location properties, including latitude and longitude (coordinates), altitude (height), and [accuracy of the position gathered], which all depend on the location sources. In some queries, altitude may yield or return no value.\n\nThe Geolocation API does not provide the location information. The location information is obtained by a device (such as a smartphone, PC or modem), which is then served by the API to be brought in browser. Usually geolocation will try to determine a device's position using one of these several methods.\n\n\nThough the implementation is not specified, W3C Geolocation API is built on extant technologies, and is heavily influenced by Google Gears Geolocation API. Example: Firefox's Geolocation implementation uses Google's network location provider.\n\nGoogle Gears Geolocation works by sending a set of parameters that could give a hint as to where the user's physical location is to a network location provider server, which is by default the one provided by Google (code.l.google.com). Some of the parameters are lists of sensed mobile cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, all with sensed signal strengths. These parameters are encapsulated into a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) message and sent to the network location provider via HTTP POST. Based on these parameters, the network location provider can calculate the location. Common uses for this location information include enforcing access controls, localizing and customizing content, analyzing traffic, contextual advertising and preventing identity theft.\n\nSimple JavaScript code that checks if the browser has the Geolocation API implemented and then uses it to get the current position of the device. this code creates a function which can be called on html using codice_1:\n\n\n"}
