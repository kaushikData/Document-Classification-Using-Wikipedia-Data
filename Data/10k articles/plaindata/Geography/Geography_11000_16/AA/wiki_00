{"id": "4619516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4619516", "title": "Butterfly gardening", "text": "Butterfly gardening\n\nButterfly gardening is designed to create an environment that attracts butterflies, as well as certain moths. Butterfly gardening is often aimed at inviting those butterflies and moths to lay eggs as well. Because some plants are not fed upon by adult butterflies, the caterpillar host should also be planted for a bigger population of butterflies. Butterflies typically feed on the nectar of flowers, and there are hundreds of such plants that may be planted to attract them, depending on the location, time of year, and other factors. In addition to the planting of flowers that feed butterflies, other means of attracting them include constructing \"butterfly houses\", providing sand for puddling, water, and other resources or food items, including rotten fruit.\n\nSome people only like to look at the butterflies, while others like to take pictures as well. Others try to help the butterfly population by planting native plants which rare or threatened butterflies feed on. Done correctly, butterfly gardening can increase the populations of butterflies. Many butterflies are becoming less abundant as a result of habitat destruction and fragmentation, and they do not feed on the plants regularly found in gardens. Others may also help in tagging monarch butterflies, which helps scientists monitor the monarch population and their migratory routes. Butterflies also serve as flower pollinators and attracting the butterflies can also assist in the pollination of nearby plants. Typically, flowers of plants that attract butterflies also attract other insect pollinators. Butterfly gardening can also serve as an educational opportunity for children and can be a relatively safe way to introduce them to the natural world.\n\nButterflies have many predators, including mantids, wasps, spiders, birds, ants, true bugs, and flies in the family Tachinidae. If these predators are becoming a problem, they can be controlled with traps rather than pesticides, which may also kill butterflies and their larvae. There are also diseases that afflict butterflies, such as bacteria in the genus \"Pseudomonas\", the nuclear polyhedrosis virus, and \"Ophryocystis elektroscirrha\", which only infects queen butterflies and monarch butterflies.\n\nIn the absence of pesticides, aphids and true bugs may infest plants. Some gardeners may wish to release ladybugs (ladybirds) and other biological pest control agents that do not harm butterflies in order to control aphids. However, the release of ladybugs is not a good idea in places such as the United States where the species that is released is generally the invasive Chinese ladybug. An alternative to this is to wait for local predatory insects to find the aphids. One technique some use to quicken this process if the infestation is particularly high is to spray the bushes with a mix of sugar and water, simulating aphid honeydew. This is known to attract lacewings whose larva eat aphids.\nAnother method of control is by spraying the plants with water, or rinsing plants with a mild dish detergent/water solution (although caterpillars should be relocated before suds are applied). Scented detergents are fine; those containing OxiClean should be avoided. The aphids will turn black within a day, and eventually fall off. One last technique is to plant a variety of different flowers, including ones that attract hoverflies and parasitic Braconid wasps, whose larvae kill pest species. Still, it is not advisable to kill all aphids, just to control them so that they are not detrimental to plants. Aphids still play a role in the environment by providing food for predators. There are even some caterpillars such as the harvester which only eat certain aphid species instead of plants.\n\nWith small home butterfly gardens, it is common for the larvae to exhaust the food source before metamorphosis occurs. Gardeners of monarch butterflies can replace the expended milkweed with a slice of pumpkin or cucumber, which can serve as a substitute source of food for monarch caterpillars in their final (fifth) instar. Planting multiple plants in clumps can help lower the chances of running out of leaves.\n\nEfforts to increase butterfly populations by establishing butterfly gardens require particular attention to the target species' food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate their food plants. For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarch butterflies prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (\"Asclepias syriaca\"), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. As monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when most \"Asclepias syriaca\" leaves are old and tough, the plant needs to be cut back in June – August to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak. In addition, \"Asclepias syriaca\" seed needs a period of cold treatment known as stratification before it will germinate.\n\nResearch should be conducted as to what species are prevalent in your area, and what plants they prefer to nectar on. Depending on your zone, some butterfly attracting plants include: purple cone flowers (\"Echinacea purpurea\"), yellow cone flowers, sunflowers, marigolds, poppies, cosmos, salvias, some lilies, asters, coreopsis, daisies, verbenas, lantanas, liastris, milkweed (especially for the monarch butterfly, whose caterpillars feed solely on this plant), the butterfly bush (also called buddleia), zinnias, pentas, porterweeds, and others. Avoid cultivars of plants that have \"double flowers\" (more petals which block the center) as these can be difficult for butterflies to access. Care should also be taken to research a species, to make sure it is not invasive in your region.\n\nIn addition to expanding the number of species seen in your yard, provide host plants that feed the caterpillars. This is just as important as planting flower beds with nectar-rich blooms.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "945670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=945670", "title": "Cirque", "text": "Cirque\n\nA cirque (French, from the Latin word \"circus\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic , meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (, ). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.\n\nThe concave shape of a glacial cirque is open on the downhill side, while the cupped section is generally steep. Cliff-like slopes, down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge, form the three or more higher sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl-shaped as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and their accompanying rock burdens: hence it experiences somewhat greater erosion forces, and is most often overdeepened below the level of the cirque's low-side outlet (stage) and its down slope (backstage) valley. If the cirque is subject to seasonal melting, the floor of the cirque most often forms a tarn (small lake) behind a dam which marks the downstream limit of the glacial overdeepening: the dam itself can be composed of moraine, glacial till, or a lip of the underlying bedrock.\n\nThe fluvial cirque or makhtesh, found in karst landscapes, is formed by intermittent river flow cutting through layers of limestone and chalk leaving sheer cliffs. A common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded.\n\nGlacial cirques are found amongst mountain ranges throughout the world; 'classic' cirques are typically about one kilometer long and one kilometer wide. Situated high on a mountainside near the firn line, they are typically partially surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs. The highest cliff often is called a headwall. The fourth side forms the \"lip\", \"threshold\" or \"sill\", the side at which the glacier flowed away from the cirque. Many glacial cirques contain tarns dammed by either till (debris) or a bedrock threshold. When enough snow accumulates it can flow out the opening of the bowl and form valley glaciers which may be several kilometers long.\n\nCirques form in conditions which are favorable; in the northern hemisphere the conditions include the north-east slope where they are protected from the majority of the sun’s energy and from the prevailing winds. These areas are sheltered from heat, encouraging the accumulation of snow; if the accumulation of snow increases, the snow turns into glacial ice. The process of nivation follows, whereby a hollow in a slope may be enlarged by ice segregation weathering and glacial erosion. Ice segregation erodes the rock vertical rock face and causes it to disintegrate, which may result in an avalanche bringing down more snow and rock to add to the growing glacier. Eventually, this hollow may become large enough that glacial erosion intensifies. The enlarging of this open ended concavity creates a larger leeward deposition zone, furthering the process of glaciation. Debris (or till) in the ice also may abrade (glacial abrasion) the bed surface; should ice move down a slope it would have a ‘sandpaper effect’ on the bedrock beneath, on which it scrapes.\n\nEventually, the hollow may become a large bowl shape in the side of the mountain, with the headwall being weathered by ice segregation, and as well as being eroded by plucking. The basin will become deeper as it continues to be eroded by ice segregation and abrasion. Should ice segregation, plucking and abrasion continue, the dimensions of the cirque will increase, but the proportion of the landform would remain roughly the same. A bergschrund forms when the movement of the glacier separates the moving ice from the stationary ice forming a crevasse. The method of erosion of the headwall lying between the surface of the glacier and the cirque’s floor has been attributed to freeze-thaw mechanisms. The temperature within the bergschrund changes very little, however, studies have shown that ice segregation (frost shattering) may happen with only small changes in temperature. Water that flows into the bergschrund can be cooled to freezing temperatures by the surrounding ice allowing freeze-thaw mechanisms to occur.\n\nIf two adjacent cirques erode toward one another, an arête, or steep sided ridge, forms. When three or more cirques erode toward one another, a pyramidal peak is created. In some cases, this peak will be made accessible by one or more arêtes. The Matterhorn in the European Alps is an example of such a peak.\n\nWhere cirques form one behind the other, a cirque stairway results as at the Zastler Loch in the Black Forest.\n\nAs glaciers can only originate above the snowline, studying the location of present-day cirques provides information on past glaciation patterns and on climate change.\n\nAlthough a less common usage, the term cirque is also used for amphitheatre-shaped, fluvial-erosion features. For example, an approximately anticlinal erosion cirque is at on the southern boundary of the Negev highlands. This erosional cirque or \"makhtesh\" was formed by intermittent river flow in the Makhtesh Ramon cutting through layers of limestone and chalk, resulting in cirque walls with a sheer drop. The Cirque du Bout du Monde is another such a feature, created in karst terraine in the Burgundy region of the department of Côte-d'Or in France.\n\nYet another type of fluvial erosion formed cirque is found on Réunion island, which includes the tallest volcanic structure in the Indian Ocean. The island consists of an active shield-volcano (Piton de la Fournaise) and an extinct, deeply eroded volcano (Piton des Neiges). Three cirques have eroded there in a sequence of agglomerated, fragmented rock and volcanic breccia associated with pillow-lavas overlain by more coherent, solid lavas.\n\nA common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded.\n\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\n"}

The results of the EVI are used to focus on planned solutions to negative pressures on the environment, whilst promoting sustainability.\n\nThe beginning stages of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) were developed to be appropriate for Small Island Developing States (SIDs), this theoretical idea at the time was presented by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) on February 4, 1999. The ideas and plans for The Environmental Vulnerability Index were worked on further with the creation of a (EVI) Think Tank that took place from September 7 – September 10, 1999 in Pacific Harbour, Fiji. Expanding the (EVI) to other SIDS was aided by a meeting of experts convened in Malta on November 29 – December 3, 1999 by (SOPAC) and the Foundation for International Studies (of the University of Malta’s Islands and Small States Institute) with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nDuring the second phase of the development, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) was tested in five different countries. A workshop was made to expand the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index to a demonstrative set of countries from around the world.

As the indicators are heterogeneous, include variables for which responses are numerical, qualitative and on different scales (linear, non-linear, or with different ranges) they are mapped onto a 1–7 vulnerability scale. Where data is not available, no value is given for the indicator and the denominator of the average adjusted down by one value. Where an indicator is considered 'non-applicable' in a country (such as volcanic eruptions in Tuvalu which has no volcanoes), the lowest vulnerability score of 1 is attributed to that indicator. The vulnerability scores for each indicator are then accumulated either into categories or sub-indices and the average calculated. An overall average of all indicators is calculated to generate the country EVI.

{"id": "45195265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45195265", "title": "Esanland", "text": "Esanland\n\nEsanland (Esan: \"Otọesan\"), or the Edo Central Senatorial District is a cultural region and senatorial district located in south-south Nigeria. It is composed of five Local Government Areas in Edo State. Esanland lies west of the banks of the Niger River. It is bordered by Kogi State, Delta State, Edo South Senatorial District, and Edo North Senatorial District. Esanland covers about 2,800 square kilometers and is home to over half a million people. The Esan people and culture of Esanland are generally homogenous.\n\nEsanland has been inhabited since the late Iron Age, by hunter-gatherers from the Nok culture. The hunter gatherers formed a society in northern Esanland until the 12th century. In the 15th century, indigenes from the Great Benin Empire moved to Esanland and renewed Edo-Esan cultural bonds as the Benin were the Royal blood and Emperor controlling the Southern Hemisphere. Esan nations often worked either in tandem or subordination towards the Benin Empire, sending soldiers to the Benin army and treating their rulers as dukes to the Oba of Benin.\n\nTrade with the Portuguese brought modern innovations such as Dane guns and spoons, and new crops.\n\nIndependent rule in Esanland continued into the 1800s, until the British claimed the entire region for the Royal Niger Company as part of the colony Nigeria. Local opposition to the conquest was vocal, and \"enijie\" such as King Ogbidi Okojie of Uromi banded together their soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt to fight British rule. After the British takeover, independence movements sprung up. Leaders in Esanland such as Anthony Enahoro successfully campaigned for independence, which was granted to the whole of Nigeria. Since independence, Esanland has suffered from poor infrastructure and an attempted takeover in the Nigerian Civil War by Biafra.\n\nEsanland originates from the term \"E san fia\" or \"they have fled\" in Edo language, referring to the flight of refugees from the Benin Empire to the surrounding forest that make up the original Esans.\n\nAccording to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years. These people were likely associated with the Nok people and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests. To this day, northern Esan dialects have more in common with Northern Edo languages such as Etsako and Owan than southern Esan dialects do, which happen to be closely related with Edo. These \"proto-Edoid\" peoples grew yam, oil palm and vegetables, but also hunted and gathered.\n\nStarting from 500 AD to 750 AD, these hunter-gatherers started to colonize the savannah-forest ecosystem of Esanland and the forest ecosystem of the Benin Empire. They created a pre-Esan, pre-Edo society that built advanced structures such as moats and walls around family properties. These enclosures were, at maximum, three to five kilometers in diameter, and demarcated residential and agricultural property. Those properties enlarged to become villages, and by 800 AD, these village coalesced to form kingdoms with hierarchies. Modern-day digs in the region have found that these walls were situated in the eastern Benin Empire and northern Esanland. Settlements were close to permanent springs on the northern plateau, but never next to intermittent springs.\n\nEsanland's culture, language and growth were majorly influenced by the mass exoduses to Esan territory from all adjacent polities Communities on Esanland's southern and eastern fringes (Ewohimi, Ewatto, Ekpon, Amahor) were heavily populated by Igbos and Igalas (into Uroh); from the north came the Emai into Ukhun, Idoa, and Amahor and the Etsako into Irrua); and from the south came the Itsekiri (into Ekpon) and Urhobo (into Ujiogba).\n\nThe biggest influence on Esanland came from the Benin Empire. In 1460, Oba Ewuare passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland's modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term \"Esan,\" or \"refugee.\" Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory. Prominent Esan and Edo historians have collected stories about this migration.\n\nEsan kingdoms had a varying degree of autonomy, but were ultimately controlled by the Benin Empire. The Oba approved the enijie of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin.\n\nEsanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin's sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or \"ekhen.\" \"Ekhen\" procured cloth, ivory, peppers and resources. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or \"ukpon ododo\" from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through \"ekhen\".\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom. The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the Muslim Nupe people in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the Kukuruku peoples’ lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans’ favor; several Nupe and Etsako warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. The nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.\n\nIn 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.\n\nThe first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a guerrilla warfare strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.\n\nOn March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by Prince Okojie, was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.\n\nThis process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued geurilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain's part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.\n\nEsan kingdoms were structured in a way that \"eguares\", or cities, were headed by \"enijies\", singular \"onojie\". \"Eguares\" were subdivided into villages, which were subdivided into \"idumu\" or quarters. Villages and \"idumu\" are headed by the oldest man in said village/\"idumu\", the \"edionwele\" (plural \"odionwere\").\n\nEsanland has an area of . It is dominated by the Ishan-Asaba Plateau in Midwestern Nigeria. This plateau is the source of many streams in the region.\n"}

It is active against the development model with which dams are associated, which International Rivers holds to be unsustainable. It promotes alternative solutions for meeting water, energy and flood-management needs. The organization is dedicated to giving dam-affected people the tools to participate in the development of local lands in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nBy facilitating international grassroots organizing and informed participation, International Rivers seeks to change the terms of the debate over river development. The group works with its numerous partners to advocate for social reparations, ecological restoration and decommissioning of existing dams. International Rivers states that it works to clarify the traditionally top-down decision-making of large infrastructure projects. It also argues against industry's presentation of hydropower regards climate change, making clear that reservoirs often produce greenhouse gas emissions that further impact on the environment.\n\nInternational Rivers has undertaken a two-pronged approach to analyzing and promoting viable water and energy solutions. Combining its efforts to change global policy with campaigning on specific key projects, International Rivers simultaneously addresses the root causes and localized consequences of destructive dam development. Their campaigns throughout Africa, China, Latin America, South Asia and Southeast Asia focus on the intersection of dams and climate change, reforming the policies and practices of international financial institutions, and promoting water and energy solutions that recognize human rights and environmental sustainability.\n\nAmong its accomplishments, International Rivers counts its integral involvement with the formation of the World Commission on Dams as one of its most important contributions. The commission was a global, multi-stakeholder body initiated in 1997 by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union, formed in response to growing opposition to dams. During its two-year lifetime, the WCD conducted the most exhaustive study of dams done to date, ultimately evaluating over 1,000 dams in 79 countries. In its published final report, the WCD concluded that although \"dams have made an important and significant contribution to human development, and benefits derived from them have been considerable... in too many cases an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been paid to secure those benefits, especially in social and environmental terms, by people displaced, by communities downstream, by taxpayers and by the natural environment.\"\n\nSince the organization's inception, worldwide construction of dams has decreased by half, and universal recognition of the consequences of hydropower continues to increase.\n\nInternational Rivers publishes a journal, \"World Rivers Review\", focused on addressing the state of various dam projects, ecosystems, and people. It also publishes an annual report on a variety of dam-related subjects.\n\n\n"}

It was written by the \"Pilgrim of Bordeaux\", an anonymous pilgrim from Burdigala (present-day Bordeaux, France). It recounts the writer's journey to the Holy Land in the years 333 and 334 as he traveled by land through northern Italy and the Danube valley to Constantinople, then through Asia Minor and Syria to Jerusalem, and then back by way of Macedonia, Otranto, Rome, and Milan. \n\nAccording to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\": \n\nAnother reader, Jaś Elsner, notes that, a brief twenty-one years after Constantine institutionalized Christianity, \"the Holy Land to which the pilgrim went had to be entirely reinvented in those years, since its main site—ancient Jerusalem—had been sacked under the Emperor Hadrian and refounded as Aelia Capitolina.\" Elsner found to his surprise \"how swiftly a Christian author was willing implicitly to re-arrange and redefine deeply entrenched institutional norms, while none the less writing on an entirely traditional model [i.e., the established Greco-Roman genre of travel writing].\"\n\nThe compiler of the itinerary was aware at each boundary of crossing from one Roman province to the next, and distinguished carefully between each change of horses (\"mutatio\") and a stopover place (\"mansio\"), and the differences between the simplest cluster of habitations (\"vicus\") and the fortress (\"castellum\") or city (\"civitas\"). The segments of the journey are summarised; they are delineated by major cities, with major summaries at Rome and Milan, long-established centers of culture and administration, and Constantinople, refounded by Constantine only three years previously, and the \"non-city\" Jerusalem. \n\nGlenn Bowman engaged in a close textual analysis of the \"Itinerarium\"; he argues that in fact it is a carefully structured work relating profoundly to Old and New Biblical dispensations via the medium of water and baptism imagery.\n\nThe \"Itinerarium\" survives in four manuscripts, all written between the 8th and 10th centuries. Two give only the Judean portion of the trip, which is fullest in topographical glosses on the sites, in a range of landscape detail missing from the other sections, and Christian legend.\n\nA well-known pilgrim itinerary of the sixth century, written by someone from Placentia/Piacenza, is attributed incorrectly to \"Antoninus of Piacenza\".\n\n\nKai Brodersen: Aetheria/Egeria, Reise in das Heilige Land.

It is a scholarly essay, a key element in the study of portolans, especially those made by Majorcans as half of the book is devoted to the study of more than 400 Majorcan portolans existing worldwide.\n\nRey Pastor before explaining how to identify the works of this school for its unmistakable traits, he says:\n\"\".. In the monumental Periplus of the unsurpassed Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, I saw with pleasant surprise that the most varicoloured parchments, ornamented with fabulous effigies of monarchs and naive legends, \" written in Catalan \" with lots of information, physical, biological and political, of each region, they originate in Majorca -in an unknown date-, being designated as \"catalan maps\"...\"'\n\nDr. Julio in his book, gives an explanation of why no Spanish scholar had touched the subject, referring to the unjust appropriation of some portolans by some Italian scholars: \"Our geographers, insufficiently armed, they stayed timidly neutral; and the militant vindicator of Spanish science, Dr. Gumersindo Laverde -who had organized a phalanx defending the flag hoisted by the young scholar Menéndez y Pelayo-, they remained silent, for the great scholar had forgotten this chapter of the medieval science \"..\n\nRey Pastor -a great mathematician and lover of the cartography- entered into this profile, in fact cartographers were apart from being artists they had to master mathematics -at least some of them- as the projection of the sphere on a plane it needs them.\n\nJulio Rey Pastor, was able to make the point defending the catalan authorship of many Majorcan portolans against both, the Portuguese scholars, and some Italian \"scholars\", and in fact he could not be more impartial, for he was not catalan, he was from La Rioja.\n\n\nRey Pastor says.. \"..That Jehuda Cresques (c. 1415) acted as founder and director of the Escola de Sagres, was known to historians for over a century, with doubts on which \"mestre Jacome\" from Majorca corresponded to the \"mestre Jacome\" contracted by Prince Henry, (although he was the only cartographer with that name).. But it's unforgivable that some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infant, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sense, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable Peter the Ceremonious and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN.. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of Pacheco Pereira...:\n\nAnd he continues.. It's unforgivable as well, that those scholars, could dare to write on the subject without reading João de Barros, which clearly states: \"..mándou vir da ilha de Mallorca um mestre Jacome, hornera mui douto na arte de navegar, que fasia e instrumentos náuticos e que Ihe custou muito pelo trazer a este reino para ensinar sua sciencia aos officiaes portuguezes d'aquella mester..\"\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It is used extensively in the disciplines of surveying, geodesy, and photogrammetry—the field of geomatics, collectively.\n\nThere are three forms of least squares adjustment: \"parametric\", \"conditional\", and \"combined\". In parametric adjustment, one can find an observation equation \"h(X)=Y\" relating observations \"Y\" explicitly in terms of parameters \"X\" (leading to the A-model below). In conditional adjustment, there exists a condition equation \"g(Y)=0\" involving only observations \"Y\" (leading to the B-model below) — with no parameters \"X\" at all. Finally, in a combined adjustment, both parameters \"X\" and observations \"Y\" are involved implicitly in a mixed-model equation \"f(X,Y)=0\". Clearly, parametric and conditional adjustments correspond to the more general combined case when \"f(X,Y)=h(X)-Y\" and \"f(X,Y)=g(Y)\", respectively. Yet the special cases warrant simpler solutions, as detailed below. Often in the literature, \"Y\" may be denoted \"L\".\n\nThe equalities above only hold for the estimated parameters formula_1 and observations formula_2, thus formula_3. In contrast, measured observations formula_4 and approximate parameters formula_5 produce a nonzero \"misclosure\":\nOne can proceed to Taylor series expansion of the equations, which results in the Jacobians or design matrices: the first one,\nand the second one,\nThe linearized model then reads:\nwhere formula_10 are estimated \"parameter corrections\" to the \"a priori\" values, and formula_11 are post-fit \"observation residuals\".\n\nIn the parametric adjustment, the second design matrix is an identity, \"B=-I\", and the misclosure vector can be interpreted as the pre-fit residuals, formula_12, so the system simplifies to:\nwhich is in the form of ordinary least squares. \nIn the conditional adjustment, the first design matrix is null, \"A=0\".\nFor the more general cases, Lagrange multipliers are introduced to relate the two Jacobian matrices and transform the constrained least squares problem into an unconstrained one (albeit a larger one). In any case, their manipulation leads to the formula_1 and formula_2 vectors as well as the respective parameters and observations \"a posteriori\" covariance matrices.\n\nGiven the matrices and vectors above, their solution is found via standard least-squares methods; e.g., forming the normal matrix and applying Cholesky decomposition, applying the QR factorization directly to the Jacobian matrix, iterative methods for very large systems, etc.\n\n\n\n\nIf rank deficiency is encountered, it can often be rectified by the inclusion of additional equations imposing constraints on the parameters and/or observations, leading to constrained least squares.\n\nLecture notes and Technical reports:\n\nBooks:\n"}

As the name implies, water is held in reserve by a reservoir so it can serve a purpose. For example, in Thailand, reservoirs tend to store water from the wet season to prevent flooding, then releases it during the dry season for farmers to grow rice. For this type of reservoir, almost the entire volume of the reservoir functions for the purpose it was built. Hydroelectric power generation, on the other hand, requires many dams to build up a large volume before operation can begin. For this type of reservoir only a small portion of the water held behind the dam is useful. Therefore, knowing the purpose\na reservoir has been constructed, and knowing how much water can be used for that purpose helps determine how much water is in possible reserve.\n\nThe following terms are used in connection with the volume of reservoirs:\n\n\"Nominal Volume\" or \"Capacity\" is the total volume of all water held behind a dam at the maximum level possible.\n\n\"Initial\" or \"Design Volume\" refers to the possible volume within the reservoir after it first opens. Many rivers are high in silt that over time deposits behind a dam reducing capacity.\n\n\"Active\" or \"Live\" volume equals the total capacity minus the \"dead pool\" volume. This is the volume that can serve some downstream purpose. For example, it is the volume available to make hydroelectric power or provide drinking water to a city.\n\n\"Dead pool\" or \"Minimum\" volume refers to the amount of water left in a reservoir that cannot be used for the general purpose the reservoir was constructed. At this state, the reservoir is termed \"fully drawn down.\" For example, if built to supply water in the dry season, it is the water left behind when no more water can be extracted. Frequently, the effective minimum volume is greater if the water is needed for a purpose behind a dam.\n\n\"Available capacity\" may require knowing the reservoir's primary purpose. If it is designed to prevent flooding, it may be the volume of water that can be retained before reaching maximum or \"top water\".\n\n\"Actual\" or \"Current\" when coupled with another term reflects the fact the level behind the dam is not constant.\n\nThe list below largely ignores many natural lakes that have been augmented with the addition of a relatively minor dam. For example, a small dam, two hydroelectric plants, and locks on the outlet of Lake Superior make it possible to artificially control the lake level. Certainly, the great majority of the lake is natural. However, the control of water that can be held in reserve means a portion of the vast lake functions as a reservoir.\n\nRecognition of lakes like Lake Superior greatly changes the list below. For example, the Francis H. Clergue Generating Station and Saint Marys Falls Hydropower Plant, which are both on the lake's outlet, operate with just 5.9 meters total head. This is short compared to other dams. However, when viewed against the 81,200 km2 area of the lake, even a small range in Lake Superior's means its \"active\" volume is greater than the largest \"nominal\" in the table below.\n\n"}

He teaches the first classes of Structural Geology and of the Geology of the Quaternary. In 1961 he is eliminated from the Department by the communist administration, on political grounds.\n\nOn April 4, 1990, together with Dolphi Drimer, Marcian Bleahu founds the Ecological University, the first private university in Romania and the only university with an ecological profile. Dolphi Drimer becomes the rector of this university and Marcian Bleahu is appointed as dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences (later on named Faculty of Ecology), where he teaches Dynamic Geology, Physical Geography of Romania, Geology of Romania, Protection of nature and protected areas.

During all these 33 years of field research, he synthesized and made public the stratigraphy and the structure of the Apuseni Mountains. The papers he published in this field are the first scientific source about the geology of the Maramures, Bihor, Codru-Moma and Metaliferic Mountains - he dedicated to each of them a monography. These researches had an important impact on synthesis of national interest, such as coal deposits, Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations, but also from the tectonic point of view, in the general works about the structure of the territory, as well as in the integration of these researches in the wider framework of the study of Triassic paleography in Eastern Europe.\n\nDirectly, or by coordinating teams of geologists, Marcian Bleahu also produced over 50 maps (pages) component of the Geological Map of Romania, on a scale of 1:200.000, for which he also made the state standards in the field.\n\nA special chapter of this field activity was the study of karstology, meaning the exploration, the mapping and the research of the caves in the Apuseni mountains, almost unknown until then: Peștera de la Căput, Peștera Buciumul Sucit, Peștera Vântului, Peștera Vadu Crișului, Peștera Șura Mare, Peștera din Peretele Dârnini, Peștera Coliboaia, Avenul de sub Pietruța, Peștera Izvorul Tăușoarelor, Peștera-aven ghețarul de sub Zgurăști, Peștera Cetatea Rădesei, Peștera Pojarul Poliței, Peștera Scărișoara, Peștera Huda lui Papară, Vânătările Ponorului, Izbucul de la Cotețul Dobreștilor, Avenul de sub Colții Grindului, Peștera Gaura cu Muscă, Peștera Bolii, Peștera Neagră, Peștera Ghețarul de la Vârtop, Avenul din Piatra Ceții, Peștera Calului, Peștera Bisericuța, Peștera din Dealul Cornului, Peștera Mică de la Vânătare, Peștera Dâlbina, Peștera Corobana lui Gârtău, Peștera V5, Peștera Poarta lui Ionele, Avenul din Șesuri etc.\n\nIn 1976 he publishes \"Caves from Romania\" \"Peșteri din România\", which becomes one of the first scientific best-sellers in Romania.\n\nAll these researches, as well as the world scientific trends of the '60s in the field of plate tectonics catalyses Marcian Bleahu's research activity and he becomes a pioneer in the field of global tectonics not only in Romania, but also with significant contributions in the international scientific community. The results of his studies were synthesized in the book \"Global tectonics\" - Bucharest, 1983, Editura Științifică, (\"Tectonica globală)\", in two volumes, with over 1000 pages.\n\nDespite the opposition of the scientific world of that time, which got quickly past any debate over ideas and arrived at the political questioning of the research results (the communist authorities forbade him to leave the country for 6 years, 1978 - 1984), Marcian Bleahu managed to thrust his theories, and he was invited in 1974, 1976 and 1978 to teach at the University in Geneva the first course in Global Tectonics; he also gave conferences in Vienna, Zurich, Freiburg, Basel, Potsdam, etc.\n\nBetween 1949 - 1952 he was the manager of the geology service for the Danube - Black Sea Canal.\n\nIn 1953, he coordinated the geological research for the project of Bucharest Metro.\n\nHe was a member of the inter-ministerial commission of analysis for the Earthquake on March 4th 1977.\n\nBetween 1985 - 1994 he was a member of the team that founded and coordinated The National Museum of Geology in Bucharest.\n\nWhile a student, he sympathized with the National Liberal Party, but he was not a member of any political party until 1965, when he joins the Romanian Communist Party, in order to be appointed on a management position in the Geological Institute. If, politically, his activity until 1990 was almost non-existent, from the professional point of view he will be remembered as the founder of the National Museum of Geology, in 1985, where he also worked as a scientific coordinator, until 1994.\n\nAfter the Revolution in December 1989, Marcian Bleahu founds the Ecologist Movement in Romania, thus putting into practice his professional belief regarding the protection of nature and of environment.\n\nHe is elected as a senator in May 1990, in the first free post-communist Parliament and he becomes the Minister of Environment in the Stolojan cabinet. In this position, he elaborated the legislation in the field (again, a pioneer work) and he tried to integrate Romania in the international conventions and programs regarding the environment.\n\nIn 1992 he is appointed vice-president of the UN Conference for environment and development in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn 1996 he is elected again as a senator, on the lists of the Democratic Convention, for the Ecologist Federation of Romania. He was a member of the Commission for Foreign Affairs and of the parliamentary group of the National Liberal Party.\n\nIn 2008 he is appointed as President of Honor of the Green Party, successor of the Ecologist Federation of Romania.\n\n\nGeology:\n\nGeography:\n\nSpeleology:\n\nEcology:\n\nTourism and Alpinism:\nMiscellaneous:\nCo-author in reference works:\n\n"}

{"id": "11812179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11812179", "title": "Military building", "text": "Military building\n\nA military building is any structure designed to house functions performed by a military unit. General types include:\n\nMilitary organizations of all types must support a wide range of administrative functions including personnel management, accounting, and procurement. Some facilities are quite similar to civilian office buildings while others are converted from other military uses and can be quite idiosyncratic.\n\nAmmunition is frequently stored in small quantities in reinforced structures which are widely separated. Standard designs are sometimes called \"igloos\".\n\nTraditionally, military units provided most of the rations, uniforms, and other supplies needed by most military personnel. However, modern units often provide fewer items and many personnel must buy some items with their own funds. Personnel with families also must buy food, clothing, and other necessities for the family. This has created the need for modern commissary and “PX” (post exchange) buildings. In some cases, these buildings are similar to modern supermarkets.\n\nMost military installations have small jails for temporary holding of suspects or short term punishment of minor offenses. However, military organizations also have larger, centralized facilities for longer term incarceration of persons convicted of more serious offenses. The main correctional facility of the US Army, Air Force, and Marines is the United States Disciplinary Barracks located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nFortifications vary widely in nature depending on the mission and type of unit engaged.\n\nFull-service military hospitals are a fairly recent innovation in military history. Prior to the nineteenth century, military hospitals as we know them today did not exist. Soldiers wounded in combat were treated in the field or in makeshift facilities commandeered near the field of battle. Medical technology at the time was such that most serious wounds were fatal and, accordingly, there was little need for facilities that provided for long-term care and recuperation. Battlefield amputations were one of the most common procedures and were only successful in saving the life of the victim in a limited number of cases.\n\nHowever, beginning in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, advances in blood transfusion, anesthesia, antibiotics, and trauma treatment meant that many more soldiers could survive wounds although the treatment time was much longer. Also, advances in the treatment of infectious diseases meant that many more personnel required treatment for non-combat conditions.\n\nAll of these conditions, plus an increasing number of personnel with families, have led to the construction of full service military hospitals. These hospitals treat both members of the military and their families.\n\nMilitary housing includes barracks, UOQs (unescorted or \"bachelor\" officer quarters), and family housing. The age and condition of these facilities varies widely. A few officer family housing units are very historical in nature and can be quite large and ornate. Most family and UOQ housing is now similar in nature to civilian housing stock. In most advanced countries, barracks housing has been modernized, but remnants of housing from World War II and older periods still remains in the inventory.\n\n“Mess” is the military term for any facility serving food to large groups. Some mess halls in remote locations can be rudimentary, but others in established locations can be similar to modern cafeterias.\n\nThese facilities are highly secured. Modern facilities involve intensive use of electronics and computer technology.\n\nBecause of the role military actions have played in determining world history, military museums are common. They range widely from small facilities memorializing the actions of local units to large, sophisticated facilities devoted to an entire branch of service or entire wars.\n\nThese facilities are engineered to provide safe storage and handling of petroleum-based materials. Newer facilities include containments to prevent environmental pollution from due to spills.\n\nRecreation facilities for both military personnel and their families. Athletic facilities are common as are officers' clubs and NCO/enlisted personnel clubs.\n\nMilitary organizations conduct extensive research operations and maintain extensive purpose-built research facilities to support those activities.\n\nTraditional military training facilities focused on physical conditioning and skills training. Newer facilities make extensive use of computer simulations of various kinds to provide more hours or training in more realistic situations at lower cost and with lower risk to personnel. Military academies are devoted entirely to training military officer cadets. Facilities for advanced training of senior officers also exist. Examples include the US Army Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, KS.\n\nMany military installations are large enough to require their own utility systems. Water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, and electric power generation stations are found on many military installations.\n\nVehicle repair shops can be very large and built to accommodate large vehicles. Aircraft hangars are some of the largest and most specialized military buildings.\n\nProduction of ammunition is now largely outsourced to industry contractors. However, facilities such as Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant produced small arms ammunition for the US Military for many years. More exotic facilities such as Rocky Mountain Arsenal (now decommissioned) was the main facility for production of chemical weapons.\n\n"}

He spoke nine languages: Romanian, Latin, both Attic and Modern Greek, French, German, Turkish, Swedish and Russian. One of his grandsons was the Spătar (Chancellor) Yuri Stefanovich, who came to Russia in 1711 with prince Dimitrie Cantemir.\n\nHis prosonym Moldavo-Lacone (Moldavan-Laconian) is thought to be an indication of a possible Greek origin. The name \"Milescu\" was adopted by his parents when they settled in Milesti. Prof. L. Turdeanu-Cartojan discovered at Oxford his autobiography, written in Greek (\"Λαζάρου\", \"Lazarou\").\n\nA boyar born in Vaslui, Milescu studied at the Patriarchate College of Istanbul and, after returning to Iași, was appointed Chancellor for the Moldavian Prince Gheorghe Ştefan. In 1660–1664, he acted as representative of his country with its Ottoman overlord, and then as envoy to Berlin and Stockholm. He followed Gheorghe Ştefan in his exile to Stockholm and Szczecin (1664–1667) and visited Louis XIV's France in an attempt to get the King to assist him in creating an anti-Ottoman alliance.\n\nNumismatic issue – in 2011, the National Bank of Romania issued a silver coin dedicated to the 375th anniversary of Nicolae Milescu's birth.\n\nMilescu had ambitions of his own, and conspired against Prince Ştefăniţă Lupu. As punishment, Ştefăniţă ordered Milescu's nose to be cut off (the reason for Milescu's moniker). According to the unlikely account of chronicler Ion Neculce: \"After [being mutilated], Nicolae the Snub-nosed fled to the German Land and found himself a doctor there, who repeatedly drew blood out of his cheeks and sculptured his nose, and thus day by day the blood coagulated, leading to his healing\".\n\nMilescu again left for Istanbul, where he received a letter from the Russian Tsar Aleksey I, who appointed him chief translator and diplomat at the Foreign Ministry in 1671. Milescu arrived in Russia together with Patriarch Dositheos II of Jerusalem. In 1674, he is shown as leading negotiations with both Wallachia and Moldavia, trying to rally them in the Russian-led anti-Ottoman projects. In 1695, Milescu took part in Peter the Great's Azov Campaigns.\n\nOne of Milescu's tasks was to reinforce the legitimacy of the Romanov Dynasty. To this end, he asserted that the Tsar was a successor to both the Roman and Byzantine emperors. In \"Vasiliologion\" (\"Book of Rulers\", 1674), he wrote that tsarist rule was derived from God, whose representative on earth was the Tsar. The work included short biographies of famous rulers, culminating with Michael Romanov and Aleksey, but also including Ivan the Terrible, Dmitry Donskoy, Alexander Nevsky, Byzantine emperors Constantine and Theodosius, and Augustus and Julius Caesar from Rome. Significantly, he included the feeble-minded Feodor Ivanovich, whose reign was considerably less illustrious, but who had to be mentioned in order to demonstrate dynastic continuity.\n\nIn \"Khrismologion\" (\"Book of Prophecy\", 1672) he analyzed commentary on the four kingdoms of Daniel prophecy, concluding that, due to its connection with Constantinople, Russia was the only true successor to the fourth kingdom, Rome. Going further, he asserted that the right of Roman succession belonged \"only\" to Russia, and not to the Holy Roman Empire. In setting forth his claim, he made reference to Anna Porphyrogenita, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II, who married Vladimir the Great. In his view, this union not only reinforced the strong connection between Byzantium and Russia, but also drew a dynastic line between Vladimir and Aleksey.\nIn 1675, he was named ambassador of the Russian Empire to Beijing, the capital of Qing China, returning in 1678. At the head of a 150-strong expedition that had a military component (meant to fend off possible attacks by a hostile indigenous population), Milescu had as his main tasks the settlement of several border incidents between Russia and China, the establishment of permanent trade relations with China, and the survey of the newly incorporated Russian lands along the Amur River. The previous Muscovite embassy to China, led by Fyodor Baykov in 1656-56, had failed to achieve these objectives.\n\nUnlike previous Russians who had gone through Mongolia, Milescu chose to travel through Siberia as far as Nerchinsk, directly north of Peking. Upon reaching Yeniseysk, Milescu sent one of his men, Ignatiy Milovanov, to the Chinese court in order to inform the Kangxi Emperor about the purpose of their embassy. Milovanov was the first European known to have crossed the Amur (Heilong) River, reaching Beijing by the shortest route possible. Milescu followed the same route to the Chinese border, and established his camp on the Nen River in Heilongjiang, waiting for news from Milovanov. The latter returned to the camp on 18 February and, taking Milescu's report to the Tsar with him, proceeded to Moscow. Milescu, on the other hand, crossed into Beijing via Hebei in the middle of May, after being held up for two months at Kalgan (modern Zhangjiakou). Here he was able to communicate in Latin with the Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest. His diplomacy proved unsuccessful, and he returned to Siberia by the same route in Spring 1677.\n\nMilescu is the author of one of the first Russian works on arithmetic, \"Arithmologion\", which was written in 1672, based on his own Greek original. The manuscript was preserved in the Chudov Monastery, till it was discovered by church historian Nikolay Kedrov.\n\nIn his road journal – later published under the title \"Travels through Siberia to the Chinese borders\", Milescu correctly described the middle course of the Ob, Irtysh, and Angara. He assumed the Ob to have its source in Lake Teletskoye in the Altai Mountains. He was also the first person to describe Lake Baikal and all the rivers feeding the lake, and the first to point out Baikal's unfathomable depth.\n\nOn his way through Siberia, Milescu used the astrolabe to establish coordinates of some settlements. His materials were later used by the Jesuits, who took considerable interest in China. Upon returning to Moscow, he submitted to the Foreign Ministry three volumes of notes: \"Travel notes\" and \"Description of China\", alongside the \"Travels\".\n\nIn his narratives, Milescu summed up the knowledge that Russian explorers had gathered about East Siberia. Although he believed that the Amur was the largest river in the world, he listed its main tributaries without mistake. His idea that there was a vast mountain range stretching from the Baikal to the Okhotsk Sea, although fundamentally wrong, was widely believed by many geographers until the mid-20th century. He also heard rumours about Sakhalin, which he supposed to be the same island as Hokkaidō, thus considerably exaggerating its dimensions.\n\nBogdan Petriceicu-Hasdeu believed that Milescu was the author of the first translation of the Bible into Romanian, the Bucharest edition (printed in 1688, during the rule of Prince Şerban Cantacuzino). However, Nicolae Iorga and other historians have argued that there is no actual proof of this, and have proposed Constantin Cantacuzino as the main translator.\n\nMilescu's name was assigned to several streets in localities throughout Romania and Moldova, including one in Bucharest named \"Strada Spatărul Nicolae Milescu\", one in Chișinău named \"Strada Nicolae Milescu Spătaru\", one in Constanța named \"Strada Nicolae Milescu\", etc. Also there are scientific and education institutions named in the Milescu's honor, among them a lyceum in Chișinău, \"Liceul Teoretic \"Nicolae Milescu Spătarul\"\", and the \"Association of Scientists of Moldova \"N. Spătaru Milescu\"\". Several busts to Milescu are across Romanian and Moldovan cities. Also in Moldova several stamps with Milescu on them were issued.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58771649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58771649", "title": "Nilotic settlement in East Africa", "text": "Nilotic settlement in East Africa\n\nStarting in the mid-19th century, European anthropologists and later Kenyan historians have been interested in the origins of human migration from various parts of Africa into East Africa. One of the more notable broad based theories emanating from these studies being the Bantu expansion. The main tools of study have been linguistics, archaeology and oral traditions.\n\nThe significance of tracing individual clan histories in order to get an idea of Kalenjin groups formation has been shown by scholars such as B.E. Kipkorir (1978). He argued that the Tugen first settled in small clan groups, fleeing from war, famine and disease, and that they arrived from western, eastern and northern sections. There is even a section among the Tugen that claims to have come from Mount Kenya.\n\nThe Nandi account on the Settlement of Nandi displays a similar manner of occupation of the Nandi territory. The Kalenjin clans that moved into and occupied the Nandi area, thus becoming the Nandi tribe, came from a wide array of Kalenjin speaking areas \n\nIt thus appears that there were spatial core areas to which people moved and concentrated over the centuries, and in the process evolved into the individual Kalenjin communities known today by adopting migrants and assimilating original inhabitants.\n\nA number of historical narratives from the various Kalenjin sub-tribes point to Tulwetab/Tulwop Kony (Mount Elgon) as their original point of settlement in Kenya. This point of origin appears as a central theme in most narratives recorded after the colonial period. One of the more famous accounts states that;\n\n\"..the Kalenjin originated from a country in the north known as Emet ab Burgei, which means, the hot country. The people are said to have traveled southwards passing through Mount Elgon or Tulwet ab Kony in Kalenjin. The Sabaot settled around the slopes of the mountain while the others travelled on in search of better land. The Keiyo and Marakwet settled in Kerio Valley and Cherangani Hills. The Pokot settled on the northern side of Mount Elgon and later spread to areas north of Lake Baringo. At Lake Baringo, the Tugen separated from the Nandi and the Kipsigis. This was during a famine known as Kemeutab Reresik, which means, famine of the bats. It is said that during this famine a bat brought blades of green grass which was taken as a sign of good omen signifying that famine could be averted through movement to greener pastures. The Tugen moved and settled around Tugen Hills while the Kipsigis and the Nandi moved to Rongai area. The Kipsigis and Nandi are said to have lived as a united group for a long time but eventually were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental factors. Some of these were droughts and invasion of the Maasai from Uasin Gishu.\"\n"}

He received a bachelor's degree in Slavic studies at the University of Ljubljana in 1950, and he obtained his doctorate in Rome in 1960. He studied composition in Trieste. As a composer, he primarily wrote chamber music and works for choral ensembles. He wrote the opera \"Kačji pastir\" (The Dragonfly). His professional work involved both music and Slovene studies. In the mid-1960s he started collecting folk songs among ethnic Slovenes living in Italy; this eventually grew into a collection of stories, customs, superstitions, and other folk material that he published in 1976 under the title \"Ljudsko izročilo Slovencev v Italiji\" (Slovene Folk Heritage in Italy). In 2004 he published the book \"1300 primorskih priimkov\" (1,300 Littoral Surnames), which complemented the etymological research of France Bezlaj.

Pine barrens are plant communities that occur on dry, acidic, infertile soils, dominated by grasses, forbs, low shrubs, and small to medium-sized pines. The most extensive barrens occur in large areas of sandy glacial deposits (including outwash plains), lakebeds, and outwash terraces along rivers.\n\nThe most common trees are the jack pine, red pine, pitch pine, blackjack oak, and scrub oak; a scattering of larger oaks is not unusual. The understory includes grasses, sedges, and forbs, many of them common in dry prairies, and rare plants such as the sand-plain gerardia (\"Agalinis acuta\"). Plants of the heath family, such as blueberries and bearberry, and shrubs, such as prairie willow and hazel, are common. These species have adaptations that permit them to survive or regenerate well after fire.\n\nPine barrens support a number of rare species, including Lepidoptera such as the Karner blue butterfly (\"Lycaeides melissa samuelis\") and the barrens buck moth (\"Hemileuca maia\").\n\nBarrens are dependent on fire to prevent invasion by less fire-tolerant species. In the absence of fire, barrens will proceed through successional stages from pine forest to a larger climax forest, such as oak-hickory forest.\n\nEuropean settlers found extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, commonly called \"barrens\". The American Indians used fire to maintain such areas as rangeland. Open barrens are now rare and imperiled globally. Suppression of wildfires has allowed larger climax forest vegetation to take over in most one-time barrens. In North America, the largest natural pine barrens exist primarily in parts of the American Midwest and in dry sandy areas along the East Coast.\n\nJohn McPhee's book, titled \"The Pine Barrens\" (1968), explores the history, ecology, and geography of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. His account is also infused with his personal memoirs. His book contributed to a reappraisal of the ecological role of pine barrens; in New Jersey and on eastern Long Island, they contribute to preserving the amount and quality of vital groundwater supplies in underground aquifers.\n\nThe New Jersey Pine Barrens is the setting of Voltaire's horror novel \"Call of the Jersey Devil\".\n\nSeason 3, episode 11 of \"The Sopranos\", titled \"Pine Barrens\" (airdate May 6, 2001), is purportedly set largely in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, although filming of the forest scenes actually took place in Harriman State Park in New York.\n\n\n"}

He was a product of a local primary school and Minehead Grammar School. Later on, Chorley began studying Geomorphology as an undergraduate at the School of Geography at Oxford. He served with the Royal Engineers from 1946 to 1948 and made it Lieutenant. Afterwards he went up to Exeter College, where he obtained his BA with Honours in 1951. Later in 1954 he also obtained his MA at Oxford University, and in 1974 his Sc.D. at Cambridge University.\n\nAt Oxford he was greatly influenced by R.P. Beckinsale, who advised Chorley to go on to graduate study in the United States. He made a transatlantic move in 1951 as a Fulbright Scholar to Columbia University where he was a graduate student in the Geology Department and explored the quantitative approach to land form evolution. \n\nChorley started his academic career as Instructor in Geography at Columbia University, New York in 1952. In 1954 he moved to Brown University, Providence, USA, where he was appointed Instructor in Geology. In 1957, Chorley needed to return to Britain for family reasons. In 1958 he was appointed a Demonstrator at Cambridge University and proceeded to move rapidly up the university hierarchy with a readership in 1970 and ad hominem chair in 1974.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1978 he also co-directed the Madingley Geography Conferences. In 1964 was appointed British representative to the Commission on Quantitative Techniques of the International Geographical Union, where he was nominated chairman in 1968. In the same year he was also appointed Chairman of the Committee on the Role of Models and Quantitative techniques in Geographical Teaching of the Geographical Association.\n\nAt Cambridge University from 1970 to 1975 Chorley served as Secretary of the Faculty Board of Geography and Geology. In 1972 he was appointed Deputy Head of the Department of Geography, Cambridge University, for the Lent and Michaelmas terms, and from 1984 to 1989 he was Head of the Department of Geography, Cambridge University. In 1990 he was elected Vice-Master, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University.\n\nChorley received a series of Awards and honours, such as:\n\nChorley died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 May 2002 following a heart attack and was buried in Cambridge's Ascension Parish Burial Ground on the 21st; he was survived by his wife, Rosemary, and their two children.\n\nHe is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge. He married Rosemary More in 1965 and they had one son and one daughter. \n\nCambridge had provided the launching pad for Chorley's revolutionary ideas. He rejected the prevailing paradigm of the Davisian cycles of erosion and sought to replace these with a quantitative model-based paradigm with an emphasis on General Systems Theory and numerical modelling. Richard Chorley's negative assessment of Davis theories led Cliff Ollier to state that \"'Davis bashing' was a theme\" for Chorley. \n\nCambridge contained a strong group in physical geography with colleagues that encouraged Chorley's ideas. It also provided a good environment for him to conduct his experiments. Chorley produced volumes of scientific papers in physical geography that codified his approach and allowed him to ask new questions about earth surface processes and ways they can be studied. Central to these was the concept of system dynamics, and his production of \"Physical Geography: A Systems Approach\" (1971) and \"Environmental Systems\" (1978) that influenced a generation of scholars. \n\nChorley's studies ranged into climatology and hydrology where he cooperated with Colorado meteorologist Roger Barry on the text, \"Atmosphere, Weather and Climate\" (1968). Many of his writings were jointly authored or edited, including \"Water, Earth and Man\" (1969). In addition, Chorley launched in 1964 the first of a series of text on \"The History of the Study of Landforms\". Two further volumes were published in 1973 and 1991. At the time of Chorley's death, Volume 4 was nearing completion.\n\nInstead of confining himself to physical geography, Chorley took a broad approach to change in geography as a whole. He did this first through a series of annual summer conferences held at Madingley Hall near Cambridge, where his lectures helped form a basis of a series of volumes (notably \"Models in Geography\", 1967) that influenced the discipline. \n\nThe second was by founding an annual series, \"Progress in Geography\", later converted into two influential quarterly journals, in which changes over the whole discipline could be recorded and assessed.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1821 as the first Geographic Society. Since 1878, its headquarters have been at 184 Boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris. The entrance is marked by two gigantic caryatids representing \"Land\" and \"Sea\". It was here, in 1879, that the construction of the Panama Canal was decided.\n\nThe Geographical Society was founded at a meeting on 15 December 1821 in the Paris Hôtel de Ville. Among its 217 founders were some of the greatest scientific names of the time, including Pierre-Simon Laplace (the Society's first president), Georges Cuvier, Charles Pierre Chapsal, Vivant Denon, Joseph Fourier, Gay-Lussac, Claude Louis Berthollet, Alexander von Humboldt, Champollion, and François-René de Chateaubriand. Most of the men who had accompanied Bonaparte in his Egyptian expedition were members: Edme-François Jomard, Conrad Malte-Brun, Jules Dumont d'Urville, Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert, Hottinguer, Henri Didot, Bottin and others such as Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès.\n\nThe Society was the location of the Arab Congress of 1913, which took place from June 18 to June 23 of that year and marked the confluence of events surrounding the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the beginnings of Arab nationalism, and early Arab reaction to Zionist immigration to Palestine.\n\nThe Society's revue has appeared monthly since 1822, as \"Bulletin de la Société de Géographie\" (1822–1899) — offering in octavo format early news of all the discoveries of the nineteenth century — or quarterly, as \"La Géographie\", with a break in 1940–46. Since 1947 the Society's magazine has appeared three times a year, as \"Acta Geographica\". \n\nThe Society's library, map collection and photograph collection are among the world's deepest and most comprehensive.\n\nThe Grande Médaille d'Or des Explorations et Voyages de Découverte (Great Gold Medal of Exploration and Journeys of Discovery) has been awarded since 1829 for journeys whose outcomes have enhanced geographical knowledge. Notable recipients have been John Franklin (1829), John Ross (1834), David Livingstone (1857), Ernest Shackleton (1910) and Roald Amundsen (1913).\n\n\n"}

Accordingly, its bishopric, which is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees, was a suffragan of Caesarea in Cappadocia, the capital of the province.\n\nThe town is mentioned as Therma by Hierocles (Synecdemus, 699, 2) and is quite probably to be identified with Aquae Sarvenae, which the Tabula Peutingeriana places on the road between Tavium and Caesarea, and with Sarvena, a city described on an inscription and by Ptolemy (V, 6, 12). This would be today Terzili Hammam, a village about 60 miles north of Caesarea, where there are hot mineral sulphur waters, still frequented. A part of the building containing the baths is of Roman construction; a Christian inscription has been found thereon.\n\nDown to the 13th century, the Notitiae episcopatuum describe the see as the first suffragan of Caesarea. Perhaps there was a bishop from the time of St. Basil; in any case four others are mentioned: Firminus, present at the Council of Chalcedon, 451; Photinus, at a Council of Constantinople in 459; Musonius, exiled by Justin I, about 518; Theodore, present at the Sixth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, 681, and at the Council in Trullo, 692,\n"}

Owen, was a Welsh geologist with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the rocks of Wales, ranging from regional stratigraphy and tectonics to geomorphology and marine geology. His research was mainly on the Carboniferous rocks of South Wales.\n\nBorn in Aberdare to a mining family, Dick Owen won a scholarship to Merthyr Tydfil Grammar School and graduated with first class honours in geology from Swansea University in 1939. He carried out his postgraduate studies there for the next two years, researching the structure of the Vale of Neath, and was associated with teaching at the university for a further 35 years.\n\nHis association with Swansea was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served as a meteorological officer in the RAF, rising to the rank of Flight lieutenant. While he was based in the Azores, one of his most memorable experiences was deciding, on meteorological grounds, whether it was suitable for Churchill and Roosevelt to hold their famous meeting in the mid-Atlantic.\n\nHis work on the Vale of Neath was published by the Geological Society in 1954 and was swiftly recognised as a classic. He also wrote and edited a series of papers and books that included \"Geology Explained in South Wales\" and \"The Upper Palaeozoic and Post-Palaeozoic Rocks of Wales\". Owen’s almost cartoon-like geological sketches became his hallmark, and illustrated his profound desire for people of all backgrounds and abilities to appreciate the magnificent geology of his native land.\n\nOwen chaired the South Wales Group of the Geologists’ Association, and an annual T.R. Owen memorial lecture has been instituted in his memory.\n\n\n"}
