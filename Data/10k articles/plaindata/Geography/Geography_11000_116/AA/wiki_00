It then crosses the A14 (where it becomes a primary route) and goes through Isham and Great Harrowden. After this it goes on to form the Wellingborough western bypass before leaving Northamptonshire to cross into the Borough of Milton Keynes (ceremonial Buckinghamshire). From there, it crosses the A428 at a roundabout and cuts through the centre of Olney. South of Olney the road passes Emberton, meeting the A422 just east of Newport Pagnell, where the routes multiplex to form the Newport Pagnell eastern bypass. South of Newport Pagnell, the routes diverge at a roundabout with the A509 turning south and the A422 continuing westbound. Here the A509 is a single carriageway once more until it crosses the M1 at Junction 14, where it enters Milton Keynes proper and multiplexes for a short distance with the A4146 (on separating, the latter takes over the 'primary route' designation and the A509 loses it). Once more a dual carriageway, it runs for a further past the edge of Central Milton Keynes (the central business district) and the Network Rail National Centre (''), to link up finally with the A5. Through Milton Keynes the road is known as the H5 Portway.\n\nDuring 2005 there were two fatal crashes in the same stretch of the road as it passes between Emberton and Petsoe End. This area of the road had become notorious as a black spot for traffic accidents, and residents of Emberton had complained to Milton Keynes Borough Council for a number of years for improvements to the road. In July 2005 local residents met in the village and demanded a speed limit and improvements. These were promised by the Council within six months, but were implemented in September 2006.\n"}

{"id": "39228831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39228831", "title": "Adoption of Chinese literary culture", "text": "Adoption of Chinese literary culture\n\nChinese writing, culture and institutions were imported as a whole by Vietnam, Korea, Japan and other neighbouring states over an extended period.\nChinese Buddhism spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries AD, followed by Confucianism as these countries developed strong central governments modelled on Chinese institutions.\nIn Vietnam and Korea, and for a shorter time in Japan and the Ryukyus, scholar-officials were selected using examinations on the Confucian classics modelled on the Chinese civil service examinations.\nShared familiarity with the Chinese classics and Confucian values provided a common framework for intellectuals and ruling elites across the region.\nAll of this was based on the use of Literary Chinese, which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region.\nAlthough each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature, they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the 19th century.\n\nDuring the 20th century, several Japanese historians grouped these three countries with China as an East Asian cultural realm.\nAccording to , it was characterized by Chinese writing, Mahayana Buddhism in Chinese translation, Confucianism and Chinese legal codes.\nThe concept of an \"East Asian world\" has seen little interest from scholars in the other countries following its appropriation by Japanese militarists in terms such as the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\".\nNishijima is also credited with coining the expressions \"Kanji bunka-ken\" (漢字文化圏, \"Chinese-character culture sphere\") and \"Chūka bunka-ken\" (中華文化圏, \"Chinese culture sphere\"), which were later borrowed into Chinese.\nThe four countries are also referred to as the \"Sinic World\" by some authors.\n\nAt the beginning of the current era, the Chinese script was the only writing system available in East Asia.\nClassical works of the Warring States period and Han dynasty such as the \"Mencius\", the \"Commentary of Zuo\" and Sima Qian's \"Historical Records\" were admired as models of prose style though the ages.\nLater writers sought to emulate the classical style, writing in a form known as Literary Chinese.\nThus the written style, based on the Old Chinese of the classical period, remained largely static as the various varieties of Chinese developed and diverged to become mutually unintelligible, and all distinct from the written form.\nMoreover, in response to phonetic attrition the spoken varieties developed compound words and new syntactic forms.\nIn comparison, the literary language was admired for its terseness and economy of expression, but it was difficult to understand if read aloud, even in the local pronunciation.\nThis divergence is a classic example of diglossia.\n\nAll formal writing in China was done in Literary Chinese until the May Fourth Movement in 1919, after which it was replaced by Written Vernacular Chinese.\nThis new form was based on the vocabulary and grammar of modern Mandarin dialects, particularly the Beijing dialect, and is the written form of Modern Standard Chinese.\nLiterary Chinese persisted for a time in journalism and government, but was replaced there too in the late 1940s.\n\nBuddhism reached China from central Asia in the first century AD, and over the following centuries the Buddhist scriptures were translated into Literary Chinese.\nBuddhist missionaries then spread these texts throughout East Asia, and students of the new religion learned the language of these sacred texts.\n\nThroughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship.\nAlthough Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature.\nChinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThough they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called Sino-Xenic pronunciations, which provide clues to the pronunciation of Middle Chinese.\nChinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.\n\nThus Literary Chinese became the international language of scholarship in East Asia. \nLike Latin in Europe it allowed scholars from different lands to communicate, and provided a stock of roots from which compound technical terms could be created.\nUnlike Latin, Literary Chinese was not used for spoken communication, and lacked the neutrality of Latin, being the language of an extant (and powerful) neighbouring state.\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed.\nBy the 7th century and possibly earlier, woodblock printing had been developed in China.\nAt first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed.\nBy the 13th century, metal movable type used by government printers in Korea, but seems not to have been extensively used in China, Vietnam or Japan.\nAt the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.\n\nThe northern part of Vietnam was occupied by Chinese empires and states for almost all of the period from 111 BC to 938 AD.\nWhen the country achieved independence, it continued to use Literary Chinese.\nAt first Buddhist monks dominated government and scholarship in the country.\nThe earliest extant writings by Vietnamese authors are poems from the late 10th century, in Chinese, by the Buddhist monks Lac Thuan and Khuông Việt.\n\nAfter three short-lived dynasties, the Ly Dynasty (1009–1225) was established with the support of Buddhist clergy, but soon came under increasing Confucian influence.\nA Confucian Temple of Literature was erected in the capital, Hanoi, in 1070.\nCivil service examinations on the Chinese model began in 1075, and in the following year a college was established for training sons of the ruling elite in the Confucian classics.\nThe influence of Confucian literati grew in the following Tran Dynasty (1225–1400) until they had a monopoly on public office, which they kept, almost uninterrupted, until the examination system was abolished by the French colonial administration in 1913.\nDocuments that survive from the early Ly Dynasty include the \"Edict on the Transfer of the Capital\" (to Hanoi) from 1010.\nWhen the Chinese invaded the country in 1076, the general Lý Thường Kiệt wrote a 4-line poem \"Mountains and rivers of the Southern country\".\nHis poem was the first of a series of statements of Vietnamese determination to resist northern invaders, all written in Literary Chinese.\nOthers include a \"Call to the Officers of the Army\" (1285), \"Return to the Capital\" (1288), the \"Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu\" (1428) and an \"Address to the Army\" (1789).\nHistorical annals, beginning with the \"Annals of Đại Việt\", were also written in Chinese, as were poetry and fiction of various kinds.\n\nIn the centuries after independence, Vietnamese authors adapted Chinese characters to produce a script for their own language.\nThis script, called Chữ nôm, was quite complex, and accessible only to those who could read Chinese.\nOver the centuries it became the vehicle for a flourishing vernacular literature, but all formal writing continued to be in Literary Chinese, except during two short-lived attempts at reform.\nWhen Hồ Quý Ly seized the throne in 1400, as well as pursuing a programme of land reform, he sought to break the power of the Confucian literati by making Vietnamese the state language and translating the classics to make them available to all.\nThis was reversed in 1407 after Ming China invaded the country.\nSimilar reforms were attempted by Nguyễn Huệ from 1788, but were again reversed at the beginning of the succeeding Nguyen Dynasty (1802–1945).\nFinally both Literary Chinese and Chữ nôm were replaced by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet in the early 20th century.\n\nVietnamese intellectuals continued to use Literary Chinese into the early 20th century.\nFor example, the nationalist Phan Boi Chau (1867–1940) wrote his \"History of the Loss of Vietnam\" (1905) and other tracts in Literary Chinese, and also used it to communicate when in Japan and China, as he spoke neither Japanese nor Chinese.\n\nChinese was first introduced to Korea in the first century BC, when the Han dynasty invaded the north of the peninsula and established the Four Commanderies.\nBuddhism arrived in Korea from China in the late 4th century, and spread from there to Japan.\nThe Goguryeo kingdom strengthened itself by adopting Chinese institutions, laws and culture, including Buddhism.\nThe influential Korean Buddhist scholar Wonhyo (617–686) wrote extensively in Chinese.\n\nThe use of Literary Chinese grew after the unification of the country by Silla in the late 7th century.\nA national institute (the Gukhak) was set up in 682 to teach the Chinese classics.\nKorean placenames and official titles were changed to Chinese (with Sino-Korean pronunciation), so that they could be used in Literary Chinese.\nCivil service examinations on the Confucian classics were introduced in 958.\n\nDuring the Goryeo period (918–1392), Korean scribes added interlinear annotations known as \"gugyeol\" (\"oral embellishment\") to Chinese texts to allow them to be read in Korean word order with Korean glosses.\nMany of the \"gugyeol\" characters were abbreviated, and some of them are identical in form and value to symbols in the Japanese katakana syllabary, though the historical relationship between the two is not yet clear.\nAn even more subtle method of annotation known as \"gakpil\" (角筆 \"stylus\") was discovered in 2000, consisting of dots and lines made with a stylus.\nAll formal writing, including the official annals of the Korean dynasties and almost all government documents, was done in Chinese until the late 19th century.\nSo too were the works of the Confucian scholars Toegye and Yulgok in the 16th century and Jeong Yak-yong at the end of the 18th.\nSeveral fiction genres were written in Chinese, including romances, beginning with the 15th century \"New Stories from Gold Turtle Mountain\".\nThe \"Eou yadam\" (c. 1600) began a new genre of unofficial histories, which became very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nEarly attempts to write the Korean language used a number of complex and unwieldy systems collectively known as Idu, using Chinese characters both for their meaning and their sound.\nThe Hangul alphabet announced in 1446 brought Korean reading and writing within reach of virtually the entire population.\nKing Sejong's announcement of the new script, \"The Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People\", was itself written in Literary Chinese like most such documents, and described the new letters in terms of Chinese metaphysics.\nAlthough the new script was clearly more efficient, it was limited to informal writing and recording of folk tales until, as part of the Gabo Reform in December 1894, the civil examinations were abolished and government documents were required to be printed in Korean.\nEven then Korean was written with a composite script, with Chinese characters (Hanja) for the Sino-Korean words that now made up over half the vocabulary of the language interspersed with Hangul for native words and suffixes.\nHanja are still taught in schools in both parts of Korea, but fell out of use in North Korea in the late 1940s, and are increasingly rarely used in South Korea.\n\nUnlike Vietnam and Korea, no part of Japan was ever occupied by China.\nChinese writing was brought to Japan by Buddhist missionaries from Korea, probably around the 4th or 5th centuries.\nThe early 8th century histories \"Nihon Shoki\" and \"Kojiki\" credit a scholar called Wani from Baekje with first bringing the Confucian classics to Japan, though many scholars have questioned this account.\nBy 607 Japan had opened direct contacts with Sui dynasty China, continued under the following Tang dynasty, and proceeded to import Chinese language and culture wholesale.\nEven the layout of the Japanese capital of Nara was modelled on the Tang capital Chang'an.\n\nAll formal writing during the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods was done in Literary Chinese.\nThe earliest collection of Chinese poetry by Japanese authors (\"Kanshi\") was the \"Kaifūsō\", compiled in 751.\nA series of \"Six National Histories\" in the Chinese style, covering the period to 887, were written in the Nara and Heian periods.\nA seventh was begun but abandoned in the 10th century.\nThe \"Ritsuryō\" (757) and \"Engi shiki\" (927) were legal codes on the Chinese model.\nAs Japanese is very different from Chinese, with inflections and different word order, Japanese scholars developed \"kanbun kundoku\", an elaborate method of annotating Literary Chinese so that it could be re-arranged and read as Japanese.\n\nThere had been experiments with adapting Chinese characters to write Japanese since the 7th century, and by the early 10th century these had been simplified to the kana syllabaries still in use today.\nHowever Chinese had such prestige in the Heian period that only women and low-status men wrote in Japanese.\nAs a result, court women produced much of the Japanese-language fiction of the period, with the most famous being the \"Tale of Genji\".\n\nAround 700, an imperial academy (the Daigaku-ryō) was founded to train the sons of the aristocracy in Chinese and the classics and to administer the first stage of civil service examinations.\nIt flourished in the 9th century but went into decline in the 10th, as the central bureaucracy and use of Chinese faded away.\nBy 1135 the site was overgrown; the buildings were destroyed in the great fire of 1177.\nBy the 13th century knowledge of Literary Chinese had become so limited that the government had to delegate official writing, including correspondence before the unsuccessful Mongol invasions of Japan, to the Buddhist clergy.\n\nThe re-establishment of strong central government by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1600 was followed by a revival of Confucianism.\nLiterary Chinese remained the preferred medium for formal writing until the late 19th century.\nA style mixing Chinese and Japanese elements (\"sōrōbun\") was derived from the medieval \"hentai-kanbun\" (\"variant Chinese writing\") used in such works as the historical chronicle \"Azuma Kagami\" (1266).\nIt was used during the Meiji period, and as late as the end of the Second World War, by men for diaries and correspondence, and for various public notices.\nBoth have since been replaced by writing in Japanese, using a script combining Chinese characters (Kanji) and kana syllabaries.\n\nIn the Tang period, other neighbouring states adopted Chinese culture and institutions, including using Chinese as the written language of administration, both to cultivate good relations with China and to strengthen their own administrations.\nThe kingdom of Balhae, established in northern Korea and eastern Manchuria in 698, followed its southern neighbour Silla in establishing a Chinese-style administration.\nDuring the reign of King Mun (737–793), the state imported Chinese literary culture and institutions wholesale.\nSimilarly, the kingdom of Nanzhao to the southwest used Chinese as the language of administration and adopted Tang laws and procedures.\nBy adopting Chinese institutions, these states became stronger and more stable than their predecessors.\nThey observed the formalities of tribute to the Tang, but functioned as independent states.\n\nIn the late 14th century, the three principalities on Okinawa opened relations with Ming China.\nIn 1393, a community of clerks and craftsmen from Fujian was established at Kume, near the port of Naha in the central kingdom of Chūzan.\nThe clerks taught the Chinese written language, and served the government in its relations with China.\nFrom the late 14th century, selected sons of the nobility of Chūzan, and later the unified Ryukyu Kingdom, were sent to the Guozijian in the Ming capital to study the Chinese classics.\nOn their return they would occupy high offices in the government.\nLocal forms of examination in the Chinese classics were also used to select candidates for high office.\nHowever, by the 17th century Japanese influence had become predominant, and the use of Chinese was limited and artificial.\nBy the mid-19th century, the Kume school teaching the Chinese classics had been overshadowed as an educator of future administrators by an academy in the capital of Shuri teaching in Japanese.\n\n"}

It seeks to enhance Australians’ knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the nation’s early history, beginning in 1606 with the voyages of Willem Janszoon in the \"Duyfken\" and Luis Váez de Torres in \"Los Tres Reyes\" and \"San Pedro\", and continuing to the present.\n\nAustralia on the Map Division of the Australasian Hydrographic Society is the successor organisation to Australia on the Map: 1606–2006. Australia on the Map: 1606–2006 was formed by Peter Reynders and Rupert Gerritsen in 2002 as the vehicle for fostering commemorations in 2006 of the 400th anniversary of the charting of west Cape York, the first documented visit to Australia by Europeans, and Torres' voyage through Torres Strait shortly after.\n\nA national organisation was formed, its Patron was initially Hon. Kim Beazley AC, and subsequently Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie AO RANR, former Chief of Navy.\n\nIn 2006 in excess of 150 commemorative events occurred nationwide, the feature being a commemorative voyage along the west, south and east coasts of continental Australia, and Tasmania by the \"Duyfken\" replica.\n\nAt the conclusion of 2006 those involved in Australia on the Map: 1606–2006 came to the realisation that there were significant limitations to Australian’s knowledge of their early history. It was recognised that there needed to be ongoing education and awareness raising of the Australian community to overcome this limitation. At the same time the Australasian Hydrographic Society saw a need for greater awareness of hydrographic history and heritage among its members and stakeholders. Consequently, they invited those involved in Australia on the Map: 1606–2006 to form a new history and heritage ‘region’, to be known as Australia on the Map Division.\n\nIn April 2007 Australia on the Map: 1606–2006 was formally wound up. Shortly after the Australia on the Map Division was formed and became part of the Australasian Hydrographic Society structure.\n\nBased on its Vision, of seeking “to enhance Australians’ knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the nation’s early history,” the Australia on the Map Division developed a number of broad aims. These are to:\n\n• Focus on the period from 1606 onwards.\n\n• Give due recognition to all relevant navigators of all nationalities in the mapping of the Australian coast.\n\n• Ensure important landmarks are commemorated take place on a nation-wide basis and occurs in all states and territories.\n\n• Have strong community involvement, engaging, as far as possible all Australians, regardless of age, creed, gender, socio-economic group or ethnicity.\n\n• Highlight the mariners’ contacts with the land and between them and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, as well as the historical and cultural implications of those contacts.\n\nThe Australia on the Map Division is a voluntary organisation which engages in a range of activities to promote its vision and aims in the areas of Commemorative Infrastructure, Commemorative Events, Heritage Projects, Research Projects, Research Promotion, Education Projects, (Curriculum and Capacity, Publicity and Promotion) and Strategic Activities.\n\nThe Australia on the Map Division website is an important educational tool for the organisation. It features what is known as the “Landings List”, which provides a brief entry on every episode of contact and other significant cartographic developments from 1606 to 1814. It also carries the only online translation of the original 1602 VOC Charter of the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC - Dutch East India Company), developed as a result research project.\n\nThe Australia on the Map Division had significant input into the process of the development of a National Education Curriculum. Through its Publicity and Promotion activities the Australia on the Map Division has help to facilitate one documentary, and is assisting a number of other documentaries in development.\n\nCommemorative Infrastructure being promoted by the Australia on the Map Division includes the concepts an Explorers Commemorative Area in the Parliamentary Triangle in Canberra and a National Events Corporation. Research Projects undertaken by the Australia on the Map Division include the online translation of the VOC Charter and the current Search for the Deadwater Wreck.\n\nAustralia on the Map endeavours to foster commemorations of significant landmarks in early Australian history. In 2011 it promoted the 200th anniversary of the publication of the first full map of Australia in 1811 by Louis de Freycinet.\n\nThe resulted in special exhibitions at the State Library of New South Wales, and numerous papers being given at various conferences and published in journals. Two events were highlights of the commemorations. The first was a presentation by Henry de Freycinet, the last male descendant of the de Freycinet family, of a signed copy of the original map to the Governor-General of Australia, Ms Quentin Bryce on 16 June 2011.\n\nThe second was a symposium, The Freycinet Map of 1811 – 200th Anniversary of the Publication of the First Map of Australia, held at the National Library of Australia on 19 June 2011. This event involved close collaboration between the Australia on the Map Division, the National Library of Australia and the French Embassy and was addressed by the most eminent French scholars in Australia.\n\nAustralia on the Map has already been engaged in preparations for commemorations in coming years. Plans were made to mark the 300th anniversary in 2012 of the sinking of the \"Zuytdorp\" on the coast of Western Australia in 1712. Australia on the Map has also been promoting the concept of “Naming Australia/Nommer l’Australie” as a commemorative theme for the 200th anniversary of the publication of Matthew Flinders’ 1814 map of Australia, \"Terra Australis or Australia\". Finally, the Australia on the Map Division began preliminary planning, in conjunction with other stakeholders, to develop commemorations in 2016 to mark the first European contact with the west coast of Australia by the visit of Dirk Hartog in the \"Eendracht\" in 1616. It was on this historic occasion that Hartog left the famous Hartog Plate.\n\nReynders, P. and Gerritsen, R. \"2006:The Commemoration of the 400th Anniversary of the 'Discovery' of Australia: A Report on Workshop, Held in the Friends Lounge, National Library of Australia 3 October 2002.\" Canberra: National Initiative Working Group, 2002\n\nReynders, P.

It is so named because it suggests the ridges on the surface of the human brain. Wide ridges are called \"closed-cell\" brain terrain, and the less common narrow ridges are called \"open-cell\" brain terrain. It is thought that the wide closed-cell terrain contains a core of ice, and when the ice disappears the center of the wide ridge collapses to produce the narrow ridges of the open-cell brain terrain. Shadow measurements from HiRISE indicate the ridges are 4-5 meters high. Brain terrain has been observed to form from what has been called an \"Upper Plains Unit.\" The process begins with the formation of stress cracks. The upper plains unit fell from the sky as snow and as ice coated dust.\n\nToday it is widely accepted that glacier-like forms, lobate debris aprons, lineated valley fill, and concentric fill are all related in that they have the same surface texture. Glacier-like forms in valleys and cirque-like alcoves may coalesce with others to produce lobate debris aprons. When opposing lobate debris aprons converge, linear valley fill results. They probably all contain ice-rich material.\n\nMany of these features are found in the Northern hemisphere in parts of a boundary called the Martian dichotomy, mostly between 0 and 70 E longitudes. Near this area are regions that are named from ancient places: Deuteronilus Mensae, Protonilus Mensae, and Nilosyrtis Mensae.\n\nLobate debris aprons, lineated valley fill, and concentric fill probably have dirt and rock debris covering huge deposits of ice.\n\n"}
{"id": "16825204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16825204", "title": "Brittia", "text": "Brittia\n\nBrittia (), according to Procopius, was an island known to the inhabitants of the Low Countries under Frankish rule (viz. the North Sea coast of Austrasia), corresponding both to a real island used for burial and a mythological Isle of the Blessed, to which the souls of the dead are transported.\n\nProcopius's Brittia lies no farther than 200 stadia (25 miles) from the mainland, opposite the mouth of the Rhine but between the islands of \"Brettania\" and legendary Thule, and three nations live in it, \"Angiloi, Phrissones\" and \"Brittones\", that is, Angles, Frisians and Britons. Procopius mentions a wall in Brittia, which he distinguishes from \"Bretannia\", however, and fertile lands. \"It is perhaps only the apparently authentic combinations of names, Angles, Frisians and Britons, which demands hard attention to this interlude in serious Byzantine discussions of the Gothic wars,\" H. R. Loyn warns.\n\nProcopius relates that\n\nThey imagine that the souls of the dead are transported to that island. On the coast of the continent there dwell under Frankish sovereignty, but hitherto exempt from all taxation, fishers and farmers, whose duty it is to ferry the souls over. This duty they take in turn. Those to whom it falls on any night, go to bed at dusk; at midnight they hear a knocking at their door, and muffled voices calling. Immediately they rise, go to the shore, and there see empty boats, not their own but strange ones, they go on board and seize the oars. When the boat is under way, they perceive that she is laden choke-full, with her gunwales hardly a finger's breadth above water. Yet they see no one, and in an hour's time they touch land, which one of their own craft would take a day and a night to do. Arrived at Brittia, the boat speedily unloads, and becomes so light that she only dips her keel in the wave. Neither on the voyage nor at landing do they see any one, but they hear a voice loudly asking each one his name and country. Women that have crossed give their husbands' names.\n\n\"A garbled account\", observed Loyn \"possibly an echo of a report by a Frankish ambassador or an Angle in the ambassador's entourage\".\n\nPursuing geographical accuracy beyond the capacity of Procopius himself, there have been suggestions as to at which point exactly these boats left the Gallic coast, Villemarqué placing it near Raz, Armorica, where there is a toponym \"baie des âmes\"/\"boé an anaon\" \"bay of souls\".\n\nJacob Grimm reports that on the river Tréguier in Brittany, in the commune Plouguel, it is \"said to be the custom to this day, to convey the dead to the churchyard in a boat, over a small arm of the sea called \"passage de l'enfer\", instead of taking the shorter way by land\".\n\nProcopius's account is repeated by John Tzetzes in the 12th century; but long before that, Claudian at the beginning of the 5th had heard of those Gallic shores as a trysting place of flitting ghosts.\n\nand not far from that region are Britain, the land of the Senones, and the Rhine. Grimm compares this account to the airy wagon of the Bretons, and to bardic traditions which make out that souls, to reach the underworld, must sail over the pool of dread and of dead bones, across the vale of death, into the sea on whose shore stands open the mouth of hell's abyss.\n\nThe name may arise from the Breton name of Brittany, \"Breizh\".\n\n"}

It consisted of three groups of surveys:\n\n\nThe Ohio River Base consisted of the Congress Lands East of Scioto River, and Congress Lands North of Old Seven Ranges. These surveys had vertical rows of six mile square townships called Ranges. These ranges were numbered from Ellicott’s Line, the boundary between Ohio and Pennsylvania, also known as the Eastern Ohio Meridian. The townships within each range were surveyed north and south from the baseline called the “Geographer’s Line” at 40 degrees 38 minutes north, which runs west from the north bank of the Ohio River where it exits Pennsylvania, at a place now called the Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey. The townships were not numbered from the baseline, but from south to north beginning with the first partial township in each range formed next to the Ohio River. Thus, townships in adjacent ranges rarely had the same number. This system extended the original numbering plan from the Seven Ranges. There being no east ranges or south townships, plats are designated “Township X of Range Y of Ohio River Survey” with no need for north or west designations. Surveys on the Ohio River Base also consist of the Ohio Company and the Seven Ranges. The Seven Ranges were sold in the same manner, and could be considered Congress Lands, but get a special category to itself.\n\nThe Congress Lands West of Miami River consists of lands between the Great Miami River and Indiana, and south of the Greenville Treaty Line. Ranges are designated as east of the First Principal Meridian which is at the Ohio-Indiana border. Townships are numbered from south to north, with irregularities caused by the course of the Great Miami River.\n\nCongress Lands in northwest Ohio consist of North and East of the First Principal Meridian and South and East of the First Principal Meridian. These lands are south of a narrow strip next to the Michigan border, west of the Firelands and the Congress Lands North of Old Seven Ranges, North of the Greenville Treaty Line and the Virginia Military District, and east of Indiana. Townships are surveyed north and south from the baseline at 41 degrees north, and are designated “Township X N, Range Y E of First Principal Meridian” or “Township X S, Range Y E of First Principal Meridian”.\n\nIn all five of Ohio’s Congress Lands, townships are divided into 36 one mile square sections. These sections are numbered by the method established May 18, 1796. Section sixteen of each survey township was set aside for support of public schools.\n\nLands that were not dispersed in the United States Military District or the Refugee Tract were made available for sale through the various Land Offices, and treated the same as Congress Lands.\n\n\n\n"}

The Transdanubian Mid-Mountain Range occupies a small area in the south, forming the basement rocks of the Danube Basin. The Eastern Alps-Western Carpathian boundary runs through Slovakia.\n\nIn the Paleogene, at the beginning of the Cenozoic, a marine transgression flooded the region from the vicinity of the Flysch Belt into the area of the Central West Carpathians. Paleogene sediments are found in the Orava, Liptov, Spiš, Zilina and Podhale depressions. In the Peri Klippen Zone, sedimentation began in the Paleocene, such as the Kambühel Limestone. Conglomerate is common as the bottom strata, overlain by flysch. At the edge of the subducting Flysch Belt, sedimentary rocks are up to four kilometers thick. Central Carpathian rocks are not folded. \n\nMolasse deposits laid down in the Oligocene span into southern Slovakia from the Pannonian Basin in Hungary. The back-arc molasse formed several large basins, including the Vienna Basin, Danube Basin, South Slovak Basin and East Slovak Basin in the Neogene (the Danuba, South Slovak and East Slovak are all subdivisions of the Pannonian Basin). The basins are filled with the sediments associated with the Paratethys Ocean, up to five kilometers thick. Marl is particularly common, intercalated with sandstone, tuff, conglomerate and algal limestone. Sediments became brackish over time as the Paratethys was isolated from the rest of the world's oceans. Overall, the basins are split up by numerous faults and small grabens, such as the Turiec Basin, Ziar Basin and Orava Basin filled with lake sediments. \n\nThere was limited volcanic activity in the Cenozoic, including a swarm of andesite dikes in the Outer Carpathians. Geophysical research and boreholes have shed light buried volcanic rocks in the southwest Danube Basin and volcanic rocks are found throughout the Central Western Carpathians and eastern Slovakia. \n\nPeat, eolian wind-blown sands, fluvial sand and gravel and loess are all typical Quaternary sediments, formed in the past 2.5 million years old and dominating the surface of Slovak lowlands. The Váh River has up to seven terraces of sand and gravel. Travertine is also common, including travertine which preserved a cranial mold of a Neanderthal from Gánovce. Moraine formations remain in the high mountains from the Pleistocene glaciations. \n\nThe moderately metamorphosed Spišsko-gemerské rudohorie hosts veins of siderite, chalcopyrite and tetrahydrite along with the Veitsch-type magnesite, and the Kremnica-Štiavnica Mountains have polymettalic lead, zinc, copper, gold and silver veins. Permian rocks often hold uranium ore. Halite is found in the Neogene East Slovak Basin and brown coal is extracted from both the Handlová-Nováky Basin and the Modrý Kameň-Potor Basin. There are small deposits of natural gas and oil in the Neogene strata of the Vienna Basin together with older Triassic rocks. \n"}
{"id": "57582110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57582110", "title": "Geology of Somalia", "text": "Geology of Somalia\n\nThe geology of Somalia is built on more than 700 million year old igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rock, which outcrops at some places in northern Somalia. These ancient units are covered in thick layers of sedimentary rock formed in the last 200 million years and influenced by the rifting apart of the Somali Plate and the Arabian Plate. The geology of Somaliland, the de facto independent country in northern Somalia, is to some degree better studied than that of Somalia as a whole. Instability related to the Somali Civil War and previous political upheaval has limited geologic research in places while heightening the importance of groundwater resources for vulnerable populations. \n\nThe oldest rock units in Somalia date back over 700 million years to the Proterozoic, forming the crystalline basement rock of northern Somalia. Many rock units date to the Mesozoic and the current Cenozoic eons. \n\nNorthern Somalia preserves the best examples of Proterozoic rocks. As basement rocks, they form a composite terrane, with younger rocks in the east and older rocks in the west. The older rocks pre-date the Pan-African orogeny and were affected by both igneous and metamorphic activity 840, 800 to 760 and 720 million years ago. \n\nThe early geology of Somalia is divided into four major events. The Qabri Bahar Complex formed in the Paleoproterozoic through the Mesoproterozoic with mafic and granitoid units, as well as rocks metamorphosed to granulite grade (part of the concept of metamorphic facies). Some geologists propose that the Qabri Bahar complex may preserve rocks from before the Pan-African orogeny. Major Event II, more than 700 million years ago, marked deformation, partial melting (also known as anataxis and rocks metamorphosed up to amphibolite grade. \n\nMajor Event III happened 700 to 640 million years ago, bringing crustal thinning and extension, mafic volcanism in the Abdulkadir complex and Mait complex, regional heating, metamorphism and the emplacement of gabbro and syenite through the thinned crust. Major Event IV continued for 100 million years, from 600 to 500 million years ago, spanning into the Paleozoic Era of the Phanerozoic Eon. Granites were emplaced and the deposition of the low-grade, metasedimentary Inda Ad sequence occurred, followed by more deformation and regional heating. \n\nThe sequence of events in Somalia in the Proterozoic are correlated with the Arabian-Nubian Shield to the north, which experienced igneous activity related to subduction and witnessed the formation of marginal basins and island arcs. \n\nIn the Early Jurassic, the supercontinent Gondwana, which included Africa, began to break apart. The marine transgression of the Tethys Ocean flooded large parts of East Africa and Arabia and new sedimentary rock units were deposited. In the west of Somalia, the Cretaceous at the end of the Mesozoic brought crustal upwarping, which is preserved in the Yesomma Sandstone. \n\nTwo major sedimentary basins began to form in Somalia during the Mesozoic, the Somali Coastal Basin and the Luuq-Mandera Basin, both filled with up to five kilometers of sedimentary rock. The basins formed due to the movements of India, Madagascar and East Africa and the opening of the Indian Ocean. Research on the basins came out of geophysical surveys in search of oil. Much of the seven kilometers of sedimentary rock in the Somali Coastal Basin was laid down in Jurassic and Cretaceous. In the Luuq-Mandera Basin, oil exploration found Late Triassic to Early Jurassic clastic sediments, evaporite and carbonate deposits, overlain by shales from the Tethys marine transgression. The Late Jurassic through the Cretaceous left marl and ammonite fossils, from an open sea environment, followed by shales and belemnite fossils from an epicontinental sea. \n\nThe two basins are separated by the Bur Region, where crystalline basement rock from the Proterozoic comes close to the surface. In the Bur Region, basement rock only outcrops as a few small hills. Even though the region covers 30,000 square kilometers, most basement rock remains hidden by one to 30 meters of recently eroded and unconsolidated sediments. \n\nGeologic research has found that there are two rock units in the Bur Region, the Olontole Complex and Dinsor Complex. The Olontole Complex includes gneiss, migmatite, granulite facies amphibolite and quartzite, cross-cut by bodies of granitoid rock. The Dinsor Complex consists of metapsammite and metapelite, migmatite, iron-rich quartzite and marble. Rubidium-strontium dating indicates that the young granites and granitoids date to the Paleozoic. \n\nSedimentation continued in the Cenozoic. Deposition of the Yesomma Sandstone continued until another regional marine transgression in the Middle Eocene. The opening of the Gulf of Aden and the uplift of the Somali Plateau created brackish basins, which filled with marine deposits in the Miocene and Oligocene. Outcrops of these rock units are limited to a few coastal areas in Somalia, but rapid faulting created offshore basins with up to two kilometers of sediments from the late Cenozoic.\n\nBoth the Luuq-Mandera Basin and the Somali Coastal Basin continued to fill with a mix of clastic sediments, marl and carbonates. Since the Late Cretaceous, uplift in these basins created lake depressions and formed the Jubba valley. \n\nThe formation of the Somali Plate began 60 million years ago and accelerated at the end of the Oligocene, approximately 23 million years ago. As the Arabian Plate and Somali Plate rifted apart, forming the Gulf of Aden through sea floor spreading in the Late Miocene, magma intruded between the two plates. \n\nAt least 287 springs have been found in northern Somalia, where they are more common in karst aquifers. Ninety-five percent of Somalis get their drinking water from aquifers, although poor quality water often means that boreholes go abandoned. \n\nThe Eocene Karkar limestone, Auradu limestone and Taalex limestone are important karstic aquifers in Somaliland and Puntland, along with thick, unconsolidated sediment aquifers up to 100 meters thick formed in the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary in wadi locations throughout the county. Fractured Pleistocene basalt flows, particularly near Las Dhure and Agabar have potential as aquifers. The Yesomma Sandstone in northern Somalia is a high productivity aquifer, but sandstones in the south remain poorly studied for groundwater potential. \n\nFourteen water utilities serve towns in Somaliland and Puntland, although at least 750,000 people on the outskirts of Hargeisa lack piped water. \n\nMining is not a significant part of the economy of Somalia,with little extraction aside from sand, gravel and stone for construction. Small amounts of gypsum, limestone, sea salt and sepiolite were mined during the instability brought on by the ongoing Somali Civil War, although the conflict halted oil exploration which had taken place in the 1980s. \n"}
{"id": "7017612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7017612", "title": "German Fountain", "text": "German Fountain\n\nThe German Fountain ( ) is a gazebo styled fountain in the northern end of old hippodrome (Sultanahmet Square), Istanbul, Turkey and across from the Mausoleum of Sultan Ahmed I. It was constructed to commemorate the second anniversary of German Emperor Wilhelm II's visit to Istanbul in 1898. It was built in Germany, then transported piece by piece and assembled in its current site in 1900. The neo-Byzantine style fountain's octagonal dome has eight marble columns, and dome's interior is covered with golden mosaics.\n\nThe idea of Great Palace of Constantinople's Empire Lodge (Kathisma) being on the site of the German Fountain's, conflicts with the view that Carceres Gates of Hippodrome was found on the site of the fountain however, the hypothesis of Carceres Gates being on the site enforces the view that Quadriga of Lysippos was used to stand on the site of the German Fountain.\n\nDuring his reign as German Emperor and King of Prussia, Wilhelm II visited several European and Eastern countries. His trip started in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire on 18 October 1898 during the reign of Abdülhamid II. According to Peter Hopkirk, the visit to Ottoman Empire was an ego trip and also had long-term motivations: The Emperor's primary motivation for visiting was to construct the Baghdad Railway, which would run from Berlin to the Persian Gulf, and would further connect to British India through Persia. This railway could provide a short and quick route from Europe to Asia, and could carry German exports, troops and artillery. At the time, the Ottoman Empire could not afford such a railway, and Abdülhamid II was grateful to Wilhelm's offer, but was suspicious over the German motives. Abdülhamid II's secret service believed that German archeologists in the Emperor's retinue were in fact geologists with designs on the oil wealth of the Ottoman empire. Later, the secret service uncovered a German report, which noted that the oilfields in Mosul, northern Mesopotamia were richer than that in the Caucuses. In his first visit, Wilhelm secured the sale of German-made rifles to Ottoman Army, and in his second visit he secured a promise for German companies to construct the Istanbul-Baghdad railway. The German Government constructed the German Fountain for Wilhelm II and Empress Augusta's 1898 Istanbul visit. According to Afife Batur, the fountain's plans were drawn by architect Spitta and constructed by architect Schoele, also German architect Carlitzik and Italian architect Joseph Anthony worked on this project.\n\nAccording to the Ottoman inscription, the fountain's construction started in the Hejira 1319 (1898–1899), although inauguration of fountain was planned to take place on 1 September 1900 - the 25th anniversary of Abdülhamid II's ascension to the throne. Construction, however, could not finish at the planned time and it was instead inaugurated on 27 January 1901 which was Wilhelm II's birthdate. Marble, stone and gem parts of the fountain were constructed in Germany and transported piece by piece to Istanbul by ships.\n\nThe German Fountain was constructed on the site where there was a tree which is known as Vakvak Tree () or The Bloody Plane (). In the 1656 janissary rebellion, Mehmed IV yielded a number of officials to the demands of the rebels and these victims, when killed, were suspended on the Plane in the Hippodrome. Boynuyaralı Mehmed Pasha overcame this rebellion, which took two months and named Vak'a-i Vakvakiye, after becoming Grand Vizier. The plane named after Seçere-i Vakvak (Vakvak Tree) which believed to be in Jahannam and its fruits are human heads.\n\nThe neo-Byzantine style octagonal fountain stands on a base with eight steps rising up to an entry gate. There are seven brass fountain spouts over basins on the remaining sides, and over the central reservoir there is a dome supported by eight porphyry columns. The fountain's central reservoir stands on a mosaic-tiled platform and surmounted with the bronze dome, which is raised on carved marble arches. There are eight monograms in the arch stonework and they represent the political union of Abdülhamid II and Wilhelm. In four of these medallions, Abdülhamid II's tughra is written on green background, and in other four Wilhelm's symbol \"W\" is written on a Prussian blue background. Also, over \"W\" there is a crown and below it a \"II\" is written. The fountain was surrounded with a bronze fence, but unfortunately this has been lost. The outside of the dome is ornately patterned bronze; the dome's ceiling is decorated with golden mosaics and again with Abdülhamid II's tughra and Wilhelm II's symbol.\n\nThe bronze inscription on the reservoir, which was written in German, reads \"Wilhelm II Deutscher Kaiser stiftete diesen Brunnen in dankbarer Erinnerung an seinen Besuch bei Seiner Maiestaet [sic] dem Kaiser der Osmanen Abdul Hamid II im Herbst des Jahres 1898\" meaning \"German Kaiser Wilhelm II endowed this fountain, in thankful remembrance of his visit in 1898 autumn, to the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II\". There is also an Ottoman inscription in the arch of fountain, Undersecretary of Seraskery Ahmet Muhtar Bey's eight couplet history verse is written by Hattat İzzet Efendi. The poem commemorates the construction of the fountain for Wilhelm II's visit to Istanbul.\n\nThe German fountain was the site of a terrorist bombing which killed 13 people (12 of them German) and injured many more on the twelfth of January 2016.\n\n\n"}

During spring time, the waterfall reaches a height of over 130 meters, which makes it the highest in Macedonia. The state border intersects the higher peak, Great Korab.\n\nAscent from the Macedonian side involves entering the Republic of Macedonian-Albanian boundary area, for which a special permit is required from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia, although people regularly track on Korab without it.\n\nThe two main passes in the Korab ridge include the Little Korab Gate and Big Korab Gate\n\nThe mountain has a number of sub-peaks that are higher than 2000 metres. These include Korab II (unnamed peak) , Korab III (unnamed peak) , Korab Gates (peak) , Maja e Moravës , Shulani i Radomirës and Small Korab .\n\nThere are no formal restrictions on climbing the mountain from the Albanian side. The area is now safer and more stable than it has been in recent times. It is possible to drive as far as the local village of Radomira, but the local infrastructure is generally not good. A four-wheel drive vehicle with high clearance may be required. There are no accurate and up to date maps, local signposting is poor, and hikers may have to overcome the additional problem of aggressive dogs. An international expedition to climb Mount Korab is organized each September by the mountain club PSD \"Korab\" in Skopje.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "158951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158951", "title": "New Urbanism", "text": "New Urbanism\n\nNew Urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies.\n\nNew Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD). These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.\n\nThe organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the \"Charter of the New Urbanism\", which begins:\n\nNew Urbanists support: regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl. The \"Charter of the New Urbanism\" also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the re-development of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.\n\nArchitecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern, or vernacular styles, although that is not always the case.\n\nUntil the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car. Specifically, after World War II urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency.\n\nThis new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after World War II and became known as \"conventional suburban development\" or pejoratively as urban sprawl. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared.\n\nAlthough New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the modernist planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian Lewis Mumford criticized the \"anti-urban\" development of post-war America. \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities,\" written by Jane Jacobs in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the \"norm\". The French architect François Spoerry has developed in the 60's the concept of \"soft architecture\" that he applied to Port Grimaud, a new marina in south of France. The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like Port Liberté in New Jersey or Le Plessis Robisson in France.\n\nRooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the \"European\" city proposed by architect Leon Krier, and the pattern language theories of Christopher Alexander. The term \"new urbanism\" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.\n\nIn 1991, the Local Government Commission, a private nonprofit group in Sacramento, California, invited architects Peter Calthorpe, Michael Corbett, Andrés Duany, Elizabeth Moule, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Stefanos Polyzoides, and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the \"Ahwahnee Principles\" (after Yosemite National Park's Ahwahnee Hotel), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.\n\nCalthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities.\n\nIn 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are \"a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world\". They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a \"culture of permanence\". \n\nNew Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.\n\nAndrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the Victorian neighborhoods of New Haven, Connecticut. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:\n\n\nSeveral terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the \"new\" moniker. The term \"Walkable Urbanism\" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger. Many debate whether Smart Growth and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term Sustainable development is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the United Nations and Agenda 21 to include human development issues (e.g., developing country) that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or Sustainable Urbanism. The term \"livability\" or \"livable communities\" was popular under the Obama administration, though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the Local Government Commission.\n\nPlanning magazine discussed the proliferation of \"urbanisms\" in an article in 2011 titled \"A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms\". Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including Sustainable Urbanism and Tactical Urbanism (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide. In 2011 Andres Duany authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design. In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder Andres Duany began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.\n\nOther terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski, Ecological Urbanism, and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. Landscape urbanism was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University. \"Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents\", edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism. Michael E. Arth promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the New Pedestrianism, which is intended to be more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 planned community in Radburn, New Jersey.\n\nThe primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions. CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:\n\n\nThe CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.\n\nThe CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters. By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more. , Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.\n\nWhile the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU), the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.\n\nBy 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the Savannah College of Art and Design, University of Georgia, University of Notre Dame, and the University of Miami. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a \"Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists\". The Next Generation of New Urbanists held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first Tactical Urbanism Guide.\n\nThe CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the \"New Urban News\" and the \"New Town Paper\". Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment. Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as INTBAU, A Vision of Europe, and others.\n\nThe CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of Smart Growth also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the United States Green Building Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop the LEED for Neighborhood Development standards, and with the Institute of Transportation Engineers to develop a Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS) Design manual.\n\nThe New Urbanism Film Festival was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film \"Urbanized\" by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States.\n\nThe 2004 documentary \"The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream\" argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawl-type development. \"\", a feature length 2008 documentary about urban designer Michael E. Arth, explains the principles of his New Pedestrianism, a more ecological and pedestrian-oriented version of New Urbanism. The film also gives a brief history of New Urbanism, and chronicles the rebuilding of an inner city slum into a model of New Pedestrianism and New Urbanism called The Garden District.\n\nNew Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the political spectrum. It has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.\n\nJournalist Alex Marshall has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans. In a 1996 article in Metropolis Magazine, Marshall denounced New Urbanism as \"a grand fraud\". The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the \"Washington Post\" in September of the same year, and in Marshall's first book, \"How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken\"\n\nCritics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence. Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments, but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.\n\nSome parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that \"communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car\". Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of car-free developments. Michael E Arth proposes new pedestrianism as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths. Steve Melia proposes the idea of \"filtered permeability\" (see Permeability (spatial and transport planning)) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.\n\nIn response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, LEED-ND, was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Congress for the New Urbanism, to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design. New Urbanist and board member of CNU, Doug Farr has taken a step further and coined Sustainable Urbanism, which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.\n\nNew Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, \"instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves\". It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.\n\nNew Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region. Miami, Florida, has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.\n\nMore than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of \"smart growth\" legislation.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money.\n\nIn 2010 University Place in Memphis became the second only U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood. LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism and green building and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. University Place, developed by McCormack Baron Salazar, is a 405-unit, 30-acre, mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, HOPE VI grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.\n\nThe Cotton District in Starkville, Mississippi, was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized. The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill.\n\nSeaside, Florida, the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on eighty acres (324,000 m²) of Florida Panhandle coastline. It was featured on the cover of the Atlantic Monthly in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.\n\nSeaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie \"The Truman Show\". Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than a million dollars, and some houses top $5 million.\n\nThe Mueller Community is located on the 700 acre site of the former Robert Mueller Municipal Airport in Austin, Texas, which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000 square feet of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140 acres of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program.\n\nThe site of the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver and Aurora, Colorado, closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by Forest City Enterprises. Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools and 2 million square feet (180,000 m²) of retail. Construction began in 2001. Northfield Stapleton, one of the development's major retail centers, recently opened.\n\nIn 1997 San Antonio, Texas, as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development, Commercial Center Development, Office or Institutional Campus Development, Commercial Retrofit Development, Tradition Neighborhood Development, Transit Oriented Development. Each district has specific standards and design regulation. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.\n\nMountain House, one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near Tracy, California. Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future train station, transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House.\n\nMesa del Sol, New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect Peter Calthorpe, and is being developed by Forest City Enterprises. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a downtown that would provide a twin city within Albuquerque.\n\nLocated in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, I'On is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of Charleston, South Carolina. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl & Partners and Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared public greens and parks, trails and a grid of narrow, traffic calming streets. Most homes are required to have a front porch of not less than eight feet (2.46 m) in depth. Floor heights of 10 feet (3.1 m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a dense, vertical feel.\n\nHaile Plantation, Florida, is a 2,600 household () development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall). There are also two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course.\n\nIn June 1996, the Walt Disney Company unveiled its 5,000 acre (20 km²) town of Celebration, near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a \"town\".\n\nCelebration's Downtown has become one of the area's most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a \"sense of place\".\n\nThe construction of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County, New Jersey has spurred transit-oriented development. In Jersey City, two projects are planned to transform brownfield sites, both of which have required remediation of toxic waste by previous owners. Bayfront, once site of a Honeywell plant is a site on the Hackensack River, and is nearby the planned West Campus of New Jersey City University. Canal Crossing, named for the former Morris Canal, was once partially owned by PPG Industries, and is a site west of Liberty State Park.\n\nThe sparsely developed agricultural Township of Chesterfield in New Jersey covers approximately and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s. Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated \"receiving area\" known as Old York Village. Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village. Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.\n\nCivita is a sustainable, transit-oriented 230-acre master-planned village under development in the Mission Valley area of San Diego, California, United States. Located on a former quarry site, the urban-style village is organized around a 19-acre community park that cascades down the terraced property. Civita development plans call for 60 to 70 acres of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot retail center, and 420,000 square feet for an office/business campus.\n\nSudberry Properties, the developer of Civita, incorporated numerous green building practices in the Civita design. In 2009, Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the U.S. Green Building Council’s 2009 LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) pilot and received the California Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award. In 2010, Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental, economic, and community health.\n\nDel Mar (Los Angeles Metro station), which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003, is a transit-oriented development surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line, which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena. Located at the southern edge of downtown Pasadena, it serves as a gateway to the city with 347 apartments, out of which 15% are affordable units. Approximately 20,000 square feet of retail is linked with a network of public plazas, paseos and private courtyards. The 3.4-acre, $77 million project sits above a 1,200-car multi-level subterranean parking garage, with 600 spaces dedicated to transit. The light rail right of way, detailed as a public street, bisects the site. It was designed by Moule & Polyzoides.\n\nNorfolk, VA, East Beach. designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk. Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nNew Urbanism is closely related to the Urban village movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is Poundbury in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall under the overview of Prince Charles. The original masterplan was designed by Leon Krier. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce car dependency had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.\n\nThe Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the Congress for the New Urbanism Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A New Zealand Urban Design Protocol was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.\n\nThere are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent:\n\n\n\n\nThere are several such developments in South Africa. The most notable is Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. Triple Point is a comparable mixed-use development in East London, in Eastern Cape province. The development, announced in 2007, comprises 30 hectares. It is made up of three apartment complexes together with over 30 residential sites as well as 20,000 sq m of residential and office space. The development is valued at over R2 billion ($250 million). There have been cases where market forces of urban decay are confused with new urbanism in African cities. This has led to a form of suburban mixed-use development that does not promote walkability. \n\nMost new developments on the edges of Australia's major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.\n\nAnother important factor or principle of New Urbanism that guides Australia's major cities is how good their foot circulation seems to be which is guided by the wayfinding systems that are implemented. Kenneth B. Hall, Jr. and Gerald A. Porterfield said in their book, \"Community by Design,\" the way to gain good circulation is to take some thoughtful consideration to things like wayfinding, sight lines, transition, visual clues, and reference points. Circulation design should work to create an interesting and informative system that utilizes subtle elements as well as technical ones. City of Port Philip, Australia, is a good example of wayfinding where they have come up with a comprehensive pedestrian signage system, specifically for their local areas of St Kilda, South Melbourne and Port Melbourne. The city's wayfinding system consists of 26 individually designed panels that are placed on some major streets such as St Kilda and St Kilda East, linking St Kilda Junction and Balaclava Station to the foreshore via Fitzroy, Carlisle and Acland Streets. City of Port Philip also created directional signage systems that makes use of the already existing street furniture such as trash cans to help provide for 130 directional indicators across Port Melbourne.\n\n\n\n"}

For nearly 100 years, Stranorlar was the headquarters of the County Donegal Railway system (originally the Finn Valley Railway), with services to Derry and Letterkenny via Strabane (near Lifford), to Ballyshannon and Killybegs via Donegal, and to Glenties. At its peak the railway had 130 employees. The last train ran from Stranorlar in 1960\n\nStranorlar railway station was built by the Finn Valley Railway and opened on 7 September 1863 and finally closed on 6 February 1960. The old railway station was demolished to make way for a new bus garage owned and run by Bus Éireann. To celebrate the millennium, the old clock from the railway station was restored and installed in a new clock tower which sits at the old pedestrian entrance to the railway station yard. The town remains the main depot for Bus Éireann within County Donegal.\n\nThe nearest railway station is operated by Northern Ireland Railways and runs from Derry / Londonderry railway station via Coleraine to Belfast Central railway station and Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station. The strategically important Belfast-Derry railway line is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services.\n\nThe next nearest railway station is Sligo railway station where Iarnród Éireann, Official site - Timetables, bookings and operations trains run to Dublin Connolly.\n\nStranorlar is home to St. Columba's College and Finn Valley College. The town is also home to two primary schools. St Mary's primary school and the Robertson National School.\n\nIsaac Butt MP, founder of the Home Rule Movement is buried in the churchyard of the Church of Ireland (C of I Church) which has a registered monument.

There are eight Apostles left, the ninth having collapsed dramatically in July 2005. The name remains significant and spectacular, especially in the Australian tourism industry.\n\nThe apostles were formed by erosion: The harsh and extreme weather conditions from the Southern Ocean gradually eroded the soft limestone to form caves in the cliffs, which then became arches, which in turn collapsed; leaving rock stacks up to 50 metres high. Because of this erosion, there are eight remaining. The site was known as the \"Sow and Pigs\" (Muttonbird Island, near Loch Ard Gorge, was the 'Sow', and the smaller rock stacks were the \"Piglets\"), the \"Pinnacles\" or the \"Twelve Apostles\". The formation eventually became known as the \"Twelve Apostles\", despite only ever having nine stacks.\nIn 2002, the Port Campbell Professional Fishermens Association unsuccessfully attempted to block the creation of a proposed marine national park at the Twelve Apostles location, but were satisfied with the later Victorian Government decision not to allow seismic exploration at the same site by Benaris Energy; believing it would harm marine life.\n\nThe stacks are susceptible to further erosion from the waves. On 3 July 2005, a stack collapsed, leaving eight standing. On 25 September 2009, it was thought that another of the stacks had fallen, but this was actually one of the smaller stacks of the \"Three Sisters\" formation. The rate of erosion at the base of the limestone pillars is approximately 2 cm per year.

{"id": "44295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44295", "title": "Vltava", "text": "Vltava\n\nThe Vltava (; ; , ) is the longest river within the Czech Republic, running southeast along the Bohemian Forest and then north across Bohemia, through Český Krumlov, České Budějovice and Prague, and finally merging with the Elbe at Mělník. It is commonly referred to as the \"Bohemian sea\" and the \"Czech national river\".\n\nThe Vltava river is long and drains an area in size, over half of Bohemia and about a third of the Czech Republic's entire territory. As it runs through Prague, the river is crossed by 18 bridges (including the Charles Bridge) and covers within the city. The water from the river was used for drinking until 1912, when the Vinohrady Water Tower ceased pumping operations. It is, however, the source of drinking water in case of failures/repairs to the water supply from the Želivka and Kárané sources. The Podolí water processing plant is on standby for such cases with the long section of the river upstream of the Podolí plant under the stricter, second degree of pollution prevention regulations.\n\nSeveral dams were built on it in the 1950s. The Orlík Dam supports the largest reservoir on the Vltava by volume, while the Lipno Dam in the Bohemian Forest () retains the largest reservoir by area. North of Prague the Štěchovice Reservoir has been built over the site of the St John's Rapids. The river also features numerous locks and weirs that help mitigate its flow from in elevation at its source near the German border to at its mouth in Mělník.\n\nThe height difference from source to mouth is about and the largest stream at the source is named Černý Potok (Black Brook, AKA Teplá Vltava). The Vltava itself originates by a confluence of two streams, the Warm Vltava (\"\"), which is longer, and the Cold Vltava (\"Studená Vltava\"), sourcing in Bavaria. Along its course, Vltava receives many tributaries, the biggest being Otava and Berounka from the left and Lužnice and Sázava from the right side. Its section around Český Krumlov (specifically from Vyšší Brod to Boršov nad Vltavou) is a very popular destination of water tourism.\n\nBoth the Czech name ' and the German name ' are believed to originate from the old Germanic words ' (\"wild water\"; compare Latin '). In ' (872 AD) it is called '; from 1113 AD it is attested as '. In ' (1125 AD) it is attested for the first time in its Bohemian form as \".\n\nOn the other side there is a river \" in Ukraine with no traces of Germanic origins. The name of a settlement on this river was mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle in 1174, traditionally connected to the name of the city of Poltava, Ukraine. There are many theories describing etymology of \"Ltava\".\n\nThe Vltava basin has flooded multiple times throughout recorded history. Markers have been created along the banks denoting the water line for notable floods in 1784, 1845, 1890, 1940, and the highest of all in 2002.\n\nIn August of that year, the basin was heavily affected by the 2002 European floods when the flooded river killed several people and caused massive damage and disruption along its length, including in Prague. It left the oldest bridge in Prague, Charles Bridge, seriously weakened, requiring years of work to repair.\n\nPrague was again flooded in 2013. Many locations within the Vltava and Elbe basins were left under water, including the Prague Zoo, but metal barriers were erected along the banks of the Vltava to help protect the historic city centre.\n\nNine hydroelectric dams have been built on the Vltava to regulate the water flow and generate hydroelectric power. Beginning at the headwaters, these are: Lipno, Lipno II, Hněvkovice, Kořensko, Orlík, Kamýk, Slapy, Štěchovice and Vrané.\n\nOne of the best-known works of classical music by a Czech composer is Bedřich Smetana's \"Vltava\", usually called \"The Moldau\" in English. It is from the Romantic era of classical music and is a musical description of the river's course through Bohemia (listen).\n\nA minor planet 2123 Vltava discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after the river.\n\nSmetana's symphonic poem also inspired a song of the same name by Bertolt Brecht. An English version of it, by John Willett, features the lyrics \"Deep down in the Moldau the pebbles are shifting\" / \"In Prague three dead emperors moulder away.\"\n\n"}
