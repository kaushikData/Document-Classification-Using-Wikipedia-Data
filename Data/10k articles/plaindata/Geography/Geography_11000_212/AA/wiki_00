Syria's Afrin District fell under the control of the People's Protection Units (YPG) around 2012 and an \"Afrin Canton\" (now Afrin Region) was declared in 2014. Afrin Canton in its latest form was established in 2017, however, as part of the reorganisation of the DFNS' subdivisions. With Afrin as its administrative centre, the canton was part of the larger Afrin Region. As a result of the Turkish-led Operation Olive Branch in early 2018, Afrin Canton became part of the Turkish occupation of Northern Syria.\n\nAfrin is the furthest west and most mountainous part of Aleppo Governorate. It consists of southern part of the Kurd Mountains. Afrîn Canton is bordered by the de facto Shahba Canton to the east, Kilis Province of Turkey to the north and Hatay Province of Turkey to the west, Al-Dana Nahiyah of the Harem District of Idlib and Mount Simeon District of Aleppo Governorates of Syria to the south.\n\nThe population of the Afrin Canton area was overwhelmingly ethnic Kurdish, to the degree that the canton had been described as \"homogeneously Kurdish\". The overall population of Afrin Canton, based on the 2004 Syrian census, was about 200,000.\n\nCities and towns with more than 10.000 inhabitants according to the 2004 Syrian census are Afrin (36,562) and Jandairis (13,661).\n\nThroughout the course of the Syrian Civil War, Afrin Canton served a safe haven for inbound refugees of all ethnicities, fleeing violence and destruction from civil war factions, in particular the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the diverse more or less Islamist rebel groups of the Syrian opposition. According to a June 2016 estimate from the International Middle East Peace Research Center, about 316,000 displaced Syrians of Kurdish, Yazidi, Arab and Turkmen ethnicity lived in Afrin Canton at the time.\n\nAccording to René Dussaud, the area of Kurd-Dagh and the plain near Antioch were settled by Kurds since antiquity. Stefan Sperl says that there is a reason to believe that Kurdish settlements in the Kurd Mountains go back to the Seleucid era, since those regions stood in the path to Antioch; Kurds in the early periods served as mercenaries and mounted archers. In any case, the Kurd Mountains were already Kurdish-inhabited when the Crusades broke out at the end of the 11th century.\n\nThe area around Afrin, today's Afrin Canton, over the centuries developed as the center of a distinctive Sufi \"Kurdish Islam\". In modern post-independence Syria, the Kurdish society of the canton was subject to heavy-handed Arabization policies by the Damascus government.\n\nIn the course of the Syrian Civil War, Damascus government forces pulled back from the canton in spring 2012 to give way to autonomous self-administration within the Rojava framework, which was formally declared on 29 January 2014, and the territory of Afrin Canton has virtually never seen civil war combat. It has however at various times been the target of artillery shelling by Islamist rebel groups as well as by Turkey. In response, Russian military troops had reportedly stationed themselves in Afrin as part of an agreement to protect the YPG from further Turkish attacks.\n\nAfrin Canton was captured by the Turkish Land Forces and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army as result of Operation Olive Branch from January to March 2018. Many civilians and officials fled from Afrin City before its capture by Turkish-led troops on 18 March 2018, and the YPG vowed to retake it. The YPG consequently announced its intention to start a guerilla war in Afrin Canton.\n\nA diverse agricultural production was at the heart of the Afrin Canton's economy, traditionally olives in particular, and more recently there was a focus on increasing wheat production. A well-known product from the area is Aleppo soap, a hard soap made from olive oil and lye, distinguished by the inclusion of laurel oil. While Afrin Canton has been the source of olive oil for Aleppo soap since antiquity, the destruction caused by the Syrian Civil War to other parts of Aleppo governorate increasingly made the entire production chains locate in Afrin Canton. At the height of the fighting for Aleppo, up to 50 percent of the city's industrial production was moved to Afrin Canton. As of early 2016, two million pairs of jeans were produced per month and exported across Syria. In January 2017, 400 textile industry workshops counted 17,000 employees, supplying the whole of Syria.\n\nAfrin Canton is under a blockade imposed by neighbouring Turkey, which places high burdens on international import and export. For example, transportation of Aleppo soap to international markets, as far as possible at all, has at least four times the transportation cost as compared to pre-war years. In 2015 there were 32 tons of Aleppo soap produced and exported to other parts of Syria, but also to international markets.\n\nAfrin District also served as center for domestic tourism due to its beautiful landscapes. Syrians continued to travel to the region for recreational purposes after the formation of Afrin Region, and later Afrin Canton. The tourism was however somewhat constricted due to the YPG's tight control of the borders, and the war; local tourism mostly collapsed during the Turkish invasion of 2018.\n\nLike in the other Rojava canton, primary education in the public schools is initially by mother tongue instruction either Kurdish or Arabic, with the aim of bilingualism in Kurdish and Arabic in secondary schooling. Curricula are a topic of continuous debate between the canton' Boards of Education and the Syrian central government in Damascus, which partly pays the teachers.\n\nThe federal, regional and local administrations in Rojava put much emphasis on promoting libraries and educational centers, to facilitate learning and social and artistic activities.\n\nAfrin Canton has one institution of higher education, the University of Afrin, founded in 2015. After teaching three programs (Electromechanical Engineering, Kurdish Literature and Economy) in the first academic year, the second academic year with an increased 22 professors and 250 students has three additional programs (Human Medicine, Journalism and Agricultural Engineering).\n\n\n"}

It was in Hellenistic Phrygia, but became part of the Roman province of Pisidia. It was near, but on lower ground than, Celaenae (Kelainai).\n\nThe site is now partly occupied by the city of \"Dinar\" (sometimes locally known also as \"Geyikler\", \"the gazelles,\" perhaps from a tradition of the Persian hunting-park, seen by Xenophon at Celaenae), which by 1911 was connected with İzmir by railway; there are considerable remains, including a theater and a great number of important Graeco-Roman inscriptions.\nStrabo (p. 577) says, that the town lies at the source (ekbolais) of the Marsyas, and the river flows through the middle of the city, having its origin in the city, and being carried down to the suburbs with a violent and precipitous current it joins the Maeander after the latter is joined by the Orgas (called the Catarrhactes by Herodotus, vii. 26).\n\nThe original inhabitants were residents of Celaenae who were compelled by Antiochus I Soter to move farther down the river, where they founded the city of Apamea (Strabo, xii. 577). Antiochus the Great transplanted many Jews there. (Josephus, \"Ant.\" xii. 3, § 4). It became a seat of Seleucid power, and a center of Graeco-Roman and Graeco-Hebrew civilization and commerce. There Antiochus the Great collected the army with which he met the Romans at Magnesia, and two years later the Treaty of Apamea between Rome and the Seleucid realm was signed there. After Antiochus' departure for the East, Apamea lapsed to the Pergamene kingdom and thence to Rome in 133 BCE, but it was resold to Mithridates V of Pontus, who held it till 120 BCE. After the Mithridatic Wars it became and remained a great center for trade, largely carried on by resident Italians and by Jews. By order of Flaccus, a large amount of Jewish money – nearly 45 kilograms of gold – intended for the Temple in Jerusalem was confiscated in Apamea in the year 62 BCE. In 84 BCE Sulla made it the seat of a \"conventus\", and it long claimed primacy among Phrygian cities. When Strabo wrote, Apamea was a place of great trade in the Roman province of Asia, next in importance to Ephesus. Its commerce was owing to its position on the great road to Cappadocia, and it was also the center of other roads. When Cicero was proconsul of Cilicia, 51 BCE, Apamea was within his jurisdiction (\"ad Fam.\" xiii. 67), but the dioecesis, or conventus, of Apamea was afterwards attached to Asia. Pliny the Elder enumerates six towns which belonged to the conventus of Apamea, and he observes that there were nine others of little note.\nThe city minted its own coins in antiquity. The name Cibotus appears on some coins of Apamea, and it has been conjectured that it was so called from the wealth that was collected in this great emporium; for kibôtos in Greek is a chest or coffer. Pliny (v. 29) says that it was first Celaenae, then Cibotus, and then Apamea; which cannot be quite correct, because Celaenae was a different place from Apamea, though near it. But there may have been a place on the site of Apamea, which was called Cibotus.\n\nThe country about Apamea has been shaken by earthquakes, one of which is recorded as having happened in the time of Claudius (Tacit. \"Ann. \" xii. 58); and on this occasion the payment of taxes to the Romans was remitted for five years. Nicolaus of Damascus (\"Athen. \" p. 332) records a violent earthquake at Apamea at a previous date, during the Mithridatic Wars: lakes appeared where none were before, and rivers and springs; and many which existed before disappeared. Strabo (p. 579) speaks of this great catastrophe, and of other convulsions at an earlier period.\n\nApamea continued to be a prosperous town under the Roman Empire. Its decline dates from the local disorganization of the empire in the 3rd century; and though a bishopric, it was not an important military or commercial center in Byzantine times. The Turks took it first in 1080, and from the late 13th century onwards it was always in Muslim hands. For a long period it was one of the greatest cities of Asia Minor, commanding the Maeander road; but when the trade routes were diverted to Constantinople it rapidly declined, and its ruin was completed by an earthquake.\n\nApamea is mentioned in the Talmud. The passages relating to witchcraft in Apamea (Ber. 62a) and to a dream in Apamea (Niddah, 30b) probably refer to the Apamea in Phrygia which was looked upon as a fabulously distant habitation. Similarly the much-discussed passage, Yeb. 115b, which treats of the journey of the exilarch Isaac, should also be interpreted to mean a journey from Corduene to Apamea in Phrygia; for if Apamea in Mesene were meant (Brüll's \"Jahrb.\" x. 145) it is quite impossible that the Babylonians should have had any difficulty in identifying the body of such a distinguished personage.\n\nApamea Cibotus is enumerated by Hierocles among the episcopal cities of the Roman province of Pisidia. Lequien gives the names of nine of its bishops. The first is a Julianus of Apamea at the Maeander who, Eusebius records, was in about 253 reported by Alexander of Hierapolis (Phrygia) to have joined others in examining the claims of the Montanist Maximilla. The list of bishops from Pisidia who participated in the First Council of Nicaea (325) includes Tharsitius of Apamea. It also gives a Paulus of Apamea, but Lequien considers that in the latter case \"Apamea\" is a mistake for \"Acmonia\". A Bishop Theodulus of Apamea (who may, however, have been of Apamea in Bithynia) witnessed a will of Gregory of Nazianzus. Paulinus took part in the Council of Chalcedon (451) and was a signatory of the letter from the bishops of Pisidia to Emperor Leo I the Thracian concerning the killing in 457 of Proterius of Alexandria. In the early 6th century, Conon abandoned his bishopric of Apamea in Phrygia and became a military leader in a rebellion against Emperor Anastasius. The acts of the Second Council of Constantinople (553) were signed by \"John by the mercy of God bishop of the city of Apamea in the province of Pisidia\". Sisinnius of Apamea was one of the Pisidian bishops at the Second Council of Nicaea (787). The Council held at Constantinople in 879–880 was attended by two bishops of Apamea in Pisidia, one appointed by Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople the other by Photios I of Constantinople.\n\nSince it is no longer a residential diocese, Apamea Cibotus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "154491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154491", "title": "Armorica", "text": "Armorica\n\nArmorica or Aremorica is the name given in ancient times to the part of Gaul between the Seine and the Loire that includes the Brittany Peninsula, extending inland to an indeterminate point and down the Atlantic Coast. The toponym is based on the Gaulish phrase \"are-mori\" \"on/at [the] sea\", made into the Gaulish place name \"Aremorica\" (\"*are-mor-ika\") \"Place by the Sea\". The suffix \"-ika\" was first used to create adjectival forms and then names (see regions such as Pays d'Ouche from \"Utica\" and Perche from \"Pertica\"). The original designation was vague, including a large part of what became Normandy in the 10th century and, in some interpretations, the whole of the coast down to the Garonne. Later, the term became restricted to Brittany.\n\nIn Breton, which belongs to the Brythonic branch of the Insular Celtic languages, along with Welsh and Cornish, \"on [the] sea\" is \"war vor\" (Welsh \"ar fôr\", \"f\" being voiced and pronounced like English \"v\"), but the older form \"arvor\" is used to refer to the coastal regions of Brittany, in contrast to \"argoad\" (\"ar\" \"on/at\", \"coad\" \"forest\" [Welsh \"ar goed\" or \"coed\" \"trees\"]) for the inland regions. The cognate modern usages suggest that the Romans first contacted coastal people in the inland region and assumed that the regional name \"Aremorica\" referred to the whole area, both coastal and inland.\n\nPliny the Elder, in his \"Natural History\" (4.17.105), claims that Armorica was the older name for \"Aquitania\" and states Armorica's southern boundary extended to the Pyrenees. Taking into account the Gaulish origin of the name, that is perfectly correct and logical, as Aremorica is not a country name but a word that describes a type of geographical region, one that is by the sea. Pliny lists the following Celtic tribes as living in the area: the Aedui and Carnuteni as having treaties with Rome; the Meldi and Secusiani as having some measure of independence; and the Boii, Senones, Aulerci (both the Eburovices and Cenomani), the Parisii, Tricasses, Andicavi, Viducasses, Bodiocasses, Veneti, Coriosvelites, Diablinti, Rhedones, Turones, and the Atseui.\n\nTrade between Armorica and Britain, described by Diodorus Siculus and implied by Pliny was long-established. Because, even after the campaign of Publius Crassus in 57 BC, continued resistance to Roman rule in Armorica was still being supported by Celtic aristocrats in Britain, Julius Caesar led two invasions of Britain in 55 and 54 in response. Some hint of the complicated cultural web that bound Armorica and the Britanniae (the \"Britains\" of Pliny) is given by Caesar when he describes Diviciacus of the Suessiones, as \"the most powerful ruler in the whole of Gaul, who had control not only over a large area of this region but also of Britain\" Archaeological sites along the south coast of England, notably at Hengistbury Head, show connections with Armorica as far east as the Solent. This 'prehistoric' connection of Cornwall and Brittany set the stage for the link that continued into the medieval era. Still farther East, however, the typical Continental connections of the Britannic coast were with the lower Seine valley instead.\n\nArchaeology has not yet been as enlightening in Iron-Age Armorica as the coinage, which has been surveyed by Philip de Jersey.\n\nUnder the Roman Empire, Armorica was administered as part of the province of Gallia Lugdunensis, which had its capital in Lugdunum, (modern day Lyon). When the Roman provinces were reorganized in the 4th century, Armorica (\"Tractus Armoricanus et Nervicanus\") was placed under the second and third divisions of Lugdunensis. After the legions retreated from Britannia (407) the local elite there expelled the civilian magistrates in the following year; Armorica too rebelled in the 430s and again in the 440s, throwing out the ruling officials, as the Romano-Britons had done. At the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 a Roman coalition led by General Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic King Theodoric I clashed violently with the Hunnic alliance commanded by King Attila the Hun. Jordanes lists Aëtius' allies as including Armoricans and other Celtic or German tribes (Getica 36.191).\n\nThe \"Armorican\" peninsula came to be settled with Britons from Britain during the poorly documented period of the 5th-7th centuries. Even in distant Byzantium Procopius heard tales of migrations to the Frankish mainland from the island, largely legendary for him, of \"Brittia\". These settlers, whether refugees or not, made the presence felt of their coherent groups in the naming of the westernmost, Atlantic-facing provinces of Armorica, Cornouaille (\"Cornwall\") and Domnonea (\"Devon\"). These settlements are associated with leaders like Saints Samson of Dol and Pol Aurelian, among the \"founder saints\" of Brittany.\n\nThe linguistic origins of Breton are clear: it is a Brythonic language descended from the Celtic British language, like Welsh and Cornish one of the Insular Celtic languages, brought by these migrating Britons. Still, questions of the relations between the Celtic \"cultures\" of Britain— Cornish and Welsh— and Celtic Breton are far from settled. Martin Henig (2003) suggests that in Armorica as in sub-Roman Britain: There was a fair amount of creation of identity in the migration period. We know that the mixed, but largely British and Frankish population of Kent repackaged themselves as 'Jutes', and the largely British populations in the lands east of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall) seem to have ended up as 'West Saxons'. In western Armorica the small elite which managed to impose an identity on the population happened to be British rather than 'Gallo-Roman' in origin, so they became Bretons. The process may have been essentially the same.\"\n\nVikings settled in the Cotentin peninsula and the lower Seine around Rouen in the ninth and early tenth centuries, and these regions came to be known as \"Normandy\", the name \"Armorica\" fell out of use in the area. With western Armorica having already evolved into \"Brittany\", the east was recast from a Frankish viewpoint as the \"Breton March\" under a Frankish marquis.\n\nThe home village of the fictional comic-book hero Asterix was located in Armorica during the Roman Republic; there, \"indomitable Gauls\" hold out against Rome. The unnamed village was reported as having been discovered by archaeologists in a spoof article in the British \"The Independent\" newspaper on April Fool's Day in 1993.\n\n\"North Armorica\" is mentioned in the first sentence of James Joyce's novel \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nArmorica is featured extensively in Bernard Cornwell's novel \"The Winter King\", where Ynys Trebes, later Mont Saint Michel, is besieged and destroyed by the Franks.\n\nIn \"\", Farley Mowat speculated that Armorica was the origin of the Albans, who fled from Romans to Britain and Orkney and later fled from Norse, discovering Iceland, Greenland, Ungava Peninsula, Quebec and Newfoundland.\n\nThe protagonist, Mathurin Kerbouchard, of Louis L'Amour's \"The Walking Drum\" is a native of Brittany and extensively references the culture of Armorica in the 12th century.\n\nArmorica is the home country of Felix in Juliet Marillier's \"Seer of Sevenwaters\", the 5th book in the Sevenwaters series.\n\n\n"}

Both paved and unpaved backroads are eligible for these grants, which seek to protect water quality from sediment accumulation caused by road and ditch erosion.\n\nMany back-roads in North Carolina were created when the states rural transportation system began investing for factories to located outside of urban areas and into rural areas. This created a system of back-roads that allowed for factories to disperse away from busy urban areas. This was done in the late 1940's under Governor Kerr Scott where investment began and was known as the states rural farm-to-market road system. The idea for the farm-to-market road system was to connect farms out in rural areas to the markets in which they sold there produce, this would allow for easy transportation for those who transported there goods to market places. Ultimately these types of roads became state highways or nice quality roads however, the importance of there beginnings is that they began as rural back-roads for agricultural purposes.\n\nBack roads, sometimes called rural roads are known to be unsafe. Back-roads usually have a fatality rate of about two and a half times more than any other road in the United States. A study done in 2015 by TRIP a National Transportation Research Group found that back-roads have a traffic fatality rate of 2.18 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, whereas all roads combined in the United States have a traffic fatality rate of 0.38 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Back-roads contribute to 22% of total amount of vehicle miles traveled in the United States, but make up 43% (15,132) of the total amount of vehicle collisions in 2015 (35,092). In 2015 Texas had the highest number of rural non interstate traffic deaths at 1,259 and California in second with 1,219 deaths. Back roads are known to have features that make them less safe then a highway, some of the features that are seen in back-roads are narrow lanes, limited shoulders, sharp curves, pavement drop offs, steep slopes, and limited clear zones along roadsides. Given that the majority of back roads were built early in american history, they were often designed with different widths and height restrictions, this makes for unsafe road conditions for modern vehicles and trucks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38749455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38749455", "title": "Catena (soil)", "text": "Catena (soil)\n\nA Catena in soil science (pedology) is a series of distinct but co-evolving soils arrayed a slope.[5] Each soil type or \"facet\" differs somewhat from its neighbours, but all occur in the same climate and on the same underlying parent material. A mature catena is in equilibrium as the processes of deposition and erosion are in balance.\n\nThe catena concept originated in Central Uganda, by chemist W.S. Martin [3] to describe a hill slope sequence at the Bukalasa research station. The term catena (Latin: chain) was first coined by scientist Geoffrey Milne to describe these soil-topography units. The concept of a catena was developed in order to analyze the regular variation of soils across a slope. The example of this approach consists first in a structural component, the recurring pattern of certain soils in a landscape transects in which every chain element has its place in the chain, a soil has it in a landscape.\n\nThe term soil catena is used to describe the lateral variation in soils over a hillslope. [2][9] A slope can be broken into sections known as a ridge, crest, midslope, and toeslope. The ridge or hilltop tends to accumulate organic matter that allows formation of an adequate thickness of soil. Steeper slope or crest sections tend to be freely drained, while at the bottom of slopes or toeslopes there is usually higher in moisture content due to poor drainage.[7] Toeslope soils are not only higher in moisture content, but are also known to be richer in clay and organic matter.[2]\n\nLithology and relief can be the primary controls on the development of certain catenas [4] with easily disaggregated parent rock and high relief favoring particle redistribution and therefore the formation of distinct soils in particle-source and particle-deposition zones along a slope.[8]\n\nCatenas can also develop on low relief hillslopes, but because less potential energy is available the redistribution of mass can be dominated by subsurface flow of plasma, a combination of dissolved and suspended solids in soil water.[1][6][8]\n\nA catena forms when the climate, including precipitation and evaporation, is the same for the whole slope, and when sufficient time has passed for equilibrium to be reached between the processes that bring materials in to a facet and the processes that take materials away. The result is a predictable sequence of soil facets. A catena is thus an open system which has continuous input and output processes. On a steeper slope in the middle of a catena, erosion, such as by runoff, is faster, so facets are typically thinner and drier. Conversely, on a shallower slope at the top or bottom of a catena, soils are thicker and deeper. In addition, the top facets lose materials such as mineral salts when these are washed out by rain (eluviation), while the bottom facets gain materials when these are washed in (illuviation).\n\nA catena can form on various underlying or parent materials and in different climates. On impermeable acid rocks such as metamorphic schists in a high rainfall climate like that of Western Scotland, the catena consists of thick acidic peat forming wet bog on the flatter facets, and thinner, drier, somewhat less acidic peaty podsols on the steeper facets. Thus the soil depth, acidity (pH) and soil moisture vary continuously along the slope. On a permeable basic rock such as chalk, the catena may consist of thick brown earths on the flatter facets, with thin rendzinas on the steeper slopes, while the valley bottom may include alkaline fen peat or river alluvium.\n\nThe importance of a catena is the variation of soils across a small area such as a slope. Understanding the soils that make up a catena could facilitate the mapping of soils across a given region.\n\nMany fields of study are taken into consideration when studying catenas, studying catenas could help to understand the influence of soil hydrology on soil formation.\n\nCatenas are found to be a great location for the study of soil science, given that the catena concept focuses on past history of the land surface, on hydrology, erosion, sediment transport, and pedogenic processes.\n\n"}

{"id": "492721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=492721", "title": "Fram", "text": "Fram\n\nFram (\"Forward\") is a ship that was used in expeditions of the Arctic and Antarctic regions by the Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen, Otto Sverdrup, Oscar Wisting, and Roald Amundsen between 1893 and 1912. It was designed and built by the Scottish-Norwegian shipwright Colin Archer for Fridtjof Nansen's 1893 Arctic expedition in which the plan was to freeze \"Fram\" into the Arctic ice sheet and float with it over the North Pole.\n\n\"Fram\" is said to have sailed farther north (85°57'N) and farther south (78°41'S) than any other wooden ship. \"Fram\" is preserved at the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway.\n\nNansen's ambition was to explore the Arctic farther north than anyone else. To do that, he would have to deal with a problem that many sailing on the polar ocean had encountered before him: the freezing ice could crush a ship. Nansen's idea was to build a ship that could survive the pressure, not by pure strength, but because it would be of a shape designed to let the ice push the ship up, so it would \"float\" on top of the ice.\n\"Fram\" is a three-masted schooner with a total length of 39 meters and width of 11 meters. The ship is both unusually wide and unusually shallow in order to better withstand the forces of pressing ice.\n\nNansen commissioned the shipwright Colin Archer from Larvik to construct a vessel with these characteristics. \"Fram\" was built with an outer layer of greenheart wood to withstand the ice and with almost no keel to handle the shallow waters Nansen expected to encounter. The rudder and propeller were designed to be retracted. The ship was also carefully insulated to allow the crew to live on board for up to five years. The ship also included a windmill, which ran a generator to provide electric power for lighting by electric arc lamps.\n\nInitially, \"Fram\" was fitted with a steam engine. Prior to Amundsen's expedition to the South Pole in 1910, the engine was replaced with a diesel engine, a first for polar exploration vessels.\n\nFram was used in several expeditions:\n\nWreckage found at Greenland from , which was lost off Siberia, and driftwood found in the regions of Svalbard and Greenland, suggested that an ocean current flowed beneath the Arctic ice sheet from east to west, bringing driftwood from the Siberian region to Svalbard and further west. Nansen had \"Fram\" built in order to explore this theory.\nHe undertook an expedition that came to last three years. When Nansen realised that \"Fram\" would not reach the North Pole directly by the force of the current, he and Hjalmar Johansen set out to reach it on skis. After reaching 86° 14' north, he had to turn back to spend the winter at Franz Joseph Land. Nansen and Johansen survived on walrus and polar bear meat and blubber. Finally meeting British explorers, the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition, they arrived back in Norway only days before the \"Fram\" also returned there. The ship had spent nearly three years trapped in the ice, reaching 85° 57' N.\n\nIn 1898, Otto Sverdrup, who had brought \"Fram\" back on the first Arctic voyage, led a scientific expedition to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \"Fram\" was slightly modified for this journey, its freeboard being increased. \"Fram\" left harbour on 24 June 1898, with 17 men on board. Their aim was to chart the lands of the Arctic Islands, and to sample the geology, flora and fauna. The expeditions lasted till 1902, leading to charts covering 260,000 km, more than any other Arctic expedition.\n\n\"Fram\" was used by Roald Amundsen in his southern polar expedition from 1910 to 1912, the first to reach the South Pole, during which \"Fram\" reached 78° 41' S.\n\nThe ship was left to decay in storage from 1912 until the late 1920s, when Lars Christensen, Otto Sverdrup and Oscar Wisting initiated efforts to preserve her. In 1935, the ship was installed in the Fram Museum, where she now stands.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

FZS focuses on maintaining biodiversity and conserving wildlife and ecosystems in protected areas and outstanding wild places. FZS leads and supports about 30 projects in 18 countries. \nBernhard Grzimek, renowned German zoo director, zoologist, book author, editor, and animal conservationist in postwar West-Germany, served as president of the Frankfurt Zoological Society for over forty years.\n\nFZS was founded in 1858 by Frankfurt citizens to establish a zoo, the Frankfurt Zoological Garden, which it operated until the First World War.\nThe city council then assumed responsibility for the zoo until 1950, when the society again became the zoo's development association.\nIn the 1950s the society became involved in conservation in the Serengeti, and began supporting development of national parks in Africa. Since then the society has become increasingly involved in protecting and preserving endangered animals and their environments worldwide.\n\nFZS provides logistical support to conservation areas around the world, sponsors animal census surveys, provides conservation-related education and gives advice to organizations involved in establishing conservation areas.\nFZS participates in programs to protect highly endangered species and to reintroduce endangered species, acquires land for conservation areas and helps protect and regenerate natural landscapes.\n\nProjects are designed as long-term and carried out in close cooperation with local organisations and authorities. Also, the integration of the local population is a vital aspect of FZS's project work.\nFZS concentrates its efforts on habitats in grasslands, wetlands, forests and mountains. All projects follow the common goal of maintaining wilderness and biodiversity.\n\nTraditionally, many FZS projects are located in Tanzania. Currently, FZS is engaged in the protection of the Serengeti, the Selous and the Mahale Ecosystem and carries out research for the preservation of East Africas threatened habitats. \nLivestock and migration data is collected, rangers, scientists and veterinarians are educated and environmental education is promoted. \nFurther projects are located in Zimbabwe (Gonarezhou sanctuary), Zambia (North Luangwa) and the Democratic republic of Congo (Virunga and Maiko Nationalpark). Exemplary local partners are Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) and Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI).\n\nAnother major project is situated in Central Sumatra: The Bukit Tigapuluh Sanctuary for the preservation of rainforest and wildlife. This project is aiming at the resettlement and reintroduction of confiscated Orang Utans, which are prepared for their life in the wild through the local \"jungle school\". Further aspects of the work on site are conflict-prevention between humans and elephants, environmental education and initiatives supporting the local population in balancing out economical development and their traditions. \nImportant project partners on site are the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park as well as the Orang Utan Project (TOP), the Jambi Province Conservation Authority and WWF.\n\nIn South America, FZS furthers the protection of the biodiverse forests located at the Andes´ eastern slope and the adjacent lowlands. \nPatrols, aerial view evaluation, the education of rangers and environmental education are supported here. \nOn site, FZS collaborates, amongst others, with Crees Foundation and the Fondo de las Américas (FONDAM).\n\nIn Kazakhstan, FZS is involved in the Altyn Dala Conservation. This international joint project furthers the protection of Kazakhstans unique grasslands and their keystone species. \nThe initiative aims at building up a network of protected grasslands in central Kazakhstan. A special focus lies on the saiga-antilopes, of the Betpak-Dala population as they hold a key role in the ecosystems of the steppes and semi-deserts. \nExemplary local project-partners are the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).\n"}

Some rock units in the northeast are as much as 680 million years old and throughout the geologic past Guinea-Bissau was influenced by the Mauritanide Belt orogeny and was submerged or partially submerged as a marine shelf or river delta for most of its existence. \n\nThe oldest rocks in Guinea-Bissau are 680 million years old, dating to the Neoproterozoic in the Koulountou Group in the far northeast of the country. The Koulountou Group includes schistose lava rocks that are part of the Calc-Alkaline Complex of the Mauritanide Belt. The rocks are believed to have originated from volcanism at a continental margin, related to the Mauritanide orogeny. \n\nRadiometric dating of the unmetamorphosed, but slightly folded sedimentary rocks Youkounkoun Group gives an age of 580 million years ago. Geologists believe the Youkounkoun Group may be the remains of amolasse formed after the orogeny. The Mali Group and Batapa Group are both the same age, or slightly younger than the Youkounkoun Group. \n\nThe Bove Basin covers most of central Guinea-Bissau, filled with thick sequences of sedimentary rock from the Paleozoic. The lowest unit is the 250 to 600 meter thick Pita Group from the Ordovician and early Devonian. The formation has conglomerate sandstones, probably the result of an alluvial plain. The overlying Telimele Group is thought to be from the Late Devonian, due to the presence of graptolite fossils. Similarly, the Late Devonian Bafata Group preserves the remains of a marine carbonate shelf environment. \n\nMesozoic rocks from 251 to 66 million years ago are largely absent in Guinea-Bissau. In the west, there is an unconformity between Paleozoic sediments and Cenozoic marine sediments, which are cut by mafic dykes. \n\nIn the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary, Guinea-Bissau's surficial geology and geomorphology have changed considerably, with the formation of new terraces and duricrust, as well as frequent marine transgressions. \n\nThe Bove Basin has a large and shallow open fold known as the Bove-Bofata Syncline, that strikes northeast-southwest. The syncline is cut with brittle faults. \n\nMining is not a significant part of the economy of Guinea-Bissau, except for pits quarrying sand, gravel and clay for roads and building material. Lateritic regolith overlying Paleozoic sediments is known to contain bauxite, but there is currently no exploitation of these resources. Some small, low-grade gold anomalies exist in the northeast of Guinea-Bissau. Geologists have found soil anomalies of zinc, copper, molybdenum and lead associated with Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, although they remain poorly understood. \n\nEocene carbonates, formed in a shallow, sheltered bay, in the Farim region contain large phosphate reserves, discovered during oil drilling in the 1950s. The Directorate of Geology and Mines drilled seven boreholes in the region in the 1970s and in one hole, encountered a 4.9 meter sandy phosphate layer. Subsequent drilling produced estimates of 112 million tons in the deposit. The phosphate deposit is the southern equivalent of similar deposits in the Mauritania-Senegal-Guinea basin. Mining the deposits would be costly due to 26 to 50 meters over overlying sediments. The government of Guinea-Bissau experimented with applying ground phosphates extracted from the deposit on grain and groundnut fields, but never reported the results. \n"}
{"id": "148545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148545", "title": "Holy Land", "text": "Holy Land\n\nThe Holy Land (Hebrew: , ; Arabic: or ) is an area roughly located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical Land of Israel and historical Palestine. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern State of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria. It is considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims.\n\nPart of the significance of the land stems from the religious significance of Jerusalem, the holiest city to Judaism, the historical region of Jesus' ministry, and the site of the Isra and Mi'raj event in Islam.\n\nThe holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the Crusades, as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had conquered it from the Christian Byzantine Empire.\n\nMany sites in the Holy Land have long been pilgrimage destinations for adherents of the Abrahamic religions, including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Bahá'ís. Pilgrims visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their faith, confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.\n\nJews do not commonly refer to the Land of Israel as \"Holy Land\" (Hebrew: ). The Tanakh explicitly refers to it as \"holy land\" in only one passage. The term \"holy land\" is further used twice in the deuterocanonical books. The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the Israelites by God, that is, it is the \"promised land\", an integral part of God's covenant. In the Torah many mitzvot commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel, which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, \"no land shall be sold permanently\" (Lev. 25:23). Shmita is only observed with respect to the land of Israel, and the observance of many holy days is different, as an extra day is observed in the Jewish diaspora.\n\nAccording to Eliezer Schweid:\nFrom the perspective of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the \"Four Holy Cities\": Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed and Tiberias - as Judaism's holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the Temple, is considered especially significant. Sacred burials are still undertaken for diaspora Jews who wish to lie buried in the holy soil of Israel.\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount Moriah, the location of the binding of Isaac. The Hebrew Bible mentions the name \"Jerusalem\" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name \"Zion\", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.\n\nThe Talmud mentions the religious duty of colonising Israel. So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of Sabbath observance to further its acquisition and settlement. Rabbi Johanan said that \"Whoever walks four cubits in Eretz Yisrael is guaranteed entrance to the World to Come\". A story says that when R. Eleazar b. Shammua' and R. Johanan HaSandlar left Israel to study from R. Judah ben Bathyra, they only managed to reach Sidon when \"the thought of the sanctity of Palestine overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back\". Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protection. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died, in order to be buried there. The sage Rabbi Anan said \"To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar.\" The saying \"His land will absolve His people\" implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one's sins.\n\nFor Christians, the Land of Israel is considered holy because of its association with the birth, ministry, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, whom Christians regard as the Savior or Messiah, and because it is the land of the Jewish people (according to the Bible). Christian books, including editions of the Bible, often had maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, Judea). For instance, the \"Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae\" (Travel book through Holy Scripture) of Heinrich Bünting (1545-1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map. His book was very popular, and it provided \"the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments.\"\n\nAs a geographic term, the description \"Holy Land\" loosely encompasses modern-day Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, western Jordan and south-western Syria.\n\nIn the Qur'an, the term (, ) is used in a passage about Musa (Moses) proclaiming to the Children of Israel: \"O my people! Enter the holy land which Allah hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin.\" () The Quran also refers to the land as being 'Blessed'.\n\nJerusalem (referred to as \"Al-Quds\" (, \"The Holy\")) has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to Muhammad's experiencing the Isra and Mi'raj as \"a Journey by night from \"Al-Masjidil-Haram\" to \"Al-Masjidil-Aqsa\", whose precincts We did bless ...\" (17:1). \"Ahadith\" infer that the \"Farthest Masjid\" is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by Abu Hurairah: \"On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, \"Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your \"Ummah\" would have gone astray\". However, some modern scholars argue that the 'Farthest Mosque' was a building or prayer-site just outside Medina. The present building of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem had not been built in Muhammad's day, and the Quran does not contain any other reference to Jerusalem, apart from the reference to the change of the \"Qiblah\" from Jerusalem to Mecca. Jerusalem was Islam's first \"Qiblah\" (direction of prayer) in Muhammad's lifetime, however, this was later changed to the Kaaba in the Hijazi city of Mecca, following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel Jibril, by which it is understood by scholars that it was in answer to the rejection by the Jews of Muhammed's Prophetship.\n\nThe exact region referred to as being 'blessed' in the Qur'an, in verses like [17:1], [21:71] and [34:18], has been interpreted differently by various scholars. Abdullah Yusuf Ali likens it to a wide land-range including Syria and Lebanon, especially the cities of Tyre and Sidon; Az-Zujaj describes it as, \"Damascus, Palestine, and a bit of Jordan\"; Muadh ibn Jabal as, \"the area between al-Arish and the Euphrates\"; and Ibn Abbas as, \"the land of Jericho\". This overall region is referred to as \"Ash-Shām\" ().\n\nBahá'ís consider Acre and Haifa sacred as Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, was exiled to the prison of Acre from 1868 and spent his life in its surroundings until his death in 1892. In his writings he set the slope of Mount Carmel to host the Shrine of the Báb which his appointed successor `Abdu'l-Bahá erected in 1909 as a beginning of the terraced gardens there. The Head of the religion after him, Shoghi Effendi, began building other structures and the Universal House of Justice continued the work until the Bahá'í World Centre was brought to its current state as the spiritual and administrative centre of the religion. Its gardens are highly popular places to visit and Mohsen Makhmalbaf's 2012 film \"The Gardener\" featured them. The holiest places currently for Bahá'í pilgrimage are the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh in Acre and the Shrine of the Báb in Haifa which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "155899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155899", "title": "Human ecology", "text": "Human ecology\n\nHuman ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. The philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in ecology, geography, sociology, psychology, anthropology, zoology, epidemiology, public health, and home economics, among others.\n\nThe roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the Greeks and a lengthy list of developments in natural history science. Ecology also has notably developed in other cultures. Traditional knowledge, as it is called, includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge, intelligent relations, understanding, and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience. The term ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1866 and defined by direct reference to \"the economy of nature\".\n\nLike other contemporary researchers of his time, Haeckel adopted his terminology from Carl Linnaeus where human ecological connections were more evident. In his 1749 publication, \"Specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae\", Linnaeus developed a science that included the \"economy and polis of nature\". Polis stems from its Greek roots for a political community (originally based on the city-states), sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community. Linnaeus was also the first to write about the close affinity between humans and primates. Linnaeus presented early ideas found in modern aspects to human ecology, including the balance of nature while highlighting the importance of ecological functions (ecosystem services or natural capital in modern terms): \"In exchange for performing its function satisfactorily, nature provided a species with the necessaries of life\" The work of Linnaeus influenced Charles Darwin and other scientists of his time who used Linnaeus' terminology (i.e., the \"economy and polis of nature\") with direct implications on matters of human affairs, ecology, and economics.\n\nEcology is not just biological, but a human science as well. An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was Herbert Spencer. Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\", he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.\n\nThe history of human ecology has strong roots in geography and sociology departments of the late 19th century. In this context a major historical development or landmark that stimulated research into the ecological relations between humans and their urban environments was founded in George Perkins Marsh's book \"Man and Nature; or, physical geography as modified by human action\", which was published in 1864. Marsh was interested in the active agency of human-nature interactions (an early precursor to urban ecology or human niche construction) in frequent reference to the \"economy of nature\".\n\nIn 1894, an influential sociologist at the University of Chicago named Albion W. Small, collaborated with sociologist George E. Vincent and published a \"‘‘laboratory guide’’ to studying people in their ‘‘every-day occupations.’’\" This was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study society in a way that a natural historian would study birds. Their publication \"explicitly included the relation of the social world to the material environment.\"\n\nThe first English-language use of the term \"ecology\" is credited to American chemist and founder of the field of home economics, Ellen Swallow Richards. Richards first introduced the term as \"oekology\" in 1892, and subsequently developed the term \"human ecology\".\n\nThe term \"human ecology\" was published in 1907 in Ellen Swallow Richards work \"Sanitation in Daily Life\", defined there as \"the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men\". Richard's use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature. The term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book \"Introduction to the Science of Sociology\", published by Robert E. Park and Ernest W. Burgess (also from the sociology department at the University of Chicago). Their student, Roderick D. McKenzie helped solidify human ecology as a sub-discipline within the Chicago school. These authors emphasized the difference between human ecology and ecology in general by highlighting cultural evolution in human societies.\n\nHuman ecology has a fragmented academic history with developments spread throughout a range of disciplines, including: home economics, geography, anthropology, sociology, zoology, and psychology. Some authors have argued that geography is human ecology. Much historical debate has hinged on the placement of humanity as part or as separate from nature.\n\nBiological ecologists have traditionally been reluctant to study human ecology gravitating instead to the allure of wild nature. Human ecology has a history of focusing attention on humans’ impact on the biotic world. Paul Sears was an early proponent of applying human ecology, addressing topics aimed at the population explosion of humanity, global resource limits, pollution, and published a comprehensive account on human ecology as a discipline in 1954. He saw the vast “explosion” of problems humans were creating for the environment and reminded us that “what is important is the work to be done rather than the label.\" \"When we as a profession learn to diagnose the total landscape, not only as the basis of our culture, but as an expression of it, and to share our special knowledge as widely as we can, we need not fear that our work will be ignored or that our efforts will be unappreciated.\"\n\nHuman ecology has been defined as a type of analysis applied to the relations in human beings that was traditionally applied to plants and animals in ecology. Toward this aim, human ecologists (which can include sociologists) integrate diverse perspectives from a broad spectrum of disciplines covering \"wider points of view\". In its 1972 premier edition, the editors of \"Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal\" gave an introductory statement on the scope of topics in human ecology. Their statement provides a broad overview on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic:\n\n\nForty years later in the same journal, Daniel G. Bates (2012) notes lines of continuity in the discipline and the way it has changed:\n\nToday there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural ecology or even a specifically “human ecology” model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.\n\nWhile theoretical discussions continue, research published in \"Human Ecology Review\" suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology. Some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether. Scholarship has increasingly tended away from Gerald L. Young's idea of a \"unified theory\" of human ecological knowledge—that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline—and more toward the pluralism best espoused by Paul Shepard: that human ecology is healthiest when \"running out in all directions.\". But human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory, rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate, synthesize, and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature. This new human ecology emphasizes complexity over reductionism, focuses on changes over stable states, and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people.\n\nThe application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications, with Carl Linnaeus having played a seminal role. However, the term appears to have come into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century. This was strengthened in 1971 by the publication of Epidemiology as Medical Ecology, and again in 1987 by the publication of a textbook on Public Health and Human Ecology. An “ecosystem health” perspective has emerged as a thematic movement, integrating research and practice from such fields as environmental management, public health, biodiversity, and economic development. Drawing in turn from the application of concepts such as the social-ecological model of health, human ecology has converged with the mainstream of global public health literature.\n\nIn addition to its links to other disciplines, human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of Ellen Swallow Richards, among others. However, as early as the 1960s, a number of universities began to rename home economics departments, schools, and colleges as human ecology programs. In part, this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term home economics in a modernizing society, and reflects a recognition of human ecology as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become home economics. Current human ecology programs include Cornell University College of Human Ecology and the University of Alberta's Department of Human Ecology, among others.\n\nChanges to the Earth by human activities have been so great that a new geological epoch named the Anthropocene has been proposed. The human niche or ecological \"polis\" of human society, as it was known historically, has created entirely new arrangements of ecosystems as we convert matter into technology. Human ecology has created anthropogenic biomes (called anthromes). The habitats within these anthromes reach out through our road networks to create what has been called technoecosystems containing technosols. Technodiversity exists within these technoecosystems. In direct parallel to the concept of the ecosphere, human civilization has also created a technosphere. The way that the human species engineers or constructs technodiversity into the environment, threads back into the processes of cultural and biological evolution, including the human economy.\n\nThe ecosystems of planet Earth are coupled to human environments. Ecosystems regulate the global geophysical cycles of energy, climate, soil nutrients, and water that in turn support and grow natural capital (including the environmental, physiological, cognitive, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of life). Ultimately, every manufactured product in human environments comes from natural systems. Ecosystems are considered common-pool resources because ecosystems do not exclude beneficiaries and they can be depleted or degraded. For example, green space within communities provides sustainable health services that reduces mortality and regulates the spread of vector borne disease. Research shows that people who are more engaged with regular access to natural areas have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease and psychological disorders. These ecological health services are regularly depleted through urban development projects that do not factor in the common-pool value of ecosystems.\n\nThe ecological commons delivers a diverse supply of community services that sustains the well-being of human society. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, an international UN initiative involving more than 1,360 experts worldwide, identifies four main ecosystem service types having 30 sub-categories stemming from natural capital. The ecological commons includes provisioning (e.g., food, raw materials, medicine, water supplies), regulating (e.g., climate, water, soil retention, flood retention), cultural (e.g., science and education, artistic, spiritual), and supporting (e.g., soil formation, nutrient cycling, water cycling) services.\nGlobal assessments of biodiversity indicate that the current epoch, the Holocene (or Anthropocene) is a sixth mass extinction. Species loss is accelerating at 100–1000 times faster than average background rates in the fossil record. The field of conservation biology involves ecologists that are researching, confronting, and searching for solutions to sustain the planet's ecosystems for future generations.\n\n\"Human activities are associated directly or indirectly with nearly every aspect of the current extinction spasm.\"\n\nNature is a resilient system. Ecosystems regenerate, withstand, and are forever adapting to fluctuating environments. Ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time. However, persistent, systematic, large and nonrandom disturbance caused by the niche constructing behavior of human beings, habitat conversion and land development, has pushed many of the Earth's ecosystems to the extent of their resilient thresholds. Three planetary thresholds have already been crossed, including biodiversity loss, climate change, and nitrogen cycles. These biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and naturally resilient, but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an Anthropocene epoch, where the threshold for planetary scale resilience has been crossed and the ecological state of the Earth is deteriorating rapidly to the detriment of humanity. The world's fisheries and oceans, for example, are facing dire challenges as the threat of global collapse appears imminent, with serious ramifications for the well-being of humanity; while the Anthropocene is yet to be classified as an official epoch, current evidence suggest that \"an epoch-scale boundary has been crossed within the last two centuries.\" The ecology of the planet is further threatened by global warming, but investments in nature conservation can provide a regulatory feedback to store and regulate carbon and other greenhouse gases.\n\nIn 1992, William Rees developed the ecological footprint concept. The ecological footprint and its close analog the water footprint has become a popular way of accounting for the level of impact that human society is imparting on the Earth's ecosystems. All indications are that the human enterprise is unsustainable as the footprint of society is placing too much stress on the ecology of the planet. The WWF 2008 living planet report and other researchers report that human civilization has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet. This means that the footprint of human consumption is extracting more natural resources than can be replenished by ecosystems around the world.\n\nEcological economics is an economic science that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss. Natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities. Population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services. The prospect for recovery in the economic crisis of nature is grim. Populations, such as local ponds and patches of forest are being cleared away and lost at rates that exceed species extinctions. The mainstream growth-based economic system adopted by governments worldwide does not include a price or markets for natural capital. This type of economic system places further ecological debt onto future generations.\n\nHuman societies are increasingly being placed under stress as the ecological commons is diminished through an accounting system that has incorrectly assumed \"... that nature is a fixed, indestructible capital asset.\" The current wave of threats, including massive extinction rates and concurrent loss of natural capital to the detriment of human society, is happening rapidly. This is called a biodiversity crisis, because 50% of the worlds species are predicted to go extinct within the next 50 years. Conventional monetary analyses are unable to detect or deal with these sorts of ecological problems. Multiple global ecological economic initiatives are being promoted to solve this problem. For example, governments of the G8 met in 2007 and set forth The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative:\n\nIn a global study we will initiate the process of analyzing the global economic benefit of biological diversity, the costs of the loss of biodiversity and the failure to take protective measures versus the costs of effective conservation.\n\nThe work of Kenneth E. Boulding is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins. Boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics, most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system, and indicated that the “household of man” and the “household of nature” could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value.\n\nHuman ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind. People's perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate, both in time and in space. This concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability: \"think global, act local.\" Moreover, people's conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from \"community as place, community as way of life, or community of collective action.\"\n\nIn these early years, human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines: geography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research.\n\nWhile some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology, it was Sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art. Bill Carpenter (1986) calls human ecology the \"possibility of an aesthetic science,\" renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective. According to Carpenter, human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness.\n\nWhile the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing, there is no human ecology at the primary and secondary education levels. Educational theorist Sir Kenneth Robinson has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic (i.e.- educate their “whole being”) activities to implement a “new conception of human ecology”.\n\nIn the late 1960s, ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields, namely architecture, landscape architecture, and planning. Ian McHarg called for a future when all planning would be “human ecological planning” by default, always bound up in humans’ relationships with their environments. He emphasized local, place-based planning that takes into consideration all the “layers” of information from geology to botany to zoology to cultural history. Proponents of the new urbanism movement, like James Howard Kunstler and Andres Duany, have embraced the term human ecology as way to describe the problem of—and prescribe the solutions for—the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society. Duany has called the human ecology movement to be \"the agenda for the years ahead.\" While McHargian planning is still widely respected, the landscape urbanism movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations. Among these theorists is Frederich Steiner, who published \"Human Ecology: Following Nature's Lead\" in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape, culture, and planning. The work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology. While Steiner discusses specific ecological settings, such as cityscapes and waterscapes, and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions, he also takes a diverse approach to ecology—considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and political geography. Deiter Steiner's 2003 \"Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary\" view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology. Part literature review, the book is divided into four sections: \"human ecology\", \"the implicit and the explicit\", \"structuration\", and \"the regional dimension\". Much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity, antidualism, and wholeness of perspective.\n\n\n"}

The theory was originally developed to explain species richness of actual islands, principally oceanic. Under either name it is now used in reference to any ecosystem (present or past) that is isolated due to being surrounded by unlike ecosystems, and has been extended to mountain peaks, oases, fragmented forest, and even natural habitats isolated by human land development. The field was started in the 1960s by the ecologists Robert H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson, who coined the term \"island biogeography\" in their theory, which attempted to predict the number of species that would exist on a newly created island.\n\nFor biogeographical purposes, an insular environment or \"island\" is any area of habitat suitable for a specific ecosystem, surrounded by an expanse of unsuitable habitat. While this may be a traditional island—a mass of land surrounded by water—the term may also be applied to many nontraditional \"islands\", such as the peaks of mountains, isolated springs or lakes surrounded by desert, and non-contiguous woodlands. The concept is often applied to natural habitats surrounded by human-altered landscapes, such as expanses of grassland surrounded by highways or housing tracts, and national parks. Additionally, what is an insular for one organism may not be so for others, some organisms located on mountaintops may also be found in the valleys, while others may be restricted to the peaks.\n\nThe theory of insular biogeography proposes that the number of species found in an undisturbed insular environment (\"island\") is determined by immigration and extinction. And further, that the isolated populations may follow different evolutionary routes, as shown by Darwin's observation of finches in the Galapagos Islands. Immigration and emigration are affected by the distance of an island from a source of colonists (distance effect). Usually this source is the mainland, but it can also be other islands. Islands that are more isolated are less likely to receive immigrants than islands that are less isolated.\n\nThe rate of extinction once a species manages to colonize an island is affected by island size; this is the species-area curve or effect. Larger islands contain larger habitat areas and opportunities for more different varieties of habitat. Larger habitat size reduces the probability of extinction due to chance events. Habitat heterogeneity increases the number of species that will be successful after immigration.\n\nOver time, the countervailing forces of extinction and immigration result in an equilibrium level of species richness.\n\nIn addition to having an effect on immigration rates, isolation can also affect extinction rates. Populations on islands that are less isolated are less likely to go extinct because individuals from the source population and other islands can immigrate and \"rescue\" the population from extinction; this is known as the rescue effect.\n\nIn addition to having an effect on extinction, island size can also affect immigration rates. Species may actively target larger islands for their greater number of resources and available niches; or, larger islands may accumulate more species by chance just because they are larger. This is the target effect.\n\n\nThe theory can be studied through the fossils, which provide a record of life on Earth. 300 million years ago, Europe and North America lay on the equator and were covered by steamy tropical rainforests. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during the Carboniferous Period and as the climate grew drier, rainforests fragmented. Shrunken islands of forest were uninhabitable for amphibians but were well suited to reptiles, which became more diverse and even varied their diet in the rapidly changing environment; this Carboniferous rainforest collapse event triggered an evolutionary burst among reptiles.\n\nThe theory of island biogeography was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his student Daniel Simberloff in the mangrove islands in the Florida Keys. Species richness on several small mangroves islands were surveyed. The islands were fumigated with methyl bromide to clear their arthropod communities. Following fumigation the immigration of species onto the islands was monitored. Within a year the islands had been recolonised. Islands closer to the mainland recovered faster as predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography. The effect of island size was not tested, since all islands were of approximately equal size.\n\nResearch conducted at the rainforest research station on Barro Colorado Island has yielded a large number of publications concerning the ecological changes following the formation of islands, such as the local extinction of large predators and the subsequent changes in prey populations.\n\nWithin a few years of the publishing of the theory, its potential application to the field of conservation biology had been realised and was being vigorously debated in ecological circles. The idea that reserves and national parks formed islands inside human-altered landscapes (habitat fragmentation), and that these reserves could lose species as they 'relaxed towards equilibrium' (that is they would lose species as they achieved their new equilibrium number, known as ecosystem decay) caused a great deal of concern. This is particularly true when conserving larger species which tend to have larger ranges. A study by William Newmark, published in the journal Nature and reported in the New York Times, showed a strong correlation between the size of a protected U.S. National Park and the number of species of mammals.\n\nThis led to the debate known as single large or several small (SLOSS), described by writer David Quammen in \"The Song of the Dodo\" as \"ecology's own genteel version of trench warfare\". In the years after the publication of Wilson and Simberloff's papers ecologists had found more examples of the species-area relationship, and conservation planning was taking the view that the one large reserve could hold more species than several smaller reserves, and that larger reserves should be the norm in reserve design. This view was in particular championed by Jared Diamond. This led to concern by other ecologists, including Dan Simberloff, who considered this to be an unproven over-simplification that would damage conservation efforts. Habitat diversity was as or more important than size in determining the number of species protected.\n\nIsland biogeography theory also led to the development of wildlife corridors as a conservation tool to increase connectivity between habitat islands. Wildlife corridors can increase the movement of species between parks and reserves and therefore increase the number of species that can be supported, but they can also allow for the spread of disease and pathogens between populations, complicating the simple proscription of connectivity being good for biodiversity.\n\nIn species diversity, island biogeography most describes allopatric speciation. Allopatric speciation is where new gene pools arise out of natural selection in isolated gene pools. Island biogeography is also useful in considering sympatric speciation, the idea of different species arising from one ancestral species in the same area. Interbreeding between the two differently adapted species would prevent speciation, but in some species, sympatric speciation appears to have occurred.\n\n\n"}

They are highly reactive because of their large surface area. In the presence of oxygen and water, they rapidly oxidize to form free iron ions. They are widely used in medical and laboratory applications and have also been studied for remediation of industrial sites contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds.\nIron nanoparticles can be synthesized by the reduction of Fe(II) or Fe(III) salt with sodium borohydride in an aqueous medium.\n\nWhen exposed to oxygen and water, iron oxidizes. This redox process can occur under either acidic or neutral/basic conditions:\n\nResearch has shown that nanoscale iron particles can be effectively used to treat several forms of ground contamination, including grounds contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated organic solvents, and organochlorine pesticides. Nanoscale iron particle are easily transportable through ground water, allowing for in situ treatment. Additionally, the nanoparticle-water slurry can be injected into the contaminated area and stay there for long periods of time. These factors combine to make this method of cheaper than most currently used alternative.\n\nResearchers have found that although metallic iron nanoparticles remediate contaminants well, they tend to agglomerate on the soil surfaces. In response, carbon nanoparticles and water-soluble polyelectrolytes have been used as supports to the metallic iron nanoparticles. The hydrophobic contaminants adsorb to these supports, improving permeability in sand and soil.\n\nIn field tests have generally confirmed lab findings. However, research is still ongoing and nanoscale iron particles are not yet commonly used for treating ground contamination.\n\n\n2.http://www.chalcogen.infim.ro/1771_Yuvakkaur.pdf\n\n"}

From 1555 to his death he was Chamberlain of Exeter. He was twice MP for Exeter in 1570/1 and 1586, and for Athenry in Ireland in 1569 and wrote an influential treatise on parliamentary procedure. He wrote an eye-witness account of the siege of Exeter during the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549. He spent several years in Ireland as legal adviser to Sir Peter Carew, and following Carew's death in 1575 wrote his biography. He was one of the editors of the second edition of Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles\", published in 1587. His last, unpublished and probably uncompleted work was the first topographical description of the county of Devon. He founded a guild of Merchant Adventurers under a charter from Queen Mary. He was the uncle of Richard Hooker, the influential Anglican theologian.\n\nHooker was born at Bourbridge Hall in Exeter, Devon, England. He was the second son and eventual heir of Robert Vowell (d.1538) of Exeter \"alias\" Hooker by his third wife Agnes Dobell (or Doble), daughter of John Dobell of Woodbridge in Suffolk. His grandfather was John Vowell \"alias\" Hooker (d.1493), MP for Exeter.\n\nThe earliest recorded member of the Vowell family was Jenaph (or Seraph) Vowell of Pembroke in Wales, from whom John Hooker (d.1601) was 6th in descent. The original Welsh name was possibly \"ap-Howell\". Jenaph's son Jago Vowell married Alice Hooker, daughter and heiress of Richard Hooker of Hurst Castle, Southampton. Thus, as was commonly required in former times on receipt of an inheritance, the Vowell family assumed the name Hooker in the 15th century, but frequently retained the earlier name; in fact John Hooker was known as John Vowell for much of his life. By the time he was born the family had been prominent in Exeter for several generations.\n\nHooker received an excellent classical education, reading Roman law at Oxford followed by a period in Europe studying with leading Protestant divines, notably Pietro Martire Vermigli.\n\nDuring the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 Hooker experienced at first hand the siege of Exeter, and left a vivid manuscript account of its events in which he made no effort to conceal his anti-Catholic sympathies. From 1551 to 1553 he was employed by Myles Coverdale during his short incumbency as Bishop of Exeter. In 1555 he became the first chamberlain of Exeter, a post he held until his death.\n\nAs chamberlain he was responsible for the city's finances, he dealt with disputes between guilds and merchants, oversaw the rebuilding of the high school, planted many trees in the city, and collected and put in order the city's archives. He used these archives to compile his \"Annals\" of the City in which he details the characteristics of every Tudor mayor of Exeter, and in 1578 he wrote and published \"The Lives of the Bishops of Exeter\". In 1570/71 he was MP for Exeter.\n\nAt a time when it was deemed essential for cities and nations to have ancient lineage, Hooker described the supposed foundation of Exeter by Corinaeus, nephew of Brutus of Britain, son of Aeneas. He advocated emulating the governmental institutions of the Roman Republic, which in his opinion brought Rome to greatness, and held up the municipal government of Exeter as a model republican commonwealth worthy of emulation.\n\nIn 1568, possibly because he regarded himself as underpaid for the work he was doing for Exeter, Hooker was persuaded by Sir Peter Carew to accompany him to Ireland as his legal adviser. He organised Carew's papers in support of his claim for the barony of Idrone, a task to which he committed himself so deeply that in 1569 he was returned to the Irish parliament as member for Athenry. Hooker later wrote a biography of Carew, \"The dyscourse and dyscoverye of the lyffe of Sir Peter Carew\", in which he almost certainly understated the deceit and aggression behind Carew's Irish venture.\n\nUntil Carew's death in 1575, Hooker spent much time in Ireland, but he had also been returned to the English parliament in 1571 as one of the burgesses of Exeter. The session had lasted only a few weeks, but he kept a journal in which he accurately recorded the proceedings. His experiences in the Irish and English parliaments led him to write a treatise on parliamentary practice, \"The Order and Usage how to Keepe a Parlement in England\", which was published in two editions in 1572. One edition had a preface addressed to William FitzWilliam, Lord Deputy of Ireland and was clearly intended to bring order to the Irish assembly; the other was addressed to the Exeter city authorities, presumably to aid his successor burgesses. In writing his treatise Hooker took much inspiration from the Modus Tenendi Parliamentum, a treatise from the early 14th century.\n\nIn 1586 Hooker again represented Exeter in parliament. At this time he was one of the editors of the second edition of Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles\", published in 1587. Hooker's \"Order and Usage\" was included within it and he contributed an updated history of Ireland, with parts of his \"Life of Carew\" and a translation of \"Expugnatio Hibernica\" (\"Conquest of Ireland\") by Gerald of Wales. In his Irish section he made his religious and political sympathies very clear, repeatedly denouncing the Catholicism of the native Irish, seeing it as the cause both of their poverty and rebelliousness. Rome he described as \"the pestilent hydra\" and the pope \"the sonne of sathan, and the manne of sinne, and the enimie unto the crosse of Christ, whose bloodthirstiness will never be quenched\".\n\nHooker continued to serve Exeter in his later years, becoming coroner in 1583 and recorder in 1590. He was also appointed as steward of Bradninch by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587. By this time he was involved in the long task of organising and writing his historically-based description of his home county which he titled \"Synopsis Corographical of the county of Devon\". He probably started work on this before his antiquary friend Richard Carew began writing his similar \"Survey of Cornwall\". In writing his \"Synopsis\", Hooker was influenced by the style and structure of William Harrison's \"Description of England\", which had been published in 1577 as part of the first edition of Holinshed's \"Chronicles\".\n\nAlthough Hooker revised his \"Synopsis\" many times, he probably never completed it to his satisfaction. The work survives today as two almost identical manuscripts, one in the British Library the other in the Devon Record Office, which were used as source material for many later topographical descriptions of the county, including Thomas Westcote's \"Survey of Devon\" (1630) and Tristram Risdon's \"Chorographical Description or Survey of the County of Devon\" (c. 1632). He wrote an account of the Black Assize of Exeter in 1586 from which a virulent and deadly disease spread from prisoners in Exeter Prison to the courtroom in Exeter Castle and thence to the whole county.\n\nHe married twice:\n\nIn later life his health failed. He wrote: \"...my sight waxeth Dymme my hyringe [hearing] very thycke my speache imperfecte and my memory very feeble\". He died in Exeter on 8 November 1601 at the age of 76 and was buried at St Mary Major, Exeter.\n\n\n\n"}

The roundabout was named after the pearl monument that previously stood on the site and was destroyed on March 18, 2011 by government forces as part of a crackdown on protesters during the Bahraini uprising (2011–present).\n\nThe roundabout was located in the heart of the capital Manama and was surrounded by the Bahrain Central Market, Marina, Pearl and City Center Roundabout as well the Abraj Al Lulu (Pearl Towers) apartment complex, which is named after the Pearl Monument. Also near the destroyed roundabout are some of the city's major remaining landmarks, including the Bahrain World Trade Center and the Bahrain Financial Harbour.\n\nThe roundabout served originally as a major traffic intersection for routes into the capital city, although it is now bypassed by a flyover and junction complex built as part of Bahrain's 2030 modernization plan.\n\nThe Pearl Monument previously stood in the center of the circle, having been erected in 1982 on the occasion of the third summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which was hosted by Bahrain for the first time in Manama on November 9–11 of that year.\n\nThe Pearl Monument consisted of six dhow \"sails\" projecting up to the sky, which came together to hold a pearl at the top. The six sails designated the Gulf Cooperation Council's six member nations, while the pearl symbolized their united heritage and the country's famous history of pearl cultivation. At the base of the monument was a dodecagonal pool with fountain jets. The Pearl Monument is featured on the face of the Bahraini half-dinar coin, the highest value coin in Bahraini currency. The Central Bank of Bahrain reportedly asked banks to exchange their half-dinar coins for half-dinar banknotes after the Pearl Monument was destroyed. The coin is no longer minted or distributed by the Central Bank of Bahrain.\n\nOn the morning of March 18, 2011, the government tore down the Pearl Monument, announcing on state broadcaster BTV that the monument had been \"violated\" and \"desecrated\" by the \"vile\" anti-government protests, and had to be \"cleansed.\" In the government's haste, a migrant crane worker was crushed to death by a falling cement arch.\n\nThe Pearl Roundabout was the site of demonstrations during 2011, which began in February. It has been compared by the protesters to Cairo's Tahrir Square, the main site of demonstrations during the 2011 Egyptian revolution.\n\nOn 15 February 2011, after the funeral procession of Mr Ali Mushaima, more people joined the demonstrators and moved towards the Pearl Roundabout, where they arrived at around 15:00. By 15:15, demonstrators began to set up tents at the roundabout, and later in the day a projector screen was installed. Among these was a tent erected by members of the SMC medical staff. There were also a number of demonstrators obstructing traffic in the roundabout overpass. By nightfall, the number of demonstrators had reached several thousand. The roundabout and its immediate vicinity were congested with protesters and private vehicles. Police in the area neither engaged the demonstrators nor did they attempt to disperse them. King Hamad had ordered that members of the procession be allowed to occupy the Pearl Roundabout to express their sadness.\n\nOn 17 February 2011, while demonstrators were spending the night at the Pearl Roundabout, police forces entered the location at 3:00 in an attempt to disperse protesters. The crackdown led to many injuries as well as the death of at least four civilians (See Bloody Thursday (2011)).\n\nSoon after the police crackdown on demonstrators, Bahraini police official Al-Hassan appeared on national television to explain the previous night's events. Al-Hassan argued that demonstrators were warned beforehand and that they refused to leave the area. He also added that demonstrators were actually in possession of weapons such as knives and pistols. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, established by King Hamad of Bahrain to prepare a report on the events on February and March saw no evidence to suggest that protesters at the roundabout were armed.\n\nSoon after the police crackdown, Bahrain Defense Force tanks occupied Pearl Roundabout to stop demonstrators from occupying the area. Some demonstrators who stayed close to Salmaniya Hospital where injured demonstrators were being assisted tried to retake Pearl Roundabout and headed towards the area. Demonstrators were shot by forces camping in Pearl Roundabout.\n\nFollowing these events, the Crown Prince of Bahrain Salman Al Khalifa came on Bahrain state television and demanded calm of all parties. The following day, he ordered the military tanks to leave the Pearl Monument and protesters were allowed to occupy the area peacefully and were guaranteed by the Crown Prince that they would be able to demonstrate without any further attacks. On March 16, however, the protesters' camp in the roundabout was evacuated, bulldozed, and set on fire by the Bahraini Defense Force, riot police, and Peninsula Shield Force, two days before the Pearl Monument was demolished. An expatriate crane operator was crushed to death during the demolition by a piece of the monument which fell onto his crane cabin.\n\nAfter demolishing the Pearl Monument, the government announced that the roundabout would be replaced with traffic lights, possibly to ease congestion in the financial district. The government changed the name of the site to Al Farooq Junction, a reference to Umar ibn al-Khattab, a historical figure revered by Sunnis and considered by Shiites to be against their cause. The name of Al Farooq was given to the junction as well as the military operation by Khalifa Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, the head of security forces and a member of the royal family.\n\nAs of 25 February 2015, the public has been restricted from accessing Al Farooq Junction. The area has been sealed off by security forces since protesters were cleared from the Pearl Roundabout on 16 March 2011.\n\n (category)\n"}

An example is a point on the Earth representing the location of the Space Needle, or a point on Mars representing the location of the mountain, Olympus Mons. Most consumers use the term when referring to hotels, campsites, fuel stations or any other categories used in modern (automotive) navigation systems. \n\nUsers of a mobile devices can be provided with geolocation and time aware POI service, that recommends geolocations nearby and with a temporal relevance (e.g. POI to special services in a ski resort are available only in winter).\n\nIn medical fields such as histology/pathology/histopathology, points of interest are selected from the general background in a field of view; for example, among hundreds of normal cells, the pathologist may find 3 or 4 neoplastic cells that stand out from the others upon staining.\n\nA region of interest (ROI) and a volume of interest (VOI) are similar in concept, denoting a region or a volume (which may contain various individual POIs).\n\nThe term is widely used in cartography, especially in electronic variants including GIS, and GPS navigation software. In this context the synonym waypoint is common.\n\nA GPS point of interest specifies, at minimum, the latitude and longitude of the POI, assuming a certain map datum. A name or description for the POI is usually included, and other information such as altitude or a telephone number may also be attached. GPS applications typically use icons to represent different categories of POI on a map graphically.\n\nDigital maps for modern GPS devices typically include a basic selection of POI for the map area.\n\nHowever websites exist that specialize in the collection, verification, management and distribution of POI which end-users can load onto their devices to replace or supplement the existing POI. While some of these websites are generic, and will collect and categorize POI for any interest, others are more specialized in a particular category (such as speed cameras) or GPS device (e.g. TomTom/Garmin). End-users also have the ability to create their own custom collections.\n\nCommercial POI collections, especially those that ship with digital maps, or that are sold on a subscription basis are usually protected by copyright. However, there are also many websites from which royalty-free POI collections can be obtained, e.g. SPOI - Smart Points of Interest, which is distributed under ODbL license.\n\nThe applications for POI are extensive. As GPS-enabled devices as well as software applications that use digital maps become more available, so too the applications for POI are also expanding. Newer digital cameras for example can automatically tag a photograph using Exif with the GPS location where a picture was taken; these pictures can then be overlaid as POI on a digital map or satellite image such as Google Earth. Geocaching applications are built around POI collections. In Vehicle tracking systems POIs are used to mark destination points and/or offices to that users of GPS tracking software would easily monitor position of vehicles according to POIs.\n\nMany different file formats, including proprietary formats, are used to store point of interest data, even where the same underlying WGS84 system is used.\n\nReasons for variations to store the same data include:\n\nThe following are some of the file formats used by different vendors and devices to exchange POI (and in some cases, also navigation tracks):\n\n\nThird party and vendor-supplied utilities are available to convert point of interest data between different formats to allow them to be exchanged between otherwise incompatible GPS devices or systems. Furthermore, many applications will support the generic ASCII text file format, although this format is more prone to error due to its loose structure as well as the many ways in which GPS co-ordinates can be represented (e.g. decimal vs degree/minute/second). POI format converters are often named after the POI file format they convert and convert to, such as KML2GPX (converts KML to GPX) and KML2OV2 (converts KML to OV2).\n\n"}
{"id": "39516295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39516295", "title": "Pomato", "text": "Pomato\n\nThe pomato (or tomtato, ketchup and chips) is a grafted plant that is produced by grafting together a tomato plant and a potato plant, both of which are members of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. Cherry tomatoes grow on the vine, while white potatoes grow in the soil from the same plant.\n\nThe concept of grafting related potatoes and tomatoes so that both are produced on the same plant was originally developed in 1977 at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, and although healthy, the plant produced neither potatoes nor tomatoes. The Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne produced a plant with fruit in 1994.\n\nAs with all grafts, this plant will not occur in nature and cannot be grown from seed, because the two parts of the plant remain genetically separate, and only rely on each other for nourishment and growth. Like most standard types of plant grafting, a small incision is made in the stem of both plants and they are strapped together. Once the cuts have healed and the plants are joined, the leafy top of the potato plant can be cut away and the roots of the tomato can be removed, leaving the leaves of the tomato plant to nourish the roots of the potato plant. The rootstock (potato) acts as a stable and healthy root system and the scions (tomato) are chosen for their fruit, flowers or leaves. The tomatoes should be ready to harvest after about 12 weeks during the summer months, the potatoes should be ready after the tomato leaves begin to die back, normally in early autumn. Grafting in this way can be used to produce many different related crops from the same plant, for example the growing popularity of 'Fruit salad' trees, which is a single tree that produces multiple types of citrus fruits, or a tree with a variety of fruits with stones (peach, plum etc.).\n\nPomato plants have been seen as a new technology to make food production more efficient, as they maximize the amount of crops that can be produced on a piece of land or in a small urban environment like a balcony. This has significant impacts on developing countries like Kenya, where farmers can save on space, time and labor without affecting the quality of their produce by growing pomato plants. In addition, grafting can improve resistance to bacteria, viruses and fungi, attract a more diverse group of pollinators and provide a sturdy trunk for delicate ornamental plants.\n\nGrafted pomato plants were launched in the United Kingdom in September 2013 by horticultural mail order company Thompson & Morgan, who sold pre-grafted plants branded as the \"TomTato\". The Incredible Edible nursery in New Zealand announced a \"DoubleUP Potato Tom\" in the same month. Thompson & Morgan claim that this is the first time the plant has been produced commercially, and director Paul Hansord describes originating the tomtato idea himself 15 years ago in the US, when visiting a garden where someone had planted a potato under a tomato as a joke.\n\nGrafting is a difficult process because the tomato and the potato stems have to be the same thickness, and Thompson & Morgan trialed the hybrid for several years before selling it. Production and grafting of tomtatos begins in a specialist laboratory in the Netherlands, before being shipped back to the UK and grown in greenhouses until they are ready to be sold.\n"}

It holds conferences about new developments in traffic separation and satellite navigation. It has charitable status and a Royal charter.\n\nThe organisation was formed in 1947 as the Institute of Navigation and was patterned after the US Institute of Navigation. Both organizations had been influenced by the role navigation had helped in moving troops and supplies during Second World War. Emerging technology such as radar and LORAN increased in the years following the war. The Institute sought to provide a forum where academics, engineers, mariners, and pilots could learn, exchange information, and share personal experiences.\n\nThe Institute's founding membership included several notable professionals in the field. From the field of astronomy Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the Astronomer-Royal was the first president. The first two vice-presidents represented the field of aviation in Air Chief Marshal Sir John Slessor (Deputy Chief of the Air Staff) and the development of radar in Sir Robert Watson-Watt. Marine navigation was represented by Michael Richey who became the first Executive Secretary. The following year Richey would found the Institute's official academic publication, the Journal of Navigation.\n\nThe Institute expanded its focus in the 1950s and 1960s to also address issues of safety and began collaborating with similar organizations in Europe. In 1972, at its 25th anniversary, its work was recognized by Her Majesty the Queen and it became entitled to the \"Royal\" prefix and was renamed the Royal Institute of Navigation.\n\nThe Institute sponsors conferences, publications, and reports related to navigation. In 2017 its international conference included comtemporary topics as artificial intelligence, cyber threats, and machine learning. It also co-sponsored a report to the UK government on the economic impact of a 5-day loss of geopositioning systems.\n"}

After last-minute preparations, the ship, under the command of Lieutenant Edwin J. De Haven and in company with , put to sea from New York on 23 May 1850.\n\nStorms battered the two ships on the initial leg of the voyage and separated them. However, both safely reached Disko Island, located off the west coast of Greenland where Davis Strait gives way to Baffin Bay. \"Advance\" arrived on 24 June, and \"Rescue\" pulled into port three days later. On the 29th, the two ships headed into Baffin Bay, bound for Lancaster Sound located north of Baffin Island and south of Devon Island. Off Haroe Island on 1 July, \"Advance\" encountered pack ice. A week later, she and her consort were caught in the pack just north of Upernavik. For the next three weeks, the two ships fought their way through the ice. On the 29th, they cleared the pack and continued their voyage across Melville Bay to Lancaster Sound. The two ships entered the sound on 19 August and, that same day, encountered two British vessels engaged in the same mission as the Americans.\n\nThat evening, a storm blew up and separated \"Advance\" and \"Rescue\". The next day dawned \"thick and foggy,\" but the wind had abated. \"Advance\" began searching for her companion. By 25 August, she was off Cape Riley on Devon Island where she put ashore a landing party to search for clues to the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition. While the searchers ashore were discovering the former campsite of some unidentified party, \"Advance\" was run aground by a strong current. The British ship \"Prince Albert\" offered assistance, but \"Rescue\" showed up at about the same time. Moreover, \"Advance\" lightened her load and succeeded in hauling off by her own efforts.\n\nOn 26 August, the two ships attempted the passage of Wellington Channel to search the area north of Cape Spencer. Soon, however, they found the way north blocked by a solid mass of pack ice and prudently returned south to the vicinity of Point Innes. There, the Americans again encountered the British, along with positive evidence of the Franklin party having camped nearby. Heartened by that find and by a favorable change in weather conditions, they headed back toward Wellington Channel. At Beechy Island, all the search vessels gathered in a cove (later called Union Bay) to plan a coordinated search. While the leading officers were so engaged, a party sent ashore discovered three graves and \"other unmistakable evidences of the missing expedition (Franklin's) having passed its first winter here.\" At that point, she and \"Rescue\" entered Wellington Channel to pursue the search, but the pack ice quickly closed in upon the two ships. Though they tried to escape the clutches of the pack, abysmal weather foiled their attempts; and \"Rescue\" suffered a damaged rudder. By mid-September, they were caught fast in the floating ice.\n\nFor the duration of the winter, \"Advance\" and \"Rescue\" were at the mercy of the drifting floe. For what remained of September and most of October, they drifted in Wellington Channel, discovering the northern peninsula of Devon Island which they named Grinnell in honor of the expedition's benefactor. During November, changing winds carried them back and forth past Beechy Island. In December, the floe made the transit of Lancaster Sound and, on 14 January 1851, they reentered Baffin Bay. Their imprisonment, however, did not end until early June. They had passed Davis Strait in May, and the floe began to break up near the end of the first week in June. \"Rescue\" – repaired – cleared the pack on 7 June 1851. \"Advance\" followed the next day.\n\nThe expedition replenished at Disko Bay and sought to renew the search. However, the ice proved heavier than in the previous year; and prudence dictated that the mission be abandoned for the time being. Therefore, the two ships headed back to the United States. \"Advance\" arrived in New York on 30 September 1851, and \"Rescue\" reached that port on 7 October. Both ships were returned to Mr. Grinnell, and he immediately began outfitting \"Advance\" for another Arctic expedition.\n\nPreparations for the second Franklin rescue expedition took about 20 months. \"Advance\" finally departed New York on 30 May 1853, Passed Assistant Surgeon Elisha Kent Kane in command. The expedition stopped at Upernavik, Greenland, to purchase supplies and, most importantly, sled dogs for searches ashore and on the solidly frozen floes. Continuing north, \"Advance\" passed the length of Baffin Bay reaching Smith Sound — the northern terminus of Baffin Bay — by 7 August. Near the end of August, she reached her northernmost point — about 78°43' north latitude — in Kane Basin, named for the ship's commanding officer, Passed Assistant Surgeon Kane.\n\nAt that point, Kane decided to pass the winter among a group of islets near the Greenland coast rather than to return south to some safer harbor. By 10 September, \"Advance\" was imprisoned in the ice. The interior of the ship underwent extensive preparations for wintering farther north than any previous expedition. When that was complete, the crew began expeditions across the frozen wastes both on the Greenland shore and the frozen pack. Kane and his officers also established a scientific station to observe climatic conditions and to make astronomical calculations.\n\nTheir expeditions on foot, however, were hampered by the loss of almost all their sled dogs to disease. In the absence of animal transport, the men themselves carried out the searches and explorations on foot, serving as beasts of burden to manhandle caches of supplies to points which would allow for more distant searches in the future.\n\nOn one such expedition in late March 1854, four of the party suffered so severely from frostbite that they had to be left behind under the care of a fifth man while the remaining members of the party — too physically exhausted to do more than drag their own persons across the frozen wastes — headed back to the brig for help. The leader of that group, upon returning to the brig, volunteered to return with the rescue party as a guide. However, his own ordeal caused him to fall victim of a temporary mental disorder and prevented him from rendering any real help. It was only good luck — first in finding the advanced party's trail and then in sighting a canvas tent at the site of the disabled men's \"encampment\" — and their own Herculean efforts that allowed the rescue party to complete their mission. Even that success, however, was marred by the fact that two of the rescued men later succumbed to their infirmities. \n\nFatigue and illness of all associated with the rescue expedition prevented Kane from undertaking further searches until the end of April. During that interlude, Greenlandic Inuit arrived in the area, and Kane bartered with them for additional sled dogs. The four animals he thus obtained allowed him to fit out a single seven-dog team which greatly extended the range of their searches. In his own words, \"The value of these animals for Arctic ice-travel (sic) can hardly be over-estimated (sic).\" Through the ensuing summer, search parties ranged the far northern coasts of Greenland and the eastern coast of Ellesmere Island searching for evidence of Sir John Franklin's party and making notes on geography and climate.\n\n\"Advance's\" crewmen passed the second winter in a state of near hibernation. The difficulties of the previous year had sapped their strength, and their provisions were too scant to restore it. Scurvy — that dread disease of the sea — riddled their ranks to the point that Kane and one other man \"... only remained to attend upon the sick, and carry on the daily work of the ship, if that name could still appropriately designate the burrow which we inhabited.\" The sun returned late in February 1855, and wild game followed it in March. Reasonably adequate food and the sunlight slowly brought the men back some semblance of full strength. At that point, Kane decided to abandon the ship — still frozen solidly in the floe — and make it across the ice to the Danish settlements of southern Greenland. Shortages of fuel and food, as well as the weakened condition of the crew, made that decision inescapable. \n\nPreparations for the journey were multifaceted and complicated. Those capable of work prepared two 25-foot whaleboats and a 13-foot dinghy by mounting them on iron-shod wooden runners and then loading them with provisions. Meanwhile, Kane took the dog sled and team out to an abandoned Inuit hut located some 35 miles from the brig. There, he established an advanced depot to store provisions for the actual journey. During April and the first half of May, he made several trips carrying supplies to his makeshift way station. On 15 May 1855, he began transporting the incapacitated members of the crew to the way station. Two days later, the main group began its torturous trek across the ice hummocks with the three boat-sleds. The main party, without the assistance of dogs, managed a snail's pace of only some three and one-half miles a day. While the main group inched its way, Kane continued his more rapid trips — facilitated by the dogs — both back to the brig and to an Inuit camp located about 75 miles south of the ship. In this manner, he moved the sick to the way station, brought additional supplies from the ship, and returned from the Inuit camp with fresh game. He last visited the ship on 8 June 1855 and, by the middle of that month, all the sick gradually joined the main party then nearing Littleton Island. The mode of travel again was Kane's dog sled During the journey south toward Cape Alexander, the party suffered numerous breaks through the ice as the spring thaw arrived. At least one man, Acting Carpenter Ohlsen, died from exposure resulting from such an incident.\n\nBy 18 June, the entire party reached open water at the edge of the floe near Cape Alexander. The journey had netted them only 81 miles in 31 days, but the numerous cutbacks and detours, necessitated by the ice hummocks, resulted in an actual trek of over 300 miles. From that point, they took to the boats. During the next phase of the journey, they alternated between runs across open water under sail and marches across frozen ice hummocks when necessary. By 21 July 1855, the men reached Cape York, the point at which they would begin the transit to Upernavik. There, they erected a rock monument in which they left information regarding their planned movements, a list of provisions on hand, and a brief summary of the expedition's findings. That project completed, Kane and his crew started out across Melville Bay. On 6 August, Kane led his exhausted party into Upernavik. They took passage from Upernavik in the Danish brig \"Marianne\" to Disko Island where they were met by the relief expedition made up of and under the command of Lt. Hartstene. The two relief ships brought the survivors into New York on 11 October 1855. Presumably, the pack ice eventually crushed and sank the abandoned \"Advance\".\n\n\n"}
