{"id": "45496024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45496024", "title": "A Matter of Time (Cook novel)", "text": "A Matter of Time (Cook novel)\n\nA Matter of Time is a novel by Glen Cook, combining elements of science fiction (specifically, time travel), crime fiction and spy thriller. In regard to the last, the novel in particular takes up and expands the theme of American prisoners of war being brainwashed in Communist China and their loyalties reversed – a theme made famous through the novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and film made on its basis.\n\nThe book was re-published in 2011, along with other earlier works of Glen Cook.\n\nThe book has three distinct plot lines, set out in alternating chapters, and weaving back and forth in time. The reader, sharing the various points of view of the alternating characters, is in effect omniscient, knowing many things which are a mystery to the characters themselves.\n\nThe main plot line centers on Norman Cash, a middle aged police detective sergeant at St. Louis, Missouri and his younger partner John Harald. On 3 March 1975, the police is perplexed at finding a body on a snowbound street. The man had died of unclear causes, cannot be identified or accounted for by any investigation, is not on file anywhere and carried nothing on his body except for a handful of American coins from the early 20th Century – the latest being a 1921 coin in mint condition.\n\nThe body was found near the home of an old lady of Central European origin named Fiala Groloch, who politely receives the police in her old-fashioned parlor, offering them tea. There is no evidence against her but Cash still feels suspicious – especially when records show the woman to be incredibly old, having lived in the same house continually since 1869. Also, old police records show that in 1921 a small-time criminal named Jack O'Brian disappeared mysteriously on the same spot; the police at the time suspected Groloch of killing him – since he had been her lover and badly abused her – but were never able to find the body. Some witnesses are found to testify that the body found in 1975 does strongly resemble the Jack O'Brian who disappeared in 1921. However, in order to link the two cases it must be assumed that time travel exists, a conclusion Cash's commander shies away from, for fear of being ridiculed should the story leak to the media, and Cash is ordered to take up other cases.\n\nAt the time, the fall of South Vietnam hits Cash hard, reviving the trauma of his soldier son Michael having gone missing in action in Vietnam back in 1967 and no certain information of his fate ever being found out. It increases the tie between Cash and his partner John, Michael's childhood friend who had been with him in Vietnam on the day he was lost.\n\nAfter some time, Cash takes up the Groloch investigation again, and from a rather \"loony\" affair it becomes deadly serious and grim: evidence is discovered that at various times people who went into the old lady's house disappeared without a trace, including several armed gangsters; then Cash's partner John also disappears when attempting an unauthorized search of the house; when police raid the house in force, they find the old lady gone, and mysterious machinery hidden in the basement turns out to be bobby-trapped, exploding and causing more police casualties; then in another part of the town, the house of a doctor – also a refugee from Europe – burns and mysterious bodies are found in the wreckage – which seems somehow tied to the Groloch affair; and the CIA turns out to have a considerable interest in all these doings... Cash, now bitterly determined to settle accounts with the sinister Groloch, has one ace left up his sleeve: he knows of another Groloch who had been living for a century at Rochester, New York, assumes that the fugitive woman went there, and sets out in pursuit.\n\nIn a dystopian 2058, the world is in the grip of a totalitarian State in which Czechs are the top dogs, and the center of power is the fearsome headquarters of the Agency for State Security at Prague. The State's virtually invincible weapon is the Tachyon Displacement Data Transfer System by which the Agency can send messages into the past, warn itself of coming threats and take action to eliminate them. The system is tended by the brilliant Zumsteg brothers, Otho and Stephan, who are honest in their way and completely devoted to the State. But the psychotic Colonel Neulist, consumed with jealousy of the Zumstegs and angry because Otho's daughter Marda rejected his advances, bursts into the chamber and starts wildly shooting – causing the Tachyon system to explode. Everybody's physical bodies are destroyed, but the personalities of both the Zumstegs and their foe \nNeulist are hurled into the past.\n\nThe three Zumstegs find themselves in 1866, inhabiting the bodies of peasants in the then obscure village of Lidice; few people show an interest in the doings of these peasants while the great Battle of Königgrätz is fought some kilometers away. Knowing that Neulist might eventually appear in the past, the Zumstegs take the name of Groloch. In possession of advanced medical knowledge which can extend human lifespan to two hundred years and more, they decide to take the slow road back to their own time. Two of them cross the Atlantic and hole up in America, patiently waiting for the 21st Century and for their beloved State to arise – Marda Zumsteg/Fiala Groloch in St. Louis, and her uncle Stephan, as Fian Groloch, in Rochester. The third, Otho Zumsteg/Fial Groloch, remains in Bohemia, taking up residence in the village of Lidice.\n\nHowever, the vengeful Neulist does appear eventually and gets on his tracks. In 1942, it is the nefarious Neulist who manipulates the Nazi occupiers to destroy Lidice, causing one of the most notorious atrocities of World War II to be perpetrated just in order that his hated rival be among the victims. After the war, Neulist goes to America to settle accounts with the other two Zumstegs. He eventually gets on the trace in St. Louis, and is behind some of the sinister events which perplexed Sergeant Cash. When Fiala Groloch flees to Rochester, Neulist is also in hot pursuit of her.\n\nIn Beijing, the genius psychologist and spy master Huang Hua had spent decades secretly improving the methods of brainwashing which had not worked out in the Korean War. With the outbreak of the Vietnam War, the Chinese get their North Vietnamese allies to secretly deliver some American prisoners to Huang's installation in the Gobi Desert.\n\nAmong these prisoners, considered MIA's in the US, is Sergeant Cash's son Michael Cash. Huang's techniques work on him and he becomes an ardent Maoist, committed to overthrowing American Imperialism and dreaming of himself becoming the American Mao. Huang decides to keep him and a few other Americans in China, while other brainwashed prisoners are sent back to Vietnam and eventually repatriated – to act as Chinese sleeper agents in the US.\n\nMichael Cash rises high within the Chinese espionage system. Still, he remains flawed from Huang's point of view, being still motivated by personal feelings and not having achieved the requisite complete ruthlessness. In particular, he retains his friendship with a fellow-prisoner, Sergeant A.O.\"Snake\" Cantrell. A fierce individualist resisting all authority, Capitalist or Communist alike, Cantrell proved immune to even the worse which Huang could do. He was destined to be sent to hard labor and die unknown in China – but Michael Cash connives at letting him join the repatriated prisoners, carrying back his knowledge of the Chinese brainwashing program. An observant journalist suspects that the returning POW's had been brainwashed and talks to Cantrell – but Cantrell refuses to be involved in anti-Communist propaganda, either, eventually ending up as a rock guitar player in Britain. Still, some editorials in the US point to the possibility of brainwashing, and Huang discovers the source of the leak.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Cash had been sent to Prague, to establish Chinese contacts with dissenting elements in the local Communist Party towards an eventual showdown between China and the USSR. He succeeds in the mission – but has also fallen deeply in love with his Czech Communist contact person, a woman named Ilse, left her bearing his child, and dreams hopelessly of building a life with her. However, Huang – far from open to his agent's romantic dreams – is furious at discovering Cash's having let Cantrell get away and endanger the entire program.\n\nMichael Cash is sternly ordered to \"correct his egoistic mistake\" and himself go to Britain and assassinate his friend. Cash – knowing that refusal would lead to his liquidation and that Cantrell would then be killed anyway by another Chinese agent – goes through with shooting Cantrell by sniper rifle during a performance. However, he vows revenge on Huang, who had forced him into this \"act of cannibalism\".\n\nThe book's diverging plot lines come together with the explosive showdown at Rochester. Detective Cash catches up with the fugitive Grolochs, but their nemesis Neulist also comes on the scene. In the confrontation Norman Cash learns that his son Michael is still alive and is in China. Neulist fatally shoots the Grolochs and escapes. Before dying, Fiala Groloch – of whom Cash thought as an ancient old lady – reveals to Cash that in fact she is his great-granddaughter from the 21st Century, and that his son Michael was her grandfather.\n\nMichael Cash is destined to be one of the major figures of human history, as influential in the second half of the 20th Century as Hitler was in its first half. When the Chinese and Russians embark on an all-out confrontation and smash each other up, Michael Cash would escape to Prague and – along with his Czech beloved, Ilse Zumsteg – would forge a new power hub centered on the Czech capital, becoming a world dictator of unprecedented power.\n\nHaving been given this shattering information, the shaken father Norman Cash is now in a position to change the course of history. He could still avert this entire future and redeem his lost son.\n\nReviewer Malcolm Wide noted that\n\nCook's \"A Matter of Time\" was written in 1984 and published in 1985 – at the same time that Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in Moscow, but before the public in the West became aware that perestroika was a radical departure from all that had gone before. This was in essence the last 'window of opportunity' for an American writer to write a Cold War book holding out the specter of a Communist takeover. ... Detective Sergeant Norman Cash believes that \"The Fall of Saigon marked the East's watershed victory in World War III. The West had been fighting a halfhearted and half-assed delaying action since 1945; Vietnam had marked the beginning of the end. From the fall of Saigon onward the collapse would cease to be gradual. The West, whether good or evil or whatever, was about to come apart, and at a rate which, historically speaking, would be precipitous. Cash supposed that he would live long enough to see the barbarians at the gates himself\" (though he would hardly conceive of the idea that the barbarians' chieftain would be his own son ...). Already in 1986, it would have been implausible – to say the least – to seriously promote this view of the situation. ...\" A Matter of Time\" could be seen as setting a suitable coda to a very extensive genre, which exercised a considerable influence over popular imagination over decades. As such, it does possess some original and unique features. A renegade American setting up a global Communist dictatorship centered on Prague is an idea whose like was never conceived of before. ... One may, if one wishes, regard the world where we actually live today as resulting from Detective Sergeant Cash catching up with his prodigal son in London and preventing Michael from assassinating his Vietnam buddy.\n\n"}

{"id": "913125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=913125", "title": "Anti-German sentiment", "text": "Anti-German sentiment\n\nAnti-German sentiment (or Germanophobia) is defined as an opposition to or fear of Germany, its inhabitants, its culture and the German language. Its opposite is Germanophilia. The sentiment largely began with the mid-19th century unification of Germany, which made the new nation a rival to the Great Powers of Europe on economic, manufacturing, and military grounds.\n\nIn the 1860s Russia experienced an outbreak of Germanophobia, mainly restricted to a small group of writers in St. Petersburg who had united around a right-wing newspaper. It began in 1864 with the publication of an article by a writer (using the pseudonym \"Shedoferotti\") who proposed that Poland be given autonomy and that the privileges of the German barons in the Baltic governorates and Finland be preserved. Mikhail Katkov published a harsh criticism of the article in the \"Moscow News\", which in turn caused a flood of angry articles in which Russian writers expressed their irritation with Europeans, some of which featured direct attacks on Germans.\n\nThe following year, 1865, the 100th anniversary of the death of Mikhail Lomonosov was marked throughout the Russian empire. Articles were published mentioning the difficulties Lomonosov had encountered from the foreign members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, most of whom had been of German descent. The authors then criticized contemporary German scholars for their neglect of the Russian language and for printing articles in foreign languages while receiving funds from the Russian people. It was further suggested by some writers that Russian citizens of German origin who did not speak Russian and follow the Orthodox faith should be considered foreigners. It was also proposed that people of German descent be forbidden from holding diplomatic posts as they might not have \"solidarity with respect to Russia\".\n\nDespite the press campaign against Germans, Germanophobic feelings did not develop in Russia to any widespread extent, and died out, due to the Imperial family's German roots and the presence of many German names in the Russian political elite.\n\nNegative comments about Germany had begun to appear in Britain in the 1870s, following the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71. Criticisms were expressed in the press and in the birth of the invasion novel (e.g. \"The Battle of Dorking\"), many of which focused on the idea that Britain might be Germany's next victim.\n\nIn 1887, the label \"Made in Germany\" was introduced, to get British buyers to adhere to the concept of \"buying British\". After suffering slight losses, German manufacturers soon found the label to be of good use.\n\nIn the 1890s there was widespread hostility towards foreigners in Britain, mainly directed against eastern European Jews but also including Germans. Joseph Bannister believed that German residents in Britain were mostly \"gambling-house keepers, hotel-porters, barbers, 'bullies', runaway conscripts, bath-attendants, street musicians, criminals, bakers, socialists, cheap clerks, etc\". Interviewees for the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration believed that Germans were involved in prostitution and burglary, and many people also viewed Germans working in Britain as threatening the livelihood of Britons by being willing to work for longer hours.\n\nAnti-German hostility deepened since early 1896 after the Kruger telegram of Kaiser Wilhelm II, in which he congratulated President Kruger of the Transvaal on resisting the British Jameson Raid. Attacks on Germans in London were reported in the German press at the time but do not appear to have actually occurred. The \"Saturday Review (London)\" suggested \"be ready to fight Germany, as \"Germania delenda est\"\" (\"Germany is to be destroyed\", a reference to the coda against the Carthaginians adopted by Cato the Elder's speeches in the second Roman Republic). The Kaiser's reputation was further degraded by his angry tirade and the Daily Telegraph Affair.\nFollowing the signing of the Entente Cordiale in 1904 between Britain and France, official relationships cooled as did popular attitudes towards Germany and German residents in Britain. A fear of German militarism replaced a previous admiration for German culture and literature. At the same time, journalists produced a stream of articles on the threat posed by Germany. In the Daily Telegraph Affair of 1908–1909, the Kaiser humiliated himself and further soured relations by his intemperate attacks on Britain.\n\nIn 1894 Alfred Harmsworth commissioned author William Le Queux to write the serial novel \"The Great War in England in 1897\", which featured France and Russia combining forces to crush Britain, who was, with German intervention, able to rally a force to turn the tide. Twelve years later Harmsworth asked him to change sentiment, promising the full support of his formidable advertising capabilities. The result was the bestselling \"The Invasion of 1910\", which originally appeared in serial form in the \"Daily Mail\" in 1906 and has been referred to by historians as inducing an atmosphere of paranoia, mass hysteria and Germanophobia that would climax in the Naval Scare of 1908–09. Articles in the \"Daily Mail\" regularly advocated anti-German sentiments throughout the 20th century, telling British readers to refuse service at restaurants by Austrian or German waiters on the claim that they were spies and told them that if a German-sounding waiter claimed to be Swiss that they should demand to see the waiter's passport. In 1903 Erskine Childers published \"The Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service\" a novel in which two Englishmen uncover a plot by Germany to Invade England; it was later made into a 1979 film The Riddle of the Sands.\n\nAt the same time, conspiracy theories were concocted combining Germanophobia with antisemitism, concerning the supposed foreign control of Britain, some of which blamed Britain's entry into the Boer War on international financiers \"chiefly German in origin and Jewish in race\". Most of these ideas about German-Jewish conspiracies originated from right-wing figures such as Arnold White, Hilaire Belloc, and Leo Maxse, the latter using his publication the \"National Review\" to spread them.\n\nIn 1914 when the German army invaded neutral Belgium and northern France many thousands of Belgian and French civilians were accused of being francs-tireurs and executed. These acts were used to encourage anti-German sentiments and the Allied Powers produced propaganda depicting Germans as \"Huns\" capable of infinite cruelty and violence.\n\nIn Great Britain, anti-German feeling led to infrequent rioting, assaults on suspected Germans and the looting of stores owned by people with German-sounding names, occasionally even taking on an antisemitic tone.\nIncreasing anti-German hysteria even threw suspicion upon the British royal family. King George V was persuaded to change his German name of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor and relinquish all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects. Prince Louis of Battenberg was not only forced to change his name to Mountbatten, he was forced to resign as First Sea Lord, the most senior position in the Royal Navy.\n\nThe German Shepherd breed of dog was renamed to the euphemistic \"Alsatian\"; the English Kennel Club only re-authorised the use of 'German Shepherd' as an official name in 1977.\n\nAttitudes to Germany were not entirely negative among British troops fighting on the Western Front; the British writer Nicholas Shakespeare quotes this statement from a letter written by his grandfather during the First World War in which he says he would rather fight the French and describes German bravery:\n\nRobert Graves who like the King also had German relatives, wrote shortly after the war during his time at Oxford University as an undergraduate that: \nIn Canada, there was some anti-German sentiment in Waterloo County, Ontario, primarily in the city of Berlin, Ontario before and during WW I and some cultural sanctions on the community. There were anti-German riots in Victoria, British Columbia and Calgary, Alberta in the first years of the war.\n\nIt was this anti-German sentiment that precipitated the Berlin to Kitchener name change in 1916. The city was named after Lord Kitchener, famously pictured on the \"Lord Kitchener Wants You\" recruiting posters. Several streets in Toronto that had previously been named for Liszt, Humboldt, Schiller, Bismarck, etc., were changed to names with strong British associations, such as Balmoral.\n\nThe Governor General of Canada, the Duke of Connaught, while visiting Berlin, Ontario, in May 1914, had discussed the importance of Canadians of German ethnicity (regardless of their origin) in a speech: \"It is of great interest to me that many of the citizens of Berlin are of German descent. I well know the admirable qualities – the thoroughness, the tenacity, and the loyalty of the great Teutonic Race, to which I am so closely related. I am sure that these inherited qualities will go far in the making of good Canadians and loyal citizens of the British Empire\".\n\nHowever, by 1919 most of the population of what would become Kitchener, Waterloo, and Elmira were \"Canadian\"; over 95 percent had been born in Ontario. \nThe German-speaking Mennonites were pacifist so they could not enlist and the few who had immigrated from Germany (not born in Canada) could not morally fight against a country that was a significant part of their heritage.\nNews reports during the war years indicate that \"A Lutheran minister was pulled out of his house ... he was dragged through the streets. German clubs were ransacked through the course of the war. It was just a really nasty time period.\". A document in the Archives of Canada makes the following comment: \"Although ludicrous to modern eyes, the whole issue of a name for Berlin highlights the effects that fear, hatred and nationalism can have upon a society in the face of war.\" \nAcross Canada, internment camps opened in 1915 and 8,579 \"enemy aliens\" were held there until the end of the war; many were German speaking immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany, and the Ukraine. Only 3,138 were classed as prisoners of war; the rest were civilians.\nBuilt in 1926, the Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower in rural Kitchener, Ontario, commemorates the settlement by the Pennsylvania Dutch (actually Pennsilfaanisch \"Deitsch\" or \"German\") of the Grand River area in the 1800s in what later became Waterloo County, Ontario.\n\nThere was also anti-German sentiment in Canada during World War II. Under the War Measures Act, some 26 POW camps opened and were filled with those who had been born in Germany, Italy, and particularly in Japan, if they were deemed to be \"enemy aliens\". For Germans, this applied especially to single males who had some association with the Nazi Party of Canada. No compensation was paid to them after the war. In Ontario, the largest internment centre for German Canadians was at Camp Petawawa, housing 750 who had been born in Germany and Austria.\n\nIn Australia, an official proclamation of August 10, 1914 required all German citizens to register their domiciles at the nearest police station and to notify authorities of any change of address. Under the later Aliens Restriction Order of May 27, 1915, enemy aliens who had not been interned had to report to the police once a week and could only change address with official permission. An amendment to the Restriction Order in July 1915 prohibited enemy aliens and naturalized subjects from changing their name or the name of any business they ran. Under the War Precautions Act of 1914 (which survived the First World War), publication of German language material was prohibited and schools attached to Lutheran churches were forced to abandon German as the language of teaching or were closed by the authorities. German clubs and associations were also closed.\n\nThe original German names of settlements and streets were officially changed. In South Australia, \"Grunthal\" became \"Verdun\" and \"Krichauff\" became \"Beatty\". In New South Wales \"Germantown\" became \"Holbrook\" after the submarine commander Norman Douglas Holbrook. This pressure was strongest in South Australia where 69 towns changed their names, including Petersburg, South Australia, which became Peterborough (see Australian place names changed from German names).\n\nMost of the anti-German feeling was created by the press that tried to create the idea that all those of German birth or descent supported Germany uncritically. A booklet circulated widely in 1915 claimed that \"there were over 3,000 German spies scattered throughout the states\". Anti-German propaganda was also inspired by local and British companies who were keen to take the opportunity to eliminate Germany as a competitor in the Australian market. Germans in Australia were increasingly portrayed as evil by the very nature of their origins.\n\nAfter the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram partly sparked the American declaration of war against Imperial Germany in April 1917, German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to Germany. Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced \"hyphenated Americanism\", insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, or ridiculed the British (as did H. L. Mencken). Similarly, Harvard psychology professor Hugo Münsterberg dropped his efforts to mediate between America and Germany, and threw his efforts behind the German cause.\n\nThe Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917–18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort. Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty. The Red Cross barred individuals with German last names from joining in fear of sabotage. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched.\n\nWhen the United States entered the war in 1917, some German Americans were looked upon with suspicion and attacked regarding their loyalty. Some aliens were convicted and imprisoned on charges of sedition, for refusing to swear allegiance to the United States war effort.\n\nIn Chicago, Frederick Stock was forced to step down as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra until he finalized his naturalization papers. Orchestras replaced music by German composer Wagner with French composer Berlioz.\n\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, Luke Lea, the publisher of \"The Tennessean\", together with \"political associates\", \"conspired unsuccessfully to have the German-born Major Stahlman declared an \"alien enemy\" after World War I began.\" Stahlman was the publisher of a competing newspaper, the \"Nashville Banner\".\n\nThe town, Berlin, Michigan, was renamed Marne, Michigan (in honor of those who fought in the Battle of the Marne). The town of Berlin, Shelby County Ohio changed its name to its original name of Fort Loramie, Ohio. The city of Germantown in Shelby County Tennessee temporarily changed its name to Neshoba during the war.\n\nGerman street names in many cities were changed. German and Berlin streets in Cincinnati became English and Woodward. In Chicago Lubeck, Frankfort, and Hamburg Streets were renamed Dickens, Charleston, and Shakespeare Streets. In New Orleans, Berlin Street was renamed in honor of General Pershing, head of the American Expeditionary Force. In Indianapolis, Bismarck Avenue and Germania Street were renamed Pershing Avenue and Belleview Street, respectively in 1917, Brooklyn’s Hamburg Avenue was renamed Wilson Avenue.\n\nMany businesses changed their names. In Chicago, German Hospital became Grant Hospital; likewise the German Dispensary and the German Hospital in New York City were renamed Lenox Hill Hospital and Wyckoff Heights Hospital respectively. In New York, the giant Germania Life Insurance Company became Guardian. At the US Customs House in Lower Manhattan, the word \"Germany\" which was on a shield that one of the building’s many figures was holding was chiseled over.\n\nMany schools stopped teaching German-language classes. The City College of New York continued to teach German courses, but reduced the number of credits that students could receive for them. Books published in German were removed from libraries or even burned. In Cincinnati, the public library was asked to withdraw all German books from its shelves. In Iowa, in the 1918 Babel Proclamation, the governor prohibited all foreign languages in schools and public places. Nebraska banned instruction in any language except English, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the ban was illegal in 1923 (\"Meyer v. Nebraska\").\n\nSome words of German origin were changed, at least temporarily. Sauerkraut came to be called \"liberty cabbage\", German measles became \"liberty measles\", hamburgers became \"liberty sandwiches\" and dachshunds became \"liberty pups\".\n\nIn parallel with these changes, many German Americans elected to Americanize their names (e.g. Schmidt to Smith, Müller to Miller) and limit the use of the German language in public places, especially in churches.\n\nEthnic German Medal of Honor winners were American USAAS ace pilots Edward Rickenbacker and Frank Luke; German-ethnicity DSC winners who also served with the USAAS in Europe included Joseph Frank Wehner and Karl John Schoen.\n\nIn 1940 the Ministry of Information launched an \"Anger Campaign\" to instill \"personal anger ... against the German people and Germany\", because the British were \"harbouring little sense of real personal animus against the average German\". This was done to strengthen British resolve against the Germans. Sir Robert Vansittart, the Foreign Office's chief diplomatic advisor until 1941, gave a series of radio broadcasts in which he said that Germany was a nation raised on \"envy, self-pity and cruelty\" whose historical development had \"prepared the ground for Nazism\" and that it was Nazism that had \"finally given expression to the blackness of the German soul\".\n\nThe British Institute of Public Opinion (BIPO) tracked the evolution of anti-German/anti-Nazi feeling in Britain, asking the public, via a series of opinion polls conducted from 1939 to 1943, whether \"the chief enemy of Britain was the German people or the Nazi government\". In 1939 only 6% of respondents held the German people responsible; however, following the Blitz and the \"Anger Campaign\" in 1940, this increased to 50%. This subsequently declined to 41% by 1943. It also was reported by Home Intelligence in 1942 that there was some criticism of the official attitude of hatred towards Germany on the grounds that \"England ought to be a civilising influence\" and that such hatred might hinder the possibility of a reasonable settlement following the war.\n\nThis attitude was expanded upon by J.R.R. Tolkien. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:\n\n[I]t is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.\n\nIn the same year Mass Observation asked its observers to analyse the British people's private opinions of the German people and it found that 54% of the British population was \"pro-German\", in that it expressed sympathy for the German people and stated that the war was \"not their fault\". This tolerance of the German people as opposed to the Nazi regime increased as the war progressed. In 1943 Mass Observation established the fact that up to 60% of the British people maintained a distinction between Germans and Nazis, with only 20% or so expressing any \"hatred, vindictiveness, or need for retribution\". The British film propaganda of the period similarly maintained the division between Nazi supporters and the German people.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1940, 114,000 Germans and thousands of Austrians moved to the United States, many of whom — including, e.g., Nobel prize winner Albert Einstein, Lion Feuchtwanger, Bertold Brecht, Henry Kissinger, Arnold Schönberg, Hanns Eisler and Thomas Mann — were either Jewish Germans or anti-Nazis fleeing Nazi oppression. About 25,000 people became paying members of the pro-Nazi German American Bund during the years before the war. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 required 300,000 German-born resident aliens who had German citizenship to register with the Federal government and restricted their travel and property ownership rights. Under the still active Alien Enemy Act of 1798, the United States government interned nearly 11,000 German citizens between 1940 and 1948. Civil rights violations occurred. An unknown number of \"voluntary internees\" joined their spouses and parents in the camps and were not permitted to leave. With the war ongoing in Europe but the U.S. neutral, a massive defense buildup took place, requiring many new hires. Private companies sometimes refused to hire any non-citizen, or American citizens of German or Italian ancestry. This threatened the morale of loyal Americans. President Franklin Roosevelt considered this \"stupid\" and \"unjust\". In June 1941 he issued Executive Order 8802 and set up the Fair Employment Practice Committee, which also protected blacks.\n\nPresident Roosevelt sought out Americans of German ancestry for top war jobs, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and General Carl Andrew Spaatz. He appointed Republican Wendell Willkie as a personal representative. German Americans who had fluent German language skills were an important asset to wartime intelligence, and they served as translators and as spies for the United States. The war evoked strong pro-American patriotic sentiments among German Americans, few of whom by then had contacts with distant relatives in the old country.\n\nThe October 1939 seizure by the German pocket battleship \"Deutschland\" of the US freighter SS \"City of Flint\", as it had 4000 tons of oil for Britain on board, provoked much anti-German sentiment in the US.\n\nFollowing its entry into the War against Nazi Germany on December 11, 1941, the US Government interned thousands of German and Italian citizens as enemy aliens. In some cases their American-born family members volunteered to accompany them to internment camps in order to keep the family unit together. The last to be released remained in custody until 1948. \n\nIn 1944, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. put forward the strongest proposal for punishing Germany to the Second Quebec Conference. It became known as the Morgenthau Plan, and was intended to prevent Germany from having the industrial base to start another world war. However this plan was shelved quickly, the Western Allies did not seek reparations for war damage, and the United States implemented the Marshall Plan that was intended to and did help West Germany's post war recovery to its former position as a pre-eminent industrial nation.\n\nAfter Brazil's entry into the war on the Allied side in 1942, anti-German riots broke out in nearly every city in Brazil in which Germans were not the majority population. German factories, including the Suerdick cigar factory in Bahia, shops, and hotels were destroyed by mobs. The largest demonstrations took place in Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian police persecuted and interned \"subjects of the Axis powers\" in internment camps similar to those used by the US to intern Japanese-Americans. Following the war, German schools were not reopened, the German-language press disappeared completely, and use of the German language became restricted to the home and the older generation of immigrants.\n\nIn 1937 NKVD Order No. 00439 led to the arrest of all German citizens and former citizens in the Soviet Union.\n\nLater during the war Germans were suggested to be used for forced labour. The Soviet Union began deporting ethnic Germans in their territories and using them for forced labour. By 1950 most deportees had returned home.\n\nAmerican General George S. Patton complained that the U.S. policy of denazification following Germany's surrender harmed American interests and was motivated simply by hatred of the defeated German people. Reprisal action soon took place in Europe. Even the speed of West German recovery following the war was seen as ominous by some who suspected the Germans of planning for World War III.\n\nAfter WWII ended, about 11 million to 12 million Germans fled or were expelled from Germany's former eastern provinces or migrated from other countries to what remained of Germany, the largest transfer of a single European population in modern history. Estimates of the total number of dead range from 500,000 to 2,000,000, where the higher figures include \"unsolved cases\" of persons reported missing and presumed dead. Many German civilians were sent to internment and labor camps, where they died. Rudolph Rummel estimated that 1,585,000 Germans were killed in Poland and another 197,000 Germans were killed in Czechoslovakia. The German-Czech Historians Commission, on the other hand, established a death toll for Czechoslovakia of 15,000–30,000. The events are usually classified as population transfer, or ethnic cleansing.\n\nFelix Ermacora, among a minority of legal scholars, equated ethnic cleansing with genocide, and stated that the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans therefore constituted genocide.\n\nIn many Allied countries, Germans were used as forced laborers after 1945. Some of these laborers, depending on the country, were either prisoners of war or ethnic German civilians.\n\nBefore the rise of Hitler and the NSDAP (1920s to 1933), many but not all Central and Eastern European Jews tended to be pro-German. German Jews were deeply integrated into the country's culture, and many of them had fought with distinction in the First World War German Army. Jews in the Czech lands tended to adopt the German language and culture in place of Slavic languages (Kafka was a conspicuous example), and a similar phenomenon was evident in other parts of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire but not all. Theodore Herzl, the founding father of Zionism, himself spoke and wrote German and in his utopian book \"Altneuland\" he actually depicted the future Jewish state as a German-speaking one. However, throughout Eastern Europe, Jews spoke Yiddish, and wrote it in Hebrew script, thus keeping some distance from German culture.\n\nPro-German attitudes suffered an extremely painful rupture and a complete reversal due to the persecutions and atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, culminating in the systematic genocide of the Holocaust. In the first decades of Israel's existence, anti-German feelings were strong and dominant in Israeli society. There was a widespread cultural and commercial boycott of all things German (and often, Austrian as well) and a determination \"never to set foot on German soil\". German Jews in Israel, themselves refugees from the Nazi persecutions, came under strong social pressure to cease using German, their mother language.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the words \"German\" and \"Nazi\" were used interchangeably. (Until the late 1990s, the sign language of Israeli deaf communities used the Swastika as the sign for \"German\".) There was a widespread scepticism about the possibility of \"another Germany\" ever emerging; specifically, there was suspicion about Konrad Adenauer's claim to be involved in the creation of a new, democratic Germany. Many Israelis took up the Soviet claims made in the early years of the Cold War that West Germany was a \"fascist state\" in which ex-Nazis held key positions.\n\nThe Reparations Agreement with West Germany, signed by the David Ben-Gurion government in 1952, was the focus of intense political controversy, and the protest demonstrations led by then opposition leader Menachem Begin turned into pitched battles with the police. In the early 1960s, the Eichmann Trial brought the horrors and traumas of the Holocaust to the center of public consciousness. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and West Germany in 1966 entailed a new wave of protests and demonstrations, though less violent than those of 1952.\n\nSince the late 1960s, there has been a clear, though gradual, process of rapprochement between Israelis and Germans in all spheres: diplomatic, commercial and cultural. The 1967 Six-Day War realigned Israeli politics, with the issue of occupied territories henceforth defining what is \"right wing\" and \"left wing\"; one result was that militant Israeli nationalism tended to be anti-Arab rather than anti-German. When Begin became Israel's Prime Minister in 1977, he had little option but to take up the maintenance of already very extensive ties with Germany, to whose creation he had been fiercely opposed as an opposition leader.\n\nA momentary flare-up of anti-German feeling occurred during the 1991 Gulf War, when Israel was the subject of missile attack by Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Some Israeli columnists and politicians combined the revelations of German corporations helping the Iraqi arms industry and the strong anti-war movement in Germany and tied both with the German Nazi past. \n\nThe German government of the time managed, however, to assuage Israeli feelings by providing the Israeli Navy with three advanced submarines, which, according to repeated reports in the international press, were used to mount nuclear missiles and provide Israel with a second strike capacity. These Dolphin class submarines replaced the obsolete 1970s Gal-class submarines, and are some of the most modern submarines in the world. Two submarines were given outright by Germany, and Israel paid for half of the third. \n\nIn the 21st century, the long debate about whether the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra should play the works of Richard Wagner is mostly considered as a remnant of the past. In March 2008, German Chancellor Angela Merkel became the first foreign head of government invited to deliver a speech in the Israeli parliament, which she gave in the German language. Several members of parliament did leave in protest during the speech, claiming the need to create a collective memory that \"will create a kind of electric wave when Jews will hear the sounds of the German language, they'll remember the Holocaust\".\n\nKibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot (English: \"Fighters of the Ghettos\")–which included among its founders survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising–reversed a long-standing ban and permitted a delegation from its Ghetto Fighters' House museum to accept an invitation and visit Germany. The explanation was given, \"When German babies born on the day of Hitler's death are now sixty-three years old, it is ridiculous to continue to demand a collective responsibility.\" \n\nIn one October 2008 interview, researcher Hanan Bar (חנן בר) summed up the ambiguous Israeli attitude to Germany: \"If the average Israeli happens to see a football match between Germany and Holland [sic], he would automatically root for the Dutch. But the same person, when buying a washing machine, would prefer a German model, considering it to be the best\".\n"}

{"id": "42509796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42509796", "title": "Convivència", "text": "Convivència\n\nConvivència is the public policy on social coexistence in Catalonia, Spain; government projects, departments and ordinances promote the principle broadly. Originally, convivència was presented as a policy to integrate immigrant populations and build social cohesion following the divisive Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Today, convivència can encompass conflict mediation, policing, civic participation, language policy, public education, civility, public celebrations and the promotion of neighborhood-based initiatives. As the dominant paradigm of social coexistence, convivència is the frequent subject of political, scholarly, media and popular discourse. Unlike the cognate Castilian term, convivencia, which refers to an imagined Medieval Iberian past, the Catalan word and policy emerged in the late 1970s and refers to contemporary social life and recent history.\n\n\"Convivència\" (literally \"to live together\") is a Catalan term, distinct from the Castilian term, \"convivencia\", the latter primarily referring to the historical and disputed coexistence of Jews, Muslims and Christians in Medieval Iberia. It was first popularized in reference to contemporary phenomena by former Catalan President Jordi Pujol, in the early years of the return to democracy following the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939–75). As Pujol employed the term, convivència signified tolerance and linguistic accommodation between native born Catalans and the Castilian-speaking \"new Catalans\" or \"other Catalans\" who had migrated from Southern Spain in such numbers as to constitute roughly half of the population of Catalonia. In subsequent decades, the term became the dominant frame of shared social existence in Catalonia and no longer carried a passive sense of mere tolerance but rather the active engagement of relations between neighbors and of the full expression of cultural pluralism in which there is public space for all traditions Convivència overlaps semantically with the concept of \"civility\" (\"civisme\") to the extent that both may refer to mutual respect in the shared use of public space yet there is an important distinction. \"Civisme\" is often understood as a top-down, legislative imposition of universal norms over the population whereas \"convivència\" (while also sometimes being legislated) is perceived as a bottom-up, neighbor-to-neighbor process whereby residents work out solutions to conflicts among themselves. This sense of conflict as productive is an important feature of \"convivència\". A municipal plan defines it this way:\n\n\"We can define convivència in the broadest sense of the concept, to live in the company of others with whom we interact with empathy, sharing, communication, and the regulation of conflict. One should bear in mind that when people live together, conflicts arise: this need not be seen as a problem but rather as an impetus to change. From this definition we understand convivència (active relations between neighbors), in contradistinction to coexistence (minimal, passively produced relations between neighbors), and to hostility.\"\n\nIn other parts of Europe, or in the US, the mixed societies that result from immigration are often discussed in terms of multiculturalism. The term multiculturalism is predicated on the existence of distinct, sometimes static cultural identities and often provoke debate regarding the conception of human rights as universal or particular to a cultural group. The rights of these cultural others often hinge on the question of their \"citizenship.\" While equivalents for all of these concepts exist in Catalonia, they are not the dominant nor even the legally significant ideas. Catalan law does not acknowledge \"citizens\" but rather \"neighbors\" (\"veïns\") through the principle of \"veïnatge administratiu\" (neighborhood jurisdiction) established by municipal registration (\"l'empadronament\") regardless of citizenship. Citizenship is an abstract concept; one may be a citizen of one place yet reside in another but a person can only be a neighbor in one determinant place at a time. Both concepts \"convivència\" and \"neighbor\" emphasize concrete local specificity over disembodied abstraction. And while convivència encompasses the relations between natives and newcomers, it also concerns the relations between people of shared origins, therefore de-emphasizing cultural differences. Following these principles, in most Catalan communities, the preferred term for immigrant is \"nouvingut\" (newcomer) suggesting the language of hospitality rather than that of social or legal policy. It should be understood that these differences do not guarantee better or different social outcomes for immigrants but rather that these concepts form part of the way Catalans understand their own society in distinct ways.\n\nHalf of Spain's Muslim population resides in Catalonia providing challenges and opportunities for the application of convivència. Catalonia's Muslim leaders, from the imams of local mosques, to Catalonia's first Muslim member of parliament who has published a trilingual book on the subject, have framed convivència as consonant with Qu'ranic teachings, or as part of Islamic tradition itself. While tensions between Muslims and non-Muslim communities exist in Catalonia as elsewhere, convivència supplies a common frame of shared values as a starting point for dialogue. This is in stark contrast to other parts of Europe where such conflicts may be framed as the \"clash of civilizations,\" or the alleged fundamental incompatibility between Islam and secular modernity.\n"}
{"id": "46428545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46428545", "title": "Dark Eden (novel)", "text": "Dark Eden (novel)\n\nDark Eden is a social science fiction novel by British author Chris Beckett, first published in the United Kingdom in 2012. The novel explores the disintegration of a small group of a highly inbred people, descendants of two individuals whose spaceship crashed on a rogue planet they call Eden.\n\nThe book won the Arthur C. Clarke Award for best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in 2012.\n\nThe novel begins about 160 years after two human beings, Angela and Tommy, were stranded on Eden. Their three companions—Mehmet, Michael, and Dixon—left in a damaged spaceship to get help. Years passed, and although Angela and Tommy held out hope for rescue, they began to raise children and form a new society which they named \"Family\". Frequent and regular incest among their descendants became common, with few children knowing who their father was. Social life centers around powerful rituals: Retelling of story of the stranding, the worship of what few relics remain, myths about Earth, and the need to stay close to Circle—the place where the landing vehicle is supposed to return to, and bring them back to Earth. Social norms are strongly adhered to in this matriarchy, and innovation is rare.\n\nFamily's world, Eden, is so far from its sun that it is icebound. Only a small area, which the Family calls Circle Valley, is temperate. Eden's animals each have two hearts, green-black blood, huge and lidless eyes, six legs, and tentacled feelers around their mouths. The animal population, however, is not diverse. Trees tap into the heat just below Eden's surface, bringing up warmth and providing fruit and other food. Nearly all plant and animal life on Eden is bioluminescent, allowing the humans to see, while overhead the Milky Way can be easily seen at all times.\n\nThe novel centers around John Redlantern, a \"newhair\" (teenager) who hates the deep social and technological conservatism of Family. Killing a deadly leopard proves to be an epiphany which opens his eyes to the Malthusian catastrophe facing Family, which has grown too large for its tiny valley. Supported by pretty Tina Spikestree and John's cousins (the somewhat passive teenaged Gerry and the club footed pre-adolescent, thoughtful Jeff), John engages in a series of iconoclastic acts which lead to the \"breaking\" of Family. Exile of John and his teenaged followers is only the first of many ramifications, as John leads a messianic quest for a land \"over Cold Dark\" where Family can grow and thrive.\n\nThe novel is told in the first-person voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a different character's perspective. Linguistic drift has given the people of Eden unique nouns (\"police veekle\", \"rayed yoh\", and \"Jesus Juice\" instead of \"police vehicle\", \"radio\", and \"Jesus and the Jews\"). The adverb \"very\" has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by reduplication (\"bad bad\" instead of \"very bad\"). Linguistic relativity has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world (\"Cold Dark\" instead of \"high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers\"). Beckett said he adopted the unsophisticated, childish language of the Edenites after realizing he had crafted a society in which \"the Eden settlers were a bunch of kids and two adults... . There's no external adult world as a reference point\". With the two adults constantly speaking baby-talk to their children, pre-teens and teens never adopted more adult ways of speaking.\n\nBeckett intended the novel to be \"the Bible story...turned on its head\", one in which people are \"expelled to Eden\". He conceived the novel after realizing that much of the Old Testament consisted of \"small domestic stories elevated to a mythical level\", and he established the social norms, rituals, and myths of Family around similar stories.\n\nBeckett also wanted to explore themes about making hard choices. To think outside the box sometimes requires not only \"transgressive\" but extremely \"cruel\" behavior, he told \"Kirkus Reviews\". The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of the latter part of the novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.\n\n\"Dark Eden\" was author Chris Beckett's second novel. Reviews were generally very positive in the United Kingdom. Stuart Kelly in \"The Guardian\" called it a \"superior piece of theologically nuanced science fiction\", although he noted that the novel drew a little heavily on Russell Hoban's \"Riddley Walker\" and Will Self's \"The Book of Dave\". Author Paul Di Filippo, reviewing the book for \"Locus\" magazine, described the plot as uninventive but \"so splendidly [written] it feels brand new and remade\". He pointed out that the novel's \"harsh oasis\" plot device resembled the work of Fritz Leiber, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, and Karl Schroeder. But that didn't matter: \"[A]ll this heavy categorizing misses the essence of the reader’s first contact with the book, which is pure astonishment and pleasure, a storytelling ride full of brio and wonder. ... The reader is swiftly seduced by two things that are intrinsic to, but separate from, the powerful plot: the Carrollian language, and the freaky ecology.\" He had high praise for the character of John Redlantern, who was a metaphor (in De Filippo's mind) for both Moses and Cain. Harry Ritchie in the \"Daily Mail\" said \"Human plight and alien planet are both superbly evoked in [this] captivating and haunting book\" while David Langford in \"The Daily Telegraph\" said \"Dark Eden\" contained \"A classic theme, beautifully told\".\n\n\"Dark Eden\" was published in the United States in April 2014 by Broadway Books. American reviewers were much more critical of the book. In \"Kirkus Reviews\", an anonymous reviewer called it \"[a]bsorbing if often familiar, inventive and linguistically adept but less than fully satisfying... Enjoyable but no blockbuster.\" Author N. K. Jemisin, reviewing the novel in \"The New York Times\", praised Beckett's method of rendering \"the terror of the darkness beyond the forests with a riveting deftness\" and the way he \"cleverly\" introduced new challenges and threats to keep the reader interested. But she strongly criticized the plot for being predictable and hackneyed and the characters for being clichéd. She had harsh words for what she saw as \"the 1950s ethos underpinning the whole thing. The Family has developed into a relatively peaceful communal society that venerates its elders and has necessarily relaxed sexual norms; the society John seeks to create instead is monogamous, individualistic, rife with subtle bigotries and rooted in murder. Survival and progress, the story seems to suggest, require these things.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" thought the novel \"hew[ed] too closely to historical patterns\", and declared the climax very unsatisfying. The reviewer still found the changing narrative viewpoints, ecological setting, and linguistic devices interesting, however.\n\n\"Dark Eden\" won the 2013 Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in 2012. Clarke Award judge Andrew M. Butler, noting why the judges gave the award to a new author rather than an established writer, said of the book, \"\"Dark Eden\" fuses rich biological and sociological speculation. Beckett really makes you care for characters who are stranded light years from an Earth they have never really known.\"\n"}

White and Mestizos make up 83.4% of the population, 7% are black people (including mulattoes), 2.4% Amerindians, 0.2% Asians, and 7% other/none.\n\nIn 2010, just under 3% of the population is of black African descent who are called Afro-Costa Ricans or West Indians and are English-speaking descendants of 19th-century black Jamaican immigrant workers. Another 1% is composed of ethnic Chinese, and less than 1% are Middle Easterners, mainly of Lebanese descent but also Palestinians. The 2011 Census provided the following data: whites and mestizos make up a 83.4% of the population, 7% are black people (including mulattoes), 2.4% Amerindians, 0.2% Asians, and 7% other/none.\n\nThere is also a community of North American retirees from the United States and Canada, followed by fairly large numbers of European Union expatriates (esp. Scandinavians and from Germany) come to retire as well, and Australians. Immigration to Costa Rica made up 9% of the population in 2012. This included permanent settlers as well as migrants who were hoping to reach the U.S. In 2015, there were some 420,000 immigrants in Costa Rica and the number of asylum seekers (mostly from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) rose to more than 110,000. An estimated 10% of the Costa Rican population in 2014 was made up of Nicaraguans.\n\nThe indigenous population today numbers about 60,000 (just over 1% of the population) with some Miskito and Garifuna (a population of mixed black African and Carib Indian descent) living in the coastal regions.\n\nCosta Rica's emigration is the smallest in the Caribbean Basin and is among the smallest in the Americas. By 2015 about just 133,185 (2.77%) of the country's people live in another country as immigrants. The main destination countries are the United States (85,924), Nicaragua (10,772), Panama (7,760), Canada (5,039), Spain (3,339), Mexico (2,464), Germany (1,891), Italy (1,508), Guatemala (1,162) and Venezuela (1,127).\n\nIn , Costa Rica had a population of . The population is increasing at a rate of 1.5% per year. At current trends the population will increase to 9,158,000 in about 46 years. The population density is 94 people per square km, the third highest in Central America.\n\nApproximately 40% lived in rural areas and 60% in urban areas. The rate of urbanization estimated for the period 2005–2015 is 2.74% per annum, one of the highest among developing countries. About 75% of the population live in the upper lands (above 500 meters) where temperature is cooler and milder.\n\nThe 2011 census counted a population of 4.3 million people distributed among the following groups: 83.6% whites or mestizos, 6.7% mulattoes, 2.4% Native American, 1.1% black or Afro-Caribbean; the census showed 1.1% as Other, 2.9% (141,304 people) as None, and 2.2% (107,196 people) as unspecified.\n\nIn 2011, there were over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (in the Central Valley), Matambú or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (northern Alajuela), Bribri (southern Atlantic), Cabécar (Cordillera de Talamanca), Guaymí (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), Boruca (southern Costa Rica) and Térraba (southern Costa Rica).\n\nThe population includes European Costa Ricans (of European ancestry), primarily of Spanish descent, with significant numbers of Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are Creole English-speaking descendants of 19th century black Jamaican immigrant workers.\nThe 2011 census classified 83.6% of the population as white or Mestizo; the latter are persons of combined European and Amerindian descent. The Mulatto segment (mix of white and black) represented 6.7% and indigenous people made up 2.4% of the population. Native and European mixed blood populations are far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are Guanacaste, where almost half the population is visibly mestizo, a legacy of the more pervasive unions between Spanish colonists and Chorotega Amerindians through several generations, and Limón, where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Costa Rica's literacy rate stands at 95.8%, the fifth highest among American countries. Costa Rica's Education Index in 2006 was 0.882; higher than that of richer countries, such as Singapore and Mexico. Costa Rica's gross enrolment ratio is 73.0%, smaller than that of the neighbors countries of El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nAll students must complete primary school and secondary school, between 6 and 15 years. Some students drop out because they must work to help support their families. In 2007 there were 536,436 pupils enrolled in 3,771 primary schools and 377,900 students attended public and private secondary schools.\n\nCosta Rica's main universities are the University of Costa Rica, in San Pedro and the National University of Costa Rica, in Heredia. Costa Rica also has several small private universities.\n\nCosta Rica's emigration is among the smallest in the Caribbean Basin. About 3% of the country's people live in another country as immigrants. The main destination countries are the United States, Spain, Mexico and other Central American countries. In 2005, there were 127,061 Costa Ricans living in another country as immigrants. Remittances were $513,000,000 in 2006 and they represented 2.3% of the country's GDP.\n\nCosta Rica's immigration is among the largest in the Caribbean Basin. According to the 2011 census 385,899 residents were born abroad. The vast majority were born in Nicaragua (287,766). Other countries of origin were Colombia (20,514), United States (16,898), Spain (16,482) and Panama (11,250). Outward Remittances were $246,000,000 in 2006.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, about 489,200 migrants lived in the country in 2010 mainly from Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize, while 125,306 Costa Ricans live abroad in the United States, Panama, Nicaragua, Spain, Mexico, Canada, Germany, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador. The number of migrants declined in later years but in 2015, there were some 420,000 immigrants in Costa Rica and the number of asylum seekers (mostly from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) rose to more than 110,000, a fivefold increase from 2012. In 2016, the country was called a \"magnet\" for migrants from South and Central America and other countries who were hoping to reach the U.S.\n\nEuropean Costa Ricans are people from Costa Rica whose ancestry lies within the continent of Europe, most notably Spain. According to DNA studies, around 67% of the population have some level of European ancestry.\n\nPercentages of the Costa Rican population by race are known as the national census does have the question of ethnicity included in its form. As for 2012 65.80% of Costa Ricans identify themselves as white/castizo and 13.65% as mestizo, giving around 80% of Caucasian population. This, however, is based in self-identification and not in scientific studies. According to PLoS \"Genetics Geographic Patterns of Genome Admixture in Latin American Mestizos\" study of 2012, Costa Ricans have 67% of European ancestry, 29% aboriginal and 3% African. According to CIA Factbook, Costa Rica has white or mestizo population of the 83.6%.\n\nCristopher Columbus and crew were the first Europeans ever to set foot on what is now Costa Rica in Columbus last trip when he arrived to Uvita Island (modern day Limón province) in 1502. Costa Rica was part of the Spanish Empire and colonized by Spaniards mostly Castilians, Basque and Sefardi Jews. After the independence large migrations of wealthy Americans, Germans, French and British businessmen came to the country encouraged by the government and followed by their families and employees (many of them technicians and professionals) creating colonies and mixing with the population, especially the high and middle classes. Later, more humble migrations of Italians, Spanish (mostly Catalans) and Arab (mostly Lebanese and Syrians) migrants visit the country escaping economical crisis in their home countries, setting in large, more closed colonies. Polish migrants, mostly Ashkenazi Jews escaping anti-Semitism and nazi persecution in Europe also migrated to the country in large numbers. In 1901 president Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra closes the country to all non-white immigration forbidding the entrance of all Black African, Chinese, Arab, Turkish or Gypsy migration in the country. After the beginning of the Spanish Civil War large migration of Republican refugees also settle in the country, mostly Castilians, Galicians and Asturians, as later Chilean, Mexican and Colombian migrants would leave their countries traveling to Costa Rica escaping from war or dictatorships as Costa Rica is the longest running democracy in Latin America and unlike most of its neighbors had no dictatorship during the 20th century.\n\nThe following listing is taken from a publication of the Costa Rica 2011 Census:\n\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2013) (Estimates - the source of data is the national household survey):\n\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\n\nNearly all Costa Ricans speak Spanish; but many blacks speak a traditional Jamaican dialect of English, also a few of the Natives speak their own language, such as the case of the Ngobes.\n\nAccording to the World Factbook the main religions are: Roman Catholic, 76.3%; Evangelical, 13.7%; Jehovah's Witnesses, 1.3%; other Protestant, 0.7%; other, 4.8%; none, 3.2%.\n\nThe most recent nationwide survey of religion in Costa Rica, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, found that 70.5 percent of the population identify themselves as Roman Catholics (with 44.9 percent practicing, 25.6 percent nonpracticing), 13.8 percent are Evangelical Protestants, 11.3 percent report that they do not have a religion, and 4.3 percent declare that they belong to another religion.\n\nApart from the dominant Catholic religion, there are several other religious groups in the country. Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopal, Baptist, and other Protestant groups have significant membership. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) claim more than 35,000 members and has a temple in San José that served as a regional worship center for Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras.\n\nAlthough they represent less than 1 percent of the population, Jehovah's Witnesses have a strong presence on the Caribbean coast. Seventh-day Adventists operate a university that attracts students from throughout the Caribbean Basin. The Unification Church maintains its continental headquarters for Latin America in San José.\n\nNon-Christian religious groups, including followers of Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Hare Krishna, Paganism, Wicca, Scientology, Tenrikyo, and the Bahá'í Faith, claim membership throughout the country, with the majority of worshipers residing in the Central Valley (the area of the capital). While there is no general correlation between religion and ethnicity, indigenous peoples are more likely to practice animism than other religions.\n\nArticle 75 of the Costa Rican Constitution states that the \"Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Religion is the official religion of the Republic\". That same article provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The US government found no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice in 2007.\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The most numerous people are the Luba, Mongo, and Bakongo.\n\nAlthough 700 local languages and dialects are spoken, the linguistic variety is bridged both by the use of French and the intermediary languages Kongo, Luba-Kasai, Swahili, and Lingala.\n\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to only 12,184,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 46.3%, 51.1% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.7% was 65 years or older\n\nStructure of the population (DHS 2013-2014) (Males 45 548, Females 49 134 = 94 682) :\n\nRegistration of vital events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is incomplete.

The country has also 60,000 White Congolese most of Belgian ancestry who remained after independence.\nBantu peoples (80%):\n\nCentral Sudanic/Ubangian :\n\nNilotic peoples :\n\nPygmy peoples :\nMore than 600,000 pygmies (around 1% of the total population) are believed to live in the DR Congo's huge forests, where they survive by hunting wild animals and gathering fruits.\n\nThe four major languages in the DRC are French (official), Lingala (a lingua franca trade language), Kingwana (a dialect of Swahili), Kikongo, and Tshiluba. There are over 200 ethnic languages.\n\nFrench is generally the medium of instruction in schools. English is taught as a compulsory foreign language in Secondary and High School around the country. It is a required subject in the Faculty of Economics at major universities around the country and there are numerous language schools in the country that teach it. In the town of Beni, for instance, there is a Bilingual University that offer courses in both French and English. President Kabila himself is fluent in both English and French, as was his father.\n\nA survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys program in 2013-2014 indicated that Christians constituted 93.7% of the population (Catholics 29.7%, Protestants 26.8%, and other Christians 37.2%). An indigenous religion, Kimbanguism, has the adherence of 2.8%, while Muslims make up 1.2%.\n\nAnother estimate found Christianity was followed by 95.8% of the population, according to the Pew Research Center in 2010.\n\nThe CIA The World Factbook states: Roman Catholic 50%, Protestant 20%, Kimbanguist 10%, Islam 10%, Other (includes Syncretic Sects and Indigenous beliefs) 10%.\n\nJoshua Project figures: Roman Catholic 43.9%, Protestant 24.8%, Other Christian 23.7%, Muslim 1.6%, Non-religious 0.6%, Hindu 0.1% other syncretic sects and indigenous beliefs 5.3%.\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n-0.54 migrant(s)/1,000 population\n\"note\": fighting between the Congolese Government and Uganda- and Rwanda-backed Congolese rebels spawned a regional war in DRC in August 1998, which left 2.33 million Congolese internally displaced and caused 412,000 Congolese refugees to flee to surrounding countries (2011 est.)\n\nGiven the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data however evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers - products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region - constituting an important subset of the population in the country.\n\nAdditionally, the country’s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced.\n\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration, the number of immigrants in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.\n\nFigures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. Most Congolese emigrants however, remain in Africa, with new destination countries including South Africa and various points en route to Europe.\n\nIn addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to UNHCR, there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.\n\nThe table below shows DRC born people who have emigrated abroad in selected Western countries (although it excludes their descendants).\nThese are only estimates and do not account for Congolese migrants residing illegally in these and other countries. \n\n\n\n"}

It is classified as an Other Backward Class by the Government of India under its system of positive discrimination.\n\nThey mainly belong to the districts of Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and Thrissur of Kerala, has also presence outside and other parts of India. There are more people in the teaching sector in the community. Ezhuthachan is a caste who have teaching as a traditional profession. There is an organization representing the community as \"Ezhuthachan Samajam\".\n\nThere are two main beliefs about the origin of the Kadupattan people.1. \"Pattar(Bhattar)\" Brahmins who were boycotted from \"Kadu\" village of medieval Chola, Pandya region, Due to the introduction of Buddhism. From the Zamorin's Kovilakam (Ambadi Kovilakam) the elder Thamburatti(Senior princess) asserted the title \"Ezhuthachan\" and assigned as village school master.2. A Jain guild, who was prominent in teaching, came to Kerala and became Village school teachers. With the influence of the Bhakthi movement, they came under Hinduism.\n\nThe Kaduru (In present Karnataka) of the Western Ganga dynasty was a Jainite settlement; From 8th to 10th centuries Jainism was the prominent religion in the Western Ganga dynasty. From 9th to 13th centuries today's the Patancheru or Pottalakkare in Telangana was the principal Jain hub in South India. In Jainism, there was a tradition of using the province name once abandoned as clan name. Evidence suggests that \"Kadupattan\" was a Jain guild which formed Kaduru and Patancheru which was prominent in teaching profession.\n\nAfter the twelfth century, Prominence of Jainism in South India decreased significantly, Many followers of Jainism abandoned their settlements and moved to the south (Today's Tamil Nadu). \"Kadupattigal\" one among thirteenth century rulers of the southern Arcot who were present on the banks of Kaveri River should have been the ancestors of Ezhuthachan(Kadupattan).\n\nWars that took place during the course of 13th and 14th centuries (Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I and Kakatiya, Delhi Sultanate), Caused Kadupattans came to Kerala through the path which was present from banks of Kaveri through the Nilgiri mountains, and with the influence of the Bhakti movement they were Hinduised as Vaishnava(Ramanuja), Shaiva and Shaktheya; In Occupation \"Ezhuthachan\" (Village school master), Teachers who practiced Shakthi worship became known as \"Gurukkal\". Historian K. Balakrishna Kurup concludes history of Ezhuthachan(Kadupattan) caste as this.\n\nIt is believed that the Kadupattans reached Malabar by the fifteenth century(Circa C.E 1447). Although the Aithihyamala says about a magician() who belonged to Kadupattan caste a disciple of the and member of a family who had been a teacher of traditional heritage, his lifespan is unclear. One of the fist Government record which contain mention about Ezhutachan caste is British India census taken on 17th February 1881.\n\nKadupattans entered Kerala through Palakkad Gap, Their migration took place as number of groups of families. First group of eight families(\"Ettu veettukar\") came and settled near Tirunavaya in Malabar region, some of their family names were \"Thekkeppattu\", \"Vadakkeppattu\", \"Kizhakkeppattu\", \"Padinjareppattu\", \"Meleppattu\", \"Keezheppattu\". Family of \"\" belongs to the tradition of \"Ettu veettukar\". And the second group of thirty two families(\"Muppaththirandu veettukaar\") settled in Thrissur region. Soon after another group of close relatives of \"Ettu veettukar\" and \"Muppaththirandu veettukaar\" settled in Palakkad region. Gradually they spread to other areas. Clashes between soldiers of Zamorin and Portuguese India Armadas that took place during sixteenth century on coastal areas of Malabar region, caused many Kadupattans who were inhabitants of coastal areas of Kingdom of Tanur to move to Kanniyampuram of Valluvanad (southern Malabar)(In present Ottappalam taluk), Chittur and other parts of Kingdom of Cochin and settle there.\n\nKadupattans played major role in spreading Vattezhuthu in Palakkad, Malabar regions and Kingdom of Cochin. Usually they were well-versed in sanskrit too. Kadupattans used the prayer of jain Tirthankara \"jina dheva\"(\"Namosthu jeenathe\") in their Ezhuthupalli(, , \"\"), And taught Vattezhuthu, Mathematics etc. \n\nAccording to historian M. G. S. Narayanan the literary activities of Malabar, especially in Sudras got strengthened after the arrival of Kadupattars. Translation of many texts from Sanskrit to Malayalam took place in the age after the arrival of them.\n\nIn Kerala they were treated as shudra. But it was permitted to go and pray until the \"Sacrificial stone(Balikkallu)\" of temple. Some of the other communities called the men of the community \"Pattarappan\"(, , ') and the women as \"Pattathiyaramma\"(, , '). In government records Kadupattans referred as the \"Choular\"(People from the Chola country).\nIt is believed that Zamorin had placed them in a high position in society . The envy of the Zamorin's minister (Mangattachan) have put them under the burden of low class shudra in society. \"Pattanam pizhaithavar\"(Those who lost status)Kadupattans were called by the other community like that. Although Ezhuthachan caste very similar to those of Nair(Even though some records classify them as Nair), they have nothing to do with the Nair community. Perhaps they have adopted to the traditional methods present in Kerala after arrival.\n\nTill the introduction of public education system in Kerala, Kadupattans were present in Kingdom of Cochin and Malabar as Ezhuthachan(Village school master) and they ran Ezhuthupallis(Traditional village school). They taught wealthy people by staying at their home and this practice was called \"Ezhuthachan thamasikkuka\"(, , \"\").\nTraditionally, although caste gave importance to teaching, other tasks such as palanquin bearing, carrying salt, Oil, and their marketing, Agriculture etc. were also Present.\nFamous Magicians, Physicians, Astrologers and Sanskrit scholars have been emerged from this caste. \"Panikkar\" was the title which used by some kadupattans.\n\nAfter the introduction of modern public education system, traditional teaching methods were less important in the society. Many Ezhuthupallis(Traditional Village school) that ran by Ezhuthachans(Kadupattan) were converted to public school with modern teaching method. In the 19th century when British rule introduced public education in Malabar, Ezhuthachan community made major contributions in the field of public education of Valluvanad.\n\nThough there are little differences in customs locally, Nearly Tamil practices followed. According to William logan's Malabar manual this caste followed a Modified \"Makkathayam\" (Patriarchy / Patrilineal system of inheritance) in which the property descends from father to son but not from father to daughter. At the wedding ceremonies there are rituals like \"Ganapathy homam\"(ritual dedicated to Lord Ganesha, performed to seek his blessings), \"Dhakshina giving\"(Give donation to elders and seek blessings) and \"Panigrahanam\"(The groom holds the hand of the bride). There was no Polygamy and Polyandry prevailed, but widow remarried. Peculiarities in death rituals of Ezhuthachan caste, Points they were foreign caste. Ezhuthachan caste worshiped Ganapathy, Vettakkorumakan, Shakti, Bhagavati,Vishnumaya.\n\nEzhuthachan Samajam started functioning from 1906 onwards. The first organizer was a Sanskrit scholar and a teacher Mr.Chakkulliyal Kunjunni Ezhuthachan who was a disciple of legendary Sanskrit scholar and teacher. Revered Punnasseri Nambi Neelakanta Sharma. He named the organization as \"Adhyapaka Samajam\". Though \"Adhyapaka Samajam\" made several reformations in caste customs and rituals, Kunjunni Ezhuthachan's efforts were not successful and he abandoned his project. Ezhuthachan samajam came in to being as a reality when Late Vakil P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan entered the arena. He was the real founder of the Ezhuthachan Samajam and architect of the present day Ezhuthachan community. He was also a freedom fighter, a member of the congress party and also in Cochin State Prajamandal, whose founder was Sri.V.R.Krishnan Ezhuthachan, his son-in-law. Later Mr.Krishnan Ezhuthachan stepped into the shoes of his mentor and father-in-law, Mr. Kumaran Ezhuthachan as Ezhuthachan Samajam president. Since both were immersed in Congress politics, freedom movement, peasant struggles and also in Cochin state Prajamandal, they found it difficult to continue in the Ezhuthachan Samajam movement. Towards late 1940’s Krishnan Ezhuthachan left the movement, so also Vakil. P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan. Kumaran Ezhuthachan left the movement after a personal tragedy - The death of his son P.Lakshmanakumar. After 1947 the Ezhuthachan community was orphaned and community became rudderless. There were some attempts to revitalize the community by some spirited people, but it didn’t reach anywhere. The services of Adv. Late M. Krishnankutty is to be mentioned in this context. In the Post era, from 1990’s onwards there was some resurgence in the community. From late 1990’s new thinking is visible in the community. From 2002, Mr.T.G.Ravi came into the scene and revitalized the samajam activities. The present president Prof. Dr. Lakshmanakumar is the grandson of Vakil. P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan and son of V R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan.\n\nThere are educational institutions under Ezhuthachan Samajam.\n\nThere is no clear history about birth or life of Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan available yet. However there is a belief prevails as Thunchathth Ramanujan Ezhuthachan was a member of Ezhuthachan(Kadupattan) community. Being a vaishnava(Ramanuja) sect member he was called as Ramanujan. And his real name was \"Thunchan\"(The youngest child). According to K. Balakrishna Kurup, Thunchchath Ezhuthachan was a member of Ezhuthachan(Kadupattan) community and Ezhuthachan led his life as a teacher by following celibacy throughout his life.\nindependent researcher in local history from Kadampazhipuram, Palakkad; supports conclusion of K. Balakrishna Kurup about Thunchathth Ezhuthachan's caste. Historian also expressing the same opinion.\n\nHistorian M. G. S. Narayanan point out mention about jain monks in \"Adhyathma ramayanam kilippattu\" as proof for Thunchaththu ezhuthachan's familiarity with jain monks.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45079634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45079634", "title": "Food sovereignty in Bolivia", "text": "Food sovereignty in Bolivia\n\nFood sovereignty is a highly influential idea in Bolivian political discourse. It is incorporated into multiple pieces of Bolivian legislation, including the 2009 constitution drafted underneath president Evo Morales. Food sovereignty fits into Morales' larger goal of the symbolic decolonization of Bolivia. First coined by indigenous and peasant worker advocacy organization Via Campesina, food sovereignty is the right for a state's people to produce and distribute culturally appropriate foods without the impingement of economic pressures created by foreign agribusiness producers. The presence of foreign agribusiness in Bolivia can be traced back to exploitative resource extraction that proliferated in South America with 19th century liberalism. Modern-day wholesale agribusiness production makes competition difficult for Bolivia’s small-scale farmers, who often take out high-interest loans and consequently accumulate debt.\n\nIn Bolivia, indigenous peasant groups and government actors emphasize the value of traditional indigenous agricultural practices, the conservation of Bolivia's agricultural biodiversity, and the strengthening of internal markets as benefits of food sovereignty. The government's prioritization of strengthening Bolivia's economy through food sovereignty can contradict indigenous peasant priorities to alleviate rural poverty and restore the ability to make a living off of farmers' own home-plots.\n\nThe inclusion of food sovereignty into Bolivian legislation is understood by advocates as an essential step to the symbolic deconstruction of imperialist and racist histories, however the extent and ways by which the government is able to implement such policy is debated.\n\nFood sovereignty was incorporated into the Constitution of Bolivia in 2009 under indigenous president Evo Morales. Bolivia follows Venezuela and Ecuador in incorporating food sovereignty into its constitution. Food sovereignty is first mentioned in Article 255 in which “Food security and sovereignty for the entire population; the prohibition of importation, production, and commercialization of genetically modified organisms and toxic elements that harm health and the environment” is listed as an guiding principle for all of Bolivia’s contracted international relations. In Article 309, food sovereignty is listed as an objective with which state enterprises and entities should comply.\n\nIn Article 405, the first of Title III, comprehensive, sustainable rural development is noted as a fundamental priority of the State. According to the constitution, the State should prioritize “communitarian economic undertakings and those of the group of rural actors placing emphasis on food security and sovereignty” by the means of five principles. These are as follows:\nAlso in Title III, which is dedicated to comprehensive, sustainable rural development, the guarantee of food sovereignty is listed as an objective of state policy aimed at rural development in coordination with “autonomous and decentralized territorial entities”. Focal to this food sovereignty objective is the production and consumption of foods produced in Bolivia.\n\nBolivian Law 3525 or \"Regulation and Promotion of Ecological Agricultural and Non-timber Forest Production\" states food sovereignty as a right and details international and Bolivian certification systems.\n\nLaw 144, of Productive, Communal and Agricultural Revolution, bans GMO plant varieties for crops native to Bolivia, but not for those such as cotton, rice, sugar cane, and soy that are non-native and popular for export. There is debate among both state actors and indigenous and peasants groups that the GMO ban may make producing less accessible for small farmers and drive up food costs in internal markets.\n\nThe Mother Earth Law concerns food sovereignty in that it asserts nature's rights to be free from genetic modification and have its biodiversity be maintained. It aligns with indigenous food sovereignty logic in that it addresses value in traditional indigenous conceptions of nature as having an inherent right to sustainability and restoration.\n\nFood sovereignty, first coined by indigenous and peasant advocacy organization Vía Campesina, is the “right to produce, distribute, and consume nutritious, culturally appropriate food in a way that is ecologically sustainable” The goals of food sovereignty are to preserve agrobiodiversity, strengthen Bolivia’s internal markets, renew social value for local foods, and secure more power for indigenous and peasant groups in deciding what they eat and how it is produced. In Bolivia, food sovereignty is part of a larger post-neoliberal, decolonized agenda of the state. Pestalozzi notes traditional agricultural systems are quite fluid and incorporate modern agricultural strategies, and that the goals of food sovereignty should be to allowed indigenous groups and farmers to produce and consume food as they wish and in accordance with their values regarding nature.\n\nThe success of agribusiness wholesale production in Bolivia has meant reduced labor returns and increased production costs for rural Bolivian families attempting to maintain plots on their own. This often obliges Bolivian families to search for off-farm supplementary income and means to provide consumer goods, or to migrate away from their farms altogether.\n\nIn Bolivia, an increase in agricultural monocropping to fulfill foreign and domestic market demands has exacerbated historically rooted tensions over the consolidation of land ownership and deforestation between indigenous peoples and peasant farmers on one side and wholesale producing agribusinesses on the other. These businesses use agrochemicals and monocropping that contrast traditional indigenous modes of production. Food sovereignty advocates trace the current food sovereignty struggle back to liberalization of trade and international investment in export-oriented agriculture, such as sugarcane plantations from the mid-twentieth century. Nicole Fabricant equates “early colonial pillaging” to “neocolonial policies of privatization and commodization of the most basic elements”. Small-scale Bolivian farmers and indigenous groups experience difficulty competing with businesses involved in this process and paying off loans acquired from attempts to also participate as a producer. Advocates argue against the power of export-oriented industries to define food production and for the right of the country’s farmers and indigenous groups to do so. New waves of imported cheap and subsidized foods also fill local markets and make it difficult for domestic producers to compete locally or regionally.\n\nBolivian food sovereignty advocates from varied backgrounds of campesino and indigenous identification, take advantage of the now broad and landless global conception of indigeneity and indigenous rights to advocate for food sovereignty. Some argue, however, that the use of this discourse may actually only reinforce a class system in which indigenous peoples are viewed as the a lower ring, powerless group. Migration from the Andes into the Bolivian lowlands, where many agroindustrial complexes have been built, has resulted in the mixing of indigenous knowledge systems and agricultural practices that provide a broad base for the food sovereignty struggle.\n\nVarious indigenous, peasant, government, and non-governmental organizations claim support for food sovereignty, though these groups act on different definitions and motivations. While state-sanctioned food sovereignty may support genetically modified food and agrochemicals, indigenous and peasant groups often do not. Government activities to support food sovereignty include providing training in particular agricultural practices and conducting research on different agriculture approaches. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization also has conducted similar research. Some argue that the state’s conception of food sovereignty serves the purpose of maintaining profit stability as an independent nation and does not possess the same concern for the effects of resource extraction as indigenous groups. The indigenous and peasant advocacy organization Vía Campesina is active in Bolivia’s food sovereignty movement. Four Bolivian organizations are affiliated with Vía Campesina, the Unified Syndical Confederation of Rural Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), the National Confederation of Indigenous Campesino and Native Women of Bolivia–Bartolina Sisa, the Syndicalist Confederation of Intercultural Communities of Bolivia, and the Landless Workers' Movement of Bolivia (MST-B). They advance the idea that food is primarily a people’s resource and source of nutrition and should only secondarily be an item of trade.\n\nThe Bolivian concept of “food sovereignty” differs from that of “food security”. While food security places emphasis on the quantity of food production and increasing access to food, sovereignty is concerned with how, where, and by whom food is produced and how Bolivian communities are affected by an increasingly foreign-influenced market. The food sovereignty ideal has gained traction as a framework for conserving agrobiodiversity, as well as an increased global interest in sustainable and organic agriculture.\n\nBolivian, and particularly Andean, knowledge systems emphasize sharing food, appreciating producers, diversity, environmental risk management, and food security. These knowledge systems include the existence of Pachamama, or Mother Earth, as a sacred being.\n\nThe ayllu is one indigenous knowledge framework that has been discussed as a possible alternative model by which food production could be practiced in a food sovereign Bolivia. The traditional values of reciprocity, communal resource management, and food access are fundamental aspects of the ayllu. The ayllu system has been preserved over time by increased autonomy due to previous condemnation and marginalization in rural lands. The ayllu organizes people into units, focuses on the human as the center of production, and incorporates care and concern for the environment, risk management, and dietary diversity. Gender complementarity is a tenet of the ayllu system, however many women facing gender inequality today have faced difficulty incorporating their voices into the public forums on food sovereignty.\n\nThe aynuqa system balances cultivated land and fallow land through crop rotation in the Bolivian altiplano. Aynuqa plots are communally owned but individually worked and inherited. The plots are put through cycles of land used for crop cultivation, grazing, regrowth, and firewood collection. Communal walls around plots help to protect crops from animals and frost. The construction and use of communal walls lessens individual workload, maintenance costs, and allows farmers to take turns shepherding over their neighbor's animals.The aynuqa is managed by the ayllu system. Categorizations such as \"Lullu Laq'a, Samata, and Puruma\" are used to describe a given field's fertility and state of vegetation regrowth based on traditional knowledge.\n\nIn recent years, ayllus and aynuqas are disappearing due to migration and the intensification of quiona production for export.\n\nBy the fallow system, fields are cultivated for several years with one crop before being allowed to lie fallow for several more years before a new crop is introduced. Of up to hundreds of fields divided amongst farmers, only small subsets are cultivated at a time while others lie fallow. Yields may produce up to three times that of a non-fallow system Bolivian plot. During the fallow period, the vegetation regrowth is used for animal grazing.\n\nTypically the first crop that is planted is potatoes. Later crops may include but are not limited to other varieties of potatoes, quiona, oats, or barley. Despite soil with low nutrient content and harsh environmental conditions in the Andes, the fallow system creates conditions to reproduce soil nutrients and eventually high yields.\n\nThe fallow system incorporates traditional knowledge about soil fertility management with strategic use of newer technologies such as mineral fertilizer at their own discretion. The system not only helps achieve high yields but also sustainably preserves the land’s ability to renew and regrow. At any given time, there are local men working in roles to ensure that the cultivate and fallow rules are being followed properly. Reduced workload, reduced pests, medicinal herb and plant product regeneration, and the mineralization of nutrients for the soil have all been documented as results of the cultivate and fallow system.\n\nQuinoa is a grain native to the Andean region that is high in protein content and micronutrients. It is capable of growing in the harsh climatic conditions of the Bolivian altiplano despite the high levels of frost, salinity, and drought. The crop has long been known for its nutritional value, and has indigenous symbolic meaning due to its long history within the region. It historically has been associated with poorer populations due to its rural use and origin. Preparation of quinoa for consumption is labor-intensive, particularly the removal of the grain’s saponin covering. In the Bolivian Andes, farmers who are compelled to work away from home in order to supplement their own farm income do not have the proper amounts of time to prepare quinoa for their own home consumption, opting instead for cheaper foreign-subsidized breads and pastas.\n\nThere are many different varieties of quinoa, which vary in what type of environment best suited for their production. With quinoa’s growing global popularity, Bolivian farmers have begun to grow the varieties that are favored in the export market rather than those best suited for home consumption. This means a nutritious product is grown in large quantities for export from a country with widespread malnutrition. There have been some attempts to reintroduce quinoa to Bolivia's population through encouragement of more consumption in the middle classes.\n\nForeign interests have patented many varieties of quinoa, and it is sold globally. Due to emphasis on export-oriented production, Bolivian farmers are increasingly excluded from control or consultation over quiona genetic resources. As farmers are encouraged to cultivate market-favoring varieties, native varieties are put at risk of disappearance. As quinoa grows in popularity, the risk of biopiracy and patenting indigenous Andean genetic material increases. This possibility has influenced Bolivian farmers to be reluctant to work with scientist sand groups researching to improve quinoa varieties.\n\nHistorically, quiona was stigmatized as a poor person’s food and replaced by non-indigenous peoples with wheat, barley, and other popular European products. Quiona has attracted interest in recent years as a potential solution to the food security crisis due to its high protein, micronutrients, and \"rustic\" characterization. Quiona’s ability to improve nutritional status for those living in poverty is still debated. Projects that have attempted to reintroduce quiona to rural and impoverished populations have faced difficulty due to the high labor costs and time associated with cultivating quiona as well as the continued lower-class perception of quinoa in Bolivia's urban middle class.\n\nMany industrial farmers originally invested in sugarcane plantations switched to the production of soy. The soy market is very profitable, as it is used globally to create biofuel as an alternative energy source. This shift to soy represents a transformation of Bolivian land use in which the land is used for wholesale production aimed at a global market rather than for subsistence or domestic uses. Small-scale Bolivian farmers and indigenous groups experience difficulty competing with businesses involved in this process and paying off loans acquired from attempts to also participate as a producer.\n\nMuch of Bolivia’s soy and oilseed is produced in Bolivia's tropical eastern lowlands. More than 70% the department of Santa Cruz is devoted to soy production. As a non-native crop, GMO soy seeds are not banned in Bolivia, as is the case of other non-native crops such as cotton, rice, and sugar cane.\n\nImports of wheat from North American countries, in the form of food aid and subsidized commercial product, dwarf the production of traditional Bolivian crops such as quinoa. These imports, as well as reduced tariffs on imports to these areas, are put in place to help feed Bolivia’s poor. The low prices of these subsidized foods means traditional and native crops are not able to compete as crops for national subsistence. Traditional crops thus become targets for export rather than internal consumption. These wheat-based foods are generally less nutritionally dense but easier and cheaper to acquire and consume.\n\nOn example of food sovereignty policy is the \"Enterprise for Support in Food Production\" (EMAPA), established by the Bolivian government during the 2007-2009 food crisis. A rise in international food prices, particularly for grains and oilseed, left poorer nations such as Bolivia vulnerable food insecurity. To combat this and stabilize domestic consumer prices, EMAPA subsidized fertilizer, made and purchased wheat, and distributed subsidized wheat flour in larger Bolivian towns. EMAPA's ultimate purpose was to decrease Bolivia's dependence on the stability of the international food market. According to Schüttel, EMAPA was not ultimately successful in shielding Bolivia from international price shocks.\n"}

{"id": "16763449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16763449", "title": "Greeks in Italy", "text": "Greeks in Italy\n\nGreek presence in Italy begins with the migrations of the old Greek Diaspora in the 8th century BC, continuing down to the present time. There is an ethnic minority known as the Griko people, who live in the Southern Italian regions of Calabria (Province of Reggio Calabria) and Apulia, especially the peninsula of Salento, within the old Magna Graecia region, who speak a distinctive dialect of Greek called Griko. They are believed to be remnants of the ancient and medieval Greek communities, who have lived in the south of Italy for centuries. Alongside this group, a smaller number of more recent migrants from Greece lives in Italy, forming an expatriate community in the country. Today many Greeks in Southern Italy follow Italian customs and culture.\n\nIn the 8th and 7th centuries BC, for various reasons, including demographic crisis (famine, overcrowding, climate change, etc.), the search for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland, Greeks began a large colonization drive, including southern Italy.\n\nIn this same time, Greek colonies were established in places as widely separated as the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Massalia (Marseille). They included settlements in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian peninsula. The Romans called the area of Sicily and the foot of the boot of Italy \"Magna Graecia\" (Latin, \"Greater Greece\"), since it was so densely inhabited by Greeks. The ancient geographers differed on whether the term included Sicily or merely Apulia and Calabria — Strabo being the most prominent advocate of the wider definitions.\n\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, new waves of Greeks came to Magna Graecia from Greece and Asia Minor, as Southern Italy remained governed by the Eastern Roman Empire. Although most of the Greek inhabitants of Southern Italy became de-hellenized and no longer spoke Greek, remarkably a small Griko-speaking minority still exists today in Calabria and mostly in Salento. \"Griko\" is the name of a language combining ancient Doric, Byzantine Greek, and Italian elements, spoken by people in the Magna Graecia region. There is rich oral tradition and Griko folklore, limited now, though once numerous, to only a few thousand people, most of them having become absorbed into the surrounding Italian element. Records of Magna Graecia being predominantly Greek-speaking, date as late as the 11th century (the end of Byzantine domination in Southern Italy).\n\nThe migration of Byzantine Greek scholars and other emigres from Byzantium during the decline of the Byzantine empire (1203–1453) and mainly after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 until the 16th century, is considered by modern scholars as crucial in the revival of Greek and Roman studies, arts and sciences, and subsequently in the development of Renaissance humanism. These emigres were grammarians, humanists, poets, writers, printers, lecturers, musicians, astronomers, architects, academics, artists, scribes, philosophers, scientists, politicians and theologians.\n\nIn the decades following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople many Greeks began to settle in territories of the Republic of Venice, including in Venice itself. In 1479 there were between 4000 and 5000 Greek residents in Venice. Moreover, it was one of the economically strongest Greek communities of that time outside the Ottoman Empire. In November 1494 the Greeks in Venice asked permission and were permitted to found a \"Brotherhood of the Greek race\", a philanthropic and religious society which had its own committee and officers to represent the interests of the flourishing Greek community. This was the first official recognition of the legal status of the Greek colony by the Venetian authorities. In 1539 the Greeks of Venice were permitted to begin building their own church, the \"San Giorgio dei Greci\" which still stands in the centre of Venice in the present day on the \"Rio dei Greci\".\n\nAlthough most of the Greek inhabitants of Southern Italy became entirely Italianized during the Middle Ages (as Paestum had already been in the 4th century BC), pockets of Greek culture and language remained and survived into modern times. This is due to the fact that the migration routes between southern Italy and the Greek mainland never entirely ceased to exist.\n\nThus, for example, Greeks re-colonized the region in the 16th and 17th centuries. This happened in reaction to the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottoman Turks. Especially after the fall of Coroni (1534) large numbers of Greeks and Albanians sought, and were granted, refuge in the areas of Calabria, Salento and Sicily. The Greeks from Coroni - the so-called Coronians - belonged to the nobility and brought with them substantial movable property. They were granted special privileges and given tax exemptions. Another part of the Greeks that moved to Italy came from the Mani region of the Peloponnese. The Maniots were known for their proud military traditions and for their bloody vendettas (another portion of these Greeks moved to Corsica; cf. the Corsican vendettas). These migrations strengthened the depopulated Italian south with a culturally vibrant and militarily capable element.\n\nThe Griko people are a population group in Italy of ultimately Greek origin which still exists today in the Italian regions of Calabria and Apulia. The Griko people traditionally spoke the \"Griko language\", a form of the Greek language combining ancient Doric and Byzantine Greek elements. Some believe that the origins of the Griko language may ultimately be traced to the colonies of Magna Graecia. Greeks were the dominant population element of some regions in the south of Italy, especially Calabria, the Salento, parts of Lucania and Sicily until the 12th century. Over the past centuries the Griko have been heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and Latin culture and as a result many Griko have become largely assimilated into mainstream Italian culture, though once numerous, the Griko are now limited, most of them having become absorbed into the surrounding Italian element. The Griko language is severely endangered due to language shift towards Italian and large-scale internal migration to the cities in recent decades. The Griko community is currently estimated at 60,000 members.\n\nAfter World War II, a large number of Greeks immigrated to countries abroad, mostly to the United States, Canada and Australia, however, a smaller number of diaspora migrants from Greece entered Italy from World War II onwards, today the Greek diaspora community consists of some 30,000 people, the majority of whom are located in Rome and Central Italy.\n\n\n\nJonathan Harris, 'Being a Byzantine after Byzantium: Hellenic Identity in Renaissance Italy', \"Kambos: Cambridge Papers in Modern Greek\" 8 (2000), 25-44\n\nJonathan Harris, \"Greek Emigres in the West, 1400–1520\" (Camberley, 1995)\n\nJonathan Harris and Heleni Porphyriou, 'The Greek diaspora: Italian port cities and London, c. 1400–1700', in \"Cities and Cultural Transfer in Europe: 1400–1700\", ed.

{"id": "4042957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4042957", "title": "Hungarians in Serbia", "text": "Hungarians in Serbia\n\nHungarians in Serbia are the second largest ethnic group in the country if not counting Kosovo. According to the 2011 census, there are 253,899 ethnic Hungarians composing 3.5% of the population of Serbia. The majority of them live in the northern province of Vojvodina, where they number 251,136 or 13% of the population of the province. Most Hungarians in Serbia are Roman Catholics by faith, while smaller numbers of them are Protestant (mostly Calvinist). Hungarian is listed as one of the six official languages of Vojvodina, autonomous province which traditionally fosters multilingualism, multiculturalism and multiconfessionalism.\n\nParts of the Vojvodina region were included into the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 10th century, and Hungarians then began to settle in the region, which before that time was mostly populated by the West Slavs. During Hungarian administration, Hungarians formed the largest part of population in northern parts of the region, while southern parts were populated by sizable Slavic population. Following the Ottoman conquest and inclusion of Vojvodina into Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, most of the Hungarian population fled from the region. During Ottoman occupation, Vojvodina region was mostly populated by Serbs and Muslim Slavs (Great Migrations of the Serbs). New Hungarian settlers started to come to the region with the establishment of the Habsburg administration at the beginning of the 18th century, mostly after the Peace of Passarowitz (Požarevac).\n\nCount Imre Csáky settled Hungarians in his possessions in Bačka in 1712. In 1745, Hungarian colonists settled in Senta, in 1750 in Topola, in 1752 in Doroslovo, in 1772 in Bogojevo, in 1760 in Stara Kanjiža, in 1764 in Iđoš, in 1767 in Petrovo Selo, in 1776 in Martonoš, in 1786 in Pačir and Ostojićevo, in 1787 in Piroš, and in 1789 in Feketić. Between 1782 and 1786, Hungarians settled in Crvenka and Stara Moravica, and in 1794 in Kula.\n\nHungarians of Roman Catholic faith originated mostly from Transdanubia, while those of Protestant faith originated mostly from Alföld. Between 1751 and 1753, Hungarians settled in Mol and Ada (Those originated mostly from Szeged and Jászság). In 1764–1767, Hungarians settled in Subotica, Bajmok and Čantavir, and in 1770 again in Kanjiža, Mol, Ada and Petrovo Selo, as well as in Feldvarac, Sentomaš and Turija.\n\nIn Banat, the settling of Hungarians started later. In 1784 Hungarians settled in Padej and Nakovo, in 1776 in Torda, in 1786 in Donji Itebej, in 1796 in Beodra and Čoka, in 1782 in Monoštor, in 1798 in Mađarska Crnja, in 1773 in Krstur and Majdan, in 1774 in Debeljača, in 1755–1760 in Bečkerek, and in 1766 in Vršac. In 1790, 14 Hungarian families from Transylvania settled in Banat.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Hungarian expansion increased. From the beginning of the century, the Hungarian individuals and small groups of settlers from Alföld constantly immigrating to Bačka. In the first half of the 19th century larger and smaller groups of the colonists settled in Mol (in 1805), as well as in Feldvarac, Temerin and Novi Sad (in 1806). In 1884, Hungarian colonists settled in Šajkaška and in Mali Stapar near Sombor. In 1889, Hungarians were settled in Svilojevo near Apatin and in 1892 in Gomboš, while another group settled in Gomboš in 1898. Many Hungarian settlers from Gomboš moved to Bačka Palanka. After the abolishment of the Military Frontier, Hungarian colonists were settled in Potisje, Čurug, Žabalj, Šajkaški Sveti Ivan, Titel and Mošorin. In 1883 around 1,000 Székely Hungarians settled in Kula, Stara Kanjiža, Stari Bečej and Titel.\n\nIn 1800, smaller groups of Hungarian colonists from Transdanubia settled in Čoka, while in the same time colonists from Csanád and Csongrád counties settled in area around Itebej and Crnja, where they at first lived in scattered small settlements, and later they formed one single settlement – Mađarska Crnja. In 1824, one group of colonists from Čestereg also settled in Mađarska Crnja. In 1829 Hungarians settled in Mokrin, and in 1880 an even larger number of Hungarians settled in this municipality. In 1804, Hungarian colonists from Csongrád county settled in Firiđhaza (which was then joined with Turska Kanjiža), as well as in Sajan and Torda. Even a larger group of Hungarians from Csongrád settled in 1804 in Debeljača. In 1817–1818 Hungarians settled in Veliki Bikač, and in 1820–1840 smaller groups of Hungarians settled in Vranjevo. In 1826, colonists from Jászság and Kunság settled in Arač near Beodra. In 1830, Hungarians from Alföld settled in Veliki Lec, in 1831 in Ostojićevo, in 1832 in Malenčino Selo near Veliki Gaj, in 1839 and 1870 in Padej, in 1840 in Jermenovci and Mađarski Sentmihalj, in 1840–1841 in Dušanovac, in 1841 in Hetin, in 1859 in Sanad, in 1869 in Đurđevo (later moved to Skorenovac), and in 1890 in Gornja Mužlja. In 1883-1886, Székely Hungarians from Bukovina were settled in Vojlovica, Skorenovac, Ivanovo and Đurđevo. Total number of Székely colonists was 3,520.\n\nThe first Hungarian settlers in the southern region of Srem moved there during the 1860s from neighbouring counties, especially from Bačka.\n\nAccording to the 1900 census, the Hungarians were the largest ethnic group in the Bács-Bodrog County and made up 42.7% in the population (the second largest were Germans with 25.1%, and the third largest group were Serbs with 18.2%). The Hungarians were third largest group in the Torontál County (West Banat) with 18.8% (after Serbs with 31.5% and Germans with 30,2%). In the next census, in 1910, the Hungarians were the largest group in the Bács-Bodrog County with 44,8% in the population (followed by Germans with 23.5% and Serbs with 17.9%), and the third largest in the Torontál County with 20.9% (Serbs with 32.5%, Germans with 26.9%).\n\nThe new temporary borders established in 1918 and permanent ones defined by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 put an end to Hungarian immigration. After World War I, present-day Vojvodina was included into the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and many Hungarians of Vojvodina wanted to live in the post-Trianon Hungarian state, thus, some of them immigrated to Hungary, which was a destination for several emigration waves of Hungarians from Vojvodina. The interwar period was generally marked by a stagnation of the Hungarian population. During these times, they numbered around 363,000 (1921 census) – 376,000 (1931 census) and they constituted about 23-24% of the entire population of Vojvodina. The outbreak of the Second World War caused some changes in population numbers, but more importantly it created tensions between the Hungarian and Serb communities.\n\nWith the onset of World War II, the Hungarian-Serb relations were low. Nazi Germany, in accordance to its \"Operation Punishment\" plan, invaded Yugoslavia, and subsequently, Axis Hungarian forces occupied Bačka. This region was annexed by Hungary, and it was settled by new Hungarian settlers, at which time number of Hungarians in the area grew considerably, while in the same time many Serbs were expelled from Bačka. The brutal conduct of the Axis Hungarian occupying forces, including the Hungarian army and , has polarized both Hungarian and Serb communities. Under the Axis Hungarian authority, 19,573 people were killed in Bačka, of which the majority of victims were of Serb, Jewish and Romani origin.\n\nAlthough part of the local Hungarian population supported Hungarian Axis authorities, many other local Hungarians opposed Axis rule and fought against it together with Serbs and other peoples of Vojvodina in the Partisan resistance movement organized by the Communist Party. In some places of Vojvodina (Bačka Topola, Senta), most of the members of the communist party were ethnic Hungarians. In Subotica, the party secretary and most of the leadership were either ethnic Hungarians or Hungarian-speaking Jews. In the Bačka Topola municipality, 95% of communists were ethnic Hungarians. One of the leaders of the partisan resistance movement in Vojvodina was Erne Kiš, ethnic Hungarian, who was captured by the Axis authorities, sentenced to death by the court in Szeged and executed.\n\nAmong the other actions of the resistance movement, the first corn stacks were burned near Futog by five communists, of whom two were ethnic Hungarians – brothers Antal Nemet and Đerđ Nemet. Antal was killed there, together with his Serb comrade, in the fighting against gendarmes, while his brother was captured and killed in Novi Sad because he refused to reveal any information about resistance movement. The corn stacks were soon also burned near Subotica. The communists that burned these corn stacks were arrested, tortured and sent to court. Two of them were sentenced to death (Ferenc Hegediš and Jožef Liht), while five other were sentenced to prison (because they were not adult).\n\nThe Axis authorities also arrested sizable number of Hungarian communists in Bačka Topola, Čantavir, Senta, Subotica and Novi Sad. Many of them were sent to the investigation centre in Bačka Topola, where part of them was killed, while some committed suicide. Among those Hungarian communists who were sent to the centre were Otmar Majer, Đula Varga, Pal Karas and Janoš Koči. Because of the size of the communist movement among Hungarians, new investigation centres were opened in Čantavir, Senta, Ada and Subotica. In the investigation centre in Subotica, almost 1,000 people were tortured, and part of them killed, among whom were Maćaš Vuković and Daniel Sabo. Among those communists sentenced to death were Otmar Majer, Rokuš Šimoković and Ištvan Lukač from Subotica, Peter Molnar from Senta, as well as Đula Varga, Rudi Klaus, Pal Karas and Janoš Koči from Novi Sad. In Petrovo Selo, Mihalj Šamu was killed during his attempt to escape. These actions of the Axis authorities were a hard strike on the resistance movement in Bačka, especially on its Hungarian component. The Hungarian component of the resistance movement was struck so hard that it could not recover until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1944, the Soviet Red Army and the Yugoslav partisan] took control of Vojvodina, and new communist authorities initiated purges against one part of local population that either collaborated with the Axis authorities or was viewed as a threat to the new regime (see: Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–1945). During this time, Partisans brutally massacred about 40,000 Hungarian civilians. In October 1944 3,000 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality in Srbobran were executed by the Serbian communist partisans from the village of 18,000 inhabitants.\n\nIn Bečej killing of the Hungarians began on 9 October 1944. In the city of Sombor in October 1944 the murdering of the Hungarians started at once on the basis of the death-list previously made. The Hungarians were taken to the Palace of Kronich. Next to the race-course the common graves were dug in which 2,500 Hungarians were buried. Several other common graves can be found in the outside districts of the city. The inhabitants of the Hungarian city were fully exterminated. In total 5,650 Hungarians were executed. A Soviet officer in Temerin prevented the extirpation of the whole Hungarian population of the village. Hungarian human loss of the village was 480 people. During the first week about 1500 Hungarians were shot down into the Danube in Novi Sad under the leadership of Todor Gavrilović. On 3 November 1944 in Bezdan Hungarian male inhabitants of the village in the age of between l6 and 5O years were driven to a sports ground. 118 men were shot down by machine pistol to the Danube. 2830 Serbian communist partisans who made the murder belonged to the udarna brigade No. 12 in the division No. 51. It is strange but the Soviet officers were also horrified at the massacre because they were who stopped further executions. On 3 December 1944 56 Hungarian citizens were executed on the bank of the Tisza river in Adorjan. In Žabalj 2,000 Hungarian citizens were killed. \nIn Subotica during the 1944-45 period about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarian) were killed by Yugoslav Partisans as retribution for supporting Hungary re-taking the city. At the end of war detachments of Serbian Partisans occupied Čurug and murdered 3000 local ethnic Hungarian residents. The surviving ethnic Hungarian residents of the village were deported to detention camps and were never allowed to return. Ethnic Hungarians Germans were declared to be collaborators or exploiters. Those suspected of not supporting the emerging Communist regime or who belonged to a \"wrong\" ethnic group were the targets of persecution.\n\nEver since the end of the Second World War, the Hungarian population has been steadily declining, mainly due to low birthrates and emigration. In 1974, the Yugoslav constitution was modified giving Vojvodina a very high level of autonomy and local Hungarians participated in Vojvodinian provincial administration. The Hungarians were also given the opportunity to keep their culture and language alive; they had their own schools and cultural institutions. During the reign of Josip Broz Tito, life in Vojvodina was peaceful for Hungarians as well as for others. The socialist regime heavily cracked down upon nationalist flareups.\n\nAs the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s were raging, more Hungarians left Vojvodina. One of the reasons for this emigration was the ruined economy of the country and inability for employment, which was the reason why many Serbs as well as others also emigrated from Vojvodina. Although the province was peaceful and calm compared to other areas of Yugoslavia, some Hungarians felt threatened, especially because Vojvodina was near the front lines, during the War in Croatia. With an emigration of Hungarians from Vojvodina, one part of their former houses was used for resettlement of refugees from other parts of former Yugoslavia. This created a change of the ethnic structure in some parts of the region. The Hungarian population has fallen from 340,946 (16.9%) in 1991, to 290,207 (14.28%) in 2002. In recent years (mostly in 2004 and 2005), some members of the ethnic Hungarian community have sometimes been the targets of anti-Hungarian sentiment.\n\nToday, many Hungarians in Vojvodina want their political rights to be extended. Some local Hungarian politicians proposing the creation of new autonomous region in northern part of Vojvodina inhabited mainly by Hungarians (see: Hungarian Regional Autonomy). They also want to attain Hungarian citizenship, without being Hungarian residents, as this would automatically make them EU citizens, giving many benefits. However, a referendum on this issue in Hungary failed. The political future of Vojvodinian Hungarians is uncertain, as their community is characterized by low birthrates and a dwindling population – according to some demographic predictions, Hungarians of Vojvodina will probably lost ethnic majority/plurality in some municipalities and sizable towns, but they will certainly remain in majority in others. Thus, while Hungarians will remain notable ethnic group in northern part of Vojvodina, partial demographic changes in the area will probably reduce demands of local Hungarian politicians for territorial autonomy or at least for wide territorial extension of the proposed Hungarian autonomous region.\n\nAlmost all Hungarians in Serbia are to be found in Vojvodina, and especially in its northern part (North Bačka and North Banat districts, respectively) where majority (57.17%) of them live. Hungarians in the five municipalities form the absolute majority: Kanjiža (85.13%), Senta (79.09%), Ada (75.04%), Bačka Topola (57.94%), and Mali Iđoš (53.91%). The ethnically mixed municipalities with relative Hungarian majority are Čoka (49.66%), Bečej (46.34%) and Subotica (35.65%). The multiethnic city of Subotica is a cultural and political centre for the Hungarians in Serbia. Protestant Hungarians form the plurality or majority of population in the settlements of Stara Moravica, Pačir, Feketić, Novi Itebej and Debeljača.\n\nThere are five main ethnic Hungarian political parties in Vojvodina:\n\nThese parties are advocating the establishment of the territorial autonomy for Hungarians in the northern part of Vojvodina, which would include the municipalities with Hungarian majority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest generally accepted archaeological evidence for human habitation in South America dates to 14,000 years ago, the Monte Verde site in Southern Chile. The descendents of these first inhabitants would become the indigenous populations of South America.\n\nBefore the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many of the indigenous peoples of South America were hunter-gatherers, and indeed many still are, especially in the Amazonian area. Others, especially the Andean cultures, practised sophisticated agriculture, utilized advanced irrigation and kept domesticated livestock, such as llamas and alpacas. In the period after the initial arrival of Europeans in 1492 the indigenous population of South America fell rapidly due to a variety of factors, such as disease and warfare.\n\nIn the present day, there are two South American countries where indigenous peoples constitute the largest ethnic group. These are Peru, where 45% are indigenous, and Bolivia, where 62% of people identify as feeling a part of some indigenous group. \n\nSouth American indigenous peoples include:\n\n\n\n"}

The majority of Irish immigrants to Mexico were Catholic.\n\nDuring the colonial era a few ethnic Irish entered Mexico. Notable among them were Governor of Yucatán and Texas Hugo Oconór and the last Viceroy of New Spain, Juan O'Donojú.\n\nA few Mexican Irish communities existed in Mexican Texas until the Texas Revolution. Many Irish then sided with Catholic Mexico against Protestant pro-U.S. elements. The \"Batallón de San Patricio\" was a largely (ethnically) Irish battalion of U.S. troops who deserted and fought alongside the Mexican Army against the United States in the Mexican–American War of 1846 to 1848. In some cases, Irish immigrants or Americans left from California (the Irish Confederate army of Fort Yuma, Arizona during the American Civil War in 1861) and blended into Mexican society instead.\n\nÁlvaro Obregón (O'Brien) was president of Mexico during 1920–1924 and Ciudad Obregón and its airport are named in his honor. Actor Anthony Quinn is another famous Mexican of Irish descent. There are also monuments in Mexico City paying tribute to those Irish who fought for Mexico in the 1800s.\n\n\n"}

It is best remembered as a gathering place of the elite of nineteenth-century French society. The club still exists at 2 rue Rabelais in Paris, and it hosts the International Federation of Racing Authorities.\n\nThe Jockey Club was originally organized as the \"Society for the Encouragement of the Improvement of Horse Breeding in France\", to provide a single authority for horse racing in the nation, beginning at Chantilly in 1834. It swiftly became the center for the most \"sportifs\" gentlemen of \"le tout-Paris.\" At the same time, when aristocrats and men of the \"haute bourgeoisie\" still formed the governing class, its Anglo-Gallic membership could not fail to give it some political colour: Napoleon III, who had passed some early exile in England, asserted that he had learned to govern an empire through \"his intercourse with the calm, self-possessed men of the English turf\".\n\nBetween 1833 and 1860, the Jockey Club transformed the Champ de Mars into a racecourse, which has since been transferred to Longchamp. One front of the Café de la Paix is in rue Scribe, which ends at the façade of the Opéra Garnier. On the wall is a memorial plaque on the Hotel Scribe, at number 1, which records the former premises of the Jockey Club, which occupied luxurious quarters on the first floor from 1863 to 1913.\n\nDuring the Second Empire and the Third Republic, the gentlemen of the Jockey Club held numerous boxes at the Opera (\"many little suspended salons\" in Marcel Proust's phrase), where the required ballet expected in every opera was never in the first act, when the Jockey Club would habitually still be at dinner. One result was the famous fiasco of the \"Paris \"Tannhäuser\"\" of 1861, when Wagner insisted on inserting the requisite ballet into the first act. The second act, when the members of the Jockey Club arrived to view their favourites in the corps de ballet, was all but hissed off the stage. Wagner never permitted another production in Paris. Proust made his fictional character Charles Swann a member of the Jockey Club as a signal honor, given Swann's Jewish background.\n\nOn the ground floor beneath the Jockey Club was the fashionable Grand Café. There, on 28 December 1895, a stylish crowd in the \"Salon Indien\" attended the public début of the Lumière brothers' invention, the cinematograph.\n\nThe Jockey Club is directed by an annually-elected committee of a president, four vice-presidents and twenty-five members. New members are sponsored by two current members and must receive five-sixths of the members' votes.\n\n\nUnder the patronage of the Jockey Club, the \"Prix du Jockey Club\" (1,500,000 euros) has been run at the Chantilly Racecourse (at the foot of the Château de Chantilly) on the first Sunday in June since 1836. The race at the \"Hippodrome de Chantilly\" is the proving-ground of the best of the three-year-olds, the French equivalent of The Derby at Epsom Downs or the Kentucky Derby in the USA.\n\nUntil 2004, the course was 2400 meters; since then, it has been run at 2100 meters. In France, only the \"Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe\" has a richer purse (1,600,000 euros); that race was inaugurated by the Jockey Club in 1863 as the Grand Prix de Paris, and run at the Hippodrome de Longchamp. The racecourse was painted by Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Pablo Picasso, among others.\n\n\n\n"}

There are some 220,000 Mamprusi living in Ghana and approximately 11,000 in Togo. They speak Mampruli, a Gur language. In Ghana, the Mamprusis live mainly in Nalerigu and Gambaga in the northwest of the Northern Region but also inhabit parts of the Upper East Region.\n\nThe Mamprusi Kingdom was founded around the 16th century by the Great Naa Gbanwah/Gbewah at Pusiga, a village 14 kilometres from Bawku. The Kingdom spans most of the Northern and the Upper East Regions of Ghana, and into Burkina Faso. As a consequence, the King of Mossi to this day is \"enskinned\" by the Nayiri – the king of Mamprugu. Thus, establishing this kingdom as the pre-eminent of its kind, and the only kingdom in present-day Ghana whose relevance and authority cuts across national boundaries on the weight of its humble supremacy. The name of the kingdom is Mamprugu, the ethnicity is Mamprusi, and the language is Mampruli.\n\nMamprusis revere the hallowed grounds of Bawku as their ancestral home, their origin. That is why Naa Gbewah's tomb in Pusiga, is a shrine of repute to this day. It is believed that his disappearance was subteraneal, one of the marvels of Northern Ghana, and many ethnicities hold to agree with this uncommon historical account. It was after his death that his children moved farther afield and founded other kingdoms, namely: Dagbon and Namum.\n\nNote that the name Naa Gbanwah and Gbewah can be used interchangeably, the difference being that Mamprusis refer to him as gbanwah and dagombas refer to him as gbewah. It is just a difference in pronunciations.\n\nThe people of Mamprusi were led by a great warrior Tohazie \"\"the Red Hunter\". During the migration Tohazie died and his grandson Na-Gbewa succeeded him. Na-Gbewa died and he was succeeded by his oldest son Wiliri.\n\n"}
{"id": "1088457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1088457", "title": "Mask and Wig", "text": "Mask and Wig\n\nThe Mask and Wig Club, a private club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1889, is the oldest all-male collegiate musical comedy troupe in the United States. Created as an alternative to the existing theatrical and dramatic outlets at the University of Pennsylvania, Mask and Wig has presented comedy, music, and dancing to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and audiences across the country. Its credo is \"Justice to the stage; credit to the University.\"\n\nThe club's performers, or \"The Cast,\" put on two all-original shows each year in collaboration with the Club's own Stage Crew, Band, and Business Staff. Many Mask and Wig originals were made famous on the radio by mid 20th century luminaries. The well-known \"Route 66\" was composed by club member Bobby Troup and launched to the height of popularity by Frank Sinatra. Troup's song \"Daddy\" was written for a Mask and Wig show. Other Mask and Wig songs, such as \"The Gypsy in My Soul,\" written by Clay Boland and Moe Jaffe, have been performed by the likes of Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Ella Fitzgerald. The first electrically recorded album ever released was Mask and Wig's \"Joan of Arkansas,\" in April 1925.\n\nThe Mask and Wig Club of the University of Pennsylvania was first conceived of in 1888 by a small group of undergraduates, led by Clayton Fotterall McMichael, who were interested in the stage and desired something the University did not offer: a troupe that would produce original humorous theatrical pieces. In 1889, therefore, McMichael and the other original founders sent out a call for undergraduate men to audition for the group and participate in the creation and production of its first performance.\n\nMcMichael and his peers envisioned a group that involved dressing up in frocks and performing spoofs and parodies. Because colleges at the time were open only to young gentlemen, any production was limited to an all–male cast. These organizations naturally saw burlesque, which was quite popular in that era, as the perfect genre. The overblown characterizations, loose plotting, musical interludes, and parody of high art made the style perfect for a group of young, well-educated, amateur men, especially since the drag tradition came \"built-in\".\n\nFounder McMichael combed the local bookstores for a story to produce and found it in Henry Byron's The Nymphs of the Lurleyburg. A substantially altered version, \"Lurline\", the Club's first production, hit the boards at the Chestnut Street Opera House on June 4, 1889, for one night only. Backed financially by the ladies of Philadelphia high society, the Club enjoyed great success in its early years. With increasingly reliable audience turnout and revenue from ticket sales, the runs were extended and the Club established a fine tradition among Philadelphia's theater–going society. Moreover, the club made a very strong impression on campus and it achieved great notoriety within its first year of existence.\nIn 1894 the Club purchased a property at 310 South Quince Street to serve as a gathering place and rehearsal hall, the Mask and Wig Clubhouse. The building had been erected by the first African-American Lutheran congregation in America as St. Paul's Lutheran Church in 1834, but had been sold in 1839 and converted into a coachhouse and stable, and later into a dissecting room for medical students. Prominent Philadelphia architect Wilson Eyre was commissioned to remodel the building, and hired the young Maxfield Parrish, who would later become one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century, to decorate the interior. The Grille Room was decorated with caricatures of members, a tradition that continues today, with the second century of members' caricatures continued upstairs at the entrance to the auditorium. Eyre expanded the clubhouse to its present size, 1901-1903.\n\nThe Club prospered throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The middle of this century was a heady time for the Club. Mask and Wig songs were the rage of the big band orchestras, radio shows, and solo acts of the day. The likes of Frank Sinatra, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Rosemary Clooney, and Les Brown all covered Mask and Wig tunes. Between 1952 and 1958, the club appeared four times on The Ed Sullivan Show. The 1961 production, \"Wry on the Rocks\", introduced a satirical revue format in a cabaret atmosphere. In 1992, with \"Myth America\", Mask and Wig returned the student–written book musical to its stage, a practice which continues to this day. Important in the show's success are the traditional high standards in the caliber of performers and excellence of the material performed. The Club's primary purpose has always been and continues to be, \"Justice to the stage; credit to the University.\"\n\nImmediately after the end of World War II the Mask and Wig dormitory on the residence quadrangle was used to house a U.S. Army unit assigned to quickly learn the Japanese language. Upon the completion of the study the soldiers were to be commissioned in the U.S. Army and serve in the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) of the Army in Japan. This army unit had classes in the University in the Egyptian Antiquities room while being scrutinized by several mummies. Classes were also held in the Wharton School of Business. Jerry Epple, a member of the Army Specialized Training Program, says he remembers to this day the stone carving of a mask and wig near the dormitory entrance.\n\nToday, Mask and Wig maintains its position as one of the premier extracurricular activities on the Penn campus. Its yearly tour over spring break brings the show to alumni clubs across the nation.\n\nThe Mask and Wig Club has two components: the Undergraduate Company and the Graduate Club. The Undergraduate Company is composed of current undergrads at the University of Pennsylvania, who are the performers in and creators of each year's productions. They are the public face of the organization.\n\nThe Graduate Club is composed of Mask and Wig Alumni. The Graduate Club is responsible for many of the decisions that guide the Undergraduate Club, including overseeing many aspects of the production of the Spring Show, and the maintenance of the Clubhouse. They provide much of the funding for the maintenance of the Clubhouse and were responsible for raising the funds for its renovation. The Graduate Club and the Undergraduate Club interface through regular Board of Governors meetings, which feature both Undergraduate and Graduate club members.\n\nThe Mask and Wig Club is made up of four distinct sections: the cast, the band, the crew, and the business staff.\n\nThe cast writes and performs all of its own material during the Fall and Spring Shows. The band often functions as a pit orchestra, playing original, self-arranged pieces for the Fall show, and professionally arranged pieces for the Spring production. The band also holds the headliner spot at the University of Pennsylvania's annual Spring Fling festival in the Quad. The crew builds elaborate, ornate, and completely original sets for both the Fall and Spring Shows. The business staff is responsible for advertising and selling tickets for the club's shows.\n\nPresident: Louis Hornick III '02\n\nVice-President: David E. Simon '86\n\nSecretary: Jonathan F.

The show is held during the first week of the academic year and is free of charge to all new freshmen. The cast performs classic bits that are tried and true. Free Show serves a few purposes: it introduces the new freshmen of the University of Pennsylvania to one of Penn's oldest institutions, and hopes to recruit new members by displaying what membership in the group entails. In 2018, for the first time the Free Show was performed in collaboration with Penn's all-female musical sketch comedy troupe, Bloomers.\n\nEach fall, the undergraduates produce their own sketch comedy show that runs for one week in a theater on Penn's campus. The upperclassmen handle all aspects of production from acting direction to choreography to musical production. A notable highlight of the show is the Second Act Opener, which consists of a medley of songs from a famous musician or group, but with parodied lyrics that often follow a Penn-centered plot. Past parodied musicians include Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, The Beatles, Aerosmith, Disney, and Queen.\n\nIn 1999, Mask and Wig established an annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival to showcase the talent of the nation's best collegiate sketch comedy troupes. The mission of the festival is not just to put on a hilarious show that cultivates new talent, but also to honor and showcase a well-known comedian. Each host does a stand-up routine for the audience and participates in sketches with Mask and Wig. Past college sketch troupes include:\n\nPast guest hosts include:\n\nThe Spring Show, historically known as the Annual Production, is the theatrical centerpiece of Mask and Wig. Performed at The Mask and Wig Clubhouse, the production is an original show that runs from late January to early April. While the format of the Spring Show has evolved over the years, the show currently runs as a full \"book\" musical comedy, complete with singing and tap dancing.\n\nUnlike the Fall Show, the Annual Production is professionally composed, directed, and choreographed by some of the best talents in the industry. The script, however, is written by the Club's cast.\n\nDuring spring break the troupe takes their show around the country as they road trip across the United States, usually performing in areas with a high Penn alumni concentration. The trip usually includes about four to six stops. In recent years the tour has taken Wig to cities like London, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Toronto.\n\nThe tour is yet another one of the group's many traditions. In Mask and Wig's heyday, the group had its own train car that it would use to do a similar tour around the nation.\n\nThe Mask and Wig Band traditionally headlines the last day of Spring Fling performances, which was historically a Saturday, at the stage in the Lower Quad. In 2018 the festival was moved to Penn Park along with the Mask and Wig performance. They generally perform an hour-long set of covers of popular music. Members of the cast generally sing for the band, along with female vocalists from other Penn performing arts groups. The other members of the company join the band on stage for the duration of the performance, and the show concludes with the singing of the Mask and Wig hallmark musical number, Tradition, by the senior members of the company.\n\nWorking in his studio just a few blocks away at Thirteenth and Walnut Streets, Maxfield Parrish received one of his first commissions in 1894 from Mask and Wig. This first job came as he was finishing his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy; it was for decoration of the stage proscenium and ticket window, illustration of a number of caricatures on the wall of the Grille Room, and most notably the Old King Cole mural. This was the start of his professional career; shortly after seeing the mural, the editor of “Harper's” Magazine invited Parrish to do some of their covers for which he became famous. He would continue working for the Club to finish a total of 35 caricatures and illustrate the earliest program covers.\n\nWilson Eyre was older and more established than Parrish when he began working on the Clubhouse, and was good friends with Parrish's father, Stephen. Eyre was the architect in charge of renovating the Club's new home and transforming it from a stable into a “Bavarian” themed Clubhouse. His first remodel in 1894 transformed the space from the stable by adding an entry hall with stairs, designing and decorating the Grille Room, and turning the second floor into a theater. Eyre designed most of the furniture in the Grille Room; three of the original tables still exist and will be returned to the Clubhouse upon its reopening. Eyre also oversaw the second major change. The building was enlarged in 1903 by adding 10 feet to the front creating the façade that still exists there today. Eyre's original drawing of the front design, created in 1902, is shown to the right. Eyre's design has endured for over a century with few changes aside from the ongoing addition of paneling for caricatures in the Grille Room and Theater. Though Eyre's career included several projects like the Clubhouse, he is best known for his design of the University of Pennsylvania’s Museum.\n\nImmediately following the close of the 2007 Spring show, the clubhouse began to undergo an extensive renovation. In addition to bringing the building up to modern code, the club also installed an elevator and central air conditioning unit. The construction, originally projected to be complete in time for a normal Spring show run, experienced a number of delays and setbacks. On the morning of March 15, 2008, a fire broke out in the attic of the clubhouse, setting back the completion date indefinitely. While nothing of historical significance was critically damaged, the 2008 Spring show, \"West Wing Story\", could not go on in the club's signature theater.\n\nLuckily, the club had a contingency plan in case of such an emergency, and was able to put on their show. \"West Wing Story\" played for two weekends in April, 2008 at the Prince Music Theater in downtown Philadelphia, marking the first annual production to be performed at a venue other than the clubhouse since 1960. The generosity of Mask and Wig's Graduate Club made it financially possible to perform in a professional theater. With renovations still behind schedule in 2009, the annual production \"Oh, the Humanities!\" was also performed at the Prince Music Theater for three weekends, selling a record number of tickets due to the large theater capacity.\n\nThe clubhouse renovation was completed in the fall of 2009, allowing the club to once again return to its own stage for the 2010 Annual Production, \"A Cheshire Catastrophe\".\n\n\n"}

This is now the Department of Government & Justice Studies.\n\nDr. Robinson has published seventeen books in the areas of criminal justice, crime mapping, criminological theory, corporate crime, media coverage of crime, the war on drugs, and the death penalty. His books include \"Justice Blind? Ideals and Realities of American Criminal Justice\" (Prentice Hall, 2002, 2005, 2009), \"Why Crime? An Integrated Systems Theory of Antisocial Behavior\" (Prentice Hall, 2004), \"Why Crime? An Interdisciplinary Approach to Explaining Criminal Behavior\" (Carolina Academic Press, 2009), \"Spatial Aspects of Crime: Theory and Practice\" (Allyn & Bacon, 2004), \"Crime Mapping and Spatial Aspects of Crime: Theory and Practice\" (Allyn & Bacon, 2008), \"Lies, Damn Lies, and Drug War Statistics\" (State University of New York Press, 2007, 2013), \"Death Nation: The Experts Explain American Capital Punishment\" (Prentice Hall, 2007), \"Greed is Good: Maximization and Elite Deviance in America\" (Rowman & Littlefield, 2008), \"Media Coverage of Crime and Criminal Justice\" (Carolina Academic Press, 2011, 2014), \"Crime Prevention: The Essentials\" (Bridgepoint Education, 2013), \"Criminal INjustice: How Politics and Ideology Distort American Ideals\" (Carolina Academic Press, 2014), \"Social Justice, Criminal Justice: The Role of American Law in Effecting and Preventing Social Change\" (Anderson, 2015), and \"Race, Ethnicity, Crime, and Justice\" (Carolina Academic Press, 2015).\n\nIn terms of the death penalty, Robinson's work in \"Death Nation\" illustrates what scholarly experts think of the death penalty in America. They overwhelmingly characterize the death penalty as a failed policy, and Robinson's review of the latest empirical evidence supports this conclusion. Professor Bohm responds to the book, noting: \"Robinson makes a unique contribution to the death penalty debate by presenting the results from his study of 45 death penalty experts and their views on capital punishment.\n\nRobinson's analysis is very thorough and reading the responses of the experts is fascinating ... It is reassuring to know that most people who have studied the death penalty for many years find it to be an archaic punishment not worthy of a modern, civilized society.\" Professor Ludowise notes: \"The death penalty story is good and ... illuminating ... The author has provided a fair and balanced approach to the many facets of the capital punishment policy debated in the U.S.\" His work was also considered by officials in various states debating whether to continue to utilize the punishment.\n\nRobinson also authored the report, \",\" which reviews all the studies conducted of the state's death penalty system. The report illustrates five important facts about the death penalty in North Carolina, including that the death penalty is rare, not a deterrent to murder, more costly than life imprisonment, racially biased, and a threat even to innocent people.\n\nRobinson's work on the drug war has led to major challenges to federal drug control policy. He and co-author Renee Scherlen, were invited to Washington, DC to debate the top policy analyst/chief scientist at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Professor Shelden reacted to the work with: \"Robinson and Scherlen have provided a thorough critique of the claims made by those in charge of the drug war. This book will no doubt prove to be a valuable resource for those trying to make sense of a war that has created so much havoc within our society.\"\n\nIncidentally, the first two chapters provide the reader with an excellent overview on the how the drug war came to be, including a brief history of anti-drug legislation. For those not familiar with this history, these chapters will provide much needed information to fill this gap. Read it, learn from it, use it.\" Ethan Nadelmann, Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance, reacts: \"Robinson and Scherlen make a valuable contribution to documenting how the Office of National Drug Control Policy fails to live up to basic standards of accountability and consistency.\"\n\nProfessor Gray says: \"Dr. Robinson and Dr. Scherlen have performed a valuable service to our democracy with their meticulous analysis of the White House ONDCP public statements and reports. They have pulled the sheet off what appears to be an official policy of deception using clever and sometimes clumsy attempts at statistical manipulation. This document, at last, gives us a map to the truth.\" Nora Callahan of the November Coalition says: \"'LIES' is a thorough indictment of ONDCP. Much of Robinson and Scherlen's analysis reads like prose, revealing the indignation of scientists exposing insidious lies, unaccountable policies and failed objectives -- all supported by federal tax dollars.\"\n\nFormer US Intelligence Analyst Brian Bennett claims: \"[I]n a word it is magnificent. While the book is quite thorough, it is also amazingly concise and easy to read ... an excellent job of completely deconstructing and debunking everything the ONDCP claims.\" Jack Cole, Executive Director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, claims: \"The authors systematically demonstrate empirically the many ways in which the ONDCP has lied over the past [7] years in its annual report of the war on drugs. The authors' analysis clarifies the despicable actions of the ONDCP and greatly contributes to the arguments of drug policy reformers everywhere.\"\n\nPaul Armentano of NORML says: \"This is an impressive compendium. I think it's especially effective when you rebuke the ONDCP's claim slide-per-slide. Also, I'm glad you brought up the fact that the agency has recently restructured their budget numbers to give the impression that there is nearly equal funding for treatment vs interdiction.\" And Joseph White of Change the Climate claims: \"... rather impressive -- very thorough ... I was especially interested in your use of \"ideology\" as a jumping off point for your critique. As a philosophy student, I appreciate your pointing to the substance behind ONDCP's madness—i.e., it is all political based on the dominant culture's morality.\"\n\nIn the area of criminological theory, Robinson created the \"integrated systems theory\" of antisocial behavior which blames much criminality on a wide variety of factors that tend to occur together in space and time. Professor Art Jipson says it \"illustrates both the psychological imagination and the gap where some classic criminology has failed. Professors Henry and Lanier refer to the theory as \"the most ambitious, comprehensive interdisciplinary attempt so far to move integration of criminological theory to new heights.\" Professor Walsh calls the book \"engaging, extremely well written,\" and notes that it makes \"major contributions to criminology.\"\n\nWalsh also says: \"Robinson's book is a tour de force for the criminologist who wants to learn something about the biosocial perspective.\" Professor Schmalleger calls the work \"among the best work being done in the area of theoretical integration today.\" Professor Barak says the theory is \"consistent with … general criminogenic 'facts of crime' that have been associated with criminal behaviour … built around known risk factors that have been identified by scholars in numerous disciplines such as anthropology, behavioural genetics, biology, economics, neurology, psychology, and sociology … in true interdisciplinary fashion, the integrated systems theory incorporates propositions derived from genetics, brain structure, brain function, brain dysfunction, personality traits, intelligence levels, mental illness, diet and nutrition, drug consumption, family influences, peer influences, social disorganization, routine activities and victim lifestyles, deterrence, labelling, anomie, strain, culture conflict and subcultures, race, class, and gender … incorporates a developmental or life-course perspective … consistent with a growing literature on developmental criminology … in harmony with the empirical evidence.\"\n\nThe second edition, co-authored with Kevin Beaver of Florida State University, is called by Professor DeLisi \"a tour-de-force through the criminological literature. Professors Robinson and Beaver have brilliantly explicated the interdisciplinary research on crime in a concise, fun-to-read text.\" And Professor Wright notes: \"What Robinson and Beaver have achieved is striking. Not only do they integrate a sound understanding of biology's role in criminal conduct into a broader biosocial paradigm, they do so in a way readers will find accessible if not inspiring. This book will certainly draw the ire of some, but for serious students of crime it will force a reconsideration of cherished beliefs. For this reason alone, Why Crime? makes a valuable contribution to the study of crime.\"\n\nRobinson also co-authored the theory called \"contextual anomie and strain theory\" which attributes corporate criminality to greed in the corporate subculture. Professor Friedrichs notes: \"In the midst of the present huge financial crisis, this book could hardly be more timely. The authors offer a novel theoretical framework for enriching our understanding of crimes of the rich and powerful. Matthew Robinson's previous books have been noteworthy additions to the criminological literature. In collaboration with colleague Daniel Murphy, he has once again made a thought-provoking contribution to the field, from which the current generation of students has much to learn.\"\n\nCriminologist Richard Rosenfeld noted that the theory \"is a faithful and 'innovative' application of arguments\" he developed with criminologist Steven Messner. Messner noted: \"This is great stuff\" that has \"elaborated anomie theory in an original and insightful manner.\"\n\nProfessor Robinson has also published about 100 other pieces of research and made more than 200 presentations to professional conferences in Criminology and Criminal Justice. The common theme of Dr. Robinson's work is critical examination of the status quo – whether the criminal justice system, the war on drugs and the death penalty are effective and just. Robinson critically analyzes widely accepted theories and practices and offers a new perspective that often conflicts with commonly held beliefs and assumptions.\n\nRobinson joined the Bill of Rights Defense Committee and founded a group in Boone to speak out against provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.

The text survives only in small fragments of papyrus from Egypt, but references in Greek literature of the Roman period, a Syrian moasic of c. 200 depicting the protagonists, and another from Zeugma, Commagene, shows the story's continued importance during the Roman period.\n\nDrawing on surviving sources, Hägg and Utan reconstruct the following plot. The story refers to historical figures, but is anachronistic and fundamentally fictional. Metiochus is the eldest son of Miltiades. However, his stepmother Hegesipyle plots against him in favour of her own children. So, along with his friend Theophanes, he flees his home (on the Thracian Chersonese), seeking the court of his distant relative Polycrates on Samos. There he meets Polycrates's daughter Parthenope at the temple of Hera. They fall instantly in love. Polycrates invites Metiochus to a symposium, and the discussions on love at this event are the main surviving part of the Greek text.\n\nFor centuries, it was known that ‘Unṣurī had composed a poem called \"Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā\", but it was thought lost. In the 1950s, however, the Pakistani scholar Mohammad Shafi identified fragments of the text in the binding of a theological manuscript produced in Herat in AH 526 (1132 AD), revealing 380 couplets (\"abyāt\") of the poem. Another 151 couplets are quoted in Persian lexical works, some or all of which may come from this poem.\n\n\"Vāmiq\" means 'the lover' and \"‘Adhrā\" means 'virgin' in Arabic (corresponding to the connotations of virginity in the name \"Parthenope\", from Greek \"parthenos\" 'young girl, virgin'), but many other names in ‘Unṣurī's text are transposed from the Greek, demonstrating derivation from \"Metiochus and Parthenope\", probably via an Arabic translation. In the tenth century, Ibn al-Nadīm records that Sahl b. Hārūn (d. 830 AD), secretary to Caliph al-Ma'mūn in Baghdad, composed a work of the same title. This must derive from the Greek text, whether by direct translation or through an intermediary — conceivably even an earlier Persian translation. Meanwhile al-Bīrūnī (d. c. 1051) claimed to have translated an Arabic work of this name into New Persian. Al-Bīrūnī's text might, then, have been the source for ‘Unṣurī's poem. \n\nBy the fifteenth century, \"Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā\" had become proverbial names of lovers in the Persian world, and a huge number of stories about the 'lover and the virgin' circulated in Islamicate literature.\n\n"}
{"id": "3684604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3684604", "title": "Murle people", "text": "Murle people\n\nThe Murle are a Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting the Pibor County and Boma area in Jonglei State, South Sudan, as well as parts of southwestern Ethiopia. They have also been referred as \"Beir\" by the Dinka and as \"Jebe\" by the Luo and Nuer, among others. The Murle speak the Murle language, which is part of the Surmic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family. The language cluster includes some adjoining groups in Sudan, as well as some non-contiguous Nilotic populations in southwestern Ethiopia.\n\nMurle in most cases practice a blend of animism and Christianity. Elders and witches often function as trouble fixers. But they are pastoralists in a country where localized and unpredictable shortages occur in rain, drinking water, bush fruits and cattle grass. This necessitates a partly nomadic lifestyle over large distances. As a result, in times of shortages they have frequently come into conflict with numerically larger groups, including the Dinka and Nuer. \n\nThe Murle (like the Dinka and Nuer) have a tradition in which men can only marry when they pay a bride wealth of several dozens of cows. Education and jobs are almost absent and there are very few possibilities to earn money by producing for domestic or foreign markets. As a result, the only way to acquire cows for marriage, quicker than through breeding them, is by stealing. With roads absent and normal policing almost impossible in a vast territory, Murle, Dinka and Nuer raid each other equally, unlike the more widespread notion by the Dinka and Nuer in the Government that only the Murle are the offenders.[no cite, and the contrary has been held true by at least one anthropologist who has studied the Murle]\n\nThe Murle have a historical traditional of migrating over the years in a clockwise direction around Lake Turkana (Arensen 1983). In the 1930s, they negotiated small pockets of 'homeland' in Pibor, where they are always allowed to graze their cattle and grow crops, even when in conflict with neighbors. This homeland is far too small for their survival, so they have a common interest in maintaining peace with Dinka and Nuer so that they can graze their cattle over wider areas. But the small size of their homeland and the near absence of police protection make them very vulnerable when conflicts do occur. When doubts arise that there will be peace and sufficient water and grazing rights, survival instincts align with 'bride hunger', sometimes driving the young men into risky cattle rustling adventures against their larger neighbors.\n\nIn the north-south war since, the Murle were mainly underrepresented and neglected by the SPLA. They sought protection by forming an armed group to protect themselves from the former rebel SPLA and the Northern Sudanese Militias.\n\nIn most South-Sudanese cattle cultures, the bride-wealth system, and illegal taxing by some unscrupulous local leaders stimulates young men to find excuses to steal cows from their own cousins. Local leaders then sometimes try to quell or prevent intra-tribal fighting, by directing that aggression outward, to other tribes. Also, Murle are feared and seen by surrounding larger tribes as having strong magical powers, and therefore they are often blamed for outbreak of diseases, theft and arson. \n\nWith the country still awash with machine guns from the north-south war, 'cattle rustling' quickly runs out of control, killing dozens or hundreds of people in tit for tat escalations. Many Nuer reason that Murle are the grand children of immigrants with much less rights to use land and graze cattle. So Murle cattle, argue some Nuer, were raised on stolen grass, so most of their cattle actually belong to the Nuer. Many Murle elders argue that often if the Dinka and Nuer are facing hunger or drought, they sell their children to the Murle in exchange for cattle, then later report to the authorities that their children have been kidnapped by the Murle.\n\nIn December 2011, about 6,000 Nuer Youths Army marched on the remote town of Pibor in Jonglei state, home to the rival Murle people, burning homes and looting facilities after overtaking a small South Sudan Army unit. The Lou-Nuer blame the Murle for cattle raiding and have vowed to wipe out the entire Murle Tribe on the face of the Earth. An estimated 3,000 people were killed, mainly children, women and the elderly. More than 1,000 people were killed in ethnic clashes within South Sudan in 2012, with Jonglei being one of the states worst affected by the violence. Thousands more civilians have been displaced from their homes.\n\nAlong South Sudan's border with Ethiopia, a rebellion is smouldering among the Murle, with civilians caught in the conflict. Civilians alleging torture by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and the villages of Laor and the Tanyang people burned alive in their huts because rebels were suspected of spending the night in the village.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, to retaliate and retrieve cattle stolen from previous conflict, several young Murle sacked and burned the air strip village of Pierri and a dozen surrounding hamlets, killing over a hundred people, abducting dozens or hundreds of children and stealing up to tens of thousands of cattle. One explanation might also be the drought: Pierri has one of the very few functioning dry season drinking water wells, often with thousands of people queuing for its water. Nuer have often excluded Murle from using this water.\n\nBecause of the Dinka and Nuer domination in the South Sudan government and as well as in the State level, most problems are blamed on Murle, therefore it is difficult for journalists and researchers to check any claims against the Murle.\n\nSome conflicts could be prevented by sinking more wells. Also, a national conference on drinking water, land use rights and land redistribution, might help, if Murle survival needs and all their arguments are taken seriously.\n\nState intervention in bride wealth culture (moving it away from virtual slave trade to an exchange of intentions and nominal tokens) and strong state action against illegal taxation by local leaders in Nuer, Dinka and Murle society is also needed.\n\nAlso, South-Sudan, with its enormous agricultural potential during the rainy season, needs to be connected to regional and world markets, so that through agriculture and cattle breeding, the economy can be based on something else than tit for tat theft.\n\n\n"}

Non-linear media is a move away from traditional linear media, in which content is selected by the publisher to be consumed and is then done so passively. There is no single specific form of non-linear media; rather, what might be considered non-linear changes as technology changes.\n\nThe model of traditional linear television programming is for a schedule of shows to be selected by the broadcaster and then viewed at a set time. In this model, the viewer cannot fast forward through the programming or choose to watch it at a later time. Conversely, non-linear television can be considered to be any method or technology that allows viewers to select what shows they watch and when they watch them. The ability to watch a show at any time is referred to as time shifted viewing; this can be achieved by either the consumer recording shows with a device such as a PVR for later viewing, or by the publisher providing content to be selected at will at the viewer's convenience.\n\nNon-linear content is often viewed on a device other than a television, such as a personal computer or a smartphone. Video on demand (VOD) content can be transmitted over the internet via streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Video, or it can be provided by a television provider as an additional option on top of their linear programming. Many producers of content now offer streaming of programs through their own websites, though sometimes the catalog that is offered will be curated in some way, such as by providing only recently released episodes. Video may also be downloaded – legally or illegally – through a peer-to-peer network such as BitTorrent, or it may be directly downloaded from a video hosting website.\n\nAs internet speeds and the number of alternate devices that are capable of viewing media on have increased, so has the number of people who consume non-linear media. The television network CBS expects that by the year 2020, 50 percent of all television content will be viewed in a non-linear fashion.\n\nLike other forms of non-linear media such as television, non-linear radio allows listeners to pick and listen to music and talk shows on a schedule that is set by the listener. Online music streaming services such as Spotify or Deezer are non-linear in that they allow listeners to create playlists from a library of music offered by a website; similarly, podcasts offer the ability to download or stream prerecorded shows similar to those that are traditionally broadcast over the radio waves; in fact, some traditional radio stations allow their shows to be downloaded on demand after the show has aired over the radio in a linear manner.\n\n"}

Tajuzbeki (or Tadj-Uzbeki) was an alternative name coined by Bholanath Tivari for the same language. Much of the academic research in documenting and characterizing this isolated Indo-Aryan language was done by prominent Soviet linguist I. M. Oranski.\n\nParya is a language that is very close to becoming extinct. It is classified under Indo-European, Indo-Iranian, Indo-Aryan, and the Central Zone but is unclassified within the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-Iranian. The language may also be referred to as Afgana-Yi Nasfurush, Afghana-Yi Siyarui, Changgars, Laghmani, or Pbharya, but there are no other similar languages with the same ISO number, which is the code used to identify languages around the world. The main dialect of Parya is Marwari. Marwari is related to Punjabi which is related to the Afghanistan dialect. The largest Parya villages in Tajikistan are the villages of Afghonobod, Qalai Hisor, Pravda Vostok, Boloi Kanal, and Kolkhozi Leninism.\n\nIn order for a language to not be recognized as at threat of extinction, it needs at least 100,000 speakers. Unfortunately, Parya is not anywhere close to this. Depending on what source one refers to, there are anywhere from about 3,000 to 7,500 speakers left. The language is not even officially recognized or used in schools. With numbers so low, the language is categorized as severely endangered. This means it is mainly spoken by older generations, it is understood younger generations, but the youngest generations don't really use it at all.\n\nMany of those who speak the Parya language Sunni Muslims, and many of them are farmers, and more specifically, primarily rice farmers. Many of the people live in Tajikistan, but some also live in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. Since the language is so endangered and not many people know it, those who do speak it tend to be bilingual in the dominant languages surrounding them, however, when Uzbek and Tajik men marry Parya women, they tend to learn the language and assimilate. Although many are bilingual, the Tajik language has increasingly influenced the Parya language. The language is mostly spoken with ones family and relations, and it is almost always spoken in the homes of native speakers.\n\nParya is largely spoken in the border regions between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, specifically in the towns of Hisor, Shahrinav, Regar/Tursunzoda and Surchi, located in the Hissor Valley of Tajikistan and the Surkhondaryo basin of Uzbekistan. It is based on the Brij Bhasha, Haryanvi and Rajasthani dialects, and is highly influenced by Uzbek, Tajik and Russian languages.\n\nThere are about 2,500 speakers worldwide. Parya speakers are usually bilingual in Tajik, but tend to exclusively use Parya at home.\n\nParya employs some vigesimal numeral counting patterns, though the base words used are Hindi.\n\n"}
{"id": "26044386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26044386", "title": "Pauline Laws", "text": "Pauline Laws\n\nThe Pauline Laws are the house laws of the House of Romanov of the Russian Empire. The name comes from the fact that they were initially established by Emperor Paul I of Russia in 1797.\n\nPaul I abolished Peter the Great's law which allowed each reigning emperor or empress to designate his or her successor, substituting a strict order of succession by proclaiming that the eldest son of the monarch shall inherit the throne, and other dynasts according to primogeniture in the male-line. In so doing, Paul implemented a semi-Salic line of succession to the Russian Throne: the throne could henceforth pass to a female and through the female (cognatic) line of the dynasty, upon the extinction of all legitimately-born, male dynasts.\n\nOver time the house laws were amended, and in the late Russian Empire the laws governing membership in the imperial house, succession to the throne and other dynastic subjects were divided, some being included in the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire and others in the Statute of the Imperial Family (codification of 1906, as amended through 1911). \n\nIn the spring of 1911, Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia became engaged to Prince Konstantin Alexandrovich Bagration-Mukhransky (1889 - 1915), a Georgian by birth, serving in a Russian Imperial Guards regiment, who would die in World War I. She was to be the first daughter of the Romanovs to openly marry a Russian subject or non-dynastic prince since the Romanov dynasty ascended the throne in 1613. Her anxious father approached the Emperor Nicholas II and his empress, Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, for approval. On 30 November 1910 Grand Duke Constantine Konstantinovich noted in one of his posthumously published journals (\"From the Diaries of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich\", Moscow, February 1994), that he had received assurances that \"they would never look upon her marriage to a Bagration as morganatic, because this House, like the House of Orléans, is descended from a once ruling dynasty.\"\n\nPreviously, the morganatic wives of Romanov grand dukes had been banished from Russia along with their disgraced husbands (e.g., Sophia von Merenberg, Countess de Torby and Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich; and Princess Olga Paley and Grand Duke Paul Aleksandrovich). Female Romanovs had only dared marry morganatically in secret, and the couples’ relationships remained open secrets (e.g., Empress Elizabeth of Russia and Alexey Razumovsky; and the second marriage of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna and Count Grigory Stroganov).\n\nNonetheless, legally, Tatiana Konstantinovna's marriage was morganatic. It was, in fact, the first marriage in the dynasty conducted in compliance with the Emperor’s formal decision \"not\" to accept as dynastic the marriages of even the most junior Romanovs—those that bore only the title of prince/princess—with non-royal partners. According to \"Always A Grand Duke\", the 1933 memoir of Nicholas II’s brother-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich (published in New York, by Farrar and Rinehart, Inc.), concern about the eventual marriages of cadet Romanovs so troubled the senior grand dukes that Alexander approached the Emperor about relaxing the requirement that all dynasts marry partners \"possessing corresponding rank\" enshrined in article 188 of the Pauline Laws, but was rebuffed. The grand dukes then officially petitioned the Emperor through a commission chaired by Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich of Russia, requesting that a new category of dynastic marriages be recognized, to consist of Imperial princes and princesses entitled, with specific Imperial consent, to marry persons of non-royal blood yet retaining the right to transmit to the issue thereof eligibility to inherit the throne. The Emperor’s response was issued formally on 14 June 1911 in the form of a memorandum from the Minister of the Imperial Court, Baron Vladimir Frederiks:\n\n\"The Lord Emperor has seen fit to permit marriages to persons not possessing corresponding rank of not all Members of the Imperial Family, but only of Princes and Princesses of the Blood Imperial...Princes as well as Princesses of the Blood Imperial, upon contracting a marriage with a person not possessing corresponding rank, shall personally retain the title and privileges which are theirs by birth, with the exception of their right to succession from which they shall have abdicated before entering the marriage. In relation to the categorization of the marriages of Princes and Princesses of the Blood Imperial, the Lord Emperor has seen fit to recognize only two categories in these marriages: (a) equal marriages, i.e. those contracted with persons belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, and (b) unequal marriages, i.e. those contracted with persons not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, and will not recognize any other categories.\" \n\nAs promised in this communiqué (the so-called \"Frederiks Memorandum\"), the Emperor proceeded to legalize \"authorized\" marriages of imperial Romanovs below grand ducal rank to persons who lacked \"corresponding rank\". Such marriages had been altogether banned, rather than deemed morganatic, by Alexander III’s \"ukase\" #5868 on 23 March 1889. But \"ukase\" #35731/1489, issued on 11 August 1911, amended the 1889 ban with the words, \"Henceforth no grand duke or grand duchess may contract a marriage with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling house.\"\n\nBoth the 1889 and 1911 decrees were addenda to article 188 of the Pauline laws (re-codified as article 63 of the Imperial Family Statute). Left intact, however, was that original statute: \"A person of the Imperial family who has entered into a marriage alliance with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, cannot pass on to that person, or to any posterity that may issue from such a marriage, the rights which belong to the Members of the Imperial family.\"\n\nAlso remaining unrepealed was article 36 (\"Children born of a marriage between a member of the Imperial Family and a person not of corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, shall have no right of succession to the Throne\"). Aside from article 188, article 36 applied to prevent Tatiana Konstantinovna's issue from claiming succession rights.\n\nHer contemplated marriage having been rendered legal, Tatiana Konstantinovna renounced her dynastic rights, as required. Nicholas II acknowledged this in a \"ukase\" addressed to the Imperial Senate on 9 February 1914: \"Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna has presented to Us over Her own sign manual, a renunciation of the right to succession to the Imperial Throne of All the Russias belonging to Her as a member of the Imperial House,\" receiving in return Nicholas II’s authorization to marry Bagration-Mukhransky (This was the same family into which Princess Leonida Bagration of Mukhrani, wife of Vladimir Cyrillovich, was born).\n\nTatiana Konstantinovna and her Georgian prince were married at her father's estate at Pavlovsk, on 3 September 1911. The Emperor was present at the wedding. On the same day the Emperor issued yet another \"ukase\", (#35766): \"By Our and Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich’s and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna’s consent, the wedding took place on 24th day of this August \"[old style]\" of the Daughter of Their Imperial Highnesses, Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna, with Prince Konstantin Bagration-Mukhransky. In consequence of this order: The Princess Tatiana Konstantiovna to retain the title of Highness and henceforth to bear the name of Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna Princess Bagration-Mukhransky...\"\n"}

One protocol is to use a random phone number, such as 555-111-2222, then replace the last n digits of the phone number with the secret such as 555-111-JOHN. Then the first person calls the number and leaves a message with the person on the other end for the second person.

The majority of the population remains below the poverty line, a situation which provides fertile soil for the development of prostitution. In Mozambique, as in many poor countries, the government is responsible for monitoring sex workers, and data on the number of prostitutes in Mozambique is not available. UNAIDS estimate there to be 13,554 prostitutes in the country.\n\nAt the time of independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the poorest countries in the world. The position of residents worsened during the civil war years 1977-1992. The arrival of peacekeepers operating under the auspices of the UN resulted in an increase in the prostitution industry. In 1992, prostitution in Mozambique had reached such proportions that the post of mediator was created between the military on the one hand and pimps and prostitutes on the other. The problem of prostitution in Mozambique came under international discussion for the first time in the mid 1990s, when the deputy head of the UN mission Behrouz Sadri accused UN peacekeepers of buying sex from underage prostitutes.\n\nResearch into child prostitution carried out in Maputo and published in 2001 indicated that 98% of child prostitutes were girls, 26% were aged 10-14 years, and 14.1% attended school. Of those not attending school, 69% had dropped out of school due to lack of funds, 12% had reached the second year of primary school, and 7.4% had attended high school.\n\nHuman trafficking in Mozambique is a significant problem. Mozambique is a source country for people trafficked for forced prostitution. Research in 2003 indicated that Mozambican girls and young women between the ages of 14 and 24 were typically being recruited. The main destination was South Africa, where they were put into sexual slavery and compelled to work in prostitution. It was estimated that around 1,000 women were being recruited, transported and exploited in this way each year. To a much lesser extent Mozambique is also itself a destination for human trafficking. Women and girls from Zimbabwe and Malawi who voluntarily migrate to Mozambique are manipulated by traffickers into forced prostitution.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Mozambique as a 'Tier 2' country.\n"}

R. Joseph evinced interest in pursuing Priesthood as a full time vocation and underwent Spiritual formation at the historic Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramayapatnam studying under the Principalship of The Rev. Maurice Blanchard and other faculty comprising The Rev. G. Solomon. The seminary was directly affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University) and Joseph was awarded the graduate degree of B.D. in 1967 from the Seminary President, Louis F. Knoll after which he was assigned a teaching role in that Seminary.\n\nIn 1972, The Council of the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramayapatnam and the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches sent R. Joseph to the Andover Newton Theological School, Newton for postgraduate studies where he earned a Master of Sacred Theology \"(S.T.M.)\" degree and on his return continued to teach at the Seminary which by then had integrated its B. D. section into the Andhra Christian Theological College and R. Joseph was reassigned to teach there by the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches.\n\nIn 1978, the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches had accorded study leave to R. Joseph who went to the United Theological College, Bangalore to upgrade his S. T. M. obtained from the United States to Master of Theology \"(M. Th.)\" degree and researched on the writings of Puroshottam Choudhary under the supervision of Joshua Russell Chandran and Eric J. Lott, his Professors. Joseph's companions at the college included G. Devakadasham, G. D. V. Prasad and others.\n\nBy 1980, R. Joseph rejoined Andhra Christian Theological College and resumed his teaching responsibilities. Again in 1983, he returned to the United Theological College, Bangalore to undertake doctoral studies but had to leave it midway as he was called to teach at his \"alma mater\" the Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramayapatnam from where he again joined the Andhra Christian Theological College.\n\nIn 1985, R. Joseph enrolled at the State-run Osmania University from where he studied Master of Arts.\n\nSoon after R. Joseph completed his graduate studies in 1967 at the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary, Ramayapatnam, he was assigned a teaching assignment. By this time, efforts among the Protestants to form a unified seminary gained credence leading to the formation of the Andhra Christian Theological College in 1964 Rajahmundry by,\n\n\nHowever, compared to the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary which was entitled to admit students for the Bachelor of Divinity degree courses - that too with English as the medium of instruction, the new unified Protestant seminary offered only Licentiate in Theology level courses in Telugu medium. The Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches was way ahead of its times both in terms of the academic credentials of its faculty as well as its affiliation to the Senate of Serampore College (University). Though the Baptists of the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches were in favour of joining the new unified Protestant initiative in Rajahmundry, the integration did not seem ripe at that stage. R. Joseph had just finished his graduate studies at Ramayapatnam in 1967 and just at that time his Principal, The Rev. Maurice Blanchard and his successor The Rev. Louis F. Knoll decided to experiment and moved their B.D. section from Ramayapatnam to Rajahmundry and functioned as a separate entity within the premises of the Andhra Christian Theological College in Rajahmundry. R. Joseph's teaching companions, K. Wilson, K. S. Prasada Rao, Tracy G. Gipson, Alice M. Findlay, B. R. Moses and Louis F. Knoll moved to Rajahmundry while G. Solomon, S. Joseph, P. Joseph and D. Daniel joined later.\n\nIn his second phase at Ramayapatnam, R. Joseph rejoined the seminary in 1984 taking up the Presidentship of the Seminary which was training Catechetists to take up rural evangelism and R. Joseph took responsibility to build up the seminary and stayed in Ramayapatnam until 1994 when he finally moved again to Hyderabad.\n\nBy 1972, the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches fully integrated its B.D. section into the Andhra Christian Theological College which by then was relocated to Hyderabad. R. Joseph was sent on study leave to the United States to upgrade his studies to enable him to take up teaching at the unified Protestant Theologiate in Hyderabad and returned in 1973 to take up teaching of Theology. On his return, R. Joseph joined the Andhra Christian Theological College which was by then led by the Old Testament Scholar Victor Premasagar while his other companions from Ramayapatnam continued to teach there who included S. Joseph, G. Solomon, K. S. Prasada Rao, and Tracy G. Gipson.\n\nWhile this was so, K. Wilson had by that time left the Office of the Priesthood moving to the State-run Osmania University to take up teaching of the Philosophy as a civilian. After teaching for nearly six years at the Andhra Christian Theological College, R. Joseph had to revisit his academics to tune up his postgraduate degree earned in the United States to suit the requirements of the Senate of Serampore College (University) and left for Bangalore in 1978, rejoining the College in 1980 and taught for nearly three more years till 1983 when he went on study leave to his alma mater at Bangalore.\n\nAfter a gap of nearly a decade, R. Joseph rejoined the Andhra Christian Theological College in 1994 which by then was led by Rev. R. Yesurathnam, the Principal and R. Joseph continued to teach Theology for the aspirants until he retired on attaining superannuation in 2003.\n\nR.

It may also be an administrative warning issued by an employer or school.\n\nFrom 1998 until 2013 in the UK, young people aged 10–17 years old could receive a reprimand (provided they had not previously been given a reprimand, a final warning or been found guilty at court). A reprimand was a formal verbal warning given by a police officer to a young person who admitted they are guilty of a 'minor' first offence.\n\nThe police passed on the details to the local Youth Offending Team of those young people given a reprimand. \nSometimes the young person would be referred to the YOT to take part in a voluntary programme to help them address their offending behaviour.\n\nReprimands and final warnings were criminal records (but not convictions) governed by provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.\n\nReprimands and Final Warnings were a statutory disposal, created by sections 65–66 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to replace cautions for offenders aged 17 and under.

{"id": "17359575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17359575", "title": "Rural credit cooperative", "text": "Rural credit cooperative\n\nA rural credit cooperative (RCC) () or () is a cooperative or credit union sanctioned by People's Bank of China to provide credit in the rural areas of the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn The 1950s, a network of rural credit cooperatives was created. At this time, they were not commercial enterprises similar to banks, but rather channeled credit between the state and the people's communes in rural areas.\n\nIn the late 1970s, after economic reforms enabled some individual entrepreneurialism and the creation of collective enterprises, the RCCs began to function as grassroots banks that provided credit and savings accounts to families and collective enterprises. In the reform era, the RCCs were intended to serve as a means for the Agricultural Bank of China to funnel credit into rural areas. However, the RCCs were insufficient to meet the high demand for credit in these areas.\n\nIndividual and enterprises often turn to other sources of credit, which range from rotating savings and credit associations to pawn shops. However, these other forms are all illegal (although some are tolerated to a greater degree than others, and are tolerated in some locations more than in others). Commercial banks are legal, but since fewer than one percent of loans from state banks go to private entrepreneurs, they do not meet the credit needs of rural areas.\n\nUntil 1996, the RCCs were supervised by the Agricultural Bank of China. In 1996, they were transferred to the People's Bank of China.\n\nIn July 1998, the rural credit foundations (RCF) () were banned when the State Council of the People's Republic of China () issued the \"Provisions on the Cancellation of Illegal Financial Institutions and Activities\". This left the RCCs as the only legal financial institution (other than banks) that served rural enterprises and individuals. As of 1998, when the RCFs were banned, there were approximately 44,000 township-level RCCs and 280,000 village-level RCC branches.\n\nSince 1998, many of the RCCs have gradually been transformed into rural commercial banks (RCBs). The first foreign investment in an RCB was allowed in 2006, when Rabobank and the International Finance Corporation (the private sector arm of the World Bank) acquired stakes in the United Rural Cooperative Bank of Hangzhou.\n\nDue to a high volume of non-performing loans, many of the RCCs are technically insolvent. Since 1998, central banking authorities have injected approximately US$4 billion into recapitalization the RCCs, and have considered other measures for improving the performance of the RCCs.\n\nAlthough the RCCs are gradually being transformed into independent commercial banks (RCBs), they are still not immune from government requests to make policy loans (loans issued for political reasons, such as the desire to support certain politically important industries or firms, rather than because the firm is an attractive candidate for a loan).\n\n"}
{"id": "505175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505175", "title": "Songhay languages", "text": "Songhay languages\n\nThe Songhay or Songhai languages ( or ) are a group of closely related languages/dialects centred on the middle stretches of the Niger River in the West African countries of Mali, Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. In particular, they are spoken in the cities of Timbuktu and Gao. They have been widely used as a \"lingua franca\" in that region ever since the era of the Songhai Empire. In Mali, the government has officially adopted the dialect of Gao (east of Timbuktu) as the dialect to be used as a medium of primary education.\n\nSome Songhay languages have little to no mutual intelligibility between each other. For example, Koyraboro Senni, spoken in Gao, is unintelligible to speakers of Zarma in Niger, according to \"Ethnologue\". However, Songhay, Zarma and Dendi have high mutual intelligibility within Niger.\n\nFor linguists, a major point of interest in the Songhay languages has been the difficulty of determining their genetic affiliation; they are commonly taken to be Nilo-Saharan, as defined by Greenberg in 1963, but this classification remains controversial. Linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal (2008) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family.\n\nHistorically, the name \"Songhay\" was neither an ethnic nor a linguistic designation, but a name for the ruling caste of the Songhai Empire. Under the influence of French language usage, speakers in Mali have increasingly been adopting it as an ethnic self-designation; however, other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves with other ethnic terms, such as Zarma (Djerma) or Isawaghen.\n\nA few precolonial poems and letters composed in Songhay and written in the Arabic script exist in Timbuktu. However, Songhay is currently written in the Latin script.\n\nResearchers classify the Songhay languages into two main branches; Southern and Northern. Southern Songhay is centered on the Niger River. Zarma (Djerma), the most widely spoken Songhay language with two or three million speakers, is a major language of southwestern Niger (downriver from and south of Mali) including in the capital city, Niamey. Koyraboro Senni, with 400,000 speakers, is the language of the town of Gao, the seat of the old Songhai Empire. Koyra Chiini is spoken to its west. The much smaller Northern Songhay is a group of heavily Berber-influenced dialects spoken in the Sahara. Since the Berber influence extends beyond the lexicon into the inflectional morphology, the Northern Songhay languages are sometimes viewed as mixed languages.\n\nDiedrich Hermann Westermann, a missionary and linguist, hesitated between assigning it to Gur or considering it an isolate, and Maurice Delafosse grouped it with Mande. At present, Songhay is normally considered to be Nilo-Saharan, following Joseph Greenberg's 1963 reclassification of African languages; Greenberg's argument is based on about 70 claimed cognates, including pronouns. This proposal has been developed further by, in particular, Lionel Bender, who sees it as an independent subfamily of Nilo-Saharan. Roger Blench notes that Songhay shares the defining singulative–plurative morphology typical of Nilo-Saharan languages, though it is difficult to show that any of the branches of Nilo-Saharan are actually related. As of 2011, he believes that Songhay is closest to the neighboring Saharan languages, and not divergent.\n\nHowever, a Nilo-Saharan classification is controversial. Greenberg's argument was subjected to serious criticism by Lacroix, who deemed only about 30 of Greenberg's claimed cognates acceptable, and moreover argued that these held mainly between Zarma and the Saharan languages, thus leading one to suspect them of being loanwords. Certain Songhay–Mande similarities have long been observed (at least since Westermann), and Mukarovsky (1966), Denis Creissels (1981) and Nicolaï (1977, 1984) investigated the possibility of a Mande relationship; Creissels made some 50 comparisons, including many body parts and morphological suffixes (such as the causative in \"-endi\"), while Nicolaï claimed some 450 similar words as well as some conspicuous typological traits. However, Nicolaï eventually concluded that this approach was not adequate, and in 1990 proposed a distinctly novel hypothesis: that Songhay is a Berber-based creole language, restructured under Mande influence. In support of this he proposed 412 similarities, ranging all the way from basic vocabulary (\"tasa\" \"liver\") to obvious borrowings (\"anzad\" \"violin\", \"alkaadi\" \"qadi\".) Others, such as Gerrit Dimmendaal, were not convinced, and Nicolaï (2003) appears to consider the question of Songhay's origins still open, while arguing against Bender's proposed etymologies.\n\nGreenberg's morphological similarities with Nilo-Saharan include the personal pronouns \"ai\" (cf. Zaghawa \"ai\"), 'I', \"ni\" (cf. Kanuri \"nyi\"), 'you (sg.)', \"yer\" (e.g. Kanuri \"-ye\"), 'we', \"wor\" (cf. Kanuri \"-wi\"), 'you (pl.)'; relative and adjective formants \"-ma\" (e.g. Kanuri \"-ma\") and \"-ko\" (cf. Maba \"-ko\"), a plural suffix \"-an\" (?), a hypothetical plural suffix \"-r\" (cf. Teso \"-r\") which he takes to appear in the pronouns \"yer\" and \"wor\", intransitive/passive \"-a\" (cf. Teso \"-o\").\n\nThe most striking of the Mande similarities listed by Creissels are the third person pronouns \"a\" sg. (pan-Mande \"a\"), \"i\" pl. (pan-Mande \"i\" or \"e\"), the demonstratives \"wo\" \"this\" (cf. Manding \"o\", \"wo\") and \"no\" \"there\" (cf. Soninke \"no\", other Mande \"na\"), the negative \"na\" (found in a couple of Manding dialects) and negative perfect \"mana\" (cf. Manding \"má\", \"máŋ\"), the subjunctive \"ma\" (cf. Manding \"máa\"), the copula \"ti\" (cf. Bisa \"ti\", Manding \"de/le\"), the verbal connective \"ka\" (cf. Manding \"kà\"), the suffixes \"-ri\" (resultative - cf. Mandinka \"-ri\", Bambara \"-li\" process nouns), \"-ncè\" (ethnonymic, cf. Soninke \"-nke\", Mandinka \"-nka\"), \"-anta\" (ordinal, cf. Soninke \"-ndi\", Mandinka \"-njaŋ\"...), \"-anta\" (resultative participle, cf. Soninke \"-nte\"), \"-endi\" (causative, cf. Soninke, Mandinka \"-ndi\"), and the postposition \"ra\" \"in\" (cf. Manding \"lá\", Soso \"ra\"...)\n\nSonghay is mostly a tonal, SOV group of languages, an exception being the divergent Koyra Chiini of Timbuktu, which is non-tonal and uses SVO order.\n\nSonghay has a morpheme \"-ndi\" which marks either the causative or the agentless passive. Verbs can even take two instances of the morpheme, one for each meaning. Thus \"ŋa-ndi-ndi\" figuratively translates to \"[the rice] was made to be eaten [by someone: causee] [by someone: causer]\".\n\n\nPublisher and publication abbreviations:\n\n"}
{"id": "6632507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6632507", "title": "Superstar", "text": "Superstar\n\nSuperstar is someone who has great popular appeal and is widely known, prominent, or successful in some field. Celebrities referred to as \"superstars\" may include individuals who work as actors, musicians, athletes, and other media-based professions.\n\nThe origin of the term in the context of celebrity is uncertain, but a similar expression is attested in \"The Cricketers of My Time\", a famous cricket book by John Nyren about the Hambledon Club. Writing in 1832, Nyren described the outstanding 18th-century batsman John Small as \"a star of the first magnitude\".\n\nThe earliest use of the term \"superstar\" has been credited to Frank Patrick in reference to the great hockey players on his Vancouver Millionaires teams of the 1910s-1920s, specifically Cyclone Taylor.\n\nWithin a major published piece in Interview Magazine that appeared in June 1977, when asked by editor Glenn O’Brien, “Who invented the word superstar?” Andy Warhol, the pop artist known for popularizing the term, responded, “I think it was [the performance artist and filmmaker] Jack Smith.” O’Brien then asked, “And who were the first superstars?” To which Warhol responded, “They were all Jack Smith’s stars; every one of them was really a great person.”\n\nThe term received widespread and commonplace use from the title of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar, in particular the 1970 concept album of the musical and the eponymous hit song.\n\n\"Super Star\" is the name of a hugely successful rose which Harry Wheatcroft introduced and named in 1960, licensed from a German developer..\n\nBy 1909, the silent film companies began promoting \"picture personalities\" by releasing stories about these actors to fan magazines and newspapers, as part of a strategy to build \"brand loyalty\" for their company's actors and films. By the 1920s, Hollywood film company promoters had developed a \"massive industrial enterprise\" that \"... peddled a new intangible—fame.\"\n\nHollywood \"image makers\" and promotional agents planted rumours, selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press, and used other \"gimmicks\" to create personas for actors. Then they \"...worked [to] reinforce that persona [and] manage the publicity.\" Publicists thus \"created\" the \"enduring images\" and public perceptions of screen legends such as Rock Hudson, Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. The development of this \"star system\" made \"fame... something that could be fabricated purposely, by the masters of the new 'machinery of glory.'\"\n\nAccording to Sofia Johansson the \"canonical texts on stardom\" include articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972) and Dyer (1979) that examined the \"representations of stars and on aspects of the Hollywood star system.\" Johansson notes that \"more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, 'celebrity culture'.\" In the analysis of the 'celebrity culture,' \"fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process, connected to widespread economic, political, technological and cultural developments.\"\n\nIn 1976 Mattel, Inc. produced a Superstar concept of its Barbie™ Doll.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, entertainment publicity tactics have become \"more subtle and sophisticated\", such as using press releases, movie \"junkets, and community activities. These promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research, \"to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures.\" In some cases, publicity agents may create \"provocative advertisements\" or make an outrageous public statement to \"trigger public controversy and thereby generate \"free\" news coverage.\"\n\nAccording to Roger Caillois, superstars are created by the interplay between \"mass media, free enterprise, and competition.\" Superstars are produced by a mixture of effort by the actors or athletes and chance (the luck of winning, due to the many arbitrary factors influencing sports, film releases, etc.). The \"superstar has extraordinary natural talent augmented by an even more extraordinary perseverance and drive.\"\n\nHowever, \"small and relative differences are of decisive importance for winning or losing by a hair's breadth.\" It is here that chance plays a role; a sudden gust of wind at the end of a yachting race can mean the difference between stardom and defeat. Caillois notes that the role of chance in superstardom is paradoxical, given that the west is such a \"predominantly meritocratic society,\" which valorizes the role of work, competition, activity, and determination.\n\n\"[Since] only one may be first. [a person may] choose to win indirectly, through identification with someone else\"- the superstar, whose triumph as the most popular actor or hit recording artist is in part due to the actions of \"... those who worship the hero\". The public believes that \"the manicurist elected Beauty Queen, by the sales girl entrusted with the heroine's role in a super production, by the shopkeeper's daughter winning the Tour de France, [and] by the gas station attendant who basks in the limelight as a champion toreador\" represents the chance or possibility, from the public's perspective, that they may become wealthy and successful. For example, Levine points out that \"Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica, was a service station attendant before becoming a rich rock star; Harrison Ford was a cabinet maker\" before becoming a wealthy film star.\n\nCaillois calls superstars' huge incomes and rewards \"disguised lotteries\", a \"special kind of game of chance.\" For example, the grand prizes for literary competitions \"bring fortune and glory to a writer, for several years.\" Caillois notes that a \"superstar\" cannot merely be successful at some activity; they must also be richly rewarded. He says that the \"material reward of the superstar is a necessary ingredient (for the glory of the star) for the identification of the public with the star, or whether it is the excellence or the private life of the star which is of more importance.\" He states that superstars' extravagant incomes play an important psychological \"compensating mechanism\" role for the public.\n\nAccording to Madow, \"fame is a \"relational\" phenomenon, something that is conferred by others. A person can, within the limits of his natural talents, make himself strong or swift or learned. But he cannot, in this same sense, make himself famous, any more than he can make himself loved.\" Madow goes on to point out that \"fame is often conferred or withheld, just as love is, for reasons and on grounds other than \"merit.\" This means that regardless of how \"... strenuously the star may ... try to \"monitor\" and \"shape\" it, the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process.\"\n\nSherwin Rosen (1981) examined the economics of superstars to determine why \"relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.\" Rosen argues that in superstar markets, \"small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue.\" Rosen points out that \"...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices\"\n\nModern microconomist Alfred Marshall explains that technology has greatly extended the power and reach of the planet's most gifted performers. He referenced a classical of the British opera singer Elizabeth Billington. She was a well-acclaimed soprano with a strong voice, that, naturally did not have access to a microphone or amplifier in 1798, let alone to MTV, CDs, iTunes, and Pandora. She could only reach a small audience. This limited her ability to dominate the market in the way that artists to do today. Marshall wrote, “so long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the £10,000 said to have been earned in a season by Mrs. Billington at the beginning of the last century, nearly as great [an increase] as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last.” Furthermore, the trends in popular music indicate that \"the price of the average concert ticket increased by nearly 400% from 1981 to 2012, much faster than the 150% rise in overall consumer price inflation.\n\nSome scholars argue that superstardom has a useful role in society. Caillois cites Rawls, who states that the \"premiums earned by scarce natural talents . . . [serve] to cover the costs of training and to encourage the efforts of learning, as well as to direct ability to where it best furthers the common interest.\" Cowen (2000) cites Rosen (1981) to argue that \"the superstars effect is welfare-improving (consumers get better performances) even if it leads to raising income inequality,\" and adds that the \"superstar phenomenon should not be overstressed. Indeed, fame is a positive-sum game, not a negative nor a zero-sum one.\" Cowen states that \"countervailing forces operate, such as a convergence of quality that limits the ability of the very best stars to dominate the market for long, or more radically the elastic supply of fame.\" This means that \"when demand for fame increases, the numbers of prizes, rewards and whatever fame generating distinctions is rising too.\"\n\nOn the other hand, it has been argued \"compensation systems that resemble prizes [lotteries] can also create perverse incentives by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors\". As well, Frank and Cook (1995) have called \"into question the way the winner-take-all markets operate, with their damaging features.\" They argue that the \"winner-take-all payoff structure [of competition for superstardom] generates a spiral of individual and social occupational waste, since it leads both to increasing (monetary and non-monetary) reward inequalities and to overcrowdings in the markets and occupations prone to an overestimation of one's chance to succeed.\" Thus as a result, they argue that \"when excess numbers of contestants are induced to invest in performance enhancement in order to raise their individual odds of winning, these investments will be mutually offsetting and socially inefficient; end consumers may get more valuable products but the social costs are excessive.\"\n\nA small number of major art museums, including Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, among others, have become household names and major tourist destinations. Art museums such as these, with their striking, architecturally designed buildings and very well known masterpieces can be termed \"superstar\" art museums. With their huge visitor traffic, superstar museums are often able to derive a significant income from museum bookshops and restaurants and have a \"major impact on the local economy\".\n\nSuperstar museums are able to use the popular appeal of their location and art holdings to produce their own books, videos, and television specials, which adds an additional revenue stream and further reinforces the public's awareness of the museum. Some superstar museums have also begun establishing museum networks. For example, London's Tate Gallery has launched satellite art museums at Liverpool and St. Ives.\n\nCultural institutions such as art museums play a \"gatekeeping role\" for consumers, helping to screen and grade the cultural artifacts and artworks, thus \"reduc[ing] information and search costs\" for consumers. Moreover, \"by channelling resources to a limited group of visual artists, cultural institutions also enhance superstar phenomena within the visual arts.\"\n\nMcGraw-Hill's economic website argues that the multimillion-dollar salaries of superstar Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the corporate world can be viewed as a type of tournament prize. The huge salaries of superstar executives \"often seem to resemble prizes for the winners of contests rather than compensation in return for the value of the marginal product of labour.\" As an example, \"a company may have many vice-presidents of roughly comparable ability and the v-p (who may only be slightly more talented than the others) that is promoted to president receives a huge salary increase, which resembles a prize for winning the contest as best v-p.\"\n\nThe article goes on to argue that \"...such a compensation system may be efficient if the organization is only able to rank its executives according to the relative value of their contribution to the organization (the organization cannot measure the productivity of each executive, only the productivity of the group of executives).\" Moreover, \"even if executives are paid a wage equal to the average productivity of the group, there will still be an incentive to perform in order be promoted and win the prize.\" However, \"compensation systems that resemble prizes can also create perverse incentives by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors\"\n\n\n"}

It received its first public reading in an early version at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 1995. It tells the tale of Katurian, a fiction writer living in a police state, who is interrogated about the gruesome content of his short stories and their similarities to a number of bizarre child murders occurring in his town. The play received the 2004 Olivier Award for Best New Play, the 2004-5 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best New Foreign Play, and two Tony Awards for production. It was nominated for the 2004 Evening Standard Award for Best New Play.\n\nKaturian, a writer of short stories that often depict violence against children, has been arrested by two detectives, Ariel and Tupolski, because some of his stories resemble recent child murders. When he hears that his brother Michal has confessed to the murders and implicated Katurian, he resigns himself to being executed but attempts to save his stories from destruction.

Cold and uncaring, he sees himself as detached from the people he aims to save, shocking his younger partner Ariel.\n\nAriel: A brutal and violent detective who has a vendetta against anyone who commits crimes against children because of abuse in his own past. He ends up being more sympathetic toward Katurian and his stories than Tupolski is.\n\nMinor characters include the parents/foster parents, The Little Jesus (girl), and a boy.\n\nScene 1: Ariel and Tupolski interrogate Katurian in a police room. At first Katurian does not know why he is being questioned, and thinks he is under suspicion of running political messages against the totalitarian dictatorship through his stories. The detectives and Katurian discuss grisly stories involving children. Ariel leaves the room, and soon after Michal is heard screaming in the next room. Ariel returns, his hand covered in blood from apparently torturing Michal, and tells Katurian that Michal has just confessed to killing three children, in association with Katurian. The first two children were murdered according to the patterns of the stories \"The Little Apple Men\" and \"The Tale of the Town on the River.\" Katurian denies the allegations, stating that although his stories are gruesome it is the job of a storyteller to tell a story.\n\nScene 2: Katurian was raised by loving parents who encouraged him to write, and for many years he wrote very happy stories. However, at night he began to hear sounds of torture from the next room, and as a result he began to write more disturbing stories. One night, a note is slipped under the door, claiming that Katurian's brother has been tortured nightly for seven years as part of an artistic experiment to get Katurian to become a great writer. Katurian breaks down the door, only to find his parents, who were playing a trick on him, pretending to be torturing a child. However, when Katurian returns years later, he discovers his brother's dead body hidden under the mattress, clutching the manuscript of a beautiful story, better than any of Katurian's, which Katurian burns. Katurian interrupts his narrative to say that this ending was fabricated when he wrote the story: when he broke down the door, he found Michal still alive. Katurian smothered his parents with a pillow that very night in vengeance for his disabled brother and the abuse he suffered.\n\nScene 1: Katurian and Michal are together in a cell, Katurian just having been tortured. Michal reveals that he had not been tortured, but rather cooperated entirely with Ariel, even screaming when Ariel asked him to. At Michal's request, Katurian tells him the story of \"The Pillowman\", about a man made of pillows who convinces children to kill themselves so they can be spared a horrible future. Michal admits to having killed the children, claiming that Katurian told him to do it by telling his stories. Michal says that he murdered the third child after hearing Katurian's story \"The Little Jesus\", one of his most violent. Michal tells Katurian that he had read the written version of \"The Writer and the Writer's Brother\", and resented the changes from their lives, wishing that Katurian had written a happy ending for the two brothers. Katurian lulls Michal to sleep by telling him the story \"The Little Green Pig\", then smothers him to save him the pain of being executed. Katurian calls to the detectives, announcing his intention to confess to the crimes on the condition that his stories are preserved. \n\nScene 2: Katurian tells the others the story of the Little Jesus, which was thought to inspire the third murder. A young girl believes that she is the second coming of Jesus, and blesses unsavory characters, to the dismay of her parents and annoyance of others. When her parents are killed in a horrific accident, she is sent to live with abusive foster parents. Annoyed by her pretensions, the foster parents crucify her and bury her alive so that she might rise again in three days, but she does not.\n\nTold briefly in I.i, and re-enacted in the first child murder. A young girl, whose father mistreats her, carves a set of little men out of apples. She gives them to her father, telling him to save them rather than eat them. He scoffs at her, and eats several. The apple has razor blades inside, which kill the father. At night the remaining apple men accuse the girl of killing their brothers, and jump down her throat to kill her.\n\nTold in I.i. A man wakes up in an iron gibbet, aware that he has committed the crime he is being punished for, but unaware of what the crime was. He sees two other gibbets, one marked \"Murderer\" and the other marked \"Rapist\". Several people come by who have sympathy for the murderer and the rapist, but express disgust for the first man after reading the sign that identifies his crime. Still ignorant of his crime, the man is shot by a highwayman.\n\nTold in I.i, and reenacted in the second murder. A young boy, mistreated by his parents, offers a strange dark rider a piece of his meal. Touched, the rider presents him a gift: he chops off the child's toes. The conclusion of the story relates that the rider was the Pied Piper on his way to Hamelin to take away the children. Since he crippled the boy, the latter could not keep up with the other children, and was the only child in town to survive. \n\nTold in II.i. The Pillowman visits people on the verge of suicide because of the tortured lives they have suffered. He travels back in time to the person's childhood and convinces them to commit suicide, thereby avoiding the life of suffering. This task saddens the Pillowman, however, and he decides to visit his own younger self, who readily commits suicide. This relieves the Pillowman's sadness, but also causes all the children he saved to live out their miserable lives and eventually die alone.\n\nTold in II.i. Katurian's most juvenile story, but also the only one devoid of violence. A green pig, who enjoys his peculiar colouring, is mocked by the other pigs. The farmers use a special permanent paint to make the pig pink just like all the others. The pig prays to God to keep his peculiarity, and can't understand why God ignored his prayers. Soon after, however, a magic green rain falls that makes all the other pigs green, and since the little pig retains his pink colour, he is once again \"a little bit peculiar\".\n\nReenacted in II.ii, and originally thought to be the source for the third murder. A young girl believes that she is the second coming of Jesus, and goes about blessing unsavory characters, to the dismay of her parents and the annoyance of others. When her parents are killed in a horrific accident, she is sent to live with abusive foster parents. Annoyed with her pretensions of divinity, the foster parents complete her performance of Jesus' life by torturing her, crucifying her, and burying her alive so that she might rise again in three days. She doesn't but three days later a man walks through the woods close to the girls grave. He fails to hear the scratching of her nails on the wood on her coffin, and does not see the fresh grave because - like a man the girl tried to heal - he is blind.\n\nThis story is partially autobiographical. A boy, raised by loving parents who encouraged him to write, wrote happy stories for many years. Then, at night, he begins hearing sounds of torture from the next room, and as a result he began to write more disturbing stories. One night, a note is slipped under the door, claiming that the boy's brother has been tortured nightly for seven years as part of an artistic experiment to get the boy to become a great writer. He breaks down the door, only to find his parents, who were playing a trick on him, just pretending to be torturing a child. However, when he returns years later, he discovers his brother's dead body hidden under the mattress, clutching the manuscript of a beautiful story, better than any of his, which he burns. Later in Act II Katurian tells Michal that in the story, the character Michal was the true \"writer\" of the title, whereas his own character was merely the brother.\n\nMichal mentions this story to illustrate the fact that Katurian's work, in general, tends to be dark and twisted. Unlike the others, it is not narrated, acted out, or summarized in great detail. Michal gives the following brief synopsis of the story: instead of being the literary genius the world thinks him to be, William Shakespeare does not pen his own plays; instead, whenever he wants something written, he jabs a little pygmy woman who he keeps in a box and she, in turn, composes a play for him (Shakespeare takes the credit).\n\nAn unnamed, sadistic character chops off the faces of his (undescribed) victims, puts them in a jar, and keeps them in his basement. As with \"The Shakespeare Room\", this story is mentioned by Michal only in passing.\n\n\"The Pillowman\" stemmed in part from McDonagh's experience composing fairy tales, with names such as The Chair and the Wolfboy, The Short Fellow and the Strange Frog, and The Violin and the Drunken Angel, early in his writing career. Attempting to rewrite fairy tales he remembered from childhood, he realized that \"there's something dark about them that doesn't quite come through.\"\n\nIn a conversation with Irish drama critic Fintan O'Toole in \"BOMB Magazine\" in 1998, McDonagh retold the Brothers Grimm version of Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf's stomach is filled with rocks and sewn with green wire, leading to the wolf's death. McDonagh's comment—\"I would love to write something as horrific as that if I could\"—indicates a potential inspiration for the story \"The Little Apple Men\" in \"The Pillowman\".\n\nThis play has been described as borrowing from \"Closet Land\" (1991), an independent film written and directed by Indian filmmaker Radha Bharadwaj, which starred Madeleine Stowe and Alan Rickman. Commenting on this, Bob Mielke, Ph.D, Professor of English at Truman State University, said that \"plot elements of \"Closet Land\" persist in another narrative host body, another way in which this text persists and haunts (if you will) our culture.\"\n\nThe original London and Broadway productions of the show featured music composed by Paddy Cunneen.\n\nIt received its first public reading in an early version at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 1995 in a season that included Shopping and Fucking by Mark Ravenhill.\n\nThe play had its world premiere on 13 November 2003 at the Royal National Theatre, directed by John Crowley.

{"id": "212342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212342", "title": "Ugaritic", "text": "Ugaritic\n\nUgaritic () is an extinct Amorite language known through the Ugaritic texts discovered by French archaeologists in 1929. It is known almost only in the Ugarit texts found in the ruined city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria). It has been used by scholars of the Hebrew Bible to clarify Biblical Hebrew texts and has revealed ways in which the cultures of ancient Israel and Judah found parallels in the neighboring cultures.\n\nUgaritic has been called \"the greatest literary discovery from antiquity since the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform\".\n\nThe Ugaritic language is attested in texts from the 14th through the 12th century BC. The city of Ugarit was destroyed roughly 1190 BC.\n\nLiterary texts discovered at Ugarit include the \"Legend of Keret\", the legends of Danel, the \"Myth of Baal-Aliyan\", and the \"Death of Baal\"—the latter two are also collectively known as the \"Baal Cycle\"—all revealing aspects of ancient Northwest Semitic religion.\n\nAccording to one hypothesis, Ugaritic texts might solve the biblical puzzle of the anachronism of \"Ezekiel\" mentioning Daniel at ; it is because in both Ugaritic and Hebrew texts, it is correctly \"Danel\".\n\nThe Ugaritic alphabet is a cuneiform script used beginning in the 15th century BC. Like most Semitic scripts, it is an abjad, where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.\n\nAlthough it appears similar to Mesopotamian cuneiform (whose writing techniques it borrowed), its symbols and symbol meanings are unrelated. It is the oldest example of the family of West Semitic scripts such as the Phoenician, Paleo-Hebrew, and Aramaic alphabets (including the Hebrew alphabet). The so-called \"long alphabet\" has 30 letters while the \"short alphabet\" has 22. Other languages (particularly Hurrian) were occasionally written in it in the Ugarit area, although not elsewhere.\n\nClay tablets written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the Levantine ordering of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic order of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin alphabets; and the South Semitic order, which gave rise to the order of the Ge'ez script. The script was written from left to right.\n\nUgaritic had 28 consonantal phonemes (including two semivowels) and eight vowel phonemes (three short vowels and five long vowels): \"a ā i ī u ū ē ō\". The phonemes \"ē\" and \"ō\" occur only as long vowels and are the result of monophthongization of the diphthongs \"ay\" and \"aw\", respectively.\n\nThe following table shows Proto-Semitic phonemes and their correspondences among Ugaritic, Classical Arabic and Tiberian Hebrew:\n\nUgaritic is an inflected language, and its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in Classical Arabic and Akkadian. It possesses two genders (masculine and feminine), three grammatical cases for nouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, and genitive), three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), and verb aspects similar to those found in other Northwest Semitic languages. The word order for Ugaritic is verb–subject–object (VSO) and subject–object–verb (SOV), possessed–possessor (NG), and noun–adjective (NA). Ugaritic is considered a conservative Semitic language, since it retains most of the phonemes, the case system, and the word order of the ancestral Proto-Semitic language.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13446366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13446366", "title": "Ukrainians in Russia", "text": "Ukrainians in Russia\n\nUkrainians in Russia make up the largest single diaspora group of the Ukrainian people. In 2010 1.9 million Ukrainians lived in Russia, representing over 1.4% of the total population of the Russian Federation and comprising the third-largest ethnic group - after ethnic Russians and Tatars. An estimated 340,000 people born in Ukraine (mostly youths) permanently settle legally in Russia each year. \n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Donbass War in 2014, over 420,000 asylum-seekers and refugees from Ukraine had registered in Russia .\n\nGrand Prince of Kiev Vladimir II Monomakh founded the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal, and his son Yuri Dolgoruki founded the city of Moscow in 1147. However, by the end of the 12th century the prominence of Rus' began to decline as Kiev's central role became disputed by the surrounding principalities which were increasingly more powerful and independent. Dolgoruki's son Andrei I Bogolyubsky plundered Kiev in 1169, an event that allowed the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal to take a leading role as the predecessor of the modern Russian state.\n\nThe sacking of Kiev itself in December 1240 during the Mongol Invasion led to the ultimate collapse of the Rus' state. For many of its residents, the brutality of Mongol attacks sealed the fate of many choosing to find safe haven in the North East. In 1299, the Kievan Metropolitan Chair was moved to Vladimir by Metropolitan Maximus, keeping the titile \"of Kiev\". As Vladimir-Suzdal, and later the Grand Duchy of Moscow continued to grow unhindered, the Orthodox religious link between them and Kiev remained strong. Envoys continued to be sent to Moscow from the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Professional artisans, builders, craftsmen and lay-people also traveled to Moscow where they could more easily earn a living.\n\nThe Southern Ruthenians found themselves within a new state of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the union of Jogaila and Kingdom of Poland in 1386 this state became officially Catholic in leadership. This isolated its majority Orthodox population, and soon many notable Ruthenian leaders began to leave for Moscow. In 1408 a group of nobles led by Švitrigaila along with the Chernihiv bishop together with a significant group of soldiers defected to Moscow. Others followed. Trade though initially sporadic, traveling through Chernihiv and Putyvl.\n\nThe frequent Russo-Lithuanian Wars meant that in 1448, Moscow Metropolitan Jonah, despite of the fall of Byzantium, achieved full Autocephaly for the Russian Orthodox Church. The title \"of Kiev\" remained with the Kievan Metropolia, which was under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nThe emigration to the Tsardom of Russia continued to grow in the 16th century. Prominent examples include Michael Glinski who staged a powerful rebellion against Lithuanian rule in February 1508 all those that took part in the uprising, who would receive a boyar title along with villages and lands around Medyn for settlement. In the mid-16th century the Ukrainian Hetman Dmytro Vyshnevetsky visited Moscow where he served in the court of Tsar Ivan IV and received in return the city of Belyov on the river Tula and surrounding villages and homesteads as rewards. Trade also grew considerably in this period, and many Ukrainian Slobodas were founded in Russian cities.\n\nMany Ukrainian settlers settled in areas that lay between the old Zasechnaya cherta and the new defence line that would guard Russia from the frequent raids by the Nogais and the Crimean Tatars. This became known as Sloboda Ukraine, and initial forts, such as Kursk, Voronezh and Kharkiv were founded and settled by Ukrainian peasants that served the garrisons stationed there. According to the writings of the English trader D. Fletcher in 1588, these garrison towns had 4300 soldiers of which 4000 had come from Ukraine. The number of Ukrainian settlers in the southern borders of Russia increased after the unsuccessful revolts against the Poles. As a result, the bulk of the population became mixed.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654, migration to Russia from Ukraine increased. Initially this was to Sloboda Ukraine, but also to the Don lands and the area of the Volga river. There was also a significant migration to Moscow, particularly by church activists: priests and monks, scholars and teachers, artists, translators, singers and merchants. A colony was built in Moscow called the Malorossiysky dvor. In 1652 12 singers under the direction of Ternopolsky moved to Moscow, 13 graduates of the Kiev-Mogilla Collegium moved to teach the Moscovite gentry. Many priests and church administrators migrated from Ukraine, in particular the established Andreyevsky Monastery was made up from Ukrainian clergy. This had a great effect on the Russian Orthodox Church, and the policies of Patriarch Nikon which led to the Old Believer Raskol (schism). The influence of Ukrainian clergy continued to grow, especially after 1686, when the Metropolia of Kiev was transferred from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nSoon after, the abolishment of the Patriarch's chair by Peter I, the Ukrainian Stephen Yavorsky became Metropolitan of Moscow, followed by Feofan Prokopovich. Demetrius of Rostov became of Tobol and Siberia, and from 1704 Rostov and Yaroslavl. In all over 70 positions in the Orthodox hierarchy were taken by recent emigres from Kiev. Students of the Kiev-Mohyla Collegium started up schools and seminaries in many Russian eparchies. By 1750, over 125 such institutions were opened. As a result, these graduates practically controlled the Russian church obtaining key posts there (and holding them to almost the end of the 18th century). Under Prokopovich the Russian Academy of Sciences was opened in 1724 which was chaired from 1746 by Ukrainian Kirill Razumovsky.\n\nThe Moscow court had a choir established in 1713 with 21 singers from Ukraine. The conductor for a period of time was A. Vedel. In 1741 44 male, 33 women, and 55 girls were moved to St. Petersburg from Ukraine to sing and entertain. In 1763 the head conductor of the Emperor's court choir was M. Poltoratsky and later Dmitry Bortniansky. Composer Maksym Berezovsky also worked in St. Petersburg at the time. A significant Ukrainian presence was also seen in the Academy of Arts.\n\nThe Ukrainian presence in the Russian Army also grew significantly. The greatest influx happened after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Large numbers of Ukrainians settled around St Petersburg and were employed in the building of the city, the various fortresses and canals.\n\nA separate category of emigrants were those deported to Moscow by the Russian government for demonstrating anti-Russian sentiment. The deported were brought to Moscow initially for investigation, and then exiled to Siberia, Arkhangelsk or the Solovetsky Islands. Among the deported were Ukrainian cossack luminaries as D. Mhohohrishny, Ivan Samoylovych and Petro Doroshenko. Others include all the family of hetman Ivan Mazepa, A. Vojnarovsky, and those in Mazepa's Cossack forces that returned to Russia. Some were imprisoned in exile for the rest of their lives such as hetmanPavlo Polubotok, Pavlo Holovaty, P. Hloba and Petro Kalnyshevsky.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, there was a continuous migration from Belarus, Ukraine and Northern Russia to settle the distant areas of the Russian Empire. The promise of free fertile land was an important factor for many peasants who until 1861, lived under Serfdom. In the colonization of the new lands, a significant contribution was made by ethnic Ukrainians. Initially Ukrainians colonised border territories in the Caucasus. Most of these settlers came from Left-bank Ukraine and Slobozhanshchyna and mainly settled in the Stavropol, and Terek areas. Some compact areas of the Don, Volga and Urals were also settled.\n\nThe Ukrainians created large settlements within Russia often becoming the majority in certain centres. They continued fostering their traditions, their language and their architecture. Their village structure and administration differed somewhat from the Russian population that surrounded them. Where populations were mixed, russification often took place. The size and geographical area of the Ukrainian settlements were first seen in the course of the Russian Empire Census of 1897. This census noted only language, not ethnicity. Nonetheless a total of 22,380,551 Ukrainian speakers were recorded. Within the European territories of Russia 1,020,000 Ukrainians, in Asia (not including the Caucasus) 209,000 were recorded. From 1897-1914, the intense migration of Ukrainians to the Urals and Asia continued, and was measured to be 1.5 million before ceasing in 1915.\n\nThe first Russian Empire Census, conducted in 1897 gave statistics regarding language use in the Russian Empire according to the administrative borders. Extensive use of Little Russian (and in some cases dominance) was noted in the nine south-western Governorates and the Kuban Oblast. When the future borders of the Ukrainian state were marked, the results of the census were taken into consideration. As a result, the ethnographic borders of Ukraine in the 20th century were twice as large as the Cossack Hetmanate that was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 17th.\n\nCertain regions had mixed populations made up of both Ukrainian and Russian ethnicities as well as other minorities. These include the territory of Sloboda and the Donbass. These territories were between Ukraine and Russia. This left a large community of ethnic Ukrainians on the Russian side of the border. The borders of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic were largely preserved by the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nIn the course of the mid-1920s, the course of administrative reforms some territory, initially under the Ukrainian SSR was ceded to the Russian SFSR, such as the Taganrog and Shakhty cities in the eastern Donbass. At the time, the Ukrainian SSR gained several territories that were amalgamated into the Sumy Oblast in Sloboda region.\n\nThe Soviet Union was officially a multicultural country with no official national language. On paper all languages and cultures were guaranteed state protection Union-wide. In reality, however, the Ukrainians were granted the opportunity to meaningfully develop their culture only within the administrative borders of the Ukrainian Republic, where the Ukrainians had a privileged status of being the titular nation. As many Ukrainians migrated to other parts of the USSR, the cultural separation often led in their assimilation, particularly within Russia, which received the highest percentage of the Ukrainian migration. In Siberia, 82% of Ukrainians entered mixed marriages, primarily with Russians. This meant that outside the Ukrainian SSR, there was little or no provision for continuing a diaspora function. As a result, Ukrainian-language press was soon found only in large cities such as Moscow. Ukrainian cultural attributes such as clothing and national foods were preserved. According to a Soviet sociologist, 27% of the Ukrainians in Siberia read printed material in Ukrainian and 38% used the Ukrainian language. From time to time, Ukrainian groups would visit Siberia. Nonetheless, most of the Ukrainians there did assimilate.\n\nDue to the fact that Ukrainians were prominent in the Gulags of Norilsk and Vorkuta Ukrainians have continued to be the majority ethnicity in these cities. Around 80% of the population in Norilsk in 1989 had least one Ukrainian ancestor.\n\nAccording to Volodymyr Kubiyovych and Aleksandr Zhukovsky the area of Ukrainian ethnic territory outside of the borders of the Ukrainian SSR (1970) where an ethnic Ukrainian majority lived was estimated to be 146,500 square kilometres, and the area of nationally mixed territories make up approximately 747,600 square kilometres.\n\nThe Ukrainian cultural renaissance in Russia began at the end of the 1980s, with the formation of the Slavutych Society in Moscow and the Ukrainian Cultural Centre named after T. Shevchenko in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg).\n\nIn 1991, the Ukraina Society organized a conference in Kiev with delegates from the various new Ukrainian Community organizations of the Eastern Diaspora. By 1991, over 20 such organizations were in existence. By 1992, 600 organizations were registered in Russia alone. The Congress helped to consolidate the efforts of these organizations. From 1992, regional congresses began to take place, organized by the Ukrainian organizations of Prymoria, Tyumen Oblast, Siberia and the Far East. In March 1992, the Union of Ukrainian organizations in Moscow was founded. In May of that year - The Union of Ukrainians in Russia.\n\nThe term \"Eastern Diaspora\" has been used since 1992 to describe Ukrainians living in the former USSR, as opposed to the Western Ukrainian Diaspora which was used until then to describe all Ukrainian diaspora outside the Union. An estimated number of Ukrainians living in the Eastern Diaspora is 6.8 million, and while those in the West is approximately 5 million.\nIn February 2009 about 3.5 million Ukrainian citizens were estimated to be working in the Russian Federation, especially in Moscow and in the construction industry. According to Volodymyr Yelchenko, the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Russian Federation there were no state schools in Russia with a program for teaching school subjects in the Ukrainian language as of August 2010; he considered \"the correction of this situation\" as one of his top priority tasks.\n\nAs of 2007, the number of Ukrainian illegal immigrants has been estimated as being between 3-11 million. many Ukrainians came illegally so the true number of Russian Ukrainians has been unknown. Many Ukrainians have been viewed as illegal immigrants and criminals, and many complain of racism. Some have compared this to how Mexicans are viewed in the United States.\n\nDuring and after the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Ukrainians living in Russia complained of being labelled a \"Banderite\" (follower of Stepan Bandera); even when they were from parts of Ukraine were Stephan Bandera has no popular support.\n\nAs of September 2015, there were 2.6 million Ukrainians living in Russia, more than half of them “guest workers,” but about a million more who’d arrived in the previous eighteen months after fleeing Ukraine, according to the Russian federal migration service. About 400,000 had applied for refugee status and almost 300,000 had asked for temporary residence status, with another 600,000 in considered to be in breach of migration rules. By November 2017, there were 427,240 asylum-seekers and refugees from Ukraine registered in Russia. The refugees are from the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics taken over by pro-Russian rebels since the War in Donbass. Most refugees have headed to rural areas in central Russia. Major destinations for Ukrainian migrants have included Karelia, Vorkuta, Magadan Oblast; oblasts such as Magadan and Yakutia are destinations of a government relocation program since the vast majority avoid big cities.\n\nUkrainians in the Russian Federation represent the third largest ethnic group after Russians and Tatars. In spite of their relatively high numbers, some Ukrainians in Russia complain of the unfair treatment and the prevailing anti-Ukrainian sentiment in the Russian Federation. In November 2010, the High Court of Russia cancelled registration of one of the biggest civic communities of the Ukrainian minority, the \"Federal nation-cultural autonomy of the Ukrainians in Russia\" (FNCAUR).\n\nThe vast majority of Ukrainians in Russia are adherents of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Ukrainian clergy had a very influential role on Russian Orthodoxy in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nRecently, the growing economic migrant population from Galicia have had success in establishing a few Ukrainian Catholic churches, and there are several churches belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Kiev Patriarchate), where Patriarch Filaret agreed to accept breakaway groups that had been excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church for breaches of canon law. Some asserted in 2002, that Russian bureaucracy regarding religion has hampered the expansion of the two groups above. According to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, their denomination has only one church building in all of Russia\n\nThe original Black Sea Cossacks colonised the Kuban region from 1792. Following the Caucasus War and the subsequent colonisation of the Circaucasus, the Black Sea Cossacks intermixed with other ethnic groups including the indigenous Cirsassian population.\n\nAccording to the 1897 census, 47.3% of the Kuban population (including extensive latter 19th-century non-Cossack migrants from both Ukraine and Russia) referred to their native language as Little Russian (the official term for the Ukrainian language) while 42.6% referred to their native language as Great Russian. Most of the cultural production in Kuban from the 1890s until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, such as plays, stories and music were written in the Ukrainian language, and one of the first political parties in Kuban was the Ukrainian Revolutionary Party. During the Russian Civil War with the Kuban Cossack Rada desperate for survival, turned to the Ukrainian People's Republic and formed a military alliance, as well declaring Ukrainian to be the official language of the Kuban National Republic. This decision was not supported uniformly by the Cossacks themselves and soon the Rada itself was dissolved by the Russian WhiteDenikin's Volunteer Army.\n\nIn the 1920s a policy of Decossackization was pursued. At the same time, the Bolshevik authorities supported policies that promoted the Ukrainian language and self-identity, opening 700 Ukrainian-language schools and a Ukrainian department in the local university. Russian historians claim that Cossacks were in this way forcibly Ukrainized, while Ukrainian historians claim that Ukrainization in Kuban merely paralleled Ukrainization in Ukraine itself, where people were being taught in their native language. According to the 1926 census, there were nearly a million Ukrainians registered in the Kuban Okrug alone (or 62% of the total population) During this period many Soviet repressions were \"tested\" on the Cossack lands, particularly the \"Black Boards\" that led to the Soviet famine of 1932-1934 in the Kuban. Yet by the mid-1930s there was an abrupt policy change of Soviet attitude towards Ukrainians in Russia. In the Kuban, the Ukrainization policy was halted and reversed. In 1936 the Kuban Cossack Chorus was however re-formed as were individual Cossack regiments in the Red Army. By the end of the 1930s many Cossacks' descendants chose to identify themselves as Russians. From that moment onwards almost all of the self-identified Ukrainians in the Kuban, date to non-Cossacks, the Soviet Census of 1989 showed that a total of 251,198 people in Krasnodar Kray (including Adyghe Autonomous Oblast) who were born in the Ukrainian SSR, and moved there by time of census. In the 2002 census, the number of people who identified themselves as Ukrainians in the Kuban was recorded to be 151,788. Despite the fact that most of the Kuban Cossacks descendants do not think of themselves as being nationally Ukrainians, and identify themselves as Russian nationals., many elements of their unique culture originates from Ukraine, such as the Kuban Bandurist music, and the dialect called Balachka which they speak.\n\nMoscow has had a significant Ukrainian presence since the 17th century. The original Ukrainian settlement, bordered Kitai-gorod. No longer having a Ukrainian character, it is today is known as Maroseyka (a corruption of Malorusseyka, or Little Russian). During Soviet times the main street, Maroseyka, was named after the Ukrainian Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky. After Moscow State University was founded in 1755, from its inception many students from Ukraine studied there. Many of these students had commenced their studies at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.\n\nIn the first years after the revolution of 1905, Moscow was one of the major centres of the Ukrainian movement for self-awareness. The magazine Zoria was edited by A. Krymsky and from 1912-17 the Ukrainian cultural and literary magazine \"Ukrainskaya zhizn'\" was also published there edited by Symon Petliura. Books in the Ukrainian language were published in Moscow from 1912 and Ukrainian theatrical troops of M. Kropovnytsky and M. Sadovsky were constantly performing there.\n\nMoscow's Ukrainians played an active role in opposing the attempted coup in August 1991.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, there are 253,644 Ukrainians living in the city of Moscow, making them the third largest ethnic group in that city, after Russians and Tatars. A further 147,808 Ukrainians live in the Moscow region. The Ukrainian community in Moscow operates a cultural centre on Arbat Street (whose head is appointed by the Ukrainian government), publishes two Ukrainian-language newspapers, and has organized Ukrainian-language Saturday and Sunday schools.\n\nWhen Saint Petersburg was the capital during the Russian Empire era, many people from all nations including Ukrainians moved there. The Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, and Dmytro Bortniansky spent most of their lives and died there. Ivan Mazepa, carrying out the orders of Peter I, was responsible for sending many Ukrainians to help build St Petersburg, where they died on a massive scale.\n\nAccording to the latest census, there are 87,119 Ukrainians living in the city of St Petersburg, where they constitute the largest non-Russian ethnic group. The former Mayor, Valentina Matviyenko (née Tyutina) was born in Khmelnytskyi Oblast of western Ukraine and is of Ukrainian ethnicity .\n\nZeleny Klyn is often referred to as \"Zelena Ukraina\". This is an area of land settled by Ukrainians which is a part of the Far Eastern Siberia located on the Amur River and the Pacific Ocean. It was named by the Ukrainian settlers. The territory consists of over 1,000,000 square kilometres and has a population of 3.1 million (1958).\nThe Ukrainian population in 1926 made up to 26% of the population . In the last Russian census, 94,058 people in Primorsky Krai claimed Ukrainian ethnicity, making Ukrainians the second largest ethnic group and largest ethnic minority.\n\nThe Ukrainian settlement of Siry Klyn (literally: the \"grey wedge\") developed around the city of Omsk in western Siberia. M. Bondarenko, an emigrant from Poltava province, wrote before World War I: \"The city of Omsk looks like a typical Moscovite city, but the bazaar and markets speak Ukrainian\". All around the city of Omsk stood Ukrainian villages. The settlement of people beyond the Ural mountains began in the 1860s. There were attempts to form an autonomous Ukrainian region in 1917-1920. Altogether before 1914 1,604,873 emigrants from Ukraine settled the area. According to the 2010 Russian census, 77,884 people of the Omsk region identified themselves as Ukrainians, making Ukrainians the third-largest ethnic group there, after Russians and Kazakhs.\n\nThe settlement of Zholty Klyn (the Yellow Wedge) was founded soon after the Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1659 as the eastern border of the second Zasechnaya Cherta. Named after the yellow steppes on the middle and lower Volga, the colony co-existed with the Volga Cossacks; colonists primarily settled around the city of Saratov. In addition to Ukrainians, Volga Germans and Mordovians migrated to Zholty Klyn in numbers. most of the population is mixed in the region, though a few \"pure\" Ukrainian villages remain.\n\nSiry klyn Ukrainian community portal\n\nNorilsk was founded as a series of Gulag camps that mostly included Ukrainian collaborators with Nazi Germany who were from the western Ukraine (unlike most other Ukrainians in Russia, who are from the east).\nNorilsk is the only inhabited locality in Russia (excluding villages) with a Ukrainian majority. Ukrainians make up 59-80 percent of Norilsk's population. Many of their descendants keep their Ukrainian identity. Norilsk, notably, has accepted refugees from the Ukraine due to family ties with the Ukraine.\n\nLarge numbers of Ukrainians live in the Russian Far East as a result of the Soviet population transfers, most of them are descendants of the deportees.\n\nStatistical information about Ukrainians in the Eastern diaspora from census materials of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation was collected in 1897, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1937, 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989, 2002 and 2010. Of which, only the 1937 census has been discarded and a semi-fixed 1939 census was carried out.\n\nIn the aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, attention has been focused on the Eastern Ukrainian diaspora by the Society for relations with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. Numerous attempts have been made to unite them. The journal \"Zoloti Vorota\" began to be published by the Society for relations with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine and also the magazine \"Ukrainian Diaspora\" in 1991.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Ukrainian population in Russia has noticeably decreased. This was caused by a number of factors. The most important one was the general population decline in Russia. At the same time, a lot of Economic migrants from Ukraine moved to Russia for better paid jobs and careers. It is estimated that there are as many as 300 000 legally registered migrants. In wake of negative sentiments to the bulk of Worker migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asians, Ukrainians are thus often more trusted by the Russian population. Assimilation is also an important factor in the falling number of Ukrainians. Due to their dispersal and cultural similarity to Russians, Ukrainians often end up marrying Russians and their children are counted as Russian on the census. Otherwise the Ukrainian population has mostly remained stable due to high amounts of immigration from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38122928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38122928", "title": "United States Economic Census", "text": "United States Economic Census\n\nThe United States Economic Census is the U.S. federal government's official five-year measure of American business and the economy. It is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, and response is required by law. Forms go out to nearly 4 million businesses, including large, medium and small companies representing all U.S. locations and industries. Respondents are asked to provide a range of operational and performance data for their companies. Trade associations, chambers of commerce, and businesses use information from the economic census for economic development, business decisions, and strategic planning purposes. The next Economic Census will be conducted for the year ending December 2017.\n\nThe Economic Census, together with the separately conducted censuses of agriculture and governments, covers virtually the entire economy, excepting only for forestry, agricultural support, rail transportation, and employment by private households.\n\nCensuses have measured American economic activities since the first census of manufactures was taken in 1810. As the nation's economy has grown, the scope of what is now called the Economic Census expanded to include retail and wholesale trade, construction industries, mining, and a broad array of services.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, Congress responded to an increase in industrial activity and ordered census takers—at that time, federal marshals—to \"take an account of the several manufactures within their several districts, territories and divisions\" as part of the 1810 United States Census. As the marshals traveled from house to house counting the population, they asked questions on 25 broad categories of manufactured products and more than 200 kinds of goods.\n\nIn successive decades the census came to include certain non-manufacturing businesses as well, such as retail stores, lumber yards and butcher shops. Then in 1902, Congress authorized the establishment of a permanent Census Bureau, and at the same time directed that a census of manufactures be taken every five years. The 1905 manufacturing census marked the first time a census of any kind was taken separately from the regular every 10 years population census.\n\nThe first census of business, covering retail and wholesale trade, was conducted in 1930, and shortly thereafter was broadened to include some service trades. The periodic economic censuses were suspended during World War II in favor of war-oriented surveys. They resumed with the 1947 Census of Manufactures and the 1948 Census of Business.\n\nThe Economic Census almost took another hiatus when the administration of President Dwight Eisenhower failed to provide funding for the 1953 Economic Census. Then, in October 1953, the United States Secretary of Commerce appointed Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, then Director of Research for Dun and Bradstreet, to form an Intensive Review Committee to study the issue. The Committee made its report, \"Appraisal of Census Programs,\" in February 1954. Its series of testimonials from the business, financial, professional, and governmental groups represented on the Committee led to the reinstatement of the Economic Census for 1954.\n\nThe 1954 Economic Census was the first to fully integrate census taking for the various kinds of business. The census provided comparable statistics across economic sectors, using consistent time periods, concepts, definitions, classification and reporting units. For the first time, an electronic computer (UNIVAC 1) was used to process Economic Census data.\n\nThe 1954 Economic Census also was the first to be taken by mail, using lists of firms provided from the administrative records of other federal agencies. Since 1963, administrative records have been used to provide basic statistics for very small firms, reducing or eliminating the need to send them census questionnaires.\n\nThe range of industries covered in the economic census has continued to expand. The census of construction industries began on a regular basis in 1967. The scope of service industries coverage was broadened at various points over the following 25 years.\n\nThe census of transportation began in 1963 as a set of surveys covering travel, transportation of commodities, and trucks. Starting in 1987, census publications also reported on business establishments engaged in several transportation industries, paralleling the data on establishments in other sectors.\n\nThe final major expansion of the Economic Census took place in 1992, adding more transportation industries, plus finance, insurance, real estate, communications, and utilities, a group accounting for more than 20 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.\n\nThe 1997 Economic Census was the first major statistical report based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Developed cooperatively by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, NAICS replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to provide greater comparability with international statistics.\n\nThe first survey of minority-owned businesses covered 1969, and a parallel program began for women-owned businesses for 1977. Now titled the Survey of Business Owners, this program presents statistics according to the federal standard that allows respondents to report more than one race. The survey also gathers expanded characteristics of businesses and their owners, including age and veteran status of the owners and the identification of home-based business and participation in franchising.\n\n\nTitle 13 of the US Code (sections 131, 191, 224) manages the Census Bureau to take economic census every five years. The 1992 Economic Census consists of the following censuses:\n\n\nResponses to the Economic Census have been treated as confidential since the 19th century. Legislation authorizing the 1910 decennial census went even further and required that statistics be published so that no particular establishment or its operations could be identified.\n\nIn 1954, the confidentiality provisions were incorporated into the law (Title 13 of the United States Code) that specifies the frequency and scope of the Economic Census. The law also prescribes penalties for any disclosure by the Census Bureau, or for a respondent's false reporting or willful refusal where response is mandatory. In 1962, the confidentiality rule for census questionnaires was extended by law to also make copies retained in respondents' files immune from legal process ().\n\nThe automation of the Economic Census dates back to the use of tabulating typewriters in 1900, punch card tabulating equipment in 1920, and electronic computers in 1954. Starting in 1967, selected large firms were allowed to file their reports on computer tape. The 2002 Economic Census was the first to allow every firm to file electronically.\n\nSince 1972, most of the same statistics found in printed reports have also been available to data users in electronic media, initially on computer tape. The 1987 Economic Census was the first to be published on CD-ROM, a practice continued until 2002, when the medium changed to DVD. Key 1987 statistics were also published online via CENDATA. Only a few reports were published in print for 1997, and none were printed in 2002. Portable document format (pdf) technology allowed anyone to print out 1992, 1997, and 2002 reports from their computers on demand. Since 1997, the primary means for data users to access Economic Census statistics is through American FactFinder.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43609310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43609310", "title": "Van Ray", "text": "Van Ray\n\nVan Ray (born 1984 in Düsseldorf) is a German artist. His art, mostly characterized as street art or urban art, makes use of various stencil techniques on vintage materials. Van Ray works from Cologne, and is considered to be one of the most successful German urban art artists.\n\nVan Ray's career began with public graffiti at the end of the 90s when he started using his art to communicate with the general public and to demonstrate social criticism. His works were based on various techniques (including stencils, stickers, paste-ups, and sculptures) and meant to express his view of Western society.\n\nAfter moving to Cologne in 2007, Van Ray became the founder of the artist collaboration 'fancyroom' which concentrated on textile designs by combining elements of graffiti and graphic design. The results were used for own textile collections and by several fashion brands. The collaboration dissolved in 2010.\n\nAt this time the public art of Van Ray was attracting the attention of several gallery owners, offering him to present his street art in their exhibitions. Consequently, the artist finally agreed to a first gallery exhibition in the winter of 2010, presenting his \"streets on wood\"-series in the 30Works Gallery, Cologne. Due to his public work, several solo as well as group exhibitions, live shows, art festival appearances, and panel discussions, Van Ray has since then become one of the most famous German street artists.\n\nIn the course of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he was invited by the Institut Pierre Werner to perform his art publicly during a live performance in Luxembourg.\n\nVan Ray's work is characterized by its detailed stencils on mostly rusty vintage materials such as iron sheets, vending machines and enamel signs or wooden slats.\nThe works nowadays reflect a fusion of street art and pop art, retaining the basic elements of his distinctive artistic style without losing sight of his intended social criticism. On the relationship between art and protest, Van Ray commented:\n\n\"Rebellion does not derive from the use of a certain technique, but rather from the color of your tie.\"\n\nHis works are all signed with the \"duck signature symbol\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "357828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357828", "title": "Zolpidem", "text": "Zolpidem\n\nZolpidem, sold under the brand name Ambien, among others, is a medication primarily used for the short term treatment of sleeping problems. Guidelines recommend that it be used only after counseling and behavioral changes have been tried. It decreases the time to sleep onset by about 15 minutes and at larger doses helps people stay asleep longer. It is taken by mouth and is available in conventional tablets or sublingual tablets and oral spray.\nCommon side effects include daytime sleepiness, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Other side effects include memory problems, hallucinations, and abuse. The recommended dose was decreased in 2013 due to next-morning impairment. Additionally driving the next morning is not recommended with either higher doses or the long acting formulation. While flumazenil can reverse zolpidem's effects, usually supportive care is all that is recommended in overdose.\nZolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine and hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class. Zolpidem is a type A GABA receptor agonist. It works by increasing GABA effects in the central nervous system by binding to GABA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines. It generally has a half-life of two to three hours. This, however, is increased in those with liver problems.\nZolpidem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. It became available as a generic medication in 2007. In the United States it has a monthly cost of about 8 for immediate release and 66 for controlled release medication, as of 2017. Zolpidem is a Schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA). More than 10 million prescriptions are filled a year in the United States, making it one of the most commonly used treatments for sleeping problems.\n\nZolpidem is labelled for short-term (usually about two to six weeks) treatment of insomnia at the lowest possible dose. It may be used for both improving sleep onset and staying asleep. \n\nGuidelines from NICE, the European Sleep Research Society, and the American College of Physicians recommend medication for insomnia (including possibly zolpidem) only as a second line treatment after nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia). This is based in part on a 2012 review which found that zolpidem's effectiveness is nearly as much due to psychological effects as to the medication itself. \n\nA lower-dose version (3.5 mg for men and 1.75 mg for women) is given as a tablet under the tongue and used for middle-of-the night awakenings. It can be taken if there are at least 4 hours between the time of administration and when the person must be awake.\n\nZolpidem should not be taken by people with obstructive sleep apnea, myasthenia gravis, severe liver disease, respiratory depression, children, or people with psychotic illnesses. It should not be taken by people who are or have been addicted to other substances.\n\nUse of zolpidem may impair driving skills with a resultant increased risk of road traffic accidents. This adverse effect is not unique to zolpidem but also occurs with other hypnotic drugs. Caution should be exercised by motor vehicle drivers. In 2013 the FDA recommended the dose for women be reduced and that prescribers should consider lower doses for men due to impaired function the day after taking the drug.\n\nZolpidem should not be prescribed to older people, who are more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics including zolpidem and are at an increased risk of falls and adverse cognitive effects. \n\nZolpidem has been assigned to pregnancy category C by the FDA. Animal studies have revealed evidence of incomplete ossification and increased postimplantation fetal loss at doses greater than seven times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; however, teratogenicity was not observed at any dose level. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. In one case report, zolpidem was found in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is recommended for use during pregnancy only when benefits outweigh risks.\n\nThe most common side effects for short-term use include headache (reported by 7% of people in clinical trials), drowsiness (2%), dizziness (1%), and diarrhea (1%); the most common side effects of long-term use included\ndrowsiness (8%),\ndizziness (5%),\nallergy (4%),\nsinusitis (4%),\nback pain (3%),\ndiarrhea (3%),\ndrugged feeling (3%),\ndry mouth (3%),\nlethargy (3%),\nsore throat (3%),\nabdominal pain (2%),\nconstipation (2%),\nheart palpitations (2%),\nlightheadedness (2%),\nrash (2%),\nabnormal dreams (1%),\namnesia (1%),\nchest pain (1%),\ndepression (1%),\nflu-like symptoms (1%),\nand\nsleep disorder (1%).\n\nUpper and lower respiratory infections are also common (experienced by between 1 and 10% of people).\n\nResidual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive function, may persist into the day following nighttime administration. Such effects may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Around 3% of people taking zolpidem are likely to break a bone as a result of a fall due to impaired coordination caused by the drug.\n\nSome users have reported unexplained sleepwalking while using zolpidem, as well as sleep driving, night eating syndrome while asleep, and performing other daily tasks while sleeping. Research by Australia's National Prescribing Service found these events occur mostly after the first dose taken, or within a few days of starting therapy. In February 2008, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration attached a boxed warning concerning this adverse effect.\n\nAs zolpidem is associated with drug tolerance and substance dependence, its prescription guidelines are only for severe insomnia and short periods of use at the lowest effective dose. Tolerance to the effects of zolpidem can develop in some people in just a few weeks. Abrupt withdrawal may cause delirium, seizures, or other adverse effects, especially if used for prolonged periods and at high doses. When drug tolerance and physical dependence to zolpidem develop, treatment usually entails a gradual dose reduction over a period of months to minimize withdrawal symptoms, which can resemble those seen during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Failing that, an alternative method may be necessary for some people, such as a switch to a benzodiazepine equivalent dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine drug, as for diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, followed by a gradual reduction in dose of the long-acting benzodiazepine. In people who are difficult to treat, an inpatient flumazenil rapid detoxification program can be used to detoxify from a zolpidem drug dependence or addiction.\n\nAlcohol has cross tolerance with GABA receptor positive modulators, such as the benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepine drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may be at increased risk of physical dependency or abuse of zolpidem. It is not typically prescribed in people with a history of alcoholism, recreational drug use, physical dependency, or psychological dependency on sedative-hypnotic drugs. A 2014 review found evidence of drug-seeking behavior, with prescriptions for zolpidem making up 20% of falsified or forged prescriptions.\n\nRodent studies of the tolerance-inducing properties have shown that zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than benzodiazepines, but in primates, the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as seen with benzodiazepines.\n\nOverdose can lead to coma or death. When overdose occurs, there are often other drugs in the person's system.\n\nZolpidem overdose can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem. It is unknown if dialysis is helpful.\n\nZolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, to provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700 μg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage. Analytical techniques, in general, involve gas or liquid chromatography.\n\nZolpidem is a high-affinity positive modulator of GABA receptors. It selectively binds to α subunits of this pentameric ion channel. Accordingly, it has strong hypnotic properties and weak anxiolytic, myorelaxant, and anticonvulsant properties. Opposed to diazepam, zolpidem is able to bind to binary αβ GABA receptors, where it was shown to bind to the α1–α1 subunit interface. Zolpidem has about 10-fold lower affinity for the α- and α- subunits than for α, and no appreciable affinity for α subunit-containing receptors. ω type GABA receptors are the α-containing GABA receptors and are found primarily in the brain, the ω receptors are those that contain the α-, α-, α-, α-, or α subunits, and are found primarily in the spine. Thus, zolpidem favours binding to GABAA receptors located in the brain rather the spine. Zolpidem has no affinity for γ1 and γ3 subunit-containing receptors and, like the vast majority of benzodiazepine-like drugs, it lacks affinity for receptors containing α and α. Zolpidem modulates the receptor presumably by inducing a receptor conformation that enables an increased binding strength of the orthosteric agonist GABA towards its cognate receptor without affecting desensitization or peak currents.\n\nLike zaleplon, zolpidem may increase slow wave sleep but cause no effect on stage 2 sleep. A meta-analysis that compared benzodiazepines against nonbenzodiazepines has shown few consistent differences between zolpidem and benzodiazepines in terms of sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.\n\nPeople should not consume alcohol while taking zolpidem and should not be prescribed opioid drugs nor take such drugs recreationally. Opioids can also increase the risk of becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. Use of opioids with zolpidem increases the risk of respiratory depression and death.\n\nNext day sedation can be worsened if people take zolpidem while they are also taking antipsychotics, other sedatives, anxiolytics, antidepressant agents, antiepileptic drugs, and antihistamines. Some people taking antidepressants have had visual hallucinations when they also took zolpidem.\n\nCytochrome P450 inhibitors, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors, fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin will increase the effects of a given dose of zolpidem.\n\nCytochrome P450 activators like St. John's Wort may decrease the activity of zolpidem.\n\nThree syntheses of zolpidem are common. 4-methylacetophenone is used as a common precursor. This is brominated and reacted with 2-amino-5-methylpyridine to give the imidazopyridine. From here the reactions use a variety of reagents to complete the synthesis, either involving thionyl chloride or sodium cyanide. These reagents are challenging to handle and require thorough safety assessments. Though such safety procedures are common in industry, they make clandestine manufacture difficult.\n\nA number of major side-products of the sodium cyanide reaction have been characterised and include dimers and mannich products.\n\nZolpidem was used in Europe starting in 1988 and was brought to market there by Synthelabo. Synthalabo and Searle collaborated to bring it to market in the US, and it was approved in the United States in 1992 under the brand name \"Ambien\". It became available as a generic medication in 2007.\n\nIn 2015, the American Geriatrics Society said that zolpidem met the Beers criteria and should be avoided in older people due to its risks compared with its benefits.\n\nPrescriptions in the US for all sleeping pills (including zolpidem) steadily declined from around 57 million tablets in 2013 to around 47 million in 2017, possibly in relation to concern about prescribing addictive drugs in the midst of the opioid crisis.\n\nThe United States Air Force uses zolpidem as one of the hypnotics approved as a \"no-go pill\" (with a 6-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation) to help aviators and special duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. (The other hypnotics used are temazepam and zaleplon.) \"Ground tests\" are required prior to authorization issued to use the medication in an operational situation.\n\nZolpidem has potential for either medical misuse when the drug is continued long term without or against medical advice, or for recreational use when the drug is taken to achieve a \"high\". The transition from medical use of zolpidem to high-dose addiction or drug dependence can occur with use, but some believe it may be more likely when used without a doctor's recommendation to continue using it, when physiological drug tolerance leads to higher doses than the usual 5 mg or 10 mg, when consumed through inhalation or injection, or when taken for purposes other than as a sleep aid. Recreational use is more prevalent in those having been dependent on other drugs in the past, but tolerance and drug dependence can still sometimes occur in those without a history of drug dependence. Chronic users of high doses are more likely to develop physical dependence on the drug, which may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, if abrupt withdrawal from zolpidem occurs.\n\nOther drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zopiclone, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of excessive-use potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone. U.S. Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy says that he was using Zolpidem (Ambien) and Phenergan when caught driving erratically at 3 am. \"I simply do not remember getting out of bed, being pulled over by the police, or being cited for three driving infractions,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNonmedical use of zolpidem is increasingly common in the U.S., Canada, and the UK. Some users have reported decreased anxiety, mild euphoria, perceptual changes, visual distortions, and hallucinations. Zolpidem was used by Australian Olympic swimmers at the London Olympics in 2012, leading to controversy.\n\nFor the stated reason of its potential for recreational use and dependence, zolpidem (along with the other benzodiazepine-like Z-drugs) is a Schedule IV substance under the Controlled Substances Act in the U.S. The United States patent for zolpidem was held by the French pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.\n\nThe z-drugs including zolpidem have been used as date rape drugs. Zolpidem is available legally by prescription, and unlike gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which is used to treat a rare form of narcolepsy, and flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), which is only prescribed as a second-line choice for insomnia, zolpidem is broadly prescribed. Zolpidem can typically be detected in bodily fluids for 36 hours, though it may be possible to detect it by hair testing much later, which is due to the short elimination half-life of 2.5–3 hours. This use of the drug was highlighted during proceedings against Darren Sharper, who was accused of using the tablets he was prescribed to facilitate a series of rapes.\n\nZolpidem received widespread media coverage in Australia after the death of a student who fell 20 m from the Sydney Harbour Bridge while under the influence of zolpidem.\n\nAs of September 2018, zolpidem was marketed under many brands: Adorma, Adorma, Albapax, Ambien, Atrimon, Belbien, Bikalm, Cymerion, Dactive, Dalparan, Damixan, Dormeben, Dormilam, Dormilan, Eanox, Edluar, Edluar, Flazinil, Fulsadem, Hypnogen, Hypnonorm, Intermezzo, Inzofresh, Ivadal, Ivedal, Le Tan, Lioram, Lunata, Medploz, Mondeal, Myslee, Nasen, Nocte, Nottem, Noxidem, Noxizol, Nuo Bin, Nytamel, Nyxe, Olpitric, Onirex, Opsycon, Polsen, Sanval, Semi-Nax, Sleepman, Somex, Somidem, Somit, Somnil, Somnipax, Somnipron, Somno, Somnogen, Somnor, Sonirem, Sove, Soza, Stilnoct, Stilnox, Stilpidem, Stimin, Sublinox, Sucedal, Sumenan, Vicknox, Viradex, Xentic, Zasan, Zaviana, Ziohex, Zipsoon, Zodem, Zodenox, Zodium, Zodorm, Zolcent, Zoldem, Zoldorm, Zoldox, Zolep, Zolfresh, Zolip, Zolman, Zolmia, Zolnox, Zolnoxs, Zolodorm, Zolpeduar, Zolpel, Zolpi, Zolpi-Q, Zolpic, Zolpidem, Zolpidem tartrate, Zolpidemi tartras, Zolpidemtartraat, Zolpidemtartrat, Zolpidemum, Zolpigen, Zolpihexal, Zolpimist, Zolpineo, Zolpinox, Zolpirest, Zolpistar, Zolpitop, Zolpitrac, Zolpium, Zolprem, Zolsana, Zolta, Zoltar, Zolway, Zomnia, Zonadin, Zonoct, Zopid, Zopidem, Zopim, and Zorimin.\n\nWhile cases of zolpidem improving aphasia in people with stroke have been described, use for this purpose has unclear benefit. Zolpidem has also been studied in persistent vegetative states with unclear effect. A 2017 systematic review concluded that while there is preliminary evidence of benefit for treating disorders of movement and consciousness other than insomnia (including Parkinson's disease), more research is needed.\n\nAnimal studies in FDA files for zolpidem showed a dose dependent increase in some types of tumors, although the studies were too small to reach statistical significance. Some observational epidemiological studies have found a correlation between use of benzodiazepines and certain hypnotics including zolpidem and an increased risk of getting cancer, but others have found no correlation; a 2017 meta-analysis of such studies found a correlation, but noted that the results were tentative because some of the studies failed to control for confounders like cigarette smoking and alcohol use, and some of the studies analyzed were case–controls, which are more prone to some forms of bias.\n"}
