Alternative formats that have been developed to aid different people to read include varieties of larger fonts, specialised fonts for certain kinds of reading disabilities, Braille, e-books, and automated Audiobooks and DAISY digital talking books.\n\nAccessible publishing has been made possible through developments in technology such as Print on demand (POD), E-book readers, the XML structured data format, and the Internet.\n\nThe aim of accessible publishing is to make reading easier for those who have difficulties doing such. This group includes people who are blind or visually impaired, people with learning disabilities, and people who are learning a second language. Accessible publishing also aims to allow people to read whichever format allows them to read fastest or allows them to absorb the information in a better way.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, the accessible publishing aim is to make every book available in all formats so that every reader can read with ease and proficiency.\n\nGuidelines and techniques for publishing in accessible formats have been made available by several organisations and authors, including:\n\nPrior to the twenty-first century the publishing industry focused on the production of printed books. The predominant publishing theory, which stressed economy of scale, tended to make only one format of a given book available. In this way they could be mass-produced and made available for the general public. This model did not allow for any other format to be widely available, however.\n\nThere were a number of developments in technology that increased the accessibility of books. The first of these was the development of the Braille language by Louis Braille in 1821. After this there was the development of audiobooks which originated from the United States Congress in 1931 and became popularised by advances in recording and the use of voice actors.\n\nIn 1980, Thorndike Press came into existence as a republisher of large print books. Thorndike bought the rights for large print versions of books from publishers and then republished them in a larger and more accessible format for people with reading difficulties.\n\nNew portable readers, such as the VictorReader Stream and the Plextalk Pocket handle talking books in a wide variety of formats including DAISY Digital Talking Book, MP3, text only, and many others.\n\nNew technology, such as the Sony Reader and Amazon’s Kindle, has the ability to alter the size of the font automatically. For example, the reader can choose from six different font size settings on the Kindle. The large font sizes available allow for easier reading for the visually impaired.\n\nReadHowYouWant is another leader in developing this technology. It works in partnership with publishers to make books available in all formats all across the world. This includes specially designed fonts for dyslexia, macular degeneration and line tracking problems.\n\n\nAccessible publishers:\n\n"}

He belonged to the Hamzite Sharifs, a division of the dynasty of the Rassids. He was the next generation descendant of the imam al-Muhtasib al-Mujahid Hamzah who died in battle in 1066. In his youth, he took up quranic studies and was an outstanding student who acquired a good juridical knowledge. As an adult, he was described as a large and well-shaped man with a heavy beard. The Zaidi community of the northern highland had not been able to appoint a new imam after the demise of al-Mutawakkil Ahmad bin Sulayman in 1171. Abdallah made a proclamation in Jawf in 1187. Although acknowledged by several men of standing, his attempt to gain power over the Zaidi community was a failure, and he withdrew to Jawf.\n\nBy this time, the main external threat against the Zaidis was the Sunni Muslim Ayyubid Dynasty, which had invaded Yemen from its base in Egypt in 1173. The new regime quickly occupied much of the country. The important highland city San'a was, for most of the time, in the hands of the Hatimid Sultan Ali bin Hatim, whose attitude to the Ayyubids alternated between submission and resistance. When the Ayyubid ruler Tughtakin, a brother of Saladin, died in 1197, virtually all Yemen except Sa'dah, the traditional centre of the Zaydiyyah, was in Ayyubid hands. In September or October 1197, the month after Tughtakin's death, Abdallah made his second bid for the imamate, and this time he was successful. As imam, he carried the honorific (\"laqab\") title al-Mansur Abdallah. He established his residence in Sa'dah. Al-Mansur was a man of learning, and 81 works by his hand are listed in one source. Among his writings are a treatise on the mutual conduct of children and parents, answers to questions about the first four caliphs, a diwan, a \"rajaz\" poem on the care and training of horses, and a four-volume work dealing with doctrinary questions, \"Ash-Shafi\". He sent his da'i (messengers) to Gilan and Deylaman in Persia, so that the khutba was read in his name among the Zaidis there. He also enjoyed some influence in the Hijaz. Al-Mansur Abdallah took a strict stance on religious matters, expelling unchaste women and pouring fermented drinks on the ground. The Mutarrifiyyah sect, which was considered heretic, was mercilessly crushed and its mosque near San'a was torn down on the orders of al-Mansur.\n\nIn 1197, Sultan Ali allied with al-Mansur Abdullah and fought against Mu'izz ad-Din Isma'il, the Ayyubid sultan in Yemen. The allies were heavily defeated at Hadur. However, a Kurdish emir, Haku bin Muhammad, and the Mamluk Shams al-Khawass, subsequently fell away from the Ayyubids and joined the Zaidi camp. The imam and Shams al-Khawass seized San'a, which momentarily stood under an Ayyubid governor. Nevertheless, the two allies immediately fell out with each other, since Shams al-Khawass was suspicious of the imam's influence among the masses. The imam had to sneak out of San'a with great effort, but managed to reach his troops outside the city walls and took possession of the city. In 1198, a new Ayyubid army marched towards San'a but was defeated by the Zaidi forces at Dhamar. Shortly afterwards, however, San'a was captured by still another Ayyubid contingent, and al-Mansur Abdullah withdrew to the mountainous stronghold Thula.\n\nIn the following years, the inconclusive Zaidi struggle against the Ayyubids wore on. San'a was in the hands of the imam for several short terms. In 1203, the imam strengthened the fortress of Zafar, and in 1205 he made peace with the Ayyubid governor in San'a, Wurdashar. Nevertheless, the peace only lasted for about two years. Serious fighting broke out in 1215, and this time a number of Zaidi strongholds in the north were captured. Al-Mansur Abdallah withdrew to Kawkaban where he took up a strong position. A large residence was constructed there, with quarters for his followers. A mint was also established. A new Zaidi-Ayyubid peace was concluded in 1216, but fighting was resumed within short. The following battles turned inconclusive, and the warfare was terminated when the imam died in Kawkaban in 1217. After his demise, the Zaidi community was split between two rival imams. These were his son an-Nasir Muhammad, and al-Hadi Yahya who belonged to another Rassid branch. Al-Mansur's nephews settled in the northern highland, adjacent to Asir, where they pursued their own secular policy, allying with the Zaidi imams, the Sulaymanid Sharifs, and the Rassids according to opportunities.\n\n"}

At the point of death, he confessed to killing 21 officers with his own hands.\n\nAndreas Balzar was born on 28 January 1769 in Höchstenbach in the German mountain region of Westerwald. As the eldest son, he should have followed his father into the priesthood. At first, he acceded to his father's will and attended the high school in Herborn. After being exposed there as the long-sought poacher of the prince's game estate, he was expelled from school, but before he was handed over to the court, he managed to escape from Herborn. He reached his parents' home in Flammersfeld, but his father turned him away.\n\nHe is said to have moved to Russia, where his brother served in the Tsar's bodyguard. He found service as a soldier fulfilling and rose to the rank of captain in the bodyguard.\n\nIt is unclear what prompted him to return to his homeland, the Westerwald. But when he did, he quickly fell in with a band of marauding robbers; he subsequently formed his own gang of poachers and made himself its leader.\n\nWhen a French officer indecently assaulted Balzar's bride as his troops marched through Flammersfeld, Balzar asked his hunters to help him hunt the French. Farmers and young boys also followed his call, but his appeal for a general uprising in the Westerwald was unsuccessful. At times, Balzar fought with his \"Freischärlers\" on the side of the Imperials (\"Kaiserliche\"), as the Austrian troops were called, but he often carried out his own ventures with his men. Under the name \"Le capitain noir\" (\"The Black Captain\") he was searched for by the French; several times he was able to escape from their captivity. In summer 1797, however, he was betrayed into the hands of a French search party, who brought him to Westerburg, where he was sentenced to death by shooting at a court martial. Although he was a poacher in the eyes of the French, the fact that he was not, like robber leader Schinderhannes was led to the scaffold or hanged may have had something to do with his Russian officer rank. However, his death by shooting made him a hero in the Westerwald for decades. He was executed on 3 October 1797 in Westerburg.\n\nEven today, Flammersfeld hosts performances of his fateful life; the Hessian author and archivist, Christian Spielmann, made him a character in a novel at the beginning of the 20th century as \"Balzar of Flammersfeld\".\n\n\n"}

Many of the ACCs were set up in anticipation of or as a result of a major protest.\n\nGenerally, Anti-Capitalist Convergences were assembled as umbrella organisations, to coordinate different groups and struggles. However, many have become groups unto themselves. In the wake of the \"Battle of Seattle\" and a similar resurgence of anti-capitalist protest and organising, activists in cities such as Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Chicago formed Convergences to carry out protests more effectively and to ensure that anti-capitalist organising would continue after major demonstrations had left the city. The Convergences were also billed as a counterweight to more mainstream coalitions and trade unions who radicals claimed dominated protests.\n\nBy far the most successful of the Anti-Capitalist Convergences has been the one, based in Montreal, best known by its French acronym: CLAC (Convergence des Luttes Anti-Capitalistes). Originally formed to coordinate protests at the Quebec City Summit of the Americas in April, 2001, it continued to operate afterwards, and provided the engine for the Take the Capital! protests the following year. It has also proven strong within its own community, launched anti-gentrification campaigns, and worked to help non-status immigrants.\n\nAs quickly as many ACCs sprung up, most of them have fallen apart. Montreal; Seattle; Colorado; Chicago; New York City; and Washington, D.C., have all seen their ACCs collapse. However, there are now ACCs active overseas in the Philippines and Japan and efforts are under way to revive an anti-capitalist umbrella group in Montreal.\n\n"}

Anti-Somali sentiment is sometimes referred to as Somaliphobia, or Somaliphobic sentiment.\n\nThe Aughties and early 2010s saw a major sporadic outbreaks of violence against Somali shopkeepers in South Africa. This violence has been attributed to jealousy over the success of Somalis businesses, ethnic tensions. However, some writers have attributed such hostility to a wider xenophobia, since other non-South Africa Africans were targeted as well. Somaliphobia has also been reported in Kenya during their invasion into Jubbaland in 2011. Anti-Somali sentiment is sometimes expressed in the context of anti-immigration sentiment. Anti-Somali sentiment is also sometimes expressed alongside anti-black sentiment. U.S. president Donald Trump's rhetoric regarding Somalis have been described as Somaliphobic.\n\nAnti-Somali sentiments sometimes overlap with Islamophobic sentiments. On Oct. 30, 2015, Asma Jama (a Muslim woman of Somali descent and Kenyan nationality) was beaten for speaking Swahili in an Applebee's in the outskirts of Minneapolis. The perpetrator for that violence was charged with third-degree assault. On June 2016, two Somalis were shot after wearing their traditional clothing. A week prior to the shooting, a Somali halal shop in the city was vandalized. Minneapolis City Council member Abdi Warsame discussed anti-Somali sentiments in the aftermath of the shooting of Justine Damond by a Somali police officer.\n\nThere are also some pejorative terms that serve to dehumanize Somalis. The term \"skinnie\" became popularized with the film Black Hawk Down. The term has been said to allude to reducing Somalis to their humanitarian struggles and National Public Radio has suggested that its usage deprives Somalis of their own point of view. The term \"Abdi\" is also sometimes pejoratively used to refer to male Somalis. The Associated Press's stylebook suggested that \"Somali\" is the correct demonym or adjective rather than \"Somalian\".\n\nPrejudice against Somalis sometimes comes from other Somalis. For example, there are terms such as Iidoor or kabadhe iidoora, that roughly translates as \"exchange\", a term viewed as pejorative that is aimed at \"Isaaq\" clan members. The term \"faqash\" was a derogatory term used by Isaaq dominated SNM forces to refer to Siad Barre's armed forces. However, due to the SNM's portrayal of the Barre's government as a Darod dictatorship, according to Lidwien Kapteijns, the term \"faqash\" \"could become a code word for “the Daarood-enemy-to-be exterminated-and-expelled” whereby \"clan-cleansing could be concealed in wide-open public view.\".\n\n"}

Strict sumptuary laws dictated the type of fiber, ornamentation and how clothing was worn by class. \n\nThe basic garment and braw for males was called \"maxtlatl\" in Nahuatl. The \"maxtlatl\" would often be worn under a cloak or cape called \"tilmahtli\" ; also called \"tilma\" in Spanish and English). Various styles of \"tilmatli\" existed which served to indicate the status of the wearer.\n\na: young wearing only a maxtlatl;\nb: common people (Macehualtin) dress;\nc: noble (Pipiltin) or high ranking warrior dress;\nd: ruling classes and the clergy;\ne: less common way to wear the tilmatli;\nf: war dress.\n\nAztec women wore a blouse called \"huīpīlli\" ; also called \"huipil\" in Spanish and English) and a long skirt called \"cuēitl\" (referred to as \"enredo\" in modern times). Women kept their skirt on them with a sash called a \"cihua necuitlalpiloni\" . In the Classical Nahuatl language, the couplet \"cuēitl huīpīlli\" \"skirt [and] blouse\" was used metaphorically to mean \"woman\".\nThe Aztecs wore different clothing depending on their age. Children younger than three wore no clothes. From age three and up, girls wore blouses and boys wore capes. From age four and up, girls additionally wore short skirts. From age five and up, the girls' short skirts was replaced with a longer skirts. At age 13, boys finally started wearing loin cloths.\n\nSandals, called \"cactli\" , were a sign of status. They were largely restricted to noble males. Those who entered temples or appeared before the emperor were required to be barefoot.\n\nAztec women wore hair in two braids that projected in the front like horns and this hairstyle was called \"neaxtlāhualli\" .\ncommon man hairstyle are cut to the length of the neck and probably a fringe\n\nThe Aztec (women and men) would tend to always decorate themselves with gold bangles, necklaces, chokers, etc. Such jewelry was worn to show how wealthy one was; a poor or unwealthy Aztec would tend to wear less jewelry than an Aztec of higher placing and wealth.\n\nThe jewelry worn by the Mayan, Aztec, and Inca people was rich in variety and quite beautiful. Without metalworking skills, Mayans made jewelry from many other materials. Mayan men wore nose ornaments, earplugs, and lip plugs made of bone, wood, shells, and stones, including jade, topaz, and obsidian. Necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and headgear were made with jaguar and crocodile teeth, jaguar claws, and feathers. Mayan women and children wore less elaborate necklaces and earrings of similar materials.\n\nAztecs and Incas perfected metalworking to a great art. Gold and silver jewelry was worn alongside ornaments made of feathers, shells, leather, and stones. Among the Aztecs, laws about which ornaments could be worn were strictly enforced. Only royalty could wear headdresses with gold and quetzal (a bird with brilliant blue-green feathers that reach three feet in length) feathers, for example. The weaving tradition, so important to Incas, helped create beautiful woven headdresses. Inca emperors wore woven hats trimmed with gold and wool tassels or topped with plumes, or showy feathers. Incas also created elaborate feather decorations for men: headbands made into crowns of feathers, collars around the neck, and chest coverings. In addition, wealthy Inca men wore large gold and silver pendants hung on their chests, disks attached to their hair and shoes, and bands around their arms and wrists. Inca women adorned themselves simply with a metal fastening for their cloak called a tupu. The head of their tupu was decorated with paint or silver, gold, or copper bells.\n\nAll warriors wore loincloths, and basic military armor called ichcahuipilli. When they were recognized by the state for their bravery in battle, their status increased (regardless of original class) and they were rewarded with shell and glass beaded jewelry. If the warrior was more honored or a higher rank, they would wear battle suits called Tlahuiztli; these suits were distinctively decorated for prestigious warriors and members of warrior societies. They served as a way to identify warriors according to their achievements in battle as well as rank, alliance, and social status like priesthood or nobility. Usually made to work as a single piece of clothing with an opening in the back, they covered the entire torso and most of the extremities of a warrior, and offered added protection to the wearer. The tlahuiztli was made with elements of animal hide, leather, and cotton. Warriors were also allowed to wear sandals as they progressed through the ranks.\n"}

The caller will, therefore, generally use easy dances so that everyone can join in.\n\nA barn dance can be a ceilidh, with traditional Irish or Scottish dancing, and people unfamiliar with either format often confuse the two terms. However, a barn dance can also feature square dancing, contra dancing, English country dance, dancing to country and western music, or any other kind of dancing, often with a live band and a caller. Modern western square dance is often confused with barn dancing in Britain.\n\nBarn dances, as social dances, were popular in Ireland until the 1950s, and were typically danced to tunes with 4/4 rhythms.\n\nWLS in Chicago is credited with developing the “barn dance” radio format, which was in large part responsible for the advent of country music in the United States. The National Barn Dance began as a program of old-time fiddling on April 19, 1924, with George D. Hay as the show's host and announcer. A year-and-a-half later, Hay moved to Nashville, Tennessee and brought in an old-time fiddler to launch the \"WSM Barn Dance\"; this show is now known as the Grand Ole Opry and remains on the air to this day. Dozens of similar programs cropped up on AM radio stations all across the United States, from New England to Los Angeles, including the WWVA Jamboree in Wheeling, West Virginia (1933), the Renfro Valley Barn Dance in Kentucky (1939), the Louisiana Hayride (1948), the Tennessee Jamboree (1953) and Ozark Jubilee (1954).

It is there that are formed all the political men of France; it is a veritable training ground for the tribune.\"\nGambetta, like many other French orators, learned the art of public speaking at the Molé.\nAt that time the Molé met in the Café Procope in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie, the oldest coffee house in Paris.\nOther active members during this period included Ernest Picard, Clément Laurier and Léon Renault.\n\nDebating societies flourished in the second half of the 19th century in the absence of political parties.\nOf these, the Conférence Molé, known simply as \"Le Molé\", was the most influential and the most politicized.\nUnder the French Third Republic many members of the Molé became parliamentary leaders, so membership was sought after by aspiring politicians.\nOn 28 April 1876 the Conférence Molé merged with the Conférence Tocqueville, which had been founded in 1863.\n\nThe Conférence Molé-Tocqueville continued to prosper.\nBy 1886 it had 344 members and 376 former members.\nThe society was less active in the 1880s, but experienced a revival in the 1890s when it was stimulated by competition and the introduction of new debating techniques.\nOn 30 April 1897 Félix Faure, President of France, decreed that the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville was an \"establishment of public utility\".\n\nOf the 320 cabinet members from 1871 to 1914, 26 had belonged to the Molé, 6 to the Tocqueville, 10 to the Molé-Tocqueville and 2 to the Bruyère.\n43 ministers, or 13.4%, had belonged to one of these societies.\nOf Paris municipal councilors between 1871 and 1914, 12 had been members of the Molé, 4 of the Tocqueville and 40 of the Molé-Tocqueville.\nÉdouard Hervé had belonged to both the Molé and the Tocqueville before their merger.\nA total of 44 people had thus belonged to one of the societies, or 9.7% of the councilors.\nThese men often played a leading role in the municipal council: 20 were presidents, vice-presidents or secretaries of the council.\n\nIn the period between World War I and World War II, 105 deputies belonged to the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville before being elected.\nAfter World War II the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville resumed its sessions, and had lively debates during the Algerian War.\nIt became moribund in the 1970s.\nA 1989 paper dated the last traces of its existence to 1978.\nThe conference was revived in the 1990s to discuss involvement of civil society in the French economic and social fabric.\n\nEarly members included Louis Wolowski and Édouard Allou, who became president.\nSeveral non-removable Senators belonged to the conferences.\nLawyers included René Bérenger, Louis Buffet, Marc Antoine Calmon, Jules Cazot, Jean Clamageran (president in 1858), Henry Didier, Albert Grévy, Édouard René de Laboulaye and Ernest Picard (president in 1853).\nOther noted members included Philippe Paul de Ségur (1780–1873), James Mayer de Rothschild (1792–1868), Napoleon III (1808–73), Jules Ferry (1832–93), Georges Clemenceau (1841–1929), Pierre de Coubertin (1863–1937), André Citroën (1878–1935), Pierre Taittinger (1887–1965) and Guy Mollet (1905–75).\n\nIn 1846 there were 221 members. \n44 had left the society, so a total of 265 had been or were part of it.\nOf 230 who gave their professions, 138 were advocates or magistrates, 30 in the Council of State, 16 in public office and 11 diplomats.\nOf the 265 members up to 1846, 59 became deputies.\n30 served under one regime, 18 under two regimes and 9 under 3 regimes.\nWerner de Merode and Charles-Pierre-Paul Paulmier were deputies under four regimes: the July Monarchy, French Second Republic, Second French Empire and French Third Republic.\nEight became ministers: Louis Buffet, Charles de Morny, Lionel de Moustier, Auguste de Talhouët-Royt and Adolphe Vuitry under the Second Empire, Louis Decazes, Eugène de Goulard and Pierre Edmond Teisserenc de Bort under the Third Republic.\nJules Grévy was elected president of the Republic in 1879.\n\n"}

The last population census was carried out in 1993, after an initial 1975 census. There was an attempt at a census in 2009, but this attempt ultimately failed due to political instability. Therefore, the demographic situation is inferred but reliability of any estimates from any source has a large margin of error.\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to only 4,084,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 43.1%, 53.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.1% was 65 years or older\n\nStructure of the population (DHS 2013) (males 18,875, females 19,483, total 38,358):\n\nUN medium variant projections:\nRegistration of vital events in Madagascar is not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.\n\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):\n\nFertility data as of 2008-2009 (DHS Program):\n\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\n\nThe island of Madagascar is predominantly populated by people broadly classified as belonging to the Malagasy ethno-linguistic group. This group is further subdivided a number of ethnic groups, often into the standard eighteen.\nIn addition, communities of Indians and Arabs have long been established on the island and have assimilated into local communities to varying degrees, in some places having long since become identified \"Malagasy\" ethnic groups, and in others maintaining distinct identities and cultural separation. More recent arrivals include Europeans and Chinese immigrants.\n\nMadagascar was probably uninhabited prior to Austronesian settlement in the early centuries AD. Austronesian features are most predominant in the central highlands people, the Merina (3 million) and the Betsileo (2 million); the remaining 16 tribal groupings are coastal peoples who are predominantly of East African origin, with various Malay, Arab, European and Indian admixtures. The largest coastal groups are the Betsimisaraka (1,500,000) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (700,000 each). Malagasy society has long been polarized between the politically and economically advantaged highlanders of the central plateaux and the people along the coast. For example, in the 1970s there was widespread opposition among coastal ethnics against the policy of \"Malagasization\" which intended to phase out the use of the French language in public life in favour of a more prominent position for the Malagasy language, whose orthography is based on the Merina dialect. Identity politics were also at the core of the brief civil unrest during 2002.\n\nIndians in Madagascar descend mostly from traders who arrived in the newly independent nation looking for better opportunities. The majority of them came from the west coast of India known as Karana (Muslim) and Banian (Hindu). The majority speak Hindi or Gujarati, although some other Indian dialects are also spoken. the younger generations speak at least three languages, including French, Gujarati and Malagasy. A large number of the Indians in Madagascar have a high level of education, particularly the younger generation.\n\nA sizeable number of Europeans also reside in Madagascar, mostly of French descent.\n\nAccording to the US Department of State in 2011, 41% of Madagascans practice Christianity and 52% practice traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the \"razana\" (ancestors). But according to the Pew Research Center in 2010, only 4.5% of Madagascans practice folk religions and 85% are Christian, with practitioners of Protestantism outnumbering adherents to Roman Catholicism.\n\nMadagascar's traditional religions tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. This spiritual communion is celebrated by the Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of famadihana, or \"turning over the dead\". In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor. In the festivities, they eat, drink, and literally dance with the dead. After one or two days of celebrating, they shower the body with gifts and rebury it.\nMalagasy Christians are mostly Protestant (mainly Reformed Protestant Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (FJKM), Lutheran, and Anglican) or Roman Catholic, but there are also smaller groups such as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, and Eastern Orthodox Christians. Many incorporate the cult of the dead with their other religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may invite a pastor to attend a famadihana. A historical rivalry exists between the predominantly Catholic masses, considered to be underprivileged, and the predominantly Protestant Merina aristocrats, who tend to prevail in the civil service, business, and professions.\nFollowers of Islam constitute approximately 7% of the population, according to the US Department of State in 2011, (down from their earlier estimate of 10 to 15% in 2009), or 3% according to the Pew Research Center in 2010. They are mostly concentrated in the north, northwest, and southeast. There are also a small number of Hindus.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has more than 8.000 members in 33 congregations in Madagascar.\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nSex ratio: \n<br>\"at birth:\"\n1.03 male(s)/female\n<br>\"under 15 years:\"\n1.01 male(s)/female\n<br>\"15–64 years:\"\n0.98 male(s)/female\n<br>\"65 years and over:\"\n0.89 male(s)/female\n<br>\"total population:\"\n0.99 male(s)/female (2000 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\n<br>\"total population:\"\n66.3 years\n<br>\"male:\"\n64.7 years\n<br>\"female:\"\n67.8 years (2017 est.)\n\nNationality:\n<br>\"noun:\"\nMalagasy (singular and plural)\n<br>\"adjective:\"\nMalagasy\n\nEthnic groups:\nMalayo-Indonesian (Merina and related Betsileo), coastal ethnics (mixed African, Malayo-Indonesian, and Arab ancestry – Betsimisaraka, Tsimihety, Antaisaka, Sakalava), French, Desi, Creole, Comorian, Chinese\n\nReligions:\nindigenous beliefs 52%, Christian 41%, Muslim 7%\n\nLanguages:\nMalagasy (official, and national language), French (official).\n\nLiteracy:\n<br>\"definition:\"\nage 15 and over can read and write\n<br>\"total population:\"\n64.7%\n<br>\"male:\"\n66.7%\n<br>\"female:\"\n62.6% (2015 est.)\n\nThe largest city in Madagascar is Antananarivo.

Sometimes it is called Meierijs, after the Bailiwick of Den Bosch.\n\nEast Brabant dialects are further subdivided into the Kempenlands (in a large area east and south east of Eindhoven, including Arendonk and Lommel in Belgium), North Meierijs (in an area south of 's-Hertogenbosch into Eindhoven), Peellands (in Helmond and surroundings), Geldrops and Heeze-and-Leendes.

Some peculiarities are typical eastern and shared with the Limburgish dialects, others only occur locally.\n\nEast Brabantian dialects have been somewhat influenced by the Cologne language expansion of thus have a few characteristics that typically east of nature and which the western variants do not have. Such differences include umlauts in diminutives, and the conjugation of Germanic strong verbs (like in Limburgish). Typical East Brabantian words are therefore \"geleuven\" vs Dutch \"geloven\" (believe), \"bruur\" vs Dutch \"broer\" (brother) and \"zuke\" vs Dutch \"zoeken\" (search). Also diminutives as \"menneke\" vs Dutch \"mannetje\" (little man) and \"jeske\" vs Dutch \"jasje\" (little coat) and conjugations as \"velt\" vs Dutch \"valt\" (falls) are typical East Brabantian.\n\n"}

{"id": "8047823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8047823", "title": "Italian Egyptians", "text": "Italian Egyptians\n\nItalians in Egypt, also referred to as Italian Egyptians, are a community with a history that goes back to Roman times. Perhaps the most famous Italian Egyptian is Yolanda Christina Gigliotti known as Dalida. Diva, famous singer and actress.\n\nThe last Queen of ancient Egypt (Cleopatra) married the Roman Mark Antony bringing her country as \"dowry\", and since then Egypt was part of the Roman Empire for seven centuries. Many people from the Italian peninsula moved to live in Egypt during those centuries: the tombs of Christian Alexandria shows how deep was that presence.\n\nSince then there has been a continuous presence of people (born in the Italian peninsula) and their descendants in Egypt.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Italian communities from the \"Maritime Republics\" of Italy (mainly Pisa, Genova and Amalfi) were present in Egypt as merchants. Since the Renaissance the Republic of Venice has always been present in the history and commerce of Egypt: there was even a \"Venetian Quarter\" in Cairo.\n\nFrom the time of Napoleon I, the Italian community in Alexandria and Egypt started to grow in a huge way: the size of the community had reached around 55,000 just before World War II, forming the second largest immigrant community in Egypt.\n\nThe expansion of the colonial Italian Empire after World War I was directed toward Egypt by Benito Mussolini, in order to control the Suez Canal.\n\nThe Italian \"Duce\" created in the 1930s some sections of the National Fascist Party in Alexandria and Cairo, and many hundreds of Italian Egyptians become members of it. Even some intellectuals, like Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (founder of the Futurism) and the poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, were supporters of the Italian nationalism in their native Alexandria.\n\nAs a consequence, during World War II the British authorities interned in concentration camps nearly 8,000 Italian Egyptians with sympathy for Italian fascism, in order to prevent sabotage when the Italian Army attacked western Egypt in summer 1940.\n\nThe areas of Egypt temporarily conquered by the Kingdom of Italy in the war (like Sallum and Sidi Barrani) were administered by the military.\n\nIndeed, the nationalist organization Misr Al-Fatah (Young Egypt) was deeply influenced by the fascism ideals against the British Empire. The Young Egypt Party was ready to do a revolt in Cairo in summer 1942 if Rommel had conquered Alexandria after a victory at the El Alamein battle.\n\nHowever, like many other foreign communities in Egypt, migration back to Italy and the West reduced the size of the community greatly due to wartime internment and the rise of Nasserist nationalism against Westerners. After the war many members of the Italian community related to the defeated Italian expansion in Egypt were forced to move away, starting a process of reduction and disappearance of the Italian Egyptians.\n\nAfter 1952 the Italian Egyptians were reduced - from the nearly 60,000 of 1940 - to just a few thousands. Most Italian Egyptians returned to Italy during the 1950s and 1960s, although a few Italians continue to live in Alexandria and Cairo. Officially the Italians in Egypt at the end of 2007 were 3,374 (1,980 families).\n\nIn 2007 there were nearly 4,000 Italians in Egypt, mostly technicians and managers working (for a few years) in the 500 Italian companies with contracts with the Egyptian government: just a few hundreds of retired \"real\" Italian Egyptians remain, mainly in Alexandria and Cairo.\n\nItaly's preeminence in its economic relations with Egypt was reflected in the size of its expatriate community. Some of the first educational missions that Egypt sent to Europe under Mohamed Ali were headed to Italy to learn the art of printing.\n\nMohamed Ali also engaged a number of Italian experts to assist in the various tasks of building the modern state: in the exploration of antiquities, the exploration of minerals, in the conquest of Sudan, designing the city of Khartoum and drawing the first survey map of the Nile Delta.\n\nIn addition, Italians featured prominently in the royal court under Ismail, which is perhaps why Italian architects were chosen to design most of Khedive Ismail's palaces, new suburbs of the capital and public buildings.\n\nThe most famous building related to the Italian community was the Royal Opera House, which was to be inaugurated in 1871 with the \"Aida\" by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. The Khedivial Opera House or \"Cairo Royal Opera House\" was the original Opera House in Cairo. It was inaugurated on November 1869 and burned down on October 1971. The opera house was built on the orders of the Khedive Ismail to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal. The Italian Egyptian architects Pietro Avoscani and Mario Rossi designed the building. Pietro Avoscani, before his 1891 death in Alexandria, created even the famous \"Corniche\" of Alexandria.\n\nThe fondness of Egyptian monarchs towards Italy appeared in the number of Italians employed in their courts.\n\nItalian-Egyptian relations were so strong and deemed so important that when the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III abdicated in 1946 after Italy's defeat in World War II, Egyptian King Faruk invited Victor Emmanuel III to live in Alexandria. Victor Emmanuel III died in Alexandria in December 1947 and was buried there, behind the altar of St Catherine's Cathedral.\n\nBefore 1952, Italians formed the second largest expatriate community in Egypt, after the Greeks. The 1882 census of Egypt recorded 18,665 Italians in the country. By 1897 the figure rose to 24,454 and 30 years later to 52,462. Thus, the Italian community increased by 122 per cent in those years.\n\nWriting in Al-Ahram of 19 February 1933, under the headline, \"The Italians in Egypt\", the Italian historian Angelo San Marco wrote, \"The Venetians and the people from Trieste, Dalmatia, Genoa, Pisa, Livorno, Naples and Sicily continued to reside in Egypt long after their native cities fell into decay and lost their status as maritime centres with the decline of the Mediterranean as a major thoroughfare for world trade.\"\n\nElsewhere in the article, San Marco writes that the Italian community in Egypt held monopolies on the goods that were still popular in the East, which included many imports. The majority of the Italian community lived in either Cairo or Alexandria, with 18,575 in the former and 24,280 in the latter, according to the 1928 census.\nItalians tended to live in exclusively Italian neighbourhoods or in neighbourhoods with other foreigners. Perhaps the most famous of these districts in Cairo was known as the \"Venetian Quarter\". Nevertheless, San Marco notes that, in order to avoid harassment, the Italians tended to wear Egyptian dress and follow, as much as possible, Egyptian customs.\n\nThe Italian community in Egypt consisted primarily of a large array of merchants, artisans, professionals and an increasing number of workers. This was because Italy had remained for a long period of time politically and economically weak, which rendered it incapable of competing with the major industries and capitalist investment coming to Egypt from France.\n\nDuring the fascist period there were eight public and six Italian parochial schools. The government schools were supervised by an official committee chaired by the Italian consul and they had a total student enrollment of approximately 1,500. Other schools had student bodies numbering in the hundreds. Italians in Alexandria also had 22 philanthropic societies, among which were the \"National Opera Society\", the \"Society for Disabled War Veterans\", the \"Society of Collectors of Military Insignia\", the \"Italian Club\", the \"Italian Federation for Labour Cooperation\", the \"War Orphans Relief Society\", the \"Mussolini Italian Hospital\" and the \"Dante Alighieri Italian Language Association\". In addition, many Italian-language newspapers were published in Alexandria, the most famous of which was \"L'Oriente\" and \"Il Messaggero Egiziano\".\n\nIndeed, the hundreds of Italian words that have been incorporated into the Egyptian dialect is perhaps the best testimony to the fact that of all the foreign communities residing in Egypt, Italians were the most closely connected to Egyptian society.\n\nSan Marco ventures that the reason for this was that \"our people are noted for their spirit of tolerance, their lack of religious or nationalist chauvinism and, unlike other peoples, their aversion to appearing superior.\"\n\nAll remaining Italian Egyptians speak Italian, while speaking Arabic and English as second language, and are Catholics.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rosemond was born in 1965, in Harlem, New York and grew up in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, in an apartment complex called Vanderveer Gardens. His parents migrated from Haiti in the 1960s. They divorced when he was young, leaving his mother to raise five children alone.\n\nRosemond and several friends founded the music conference \"How Can I Be Down\" in 1992.\n\nIn 2002, Rosemond negotiated the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson boxing match. It was the first time that a boxer demanded that after a million buys on pay-per-view, the boxers would split the purse 50–50 with Showtime Networks/HBO.\n\nIn 2003, Rosemond, along with the artist he managed, joined Russell Simmons in his campaign to end New York's draconian Rockefeller Drug Laws.\n\nRosemond along with Shakim Compere and Mona Scott, executive produced BET's \"SOS Saving Ourselves: Help for Haiti\", a telethon held at Miami's American Airlines Arena on February 5, 2010, to raise money for the devastated victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake that killed over 100,000 people.\n\nCirca 1996, Rosemond founded Henchmen, the company that would later become the rap management company Czar. He was the CEO of Czar, when it managed The Game, Sean Kingston, Brandy, Gucci Mane, Guerilla Black, Salt-n-Pepa and Akon. He was a known figure in the hip hop music industry, described in a 2012 \"The New York Times\" article as \"a prince at the royal court, whose ties to rap music’s biggest stars were known far and wide.\" Rosemond was behind Salt-n-Pepa's \n\"Shoop\" and he was The Game's manager during a feud with 50 Cent when The Game recorded the diss track \"300 Bars and Runnin'\" In 2006, Henchman and 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) settled a lawsuit regarding a DVD that Czar Entertainment released about 50 Cent's namesake, Kelvin \"50 Cent\" Martin, in which interviews with Jackson were alleged to have been inappropriately used. In the settlement, a charity was created with funds going to support Martin and his children.\n\nIn June 2010, he was arrested on charges of cocaine trafficking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Rosemond went on trial in May 2012, represented by Gerald Shargel.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, Rosemond was convicted in Federal District Court in Brooklyn of drug trafficking, obstruction of justice, firearms violations and other financial crimes associated with his position as head of a multi-million-dollar transnational cocaine-selling organization. At trial, it was alleged that Rosemond led the large scale, bi-coastal narcotics-trafficking organization that transported cocaine from Los Angeles, California to the New York metropolitan area. The group, known as the \"Rosemond Organization,\" in turn shipped cash proceeds from the narcotics sales back to Los Angeles using a variety of methods as part of its operation. Millions of dollars in cash and narcotics were sent through Federal Express and United Parcel Service, often covered in mustard to avoid discovery by detection dogs. In the indictment, prosecutors noted that Rosemond made over $11 million a year since 2007 through his drug trafficking scheme.\n\nOn October 25, 2013, Rosemond was sentenced to life imprisonment. As part of his sentence, Rosemond forfeited approximately $14 million in cash and property. United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta E. Lynch said that Rosemond's carefully crafted image as a music mogul was in reality \"a cover for the real Jimmy Rosemond - a thug in a suit.\" Presiding judge John Gleeson remarked that he would have sentenced Rosemond to life even if it were not legally required as his crimes were \"astonishing in their breadth, duration and intensity.\" \n\nOn March 10, 2016, Rosemond filed a habeas corpus appeal seeking a new trial along with a complaint to the U.S. Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility against former U.S. Attorney Todd Kaminsky citing actions taken with regard to securing testimony from the government's lead witness Henry \"Black\" Butler.\n\nIn June 2012, Rosemond was charged with four crimes in connection with the death of G-Unit affiliate Lowell \"Lodi Mack\" Fletcher, including murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder. Rosemond is alleged to have arranged a murder as payback for the alleged assault on his son by Tony Yayo. The trial began on February 10, 2014 in a New York federal court. More than 35 witnesses testified at the trial. Closing arguments finished on March 4, 2014. The jury deliberations resulted in a hung jury on the four counts for both Rosemond and co-defendant Johnson. Rosemond came before a jury again in December 2014 and on December 11 the jury found him guilty on all charges for the murder of Lowell \"Lodi Mack\" Fletcher.\n\nOn March 23, 2015, Rosemond was sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years by Judge Colleen McMahon in his murder-for-hire case.\n\nRosemond has a son, James Rosemond, Jr., with Cynthia Reed of Staten Island.\n\nIn 2008, the \"LA Times\" retracted and apologized for a story which had alleged that Rosemond had been involved in a criminal event. The story was based on documents created by a person convicted of fraud that had been falsely believed to be from an FBI file.\n\nRosemond is profiled in the 2016 documentary series \"\", an investigative look into his life and criminal cases.\n\nHenchman was mentioned by name by Tupac Shakur in his song \"Against All Odds\" on his album \"\", on which Shakur raps \"promise to payback Jimmy Henchman in due time.\" Tupac believed that Henchman was involved in setting up the shooting and robbery of Shakur at the Quad Recording Studios in New York in November 1994. In 2012, a man named Dexter Isaac, serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was indeed orchestrated by Rosemond.\n\nAmerican rapper Rick Ross acknowledges Rosemond as a mentor in his song \"Ghostwriter\" from the album \"Black Market\": \"Remember receiving words of wisdom from Jimmy Henchman I lit a blunt in his honor when he received his sentence.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "24501282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24501282", "title": "Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia", "text": "Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia\n\nJapanese settlement in what now constitutes modern-day Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) dates back to the end of the 19th century, when Japanese traders and explorers settled on the central and eastern Carolines, although earlier contacts can not be completely excluded. After the islands were occupied by Japan in 1914, a large-scale Japanese immigration to them took place in the 1920s and 1930s. The Japanese government encouraged immigration to the islands belonging to the South Pacific Mandate to offset demographic and economic problems facing Japan at that time.\n\nThe earliest immigrants worked as traders, although most of the later settlers worked as fishermen, farmers or conscript labourers. The majority of immigrants settled in Pohnpei and Chuuk, while other islands were home for only a few Japanese. The total Japanese population reached about 100,000 by 1945. The Japanese immigrants in the central and eastern Carolines were Japanese, Okinawans, and a few Koreans. The settlers brought Shinto and Buddhism religions to the islands, although they were not popular with indigenous people. By 1945 the Japanese language replaced Micronesian languages in day-to-day communications.\n\nEthnic relations between the Japanese settlers and civil officers with the Micronesians were initially coordial and intermarriage was encouraged between the Japanese and Micronesians, although relations soured as the Japanese administration implemented policies that favoured the Japanese populace and were insensitive to Micronesian cultural norms. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, virtually all Japanese were repatriated back to Japan. People of mixed Japanese and Micronesian descent were allowed to remain, which most of them chose to do. Many of them assumed leading roles in the political, public and business sectors after World War II, and constitute a large minority within FSM itself. Micronesia began to engage with Japan again in the business and cultural spheres from the 1970s, and established formal diplomatic ties in 1988, two years after Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) became an independent country.\n\nThe first recorded contact between the Japanese and Pacific Islanders (believed to be Micronesians) was reflected in the \"Kokon Chomon Jyu\", when eight men arrived at Okinoshima (an ancient town in modern-day Izu Province) in July 1171. They were described to be tall, having dark-brown and tattooed skin, wearing ornaments as well as having coarse hair. The Japanese served them some millet and sake. When the eight men attempted to take the bows and spears, a fight ensued between the Japanese and the eight men, before the latter left Okinoshima. Japanese contact was also suggested by some anthropologists in the 19th century, and at least one, James McKinney Alexander suggested that Micronesians may have intermarried with Japanese fishermen who were strayed off course and stranded in the islands. In an 1895 study, Alexander noted similarities between the cultural traditions, vocabulary and the pre-Christian beliefs between Pohnpeian and Kosraeans. Studies done by other Japanese anthropologists in the 19th and 20th centuries noted that at least 60 Japanese vessels drifted into the Pacific Ocean between the 17th and 19th centuries and could have made windfalls in the Pacific Islands.\n\nA Japanese corvette, \"Ryujo\" under the command of Enomoto Takeaki stopped by Pohnpei and Kosrae between 1882 and 1883. The entire tenth class of the Japanese naval academy was aboard the ship, and was noted as the first Japanese warship to stop by Micronesian waters. The king of Kosrae accorded the Japanese crew a warm welcome, and personally claimed that the Kosraeans had some Japanese ancestry. Some years later, a Japanese cattle farmer, Shinroku Mizutani from the Bonin Islands visited Pohnpei in 1887 and 1889. In both visits, Mizutani stayed for a few days in the islands before he was chased out by the Spanish.\n\nIn 1890, two Japanese businessmen, Ukichi Taguchi and Tsunenori Suzuki, formed the \"Nanto Shokai\" (South Seas Trading Company) with the aim of developing Japanese commercial interests in Micronesia. They bought a sailing ship, \"Tenyu Maru\" and sailed for Yap in June and befriended a shipwrecked Irish American missionary, Daniel O'Keefe, but set sail for Pohnpei after two days. They set up a small store peddling Japanese wares under strict conditions imposed by the Spanish, and returned to Japan in December because of dwindling funds. The ship was later sold to the Ichiya company which established two trading stations at Chuuk and Pohnpei. More Japanese businessmen arrived in Chuuk in 1892 under the charge of Mizutani and established a store at Chuuk in 1892. A few Japanese, notably Koben Mori, began socialising with the Chuukese and led semi-nomadic lifestyles until 1896 before gaining the protection of Spanish guards. Mori lived with a few Japanese compatriots, and became the resident agent for \"Hiki Shokai\", another Japanese trading company that came to set up a shop at Moen.\n\nThe Japanese businessmen that were based at Moen were repatriated from Micronesia in 1900, a year after Spain ceded its sovereignty to Germany as part of the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899. Only Mori and another Japanese business agent remained behind in Chuuk and Pohnpei, respectively. At the time of German annexation, Mori was serving as the resident agent for a German trading company at that time. Mori lived in isolation until 1907 when the German authorities allowed Japanese trade in Chuuk, and another trading company–\"Murayama Shokai\" established a trading post in Tol. Japanese settlers also started to come in small numbers to Chuuk to engage in farming or fishing activities. The German colonial administration granted the Japanese settlers equal rights with other European settlers in German-mandated territories, considering them citizens of an imperialist power. In official statistics the Japanese were legally classified as \"White\".\n\nThe First World War saw many nations leap to take Germany's overseas possessions for themselves, and Micronesia was no exception. A Japanese warship sailed into Truk Lagoon in October 1914; it was greeted by Japanese settlers living on the nearby islands. The navy set up its regional headquarters at Chuuk and stationed a garrison at Pohnpei until 1922, where the region's administrative capital Kolonia was established under the South Pacific Mandate. When a civilian government was established in March 1922, there were about 150 Japanese living in Pohnpei, which consisted of traders and government officials. Another seventy Japanese immigrated to Pohnpei by 1930, and a few individuals settled in neighbouring Chuuk, Kosrae and Yap. In Chuuk, another hundred Japanese businessmen settled at Toloas by the late 1920s to cater to governmental and business interests. A few elementary schools were set up to serve both the local Japanese and Chuukese populace.\n\nThe majority of the settlers who came before 1930 consisted of Okinawans. A tuna canning factory was set up at Pohnpei in 1930, and Japanese settlers from the Tōhoku region and Hokkaido came in greater numbers after that. Some of them became fishermen, while others organised farming communes. The civilian government persuaded twenty-four families to establish a farming commune at Palikir in 1931, but the settlers faced problems adapting to the tropical climate and bringing their vegetable produce to Kolonia for sale. The civilian government moved in to quickly improve the transport network and electrical supplies throughout Pohnpei. In addition, they granted larger tracts of land to the settlers, and as a result the settlers went into rice cultivation. More settlers followed suit, and an anthropologist, Umesao Tadao reported that the farming settlement in Pohnpei was well established by 1941.\n\nThe Japanese populace at the other islands grew at a slower rate—although less so for Chuuk, and Japanese tend to prefer settling in low-lying areas like Tomil and Tol. Road and electrical infrastructure were built in new towns and hamlets, which were founded or expanded by Japanese settlers. Many towns and hamlets had at least a thousand Japanese inhabitants by 1941. Some conscript and contract labourers from mainland Japan, Okinawa and Korea hired to build naval facilities at Chuuk and Pohnpei contributed to the increasing immigrant population in the central and eastern Carolines. Kolonia and Palikir had the largest Japanese populace after the Marianas and Palau, and the Japanese outnumbered the natives by a thin margin in 1941. Kosrae was populated by no more than a few hundred Japanese throughout the colonial era; a few Japanese policemen were stationed on the island to keep law and order. Japanese and Korean labourers briefly stayed on the island to carry out phosphate mining operations and establish a cotton plantation, but were repatriated back after the plantation failed.\n\nIntermarriage between Japanese men and Micronesian women were encouraged, especially in Pohnpei and Chuuk where there are large Japanese populations. The number of intermarriages between the Japanese and Micronesians were the highest among Okinawan fishermen in the 1930s, many of whom were single men. A sizable community of mixed Japanese–Micronesians by the 1930s, and children of legitimate unions were conscripted into the Japanese military forces. Micronesians and Japanese–Micronesians came under the suspicion of the Kempeitai for sympathies with the Americans, and many reportedly faced harassment as a result. Micronesian islands reverted to military administration in 1943, and the regional headquarters was relocated from Palau to Chuuk. As food supplies ran scarce during the later months of the Second World War, the Japanese military began stealing breadfruit and food supplies from Micronesian farms. The Japanese military avoided Japanese and Japanese–Micronesian families, especially those that wielded political influence within the local community. In Chuuk, land was also confiscated from Micronesians and Japanese–Micronesians to facilitate the construction of new military facilities.\n\nThe Japanese settlers in the central and eastern Carolines were repatriated after the Japanese surrender. The civilians were repatriated first, while the soldiers stayed on as Prisoners of war to carry out repair works to the islands' infrastructure until 1946. Most people of mixed Japanese–Micronesian descent stayed behind and were brought up by their mothers, although a few chose to return to Japan with their fathers. The American military government permitted some thirty-three Japanese and Korean settlers to remain with their families, but this was allowed only under exceptional circumstances. Within the first few years after the war, some former Japanese settlers formed philanthropic organisations to promote public understanding and memory of Japan's colonial legacy in Micronesia. These organisations arranged visitation trips for the former settlers to the Carolines, usually with the purpose of maintaining kinship ties with their Japanese–Micronesian descendants.\n\nJapanese–Micronesians assumed leading positions in the public and private sector, particularly in Chuuk where there is a substantial percentage of Micronesians with Japanese ancestry. Micronesia began to engage with Japan in the business and cultural spheres from the 1970s, and established formal diplomatic ties in 1988, two years after Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) became an independent country. In turn, Japan is one of the key aid providers to Micronesia. Many mixed Japanese–Micronesians sought closer cultural and business ties with Japan, and politicians of Japanese–Micronesian descent—notably Manny Mori—have made publicised visits to their ancestral homelands as well as personal friendship ties with some former Japanese leaders.\n\nA 1998 census conducted by the Japanese foreign affairs ministry showed 141 Japanese nationals residing in the FSM, the majority whom of are expatriate businessmen. Another 2007 census counted a 114 Japanese nationals in the FSM. The Spanish counted fifteen Japanese traders based in Chuuk in 1895, after American missionaries reported the Japanese involvement in smuggling weapons and liquor. An 1899 census counted a total of 30 Japanese nationals, mainly businessmen living in the Caroline Islands, with the majority being located on Pohnpei, Chuuk and Palau. The German authorities chased out most of the businessmen in 1900, leaving only a few Japanese in the Micronesian islands. A few Japanese began settling in the islands in 1907 after the German authorities allowed the Japanese traders to establish their enterprises in Pohnpei and Chuuk. Early Japanese settlers consisted of single men, and official statistics showed a gender imbalance with five Japanese males to one female. Many Japanese men took on Micronesian wives and raised mixed Japanese–Micronesian families.\n\nJapanese arrivals to Micronesia remained modest until the 1920s, following which the islands experienced a quick increase in the number of immigrants, especially in Pohnpei. Immigrants consisted largely of single men in the 1920s, the majority of whom were Okinawan fishermen. The influx of Japanese immigrants to the central and eastern Carolines was not as intense as compared to the Marianas and Japanese settlement in Palau until the early 1930s, and constituted a little more than 10 percent of the total Japanese populace through Micronesia in 1939. In urban areas, Japanese settlers outnumbered Micronesians around the late 1930s. Many Japanese families migrated to the central and eastern Carolines in the 1930s, and by 1935 there were three Japanese males to two females in the islands. More Japanese were brought to the Central and Eastern Carolines during the Second World War, and the Japanese populace outnumbered the native Micronesians in many islands immediately after the Japanese surrender in 1945. The majority of Japanese who were brought to the central and eastern Caroline islands consisted of labourers as well as military personnel, and soon outnumbered both Japanese and Micronesian civilians alike.\n\nThe Japanese population were repatriated back to Japan after the war, but most people of mixed Japanese–Micronesian remained in the islands and constituted a substantial percentage in the islands' population. They became assimilated with the Micronesians, and in all official census they are identified by their Micronesian heritage. In 2001, the director of Japan's Institute for Pacific Studies Izumi Kobayashi estimated that at least 23% of FSM's population was of Japanese ancestry. An official estimate in 2006 puts the number a little below 20%.\n\nJapanese settlers were generally followers of Shinto and Buddhism. In the central and eastern Carolines, religious activities were less widely publicised than in the Marianas or Palau. In towns with a sizeable Japanese populace, the civilian government would fund the construction of at least one public shrine in each town, and in smaller Japanese settlements, community leaders would direct the construction of a small shrine for communal purposes. Two Buddhist temples were also constructed during the Japanese colonial era, one at Dublon in Pohnpei and another in Chuuk.\n\nChristian missionary activities—particularly Protestant—were more commonly seen in the central and eastern Carolines than in the other mandated islands. Four Congregationalist missionaries were sent to the Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1920 and received partial funding from the government. Although Christian missionary activities were intended to cater to the spiritual needs of Micronesians, a few Japanese settlers and government officials also patronised the missionaries. Missionary and church services were suppressed in the late 1930s, but the continued presence of Japanese Christians prompted the civilian government to permit private church services until the Japanese surrender. After the Japanese settlers were repatriated, the Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples were either abandoned or demolished. People of mixed Japanese–Micronesian heritage adopted Christianity in favour of Shinto and Buddhism.\n\nEarly Japanese settlers taught their children to speak Japanese. Some, like traders and settlers with Micronesian wives, learned to speak some Micronesian languages. Japanese replaced the Micronesian languages as the lingua franca for day-to-day communication and administrative purposes for both Japanese and Micronesians. However, regular use of Japanese was discouraged when Micronesia came under United Nations trusteeship, and people of mixed Japanese–Micronesian heritage switched to English and various Micronesian languages. Japan's economic influence has led cultural organisations to promote learning Japanese among FSM citizens. Elementary Japanese had been offered as a foreign language in some schools, notably in the College of Micronesia-FSM.\n\nA few Japanese trading companies established businesses at Chuuk and Pohnpei in the 1890s, and Koben Mori acted as its resident agent, helping to facilitate trade with the islanders. The early Japanese businessmen traded on alcoholic products, explosives and Chinaware. Contraband products like alcohol and weapons were also illegally traded, and the Spanish administration made futile attempts to suppress these activities. The Japanese traders were expelled from Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1900 when the Germans purchased the islands from Spain, but Japanese traders returned to Chuuk in 1907 and set up a trading firm dealing with copra production. After the Japanese annexed Micronesia from Germany in 1914, they gained a monopoly over the shipping routes in all of the mandated islands. The rate of copra production reached twelve thousand tons per year by the 1920s, and had an export value of two million yen. In the late 1920s, an Okinawan fisherman, Tamashiro established a tuna production factory at Wonei. The Japanese government provided incentives for fishermen to open new fishery production factories, and in 1937 there were at least 1500 Okinawans and Japanese who were employed in the fishery industry. Japanese settlers introduced commercial agriculture in Pohnpei and to a smaller extent in Chuuk and Yap. A few Japanese businessmen also set up firms to oversee the plantation of cash crops, including copra, rice and pineapples. They constituted the main exports in the central and eastern Carolines.\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Allied occupation authorities scrapped all organisations pertaining to overseas trade, banking, finance and colonisation, and effectively led to an end of Japanese influence in Micronesia. Trade restrictions were then enforced between Japan and Micronesia in the first two decades after the war, but were gradually removed between 1973 and 1983. Japanese tourists began to visit the islands from the 1960s onwards, and private businesses were allowed to invest in hotel construction and fisheries. Japanese tourists—30 million travel abroad every year—were seen as a possible economic driver for FSM. Sites of historical interests such as the sunken Japanese ships at Chuuk Lagoon received the highest concentration of Japanese visitors.\n\nRacial segregation was practiced from the early days of civilian rule, and policies were enforced to restrict Micronesians in the education, work force, health care benefits and civil service to inferior positions as compared to their Japanese counterparts. The local populace was classified according to ethnicity, with the Japanese at the top of the social strata, followed by the Okinawans, Koreans, with the Micronesians at the bottom, although some scholars argued that the Micronesians were accorded a more privileged position than the Koreans, who were often subjected to abuse by the Japanese authorities. In the education sector, Micronesian children attended public schools (\"logakko\" in Japanese) that emphasised teaching vocational skills, self-discipline and a basic command of Japanese. Japanese, Okinawan and Korean children attended primary schools (\"shogakko\") with lessons that were based on the mainstream Japanese curriculum. Very few Micronesians progressed beyond the elementary level, and those who did usually had family connections with influential Japanese figures. Micronesians were generally accorded lower-ranking jobs, and most were employed as language interpreters, administrative assistants or jobs that required menial labour.\n\nThe Japanese actively discouraged the practice of Micronesian customs and religions, which they viewed as \"primitive\" and \"barbaric\". Christian missionary activity among the Micronesians was encouraged by the civilian government during the interwar period in order to encourage them to adopt modern cultural practices. Japanese cultural practices were actively encouraged; many Micronesians learned to speak Japanese fluently and adopted Japanese manners and customs. On the other hand, many Koreans did not speak Japanese well, and the eagerness of Okinawans to engage in manual labour occasionally motivated Micronesians to criticize the Japanese culture promoted by the Japanese administrators. Japanese cultural influences were the strongest in Chuuk and Pohnpei; in most towns by the 1920s, most Micronesians were dressed in Western or Japanese style-clothing. Micronesians in these two states were also very receptive to promiscuous liaisons between Japanese men and Micronesian women; the first brothels appeared in both states in the 1910s. Separate brothels were established for Japanese and Micronesian men, although women in both types of brothels were mainly Micronesian women.\n\nIn Kosrae and Yap, the Japanese administration had to contend with considerable resistance from the islanders to accept Japanese political and cultural influences. Anti-Japanese sentiment was developed from the early days of Japanese rule in Kosrae, when a Japanese sergeant who was placed in-charge of the island's administrative affairs often threatened the islanders with physical abuse when dealing with conflicts. A Japanese custom frowned upon by Kosraeans was the practice of cremation of the dead. In addition, the administrators' indifference towards nudity clashed with the Christian moral values that the islanders held to. Similarly in Yap, the islanders' negative attitudes towards the Japanese was developed as a result of incidences of cultural insensitivity from the Japanese administrators. In particular, the introduction of Chamorros by the Japanese administration to work as policemen in the island incited racial hatred of Yapese chiefs against the Japanese. As a consequence, few Japanese immigrants chose to settle in Yap or Kosrae.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "698656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=698656", "title": "Karaim language", "text": "Karaim language\n\nThe Karaim language (Crimean dialect: , Trakai dialect: ', traditional Hebrew name ' \"language of the nomads\") is a Turkic language with Hebrew influences, in a similar manner to Yiddish or Judaeo-Spanish. It is spoken by only a few dozen Crimean Karaites (\"\") in Lithuania, Poland and Crimea and Galicia in Ukraine. The three main dialects are those of Crimea, Trakai-Vilnius and Lutsk-Halych all of which are critically endangered. The Lithuanian dialect of Karaim is spoken mainly in the town of Trakai (also known as \"Troki\") by a small community living there since the 14th century.\n\nThere is a chance the language will survive in Trakai as a result of official support and because of its appeal to tourists coming to the Trakai Island Castle, where Crimean Karaites are presented as the castle's ancient defenders.\n\nThe origin of the Karaims living in Crimea is subject to much dispute and inconsistency. Difficulty in reconstructing their history stems from the scarcity of documents pertaining to this population. Most of the known history is gathered from correspondence between the populations of Karaims and other populations in the 17th to 19th centuries (Akhiezer 2003). Furthermore, a large number of documents pertaining to the Crimean population of Karaims were burned during the 1736 Russian invasion of the Tatar Khanate's capital, Bakhchisarai (Akhiezer 2003).\n\nSome scholars say that Karaims in Crimea are descendants of Qaraite merchants who migrated to Crimea from the Byzantine Empire (Schur 1995). In one particular incidence, migration of Qaraites from Istanbul to Crimea is documented following a fire in the Jewish quarter of Constantinople (modern Istanbul) in 1203 (Tsoffar 2006). After the Turco-Mongol invasions, settlement of merchants in Crimea may have been encouraged in the 13th and 14th centuries by the active trade routes from Crimea to China and Central Asia (Schur 1995).\n\nOn the other hand, \"many scholars consider Karaims as descendants of Khazars and, later, Polovtsi tribes\" who converted to Qaraism (IICK 2007). Kevin Alan Brook considered the link to the Khazars as historically inaccurate and implausible while claiming Talmudic Jews (especially Ashkenaz) as the true preservers of the Khazar legacy.\n\nThe third hypothesis says that Karaims are the descendants of Israelite tribes from the time of the first Exile by an Assyrian King (720sBCE). The Karaim scholar Abraham Firkovich collected the documents arguing in favor of this theory before the Russian Tsar. He was of the opinion that Israelites from Assyria had gone into the North Caucasus and from there, with the permission of the Assyrian king into the Crimean peninsula. He also claimed to have found the tombstone of Yitzhak ha-Sangari and his wife who he claimed were Karaims. Whether Firkovich forged some of the tombstone inscriptions and manuscripts is controversial.\n\nRegarding the origin of the Karaims in Lithuania also there is no complete consensus yet between the scholars. According to Lithuanian Karaim tradition they came from Crimea in 1392 when the Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania allied with Tokhtamysh against the White Horde Tatars and relocated 330 Karait families to Lithuania (Schur 1995). Although linguistically sound, and in agreement with the tradition of the Lithuanian Tatars, claiming their origin from the collapsed Golden Horde, some modern historians doubts this assumption. Nevertheless, Karaims settled primarily in Vilnius and Trakai, maintaining their Tatar language; there was also further minor settlement in Biržai, Pasvalys, Naujamiestis and Upytė. Despite a history through the 16th and 17th centuries that included disease, famine, and pogroms, Lithuania was somewhat less affected by such turmoil than the surrounding areas. As a result, the Lithuanian Karaims had a relative sense of stability over those years, and maintained their isolation as a group, keeping their Turkic language rather than abandoning it for the local languages (“Karaim Homepage” 1998).\n\nKaraim is a member of the \"Turkic language\" family, a group of languages of Eurasia spoken by historically nomadic peoples. Within the Turkic family, Karaim is identified as a member of the Kipchak languages, in turn a member of the Western branch of the Turkic language family (Dahl et al. 2001). Within the Western branch, Karaim is a part of the Ponto-Caspian subfamily (Ethnologue 2007). This language subfamily also includes the Crimean Tatar of Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and Karachay-Balkar and Kumyk of Russia. The close relation of Karaim to Kypchak and Crimean Tatar makes sense in light of the beginnings of the Lithuanian Karaim people in Crimea.\n\nOne hypothesis is that Khazar nobility converted to Karaite Judaism in the late 8th or early 9th century and were followed by a portion of the general population. This may also have occurred later, under Mongol rule, during an influx of people from Byzantium (Tütüncü et al. 1998).\n\nAs all Turkic languages, Karaim grammar is characterized by agglutination and vowel harmony. Genetic evidence for the inclusion of the Karaim language in the Turkic language family is undisputed, based on common vocabulary and grammar. Karaim has a historically subject–object–verb word order, extensive suffixing agglutination, the presence of vowel harmony, and a lack of gender or noun classes. Lithuanian Karaim has maintained most of these Turkic features despite its history of more than six hundred years in the environment of the Lithuanian, Russian, and Polish languages.\n\nMost of the religious terminology in the Karaim language is Arabic in etymology, showing the origins of the culture in the Middle East (Zajaczkowski 1961). Arabic and Persian had the earliest influences on the lexicon of Karaim, while later on in its history, the Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish languages made significant contributions to the lexicon of Karaims living in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania.\n\nToday, there are Karaim speakers living in Crimea, Lithuania, Poland, Israel, and the United States. However, there only remain about 200 Karaims in Lithuania, only one quarter of whom are competent speakers of the Karaim language (Csató 2001).\n\nKaraim can be subdivided into three dialects. The now-extinct eastern dialect, known simply as Crimean Karaim, was spoken in Crimea until the early 1900s. The northwestern dialect, also called Trakai, is spoken in Lithuania, mainly in the towns of Trakai and Vilnius. The southwestern dialect, also known as the Lutsk or Halich dialect, spoken in Ukraine, was near-extinct with only six speakers in a single town as of 2001 (Csató 2001). Crimean Karaim is considered to make up the “Eastern group,” while the Trakai and Lutsk dialects comprise the “Western group.”\n\n Throughout its long and complicated history, Karaim has experienced extensive language contact. A past rooted in Mesopotamia and persisting connections to the Arab world resulted in Arabic words which likely carried over via the migration of Qaraites from Mesopotamia. The Karaim language was spoken in Crimea during the rule of the Ottoman Empire, so there is also a significant history of contact with Turkish, a distant relative in the Turkic language family. Finally, Karaim coexisted with Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian as a minority language in the other areas to which it dispersed where Karaims lived and had to speak the dominant majority languages.\n\nKaraim speakers show a strong tendency towards code-copying (Csató 2001). Code-copying differs from code-switching in that speakers don’t just switch from one language to another, but actually transfer lexical items and grammatical features from one language to another in processes that may be only for single instances, or that may have much more lasting effects on language typology (Csató 2001). Extensive code-copying is indicative both of the ever-shrinking population of Karaim speakers (leading to an insufficient Karaim lexicon and a high frequency of borrowing from Russian, Polish, and Slavonic languages) and of the high level of language contact in the regions where Karaim is spoken.\n\nDue to the very small number of speakers of Karaim and the high level of multilingualism in Lithuania in general, there is also a high level of multilingualism among Karaim speakers. Karaim speakers also communicate with the dominant languages of their respective regions, including Lithuanian, Polish, and Russian. Some also have religious knowledge of Hebrew (Csató 2001). Multilingualism is a necessity for Karaim speakers, because without other languages the majority would not even be able to communicate with members of their own family (Csató 2001).\n\nMost dialects of Karaim are now extinct. Maintenance of the Karaim language in Lithuania is now endangered due to the dispersal of Karaim speakers under the Soviet regime in the aftermath of World War II and the very small number and old age of fluent speakers remaining (Csató 2001). Children and grandchildren of Karaim speakers speak Lithuanian, Polish, or Russian, and only the oldest generation still speaks Karaim.\n\nWhile most languages of the Turkic family exhibit palatal vowel harmony, Trakai Karaim shows harmony in palatalization of consonants. Thus, in any given word, only palatalized or only non-palatalized consonants can be found (Németh 2003). Palatalized consonants occur in the presence of front vowels, and non-palatalized consonants occur in the presence of back vowels. Similarly to most Turkic languages, virtually all of the consonants in Karaim exist in both a palatalized and a non-palatalized form, which may be further evidence of their genetic relationship (Hansson 2007). However, care must be taken in assuming as much, because Karaim has been in contact with the Lipka Tatar language in Lithuania for hundreds of years.\n\nKaraim also exhibits vowel harmony, whereby suffix vowels harmonize for front or back quality with the vowels in the stem of a word (Zajaczkowski 1961).\n\nKaraim morphology is suffixing and highly agglutinating. The Karaim language lacks prefixes but uses post-positions. Nouns are inflected for seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, locative, and instrumental, which is rare in other Turkic languages). A notable feature of verb conjugation in Karaim is the possibility of abbreviated forms, as shown below for the verb [ał], “to take” (Németh 2003):\n\nHistorically, Karaim had a typically Turkic SOV word order. However, it appears to have acquired somewhat free word order due to extensive language contact situations, and currently has a preference for SVO constructions (Csató 2001). Due to the agglutinative nature of Karaim morphology, pronominal subjects are frequently dropped as the same information is already represented in the inflection of the main verb. Karaim is head-final and uses postpositions.\n\nKaraim syntax exhibits multiple instances of code-copying, whereby Karaim merges with syntactic properties of other languages in its area due to strong language contact situations. The impact of such language contact is also evident in the Karaim lexicon, which has extensive borrowing (Zajaczkowski 1961). In more modern times, the significant borrowing is also representative of insufficiencies in the lexicon.\n\nThe traditional script of the Karaites on the Hebrew alphabet was used till the 20th century. In many Karaite families still stored is written in the Hebrew letter handwritten collection of texts of diverse content, referred to as \"miedžuma\". Throughout the 20th century, the Karaite communities also used various modifications of Latin (Yañalif, Lithuanian and Polish alphabets) and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\n\"Romanized alphabet of the Karaites of Crimea (Yañalif)\"\nIn Lithuania and Poland, a modified Latin alphabet is used to write in Karaim, while in Crimea and Ukraine, it \"was\" written using Cyrillic script. From the 17th century up until the 19th century, Hebrew letters were used.\n\n\"The Cyrillic alphabet of the Karaites of the Crimea\"\n\n\"The Latinized alphabet of the Karaites of Lithuania\"\n\n4.

The baronies of Lune in Meath, and Leyney in Sligo, were called after them. According to Lambert McKenna (pp.xvi-xvii):\n\n\"\"[They] probably acquired their land in Connacht as a reward for military service rendered to the tribes which had victoriously invaded that part of the country. Their migration ... and their settlement in Connacht are constantly referred to in the poems of this book\" (see The Book of O'Hara) \"and are the chief subject of the story of the Battle of Crionna; it evidently remained a very lively tradition among them even down to late times.\"\"\n\nAccording to this story, the Luighne accompanied Tadhg mac Cian, who \"The genealogists brought Tadc and his descendants from Éli in northern Munster, but since we find the Luigni and Gailenga closely associated as neighbours and allies in Connacht ... there is reason to agree with MacNeill that they were vassal tribes of fighting men whom the Connachta and Ui Neill ... planted on the lands they had conquered\" (IKHK, p. 69)\n\nOf the original Brega-based tribes called Gailenga, Luigni, Saitne, Delbhna, Ciannachta, Francis John Byrne goes on to say: \"the Brega peoples of that name ... extending as they did in a group of tribal kingdoms from Glasnevin to Lough Ramor in Cavan, give the impression of a remarkably homogeneous body. They are so closely connected that in the later period before the Norman invasion we find that the kingship of the various tribes seem to have been interchangeable. They form a striking contrast to the population of Mide... But the Boyne valley had been an area of settled culture since Neolithic times, so that it is likely that a basic unity persisted under the superstructures of succeeding conquests.\" (IKHK, p. 69) Members of these population-groups were able to exploit the political weakness of the Clann Cholmáin during the 11th and 12th centuries and become Kings of Brega after centuries of subordination.\n\nThe early Connachta had close alliances with the Luighne, Gailenga, Grecraige and Corca Fhir Trí, all of whom were found in close association with Connachta territory west of the Shannon. (\"It was probably not until the end of the 6th century that the name Connachta was restricted to those of the dynastic group who remained in the west: the Uí Fiachrach, Uí Briúin and Uí Ailello.\" IKHK, p. 231).\n\nIn Connacht, the Luighne and neighbouring tribes were classed as \"Fortuatha\" (\"kingdoms not ruled directly by members of the dominant dynasty of a province\", IKHK, p. 45), meaning \"external\" or \"alien\" tribes. Byrne notes that the Luighne dominated smaller, minor tribes (including the likes of the Calraige, Grecraige and Corca Fhir Trí), \"and have some claim to be considered an over-kingdom, as was recognised in the 12th century when their lands were erected into the diocese of Achonry.\"\n\nMcKenna (p.xvii) writes \"\"Less common that \"Luighne\" there is \"Luighne Connacht\", the use of which is puzzling. sometime it appears to be synonymous with \"Luighne\". ... On the other hand, \"Luighne Connacht\" is often used to denote a folk distinct from \"Luighne\".\"' In Rawlinson B 502 ... we find a separate \"genealogy of Luighne Connacht\" breaking off from the main Luighne line somewhere in the 8th century, and descending from Ceannfhaoloadh brother of Flaithgheas. (see Genealogy, below).\n\n Ailill Aulom\n\nAn Teora Sloinnte Luighne (\"the three Luighne\") appear to have been the clans of Ó hEaghra, Ó Gadhra and Ó Dobhailen; the latter descend from Dobhailen mac Gormghus, noted on his death in 885 as \"king of Luighne Connacht\". Dobhailen is explicitly listed as of the Corca Fhir Trí, so his people, originally themselves thought to be subject to the Luighne, had come to rank as one of Luighne's ruling dynasties.\n\nMcKenna further states (p.xviii-xix): \"In their many entries the Annals use the word Gaileanga to indicate sometimes a people but more often, especially in their later ones, a district, i.e., the district afterwards known as the barony of Gallen. In 993, the Lord of Gaileanga is said to be Ua Gadhra. Hence it would appear probable that the territory afterwards called Gallen was at first ruled by its Gaileanga princes, and that towards the end of the 10th century it came under the power of the chieftains of Luighne, chiefly that of the Í Ghadhra, who ruled it till the early 13th century when they were thrust aside by the Jordans; it is often afterwards referred to as Mac Jordan's country.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The term is Malay for \"Original People\", used to refer to the aboriginals of Sabah, Sarawak, and Malays. These groups are given the Bumiputera status in Malaysia.\n\nThe Orang Asal in Peninsular Malaysia are collectively known as the Orang Asli, and are minorities on the Peninsula, whereas the Orang Asal of East Malaysia form a majority of the population.\n\nThe term \"Orang Asal\" means \"Original People\". It was originally used by Communist insurgents in the Malayan Emergency in order to gain the support of these tribal groups.\n\nOrang Asal are officially Bumiputera, which grants them special privileges in Malaysian society as accorded in the Constitution of Malaysia. However, their societies remain marginalised, and they have been labelled as \"second-class Bumiputra's\" in contrast with the ethnic Malays. An ongoing issue is in regards to land, which is often taken for development purposes. This has caused many issues, including court cases and divisions between federal and state governments. In addition, illegal logging often occurs on what is considered traditional land of the Orang Asal. Issues have also occurred in relation to immigration, with immigrants often given identity cards ahead of the Orang Asal. In addition, many have also been pressed to assimilate into mainstream culture and convert to Islam. Orang Asal are often moved in response to development; the incomplete Bakun Dam in Sarawak has forced 11,000 to move.\n\nOrang Asal are located throughout Malaysia, making up 11% of the population, about 2.1 million people. Orang Asal is an overarching term, encompassing all indigenous people on both Peninsula and East Malaysia.\n\nThose on the Peninsula are known more specifically as the Orang Asli; they number around 149,500 and make up only 0.7% of the total Malaysian population. They are officially 19 ethnic subgroups, classed as either Negrito, Senoi, or Proto-Malay.\n\nSome numbers differ, but East Malaysia contains a total of about 64 indigenous groups, around 39 in Sabah and 25 in Sarawak. The Orang Asal make up 60% of Sabah's population, and 50% of Sarawak's population. Sabah's population is hugely diverse, with over 50 languages and 80 dialects spoken. The largest group on Sarawak is the Iban.\n\nThe Orang Asal have their own religions and customs, as well as unique languages. The languages spoken are generally from the Austronesian and Austroasiatic language families. The languages of the peninsula can be grouped into Negrito, Senoi, and Malayic, which together can be divided into about 18 subgroups. However, all these languages are in danger of being lost as the children in the tribes learn Malay and English. The primary languages in East Malaysia are Kadazan-Dusun and Iban, both used by many indigenous groups. In contrast to the indigenous languages of the peninsula, these languages are commonly used in everyday life.\n\nIn the peninsula each subgroup is culturally distinct from the others, with lifestyles varying from fishermen to farmers to hunter-gatherers. Although many are now settled due to the intrusion of modern life, some remain semi-nomadic.\n\nThe people of Sabah are traditionally subsistence farmers, although nowadays they are becoming more involved in local government. Many Orang Asal in Sarawak subsist on rice, supplementing the meal with hunting. Some also remain semi-nomadic. The Orang Asal of East Malaysia are known for their artwork such as wooden masks.\n"}

However, that victory was upset in 1919 when Los Angeles County bowed to public pressure and used the courts to condemn the right-of-way and begin construction of a road. Mrs. Rindge continued the fight in court, and to resist survey and construction work, but merely delayed the road. Overcoming all of May Rindge's objections, the County Road through Malibu Ranch was finally opened for the public on November 3, 1921.\n\n\n\n"}

They initiated the construction of 19 mountain huts, an extensive network of paths through the mountains and training for mountain guides. After the end of the First World War, the annexation of South Tyrol by Italy and the coming into power of the fascists, the South Tyrolean sections were disappropriated and banned in 1923 (see Italianization of South Tyrol). After the end of the Second World War, on December 31, 1945, the military administration of the Allies permitted the foundation of the South Tyrol Alpine Club. Its inaugural meeting took place in Bolzano on 14 June 1946.\n\nNowadays, the AVS takes care of more than 9,500 km of hiking trails and is involved in nature conservancy and South Tyrolean cultural issues as well. The club is a member of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme and the Club Arc Alpin. In 2007, the AVS finished its project to digitalise all hiking trails in South Tyrol.\n\n\n"}

Stunt casting can take many forms, ranging from a celebrity or famous non-actor cameo appearance to the use of an actor's real-life relatives to play the corresponding fictional character's relatives or younger or older versions of the same character.\n\nStunt casting is used to generate media attention. It may also be employed in order to garner studio support or financing for a project; for example, according to DVD featurette commentary, the 1978 version of \"Superman\" received studio support only after the producers were able to enlist A-list actors Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman to appear.\n\n"}

In his last years he lived in the \"Gazteluene\" baserri in Altza. \n\nDue to an accident he suffered in Goizueta in May 1936, on June 3 of the same year he died in the \"Gazteluene\" baserri, in Altza.\n\nAlthough he was heir to the baserri, he left the farm and started working as bricklayer. He began his career as a bertsolari aged 14, being in the company of bertsolaris much older than himself. He stood out by his sharp wit and agile tongue, and his witticisms left a lasting memory.\n\nMany of his bertsos deal with social issues, and the thoughts and feelings of the lower classes. As Antonio Zavala was told, many people sought out Txirrita to ask him to compose a bertso against other people. The subject of many of these bertsos was that of unrequited love. Txirrita composed his bertsos on the subject required and his nephew would write them down, later putting them into print, and after selling them on the fairs. \n\nThanks to collective memory and collectors of bertso-papers like Antonio Zavala, many of these bertsos were recorded. Txirrita became the prototypical bertsolari - an old bachelor, reveller and rogue. Although he was a skillful bricklayer, he didn't enjoy work, and at every opportunity he would seek out a tavern to drink, sing bertsos or bet. Txirrita was unschooled and although he could read, he could not write, and he would dictate bertsos to his nephew.\n\nIn 1935 he was the runner-up in the first bertsolari championship of the Basque Country, and the year after won the championship.\n\nIn Bilbao, Hernani and Altza three streets bear his name. In Errenteria there is an industrial park called Txirrita-Maleo, named after its location between the farmhouses of Txirrita and Maleo.\n"}

In Eswatini, tens of thousands of unmarried and childless Swazi girls and women travel from the various chiefdoms to the Ludzidzini Royal Village to participate in the eight-day event. The young, unmarried girls were placed in female age-regiments; girls who had fallen pregnant outside wedlock had their families fined a cow. \n\nUmhlanga was created in the 1940s in Eswatini under the rule of Sobhuza II, and is an adaptation of the much older Umcwasho ceremony. The reed dance continues to be practised today in Eswatini. In South Africa, the reed dance was introduced in 1991 by Goodwill Zwelithini, the current King of the Zulus. The dance in South Africa takes place in Nongoma, a royal \"kraal\" of the Zulu king.\n\nIn South Africa, the ceremony is known as Umkhosi woMhlanga, and takes place every year in September at the Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal. The girls come from all parts of Zululand, and in recent years there are also smaller groups from Eswatini, as well as more distant places such as Botswana and Pondoland. \n\nAll girls are required to undergo a virginity test before they are allowed to participate in a royal dance. In recent years the testing practice has been met with some opposition.\n\nThe girls wear traditional attire, including beadwork, and \"izigege\" and \"izinculuba\" that show their bottoms. They also wear anklets, bracelets, necklaces, and colourful sashes. Each sash has appendages of a different colour, which denote whether or not the girl is betrothed.\n\nAs part of the ceremony, the young women dance bare-breasted for their king, and each maiden carries a long reed, which is then deposited as they approach the king. The girls take care to choose only the longest and strongest reeds, and then carry them towering above their heads in a slow procession up the hill to Enyokeni Palace. The procession is led by the chief Zulu princess, who takes a prominent role throughout the festival. If the reed should break before the girl reaches that point, it is considered a sign that the girl has already been sexually active.\n\nThe ceremony was reintroduced by King Goodwill Zwelethini in 1991, as a means to encourage young Zulu girls to delay sexual activity until marriage, and thus limit the possibility of HIV transmission. In 2007, about 30,000 girls took part to the event. The organisers of the ceremony have occasionally enforced strict rules on photographers, as some of them have been accused of publishing pictures of the rites on pornographic websites.\n\nIn past years, the event was attended by former President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma (himself a Zulu), and former Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Zweli Mkhize.\n\nIn Eswatini, girls begin the rite by gathering at the Queen Mother's royal village, which currently is Ludzidzini Royal Village. After arriving at the Queen Mother's royal residence, the women disperse the following night to surrounding areas and cut tall reeds. The following night, they bundle the reeds together and bring them back to the Queen Mother to be used in repairing holes in the reed windscreen surrounding the royal village. \n\nAfter a day of rest and washing, the women prepare their traditional costumes consisting of a bead necklace, rattling anklets made from cocoons, a sash, and skirt. Many of them carry the bush knives, which they had earlier used to cut the reeds, as symbols of their virginity.\n\nThe women sing and dance as they parade in front of the royal family as well as a crowd of dignitaries, spectators, and tourists. After the parade, groups from select villages take to the centre of the field and put on a special performance for the crowd. The King's many daughters and royal princesses also participate in the reed dance ceremony and are distinguished by the crown of red feathers they wear in their hair.\n\nThe present form of the Reed Dance developed in the 1940s from the Umcwasho custom, where young girls were placed in age regiments to ensure their virginity. Once they had reached marriageable age, they would perform labour for the Queen Mother followed by dancing and a feast. The official purpose of the annual ceremony is to preserve the women's chastity, provide tribute labour for the Queen Mother, and produce solidarity among the women through working together.\n\nThe reed dance videos were once classified as age-restricted content by Youtube, which angered the users who had uploaded them. This included Lazi Dlamini, the head of TV Yabantu, an online video production company that aims to produce content that “protects, preserves and restores African values”. Working with more than 200 cultural groupings across the country and in neighbouring Eswatini, Dlamini organised a series of protests against Google to force them to rethink their position. At last, YouTube apologized, and allowed the showing of bonafide African traditional videos , - \"Google says it has lifted the restriction on the videos that were age-restricted as it is not its policy to restrict nudity in such instances where it is culturally or traditionally appropriate.”.\n\n"}

It became recognised as an island only in September 2005, by US explorer Dennis Schmitt. It was attached to the mainland of Liverpool Land by glacial ice even in 2002, when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area, so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland. Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of global warming. The island has three large peninsulas, and thus resembles the letter W, or the Chinese character 山 .\n\nPatrick Michaels, a climatologist and prominent global warming skeptic, created a controversy over the history of Warming Island in a post on his website, World Climate Report, in which he argued that the island had been previously uncovered in the 1950s toward the end of a brief warm period in Greenland.\n\nDespite a general lack of suitably detailed maps, Michaels found a map published by Ernst Hofer, a photographer who did aerial surveys of the area in the early 1950s, which showed the Warming Island landmass unconnected to Greenland. Michaels concluded therefore that Warming Island was also a separate island when observed by Hofer in the 1950s, and more broadly that Warming Island is an example of unjustified concern about the future outcomes of global warming.\n\nDennis Schmitt countered Michaels' theory in an article by New York Times reporter Andy Revkin, contending that Hofer's map is inaccurate. Citing discrepancies such as the absence on Hofer's map of nearby Reynolds Island, he suggested that the discrepant features are consistent with an aerial view of the area when covered with fog, which has often obscured low-lying areas like Reynold's Island and the ice-bridge connecting Warming Island to the Greenlandic mainland. He further observed, \"I see by the markings of the 1957 document that it is to be construed as indeed only schematic, that it is explicitly incomplete.\"\n\nMichaels explained that Hofer included the map in his book \"so as to place his pictures and stories in context.\"\n\nNo photographic evidence is available that would resolve the issue.\n\nThe island was also part of a 2011 controversy when it was included in the \"Times Atlas of the World\", along with a revised depiction of the Greenland ice sheet that showed a 15% reduction. After being alerted through the media, the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the atlas editors must have used a 2001 map showing only the thickest segment of the ice sheet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57781595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57781595", "title": "Vietnam War body count controversy", "text": "Vietnam War body count controversy\n\nThe Vietnam War body count controversy centers on the counting of enemy dead by the US forces during the Vietnam War with issues around killing and counting unarmed civilians as enemy combatants as well as inflating the number of actual enemy KIA. For search and destroy operations, as the objective was not to hold territory or secure populations victory was assessed by having a higher enemy body count.\n\nSince the goal of the United States in the Vietnam War was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically \"held\" already. Instead, the US Army used body counts to show that the US was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Viet Cong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) would lose after the attrition warfare.\n\nAccording to historian Christian Appy, \"search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress\" in General Westmoreland’s war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the VC out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. Since the early stages of the war did not seek to hold territory, assessments of whether an operation was considered a victory or not was entirely based on having a higher enemy killed ratio for US commanders. Competitions were held between units for the highest number of VC/PAVN killed in action, or KIAs. Army and marine officers knew that promotions were largely based on confirmed kills. The pressure to produce confirmed kills resulted in massive fraud. One study revealed that 61% of American commanders considered that body counts were grossly exaggerated.\n\nIt was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN operations were miscounted as \"enemy KIA\" as when free-fire zones were declared it was erroneously assumed all individuals were enemy combatants For official US military operations reports, there are no distinctions between enemy KIA and civilian KIA since it was assumed by US forces that an area declared a free-fire zone that all individuals killed regardless of whether they were combatants or civilians were considered enemy KIA. Since body counts was a direct measure of operational success this often caused US battle reports to list civilians killed as enemy KIA. The inclusion of civilians killed led to the enormous discrepancy between weapons seized and 'enemy KIA' during Operation Speedy Express, nearly 10,000 KIA with just 748 weapons found. Most of the enemy killed included were unarmed civilians. The My Lai Massacre and Son Thang massacre both reported women and children killed as \"enemy combatants\".\n\nFormer Marine Officer and later war-time corresponding Philip Caputo in the book A Rumor of War noted:\"General Westmoreland’s strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior. Our mission was not to win terrain or seize positions, but simply to kill: to kill communists and as many of them as possible. Stack ’em like cordwood. Victory was a high body-count, defeat a low kill-ratio, war a matter of arithmetic. The pressure on unit commanders to produce enemy corpses was intense, and they in turn communicated it to their troops. This led to such practices as counting civilians as Viet Cong. ‘If it’s dead and Vietnamese, it’s VC,’ was our rule of thumb in the bush. It is not surprising, therefore, that some men acquired a contempt for human life and predilection for taking it.\"Christian Appy in \"Working Class War\" documents widespread atrocities committed by US forces, especially towards the latter 'withdrawal' period as well. Accidental or deliberate killings through napalming, artillery and others were reported to have frequently either been re-attributed to the PAVN/VC or claimed as \"VC\" casualties by US forces. Other reported incidents include the ambushing or attacking unarmed groups of men such as fishermen or farmers which were reported as \"Viet Cong\" as well as any civilians wearing black pajamas and civilians running away from helicopters, including women and children who were again reported as \"enemy combatants\" KIA. One notable example of this was the purported killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians by Tiger Force, following grievous losses from a PAVN ambush, in which the unit proceeded to kill countless women, children and crippled individuals during Operation Wheeler/Wallowa. Journalist Jonathan Schell who reported on Operation Cedar Falls observed the general inability of US forces to discern VC from unarmed civilians during, based on tacit ignorance of the culture and the murder of civilians on whim or suspicion, for example in which a man riding a bicycle past a patrol near his town was shot and subsequently declared a VC, and the shooting of a woman carrying medical supplies, who was then declared an enemy combatant serving as a medic post-mortem.\n\nIn the summer of 1970, H. Norman Schwarzkopf writes, \"the Army War College issued a scathing report,\" that, among other things, \"criticised the Army's obsession with meaningless statistics and was especially damning on the subject of body counts in Vietnam. A young captain had told the investigators a sickening story: he'd been under so much pressure from headquarters to boost his numbers that he'd nearly gotten into a fistfight with a South Vietnamese officer over whose unit would take credit for various enemy body parts. Many officers admitted they had simply inflated their reports to placate headquarters.\"\n\nThe junior officers queried in the 1970 \"Study on Military Professionalism\" (seemingly the study that Schwarzkopf refers to) had particularly violent reactions to instructions on the body count. \"They told of being given quotas and being told to go out and recount until they had sufficient numbers. “Nobody out there believes the body count,” was the reportedly common response.\"\n\nIn Lewis Sorley's book \"A Better War\", published in 1999 after studies of voluminous previously-secret papers of Creighton Abrams, he writes \"Body count may have been the most corrupt - and corrupting - measure of progress in the whole mess. Certainly the consensus of senior Army leaders, the generals who commanded in Vietnam, strongly indicates that it was. A survey found that sixty-one percent of officers believed that the body count was often inflated. Typical comments by the respondents were that it was \"a fake - totally worthless,\" that \"the immensity of the false reporting is a blot on the honor of the Army,\" and that they were grossly exaggerated by many units primarily because of the incredible interest shown by people like McNamara and Westmoreland.\" \n\nSecretary of Defense Charles Hagel states that U.S. commanders on the ground inflated body counts since this was how their success was judged.\"You used that body count, commanding officers did, as the metric and measurement of how successful you were...\", hence providing a positive incentive for deliberate fabrication. During the Battle of Dak To and the Battle of the Slopes, one company commander alleges after losing 78 men while finding 10 enemy bodies, the \"enemy body count\" figures was deliberately re-written as 475 by General William Westmoreland and released as official operational reports.\n\nShelby Stanton states that accurate assessments of PAVN and VC losses were largely impossible due to lack of corresponding statistics, the fact that allied ground units were often unable to confirm artillery and aerial kills and gamesmanship practised by units under pressure to \"produce results.\" American losses were subject to statistical manipulation as well. For instance, dying soldiers put aboard medical evacuation helicopters were often counted as only wounded in unit after-action tables.\n\nAuthor Mark Woodruff states that when the Vietnamese Government released its actual losses in April 1995 as being 1.1 million dead, US body count figures he claimed they had actually underestimated communist losses.\n\nThe Vietnamese government reported 849,000 military deaths during the war for the period between 1955 and 1975, of which 1/3 were non-combat deaths, (it is unclear whether or not this figure includes the 300-330,000 PAVN/VC soldiers missing in the war), while 58,220 Americans and about 313,000 South Vietnamese combatants died in the conflict. The official US Department of Defense figure was 950,765 communist forces killed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1974. Defense Department officials believed that these body count figures need to be deflated by 30 percent.\n\nLewis Sorley in \"A Better War\" cites Douglas Pike with a figure of 900,000 PAVN/VC dead by 1973 and states that during a 1974 visit by Admiral Elmo Zumwalt to North Vietnam, PAVN General Võ Nguyên Giáp advised Zumwalt that the North had 330,000 missing. Jim Webb claims that the Vietnamese lost over 1.1m soldiers. Geoffrey Ward and Ken Burns in the book \"The Vietnam War\" state over a million casualties were reported as well.\n"}

She kept her origins a well-guarded secret, as she once threatened to kill a lover if he ever disclosed her family's location. Researchers interested in her case have most often been led to dead ends in the difficult search for Chase's origin. The historical record for Chase only begins in 1920, when the January 1920 United States Census reported eighteen-year-old Vivian Davis was living single in Kansas City, Missouri at 706 E. 14th Street. Her occupation was listed as waitress in a restaurant and her parents were listed as natives to Missouri, although she was not living with them. Another solid historical document discovered for Chase is her marriage certificate with George M. Chase. On April 1, 1921, 19-year-old Vivian Davis married George M. Chase also of Kansas City, Mo. Chase has often been confused with Vivian Grace Davis of Springfield, Missouri, who died on February 5, 1920, or with Albert and Sarah Davis, but it has been proven that they are not the same person.\n\nChase first gained notice as George's wife on December 23, 1923, when he was arrested for an altercation during which he was shot by Ella Keller. Keller stated that George and his companions attacked her because she had reported them to the police and that she had to shoot George in self-defense. After arresting George, the police went to his home, where they found Chase wearing six diamond rings. Chase was arrested for suspicion when she could not explain her possession of the multiple rings. She was released after three days when further evidence could not be found against her.\n\nChase did not surface in public records again until three years later, when she was in the company of Charlie Mayes, also known as Pighead Hardman. On February 15, 1926, Chase, Mayes, and Lee Flournoy and his wife were arrested after a free-for-all fight in a rooming house in Wichita, Kansas. During the arrest, Chase refused to talk. The investigation led investigators to her brother-in-law Charles Chase and allegations of involvement with the Joe Bratton liquor gang. On June 9, 1926, following a \"drunken party and joy ride\", Flournoy and Mayes were fatally shot in a gun battle in Picher, Oklahoma during which Chase was present. The three of them had been under surveillance by Ottawa County, Oklahoma officers for several days because the deputy sheriff had informed the Sheriff of Montgomery County, Kansas that he had found the suspects who robbed the Cherryvale Bank on May 29, 1926. Chase was placed in jail, where she refused to face reporters. She was released on June 13, 1926, after insufficient evidence was found to charge her with a crime.\n\nThe record once again went silent on Chase until she resurfaced in June 1932. She was arrested with Jackie Forman and Enos Weeks for the robbery of the First National Bank in North Kansas City on April 9, 1932. She was held on $50,000 bond. It was a small robbery; no more than $1,500 was taken. Chase was held at the Clay County Jail in Liberty, Missouri and escaped after four months by sawing through the bars of her cell and lowering herself down with a rope made of bed sheets.\n\nAfter her escape from the Liberty jail, Chase fled to St. Louis, Missouri, where she became involved with Walter (Irish) O'Malley. On July 10, 1933, she participated in the kidnapping of banker August Luer. Chase, O'Malley, and Percy 'Dice Box' Fitzgerald drove to Mr. Luer's home in Alton, Illinois. Chase, accompanied by O'Malley, rang the doorbell and requested to use the phone. When she was let in and shown the phone's location, she cut the line. O'Malley wrestled August Luer to the floor and gagged his mouth. Luer was taken to a farm where he was hidden in a damp underground cellar while his captors tried to collect a ransom for him. Luer was not a well man, and fearing that he would die before they were able to receive any ransom, his kidnappers released him after 123 hours. Both Chase and O'Malley fled from Illinois back to Missouri after the bungled kidnapping. Chase eluded capture, but O'Malley only managed to do so for two years until he was apprehended in Kansas City on May 23, 1935.\n\nIn the early fall of 1935, Kansas City, Missouri experienced a series of drug store robberies. The robbers were described as a man and a woman. The woman was further described as approximately 5 ft. 6 in. tall, slender, with hennaed hair. When victims were shown a photograph, they identified Chase as the female robber.\n\nOn November 3, 1935, Chase's body was found in a parked car at Saint Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, MO. She had been shot in the neck with a .45 caliber gun, the bullet exiting through her chest. When she was found, the coroner estimated that she had only been dead 2 hours or less, leading to speculation that her killer drove her to the hospital while she was still alive, expecting her to be found before her death. She had a .22 caliber pistol on her person, with .45 caliber bullets in her handbag. Newspapers speculated that she had been double-crossed by an accomplice and was shot before she could shoot her assailant.\n\nChase seemed destined for burial in a potter's field. The owner of the funeral home to where she had been removed received an anonymous call asking about funeral costs. The next morning, the funeral home received an envelope of money for the costs, as well as a blue dress and undergarments (her own) for Chase to be buried in. Nine mourners outside of reporters and law enforcement officers attended her funeral. No-one signed the guest book.\n\n\n"}

An enhanced search engine offers extensive metadata filters for both document projects and full text sources.\n\nWomen and Social Movements in the United States, 1600 to 2000, began in 1997 with a small grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. For six years, Kathryn Kish Sklar and her students at SUNY Binghamton developed document projects consisting of 20-30 transcribed documents focused around a historiographic question. Students not only transcribed the primary source documents, but also learned the necessary HTML for the placement of the project on the course web site. Document projects proved an ideal form for combining the internet’s spaciousness with the historian’s craft of working with primary sources. At the end of the first semester of teaching this senior seminar, Kathryn Sklar was joined by Thomas Dublin, her colleague at SUNY Binghamton, in creating an innovative website for the documentary projects, adding his knowledge of U.S. women's history and his experience with the use of computers in historical research. The first document project went live on a public web site in December 1997.\n\nWomen and Social Movements website grew rapidly. In 2001, with a second NEH grant, the editors began a collaboration with eleven faculty from other colleges and universities around the country. By the end of 2002, the website offered 43 documentary projects, authored in part by undergraduate students, which interpreted about 1,000 documents ranging in time from 1775 to 2000. The site attracted about 30,000 viewers a month from more than ninety countries. Yet two aspects of the website were not sustainable: the intensive labor needed to transform student work into authoritative scholarly analysis; and the initial sources of the site's funding.\n\nThis combination of success and challenges prompted a reconception of the Women and Social Movements website in the spring of 2002. Convinced that the technology and the format of the website were ideally matched to generate new knowledge in U.S. Women's History, Sklar and Dublin decided to encourage faculty and advanced graduate students to author document projects for the site. That effort proved remarkably successful; the website now includes document projects and archives from a wide range of scholars drawing on their specialized knowledge of women and social movements. Sklar and Dublin established an Editorial Board for the website as well as guidelines for submissions with blind peer review.\n\nYet despite this expansion, in the spring of 2002 the site’s future seemed uncertain because grant funding was no longer available (the site was no longer experimental), and the editors were unable to locate new sources of funding for the staff of graduate students who maintained the site and made its expansion possible. This funding dilemma was solved when Stephen Rhind-Tutt of Alexander Street Press, approached the editors and suggested that they consider publishing jointly with ASP. The press could fund the website’s costs through library subscriptions to the site. In 2003 the editors decided to publish jointly with ASP. This relationship has provided stability for the website and facilitated its expansion.\n\nIn March 2004 \"Women and Social Movements,\" which now published quarterly, began to include digitized versions of books and pamphlets related to women and social movements in the U.S. Initially these volumes focused on one hundred years of the woman suffrage movement, 1830–1930, including the six volumes of \"The History of Woman Suffrage (1881–1922)\" edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and other leaders of the woman suffrage movement and all the proceedings of the three national conventions of anti-slavery women held in the 1830s and of the Seneca Falls Convention and the National Women's Rights Conventions held between 1848 and 1870. Alexander Street Press has provided detailed indexing and database searching for these and other resources on the site, greatly improving its scholarly utility. A Dictionary of Social Movements and a Chronology of U.S. Women's History, both especially prepared for the website, provide users unique subject access to both document projects and full-text sources on the site. Book reviews and website reviews were also incorporated into each issue.\n\nIn March 2007 Sklar and Dublin began co-publishing with Alexander Street Press a greatly expanded version of the database—the Scholar’s Edition of Women and Social Movements. This edition features an online archive of all publications by federal, state, and local commissions on the status of women since 1963. Constituting 90,000 pages of documents collected from over 300 repositories, these commission publications offer a major new set of sources for research on the lives of American women since 1960. In addition, the Scholar’s Edition includes the first electronic version of Harvard University Press's five-volume biographical dictionary, \"Notable American Women (1971–2004)\", which is fully indexed and searchable.\n\nWith Volume 13 (2009) the publication schedule of Women and Social Movements became semi-annual, publishing in the spring (March) and fall (September) due to the larger size of each issue requiring a longer production schedule. Each issue now includes three document projects or document archives—along with book reviews, notes from the archive, teaching tools, and full text sources.\n\nWith the assistance of a large advisory board, Sklar and Dublin developed an ambitious plan to create an online archive of women's international activism. The two traveled extensively, and ultimately, materials from over 250 libraries in the US and abroad, were included in a second International database. Women and Social Movements International 1840 to Present, began in 2008, was completed in 2013. consisting of 25 scholarly essays, over 4,600 sources of published and manuscript resources, as well as links to 124 online resources. The database includes the same metadata rich search functions as the U.S. version, but also allows users to create their own playlists of documents, images, and videos.\n\n"}

In 1944, French women obtained women's suffrage. As in other Western countries, the role of women underwent many social and legal changes in the 1960s and 1970s. French feminism, which has its origins in the French Revolution, has been quite influential in the 20th century with regard to abstract ideology, especially through the writings of Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nThe traditional role of women in French society involves domestic duties such as housekeeping, preparation of meals in the customary fashion that involves a \"succession of courses eaten one at a time\", child rearing, harvesting of crops, and tending to farm animals. Upon the onset of the industrial revolution in France, women's role changed with them becoming domestic helpers, factory workers, and washerwomen. This did not generally include women who had \"bourgeois\" status, because these women often became dependent on the financial support of their husbands; such women of upper-class status also had the tendency to send their own \"children to wet nurses until\" weaned. Further changes to the status of women in France became apparent in 1944, when French women gained the right to vote. But it was only during the 1960s when they won the right to work without getting permission from their husbands, in addition to the right to open personal bank accounts. At present, due to effective health care provision in the country, the life-span of women is at an average of 80.9 years old. So-called \"infant allowances\" are available to subscribing pregnant women and their newborn children. In 1988, the unemployment rate among the French population was described to be \"higher among women\". However, in modern-day France, women who have attained a \"suitable level of education\" and training are gaining prominent positions in the fields of business and the engineering industry, particularly within Paris, the capital city of France. \nEducational aspirations were on the rise and were becoming increasingly institutionalised in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators. Girls were schooled too, but not to assume political responsibility. Girls were ineligible for leadership positions and were generally considered to have an inferior intellect to their brothers. France had many small local schools where working-class children - both boys and girls - learned to read, the better \"to know, love, and serve God.\" The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites were given gender-specific educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters - if they were lucky enough to leave the house - would be sent to board at a convent with a vague curriculum. The Enlightenment challenged this model, but no real alternative was presented for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.\n\nWomen in France obtained many reproductive rights in the second half of the 20th century.\nThe Neuwirth Act of 1967 authorized contraception. The Veil Law of 1975 legalized abortion. The maternal mortality rate in France is 8.00 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010). France's HIV/AIDS rate is 0.4% of adults (aged 15-49) - estimates of 2009.\nFrance has been one of the first countries to take legal action against female genital mutilation (which occurs in its immigrant communities) and to prosecute those who perform the practice.\n\nIn common with other countries in Mediterranean Europe and of Roman Catholic tradition, French organization of family life has traditionally been conservative, founded on distinct gender roles. Under the Napoleonic Code, married women were subordinated to the husband's authority. Married French women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965. The paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that, parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property. Adultery was decriminalized in 1975. In 1999, France introduced PACS (a civil union, known as \"civil solidarity pact\", which can be contracted both by heterosexual and by same-sex couples). In 2005, France reformed its divorce laws, simplifying the procedure, in particular by reducing the separation period, necessary before a divorce in certain circumstances, from 6 years to 2 years; there are now four types of divorce that can be obtained (divorce by mutual consent; divorce by acceptance; hostile divorce; divorce for separation).\n\nIn the past decades, social views on the traditional family have changed markedly, which is reflected in the high proportion of cohabitation and births outside of marriage, and in a questioning of traditional expectations regarding the family; in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, 35.4% of respondents in France agreed with the assertion that \"Marriage is an outdated institution\". \n\nAs of 2014, 58% of children were born outside of marriage. In France, legal reforms regarding the \"illegitimacy\" of children (born outside of marriage) began in the 1970s, but it was only in the 21st century that the principle of equality was fully upheld (through Act no. 2002-305 of 4 March 2002, removing mention of \"illegitimacy\" — \"filiation légitime\" and \"filiation naturelle\"; and through law no. 2009-61 of 16 January 2009). In 2001, France was forced by the European Court of Human Rights to change several laws that were deemed discriminatory, and in 2013 the Court ruled that these changes must also be applied to children born before 2001.\n\nFeminism in France has its origins in the French Revolution. Some famous figures were notable in the 19th century, including Louise Michel, Russian-born Elisabeth Dmitrieff and Nathalie Lemel. French feminism encompasses a branch of feminist theories and philosophies that emerged in the 1970s to the 1990s. This French feminist theory, compared to Anglophone feminism, is distinguished by an approach which is more philosophical and literary, rather than focused on practical issues. Its writings tend to be effusive and metaphorical being less concerned with political doctrines.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist and social theorist, is a prominent feminist figure.\nShe is known for her 1949 treatise \"The Second Sex\", a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism.\n\nIn the 21st century, France has taken many steps in order to combat domestic violence and violence against women, in particular by enacting \"Law No. 2010-769, of July 9, 2010, on Violence Against Women, Violence Between Spouses, and the Effects of These Types of Violence on Children\". France has also ratified the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.\n\nFrance has a long tradition of indulgence towards crimes of passion, which before 1975 were treated legally very leniently. In France, as of 2004-2009, former and current partners were responsible for more than 80% of all cases of murders of women.\n\nThe traditional religion of France is Roman Catholicism, but today it is no longer the state religion; and contemporary France is one of the most secular countries in Europe. In France, freedom of religion is guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Republic is based on the principle of \"laïcité\" enforced by the 1880s Jules Ferry laws and the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. Today, France also has a sizable Muslim population. In 2010, France enacted a ban on face covering, prohibiting the wearing in public places of niqab, burqa and similar outfits. In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the French law, accepting the argument of the French government that the law was based on \"a certain idea of living together\".\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century and continuing well into the 1800s, there was a large influx of talented French women painters. This is despite the fact that only a select few women were admitted into quality artistic schools, including the prestigious Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. Particularly noteworthy French women painters during the late 18th century include Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, Anne Vallayer-Coster, and Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. Vallayer-Coster was prominent for her figural paintings of King Louis XV's daughters and his daughter-in-law Queen Marie Antoinette. Antoinette and the Mesdames de France, also helped Labille-Guiard and Vigée Le Brun obtain admission to the Académie which caused a huge stir among the press, who decided to pit them as rivals against each other.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 created a hostile environment for artists at the time, particularly those supported by the royal family. Vigée Le Brun and Vallayer-Coster, along with many other female artists, fled to other parts of Europe and Russia. Labille-Guiard, however, chose to stay and built a respectable reputation painting the faces of the Revolution. After the Revolution, lesser known women artists were able to use the now wide-open biennial Salon (France) to display their art to a more receptive audience.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the number of French women artists sharply declined. It was the monarchy who gave women artists, especially painters, the opportunities to succeed. The Royal Academy was closed down and replaced with an institution that barred the admittance of women. Some female artists close to the monarchy were even executed. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that a significant number of women were combating stereotypical gender roles.\n\nGender roles played a big role in hindering prospective French women's artistic careers. While drawing and painting at the amateur level was encouraged as a part of a good bourgeois education, women were not socially permitted to engage in professional careers that weren't deemed important to society and/or disrupted in the perceived women's role of being a fully functional wife and mother. Many of the artists of this time felt the need to choose between a career and marriage. Also, any female students who did receive training from a skilled artist, were given limited expectations and were generally left with the simplest of artistic tasks. In 1860, Marie Bracquemond, a rising impressionist artist, quipped of her instructor, famous painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, \"The severity of Monsieur Ingres frightened me... because he doubted the courage and perseverance of a woman in the field of painting... He would assign to them only the painting of flowers, of fruits, of still lifes, portraits and genre scenes.\" \n\nIn the 1870s, life drawing classes became more open to French female students aspiring to be artists in Paris. Perhaps the most successful French woman artist in this era was Rosa Bonheur, who was well known for her animal paintings as well her sculptures. At a time dominated by male artistic ability, Bonheur is received very positively and rated very well among all of her peers. In an attempt to reject the gender roles, she cut and maintained a short hairstyle and also requested permission from the police to wear man's pants in order to remain relatively unnoticed in farms and slaughterhouses while she painted animals and studied animal anatomy. Due to concerns like this, women were more likely to embrace movements like the Impressionism that put artistic emphasis on everyday subjects, and not historical themes, that could be painted at home. Despite these hindrances, France was still one of the leading countries for the private tutelage of artistic women at the end of the 18th century. This isn't to say France wasn't behind the times, becoming one of the last countries in Western Europe to provide women with a state-sponsored education when the École des Beaux-Arts began admitting women in 1897. \n\nWith regard to literature, France is well known for the writer George Sand (pseudonym of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin).\n\n\n\n"}
