Abu Salem worked in the D-Company (Dawood Ibrahim gang) as a driver transporting weapons and contraband. Later he rose among the ranks after he introduced a new strategy of hiring unemployed Muslim youths from his hometown Azamgarh to come to Mumbai, execute shoot-outs and return to Azamgarh the next day remaining untraced by the Mumbai police.\n\nSalem is infamous for terrorizing the Bollywood film industry by extorting money from film producers and usurping the overseas distribution rights. He basically from Azamgarh. It is believed that Salem was the mastermind behind threatening Bollywood film producers like Gulshan Kumar, Subhash Ghai, Rajiv Rai and Rakesh Roshan. While his gang members assassinated Gulshan Kumar in 1997, they also tried to assassinate Rajiv Rai and Rakesh Roshan but failed.\nAfter the assassination of music baron and film producer he was also involved in several murder, extortion and other cases. He was later arrested in 2002 in Portugal and extradited to India. He was arrested on charges of Fake passport and later Amber Sharma of Mowgli Productions exposes all his fake passport details in his series Life of Mafia. He was tried and convicted in some cases and was awarded life imprisonment in 2015.\nAbu Salem was born in 1970 (according to the CBI; although the Mumbai police says, 1962; some reports suggests 1968) in a lower-middle-class family in Sarai Mir village of Azamgarh district, Uttar Pradesh. He was a third among four brothers Though some reports maintain that he was the eldest of four brothers. His father was a lawyer by profession who was killed in a road accident. He started a small mechanic shop in his home town to support his family. He studied in a primary school called Azamgarh and left the village after completing his inter college. He moved to Delhi, where he worked as a taxi driver. In 1985, he came to Mumbai to earn his livelihood. He worked as a bread delivery boy between Bandra and Andheri; later worked at a garment shop in Andheri West in 1986. Later, he became a real estate broker who operated from Arasa Market in Andheri West in 1987. In 1988, he assaulted a colleague over a monetary issue, resulting in the first case against him was registered at Andheri police station. In the meantime, he married Samira Jumani, a girl from Jogeshwari, from whom he divorced later. He has two sons from her. He loved film and reportedly named his sons after Bollywood actors. His elder brother Abu Hatim, also known as \"Chunchun Miyan\", owns a shop in his native village.\n\nIn the eighties, Abu Salem came to Mumbai from his hometown Azamgarh in UP. He started working for his cousin Akthar who had a cheap electronics shop near Andheri railway station. Akhtar also worked for a Sayyed Topi, a Dawood Ibrahim gang leader in the Andheri area.\nLater Abu Salem started a travel agency at Santa Cruz with J K Ibrahim who worked for the Dawood gang. From 1989 to 1993, Salem worked as a driver for the D-Company (Dawood Ibrahim gang) and he delivered weapons, illegal cash and goods to different gang members in Mumbai.\nHis proficiency at delivering goods at the right time and place earned him the nickname Abu Samaan. In 1992, he supplied weapons to film actor Sanjay Dutt. He played an active role in March 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts which killed over 250 people, left 700 injured and damaged property worth Rs 270 million. In 1993, he left the country and moved to Dubai when the police started rounding up suspects in serial blasts case. He had a business establishment there called Kings of Car Trading.\n\nIn the mid-nineties, many sharp shooters from D-company were killed either by the Chhota Rajan gang or in police encounters.\nSalem successfully introduced a new strategy of hiring unemployed Muslim youths from his hometown Azamgarh to come to Mumbai, carry off the shooting and return to Azamgarh the next day. Those youths were paid a paltry sum compared to sharp shooters and the Mumbai police also could not track them as the youths had no criminal record with the Mumbai police.\nSoon Abu Salem got the support of Anees Ibrahim (Dawood's brother) and he rose to prominence within the gang.\nBecause of his smooth talking skills, Salem was given the responsibility to manage the Bollywood deals and film financing for Dawood.\nHe organised stage shows where he invited actors. He was involved in extorting from the Hindi film industry, channelling illicit money into film production, forcibly getting the dates of stars, and usurping overseas rights. Salem first worked under Chhota Shakeel but later split and took to threatening film personalities for extortion. In mid-1997, reportedly went to Pakistan to make arrangements for the marriage of Dawood's brother Humayun. Salem is believed to be the mastermind behind the murder of music baron Gulshan Kumar on 12 August 1997 without Dawood's consent.\nHis gang members also attempted to shoot at Bollywood film directors, Rajiv Rai and Rakesh Roshan when they refused to succumb to his extortion demands.\nSalem fled Dubai, fearing Dawood's wrath. He finally parted ways with Dawood after being sidelined in 1998. His friction with Shakeel and Dawood's favouring of Shakeel is believed to be the reason behind Salem's split from the D-Company. In 2000, he planned kidnapping of Milton Plastics owner for ransom of Rs 30 million. In January 2001, his men shot Ajit Diwani, personal secretary to film actress Manisha Koirala. In October 2001, Four members of his gang shot down in Bandra before they could target film personalities Aamir Khan, Ashutosh Gowarikar and Jhamu Sughand. In July 2002, Two shooters of Salem gang opened fire on film director Lawrence D'souza who survived. He also attempted to kill cine figures Rajiv Rai, Rakesh Roshan and Manmohan Shetty.\n\nHe was convicted for the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, and murder of music baron Gulshan Kumar in 1996, shooting at Indian actress Manisha's secretary, murdering a property builder and more than 50 other cases.\n\nOn 20 September 2002, he was arrested along with Monica Bedi by Interpol in Lisbon, Portugal. His satellite phone was tracked using GPS technology. Monica Bedi was a film actress who reportedly had relationship with him. In February 2004, a Portugal court cleared his extradition to India to face trial in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case. In November 2005, Portuguese authorities handed him over to India on the assurance by the Government of India that the death penalty would not be handed out. When Salem was in Lisbon fighting India's extradition attempt, the only proof that he was indeed Salem was provided by the fingerprint and photographs taken after his arrest in 1991. Monica Bedi was also extradited to India and later convicted of passport forgery in 2006 and served her imprisonment but she was not involved in any of the business which belongs to abu salem.\n\nIn March 2006, a special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act court filed eight charges against him and his alleged associate Riaz Siddiqui for his role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. He stands accused of ferrying and distributing weapons.\n\nA lower court in Portugal cancelled his extradition to India for violation of deportation rules by Indian authorities by instituting fresh cases against him that attracted the death penalty. In July 2012, the Portuguese Supreme Court of Justice\nquestioned the legal right of Indian authorities to challenge the cancellation of extradition order.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, Salem was shot by Devendra Jagtap, an accused person in the Shahid Azmi murder case inside Taloja Central Jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, the police said. Salem sustained injury to his hand as Jagtap fired one round.\n\nAbu Salem was convicted in Pradeep Jain murder case on 16 February 2015. Jain, a city-based builder, was shot dead outside his Juhu bungalow on 7 March 1995. Nameem Khan, an accused in the case had turned approver. Riyaz Siddiqui, another accused in the case had turned approver then retracted and is being tried separately. He was sentenced life imprisonment in Pradeep Jain murder case on 25 February 2015.\n\nAbu Salem, Mustafa Dossa,and 4 others were convicted by a Special CBI court in Mumbai on 16th June 2017 in connection with the 1993 Bombay blasts case. Salem is currently lodged in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail. Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act Court Gives Life Imprisonment To Abu Salem In Mumbai 1993 Blast Case. \n\nOn 7 June 2018, A Delhi court held him guilty in an extortion case from 2002 of demanding ₹ 5 crore from Delhi businessman Ashok Gupta and awarded him jail for seven years. Gupta had received two phone calls on April 2, 2002 from Abu Salem asking him to call a number in Dubai. Salem had threatened Gupta about dire consequences for him and his family. \n\nIn August 2013, Punjabi Singer Sukhwinder Singh Maan alias Sukha Delhi wala revealed that he would release a song composed by Abu Salem while lodged in Tihar Jail, in his next Music Album. The Music Album shall also feature many other celebrities like Rahul Mahajan and Vindu Dara Singh.\n\nAbu Salem is said to be a billionaire gangster worth Rs. 55 billion (Approx $0.67 billion). His cash and property have been valued at least Rs 10 billion, which is divided between him and his wife, Samira Jumani. While Salem stakes a claim to Rs 2 billion, his wife possess Rs 8 billion in cash and property. Salem's investments in Bollywood and hawala rackets are estimated to be at least another Rs 30 billion. The CBI arrived at the figures on the basis of one-years transactions (2000–2001), and are said to be a conservative estimate.\n\nSalem possessed a non-immigrant work visa in the US, where he was employed as a maintenance manager for a marine engineering company. As he operated under different names, he could buy property worth crores, despite his employment background. Preliminary calculations by the CBI reveal transactions worth Rs 2 billion were carried out by Salem in the year 2000 itself. Details of his earlier transactions were not known as his whereabouts are not known. Police sources say that his benami but legal businesses in the Middle East are run by his close associates.\n\nHe married Samira Jumani, a college girl and a 17 year old minor in 1991 from whom he has a son. Samira currently lives in Duluth, Georgia, United States. Post Salem's arrest in Portugal, she told interviewers that he was a \"violent psychotic man\" and she was forced into marriage.\n\nIn September 2002, Abu Salem and his Bollywood partner Monica Bedi, were arrested and served jail sentence in Portugal for entering the country on forged documents. In 2006, an Indian Court convicted Bedi for procuring a passport on a fictitious name. In November 2010, the Supreme Court of India upheld her conviction but reduced the jail term to the period that she had already served.\n\n"}

Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments.\n\nWhile the ceremony itself is civil, many Buddhists obtain the blessing from monks at the local temple after the marriage is completed.\n\nGautama Buddha never spoke against marriage but instead pointed out some of the difficulties of marriage. He is quoted in the Parabhava Sutta as saying\n\nThe Pali Canon - the scriptures of the modern Theravada School - acknowledges homosexuality at some length in the Vinaya, or monastic code, which bars both male and female monastics (\"Bhikkhus\") from both heterosexual and homosexual activities. Although this clear and quite detailed acknowledgement of homosexuality exists in the monastic discipline (Vinaya), there is not one instance in which homosexuality is condemned or spoken of as evil or unskillful (Pali, \"akusala\") in the voluminous recension of discourses and teachings given by the Buddha and his disciples (the Suttas). All schools, including the Dalai Lama's Tibetan Buddhism, consider compassion, love and kindness at the centre of Buddhist practice and therefore love of all kind is seen as accepted. \n\nThe Dalai Lama has spoken of the merits of (heterosexual) marriage:\n\nWhile Buddhism neither encourages nor discourages marriage, it does offer some guidelines for it. While Buddhist practice varies considerably among its various schools, marriage is one of the few concepts specifically mentioned in the context of Śīla (Buddhist behavior discipline).\n\nThe fundamental code of Buddhist ethics, the Pancasila (or five precepts), contains an admonishment of sexual misconduct, though what constitutes such misconduct from a Buddhist perspective varies widely depending on the local culture. \n\nThe Digha Nikaya 31 (Sigalovada Sutta) describes the respect that one is expected to give to one's spouse.\n\nSince marriage is secular, Buddhism has no restrictions on divorce. Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda has said \"if a husband and wife really cannot live together, instead of leading a miserable life and harboring more jealousy, anger and hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and live peacefully.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27355965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27355965", "title": "Caduceus as a symbol of medicine", "text": "Caduceus as a symbol of medicine\n\nThe caduceus (☤) is the traditional symbol of Hermes and features two snakes winding around an often winged staff. It is often mistakenly used as a symbol of medicine instead of the Rod of Asclepius, especially in the United States. The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, eloquence, negotiation, alchemy, wisdom, and controversially, thievery, lying, and the passage into the underworld.\n\nThe modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.\n\nBefore the ancient Romans and Greeks (about 2612 BCE), older representations from Syria and India of sticks and animals looking like serpents or worms are interpreted as a direct representation of traditional treatment of \"Dracunculiasis\", the Guinea worm disease.\n\nWhile there is ample historical evidence of the use of the caduceus, or herald's staff, to represent Hermes or Mercury (and by extension commerce and negotiation), early evidence of any symbolic association between the caduceus and medicine or medical practice is scarce and ambiguous. It is likely linked to the alchemical \"Universal Solvent\", Azoth, the symbol of which was the caduceus.\n\nThe Guildhall Museum in London holds a 3rd-century oculist's seal with caduceus symbols both top and bottom. The seal was apparently used to mark preparations of eye medicine. It is believed likely that rather than being evidence of a medical association \"per se\", this is rather an allusion to the words of the Greek poet Homer who described the caduceus as \"possessing the ability to charm the eyes of men\", which of course relates to the business of an oculist.\n\nWalter Friedlander proposed that early association of the caduceus with medicine might have derived from the association of Hermes Trismegistus (\"Thrice-Great Hermes\") with early chemistry and medicine as aspects of alchemy as an esoteric practice. He notes however, that \"although these various factors may link Hermes/Mercury, along with his caduceus, with alchemical medicine, they may just as well link all the other non-medical aspects of alchemy with Hermes/Mercury and the caduceus.\"\n\nBeginning with the 16th century there is limited evidence of the use of the caduceus in what is arguably a medical context. However, this evidence is also ambiguous. In some cases it is clear that the caduceus symbolized wisdom, without any specific medical connotations.\n\nThe caduceus appears in a general medical context in the printer's device used by the Swiss medical printer Johann Frobenius (1460–1527), who depicted the staff entwined with serpents and surmounted by a dove, with a biblical epigraph in Greek, \"Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves\" (Matthew 10:16, here in the KJV translation), in keeping with the connotations of the caduceus as a symbol of messengers and publishers based on the association of Hermes or Mercury with eloquence and negotiation. Friedlander observed that Frobenius could hardly be considered a medical printer, as had previously been asserted, noting that in a review of 257 of the works bearing this printer's device only one was related to medicine. Similar use of the caduceus in printers' marks continues to the present day, with companies including F. A. Davis Company still using the symbol as an element of their insignia.\n\nThere are a few other examples of use in this period. It may have been used as a symbol by Sir William Butts, physician to Henry VIII. Similarly, physician John Caius, founder of Caius College, Cambridge, and at the time President of the Royal College of Physicians, during official visits to his eponymous college, had carried before him a silver caduceus on a cushion, and later presented this artefact to the college, where it remains in the College's possession. This use was adduced by the medical historian (and primary apologist for the use of the caduceus in a medical context) Fielding Garrison to support his argument that the caduceus was used as a symbol of medicine as far back as the 16th Century. However, as Walter Friedlander noted, \"what Caius used was a non-specific herald's wand, rather than the caduceus of Hermes.\" In support of this assertion he quotes Caius's own words on why he chose a herald's wand as a symbol, making it clear that he chose it as a symbol of prudence. This same passage was also earlier referenced by Engle in refuting Garrison's claim. Engle and Friedlander are not the only ones to have noted that the use of the Caduceus by Caius had nothing to do with supposed medical symbolism; as indicated in a publication produced by the Royal College of Physicians itself: \"[...] by introducing the caduceus into the ceremony of the College of Physicians, Caius unintentionally added to the confusion between the two emblems for later times, when few people understand the visual signs with which he was so familiar.\"\n\nIn support of the idea that the caduceus had a long-standing association with medicine, Garrison also mentioned the fact that the English medical printer Churchill used the symbol as a printer's device, beginning some time around 1844. Friedlander has examined this subject in detail, and shows that Churchill was well aware that the rod of Asclepius was the accepted symbol of medicine. He is, it seems, inclined to think that the adoption of the caduceus in this context probably had something to do with the relation between publishing and the role of Mercury as a messenger and scribe. He notes, however\n\nIn any case, in Great Britain, as late as 1854, the distinction between the rod of Asclepius and the caduceus as symbols of two very different professions was apparently still quite clear. In his article \"On Tradesmen's Signs of London\" A.H. Burkitt notes that among the very old symbols still used in London at that time, which were based on associations between pagan gods and professions, \"we find Mercury, or his \"caduceus\", appropriate in trade, as indicating expedition. \"Esculapius\", his \"Serpent and staff\", or his \"cock\", for professors of the healing art\"\n\nWidespread confusion regarding the supposed medical significance apparently arose as a result of events in the United States that occurred in the second half of the 19th Century. As pointed out by Garrison, the caduceus had appeared on the chevrons of Army hospital stewards as early as 1856 (William K. Emerson indicates the insignia was adopted earlier, in 1851). It has been asserted that this was a result of ignorance or misinterpretation regarding the pre-existing designation of the rod of Asclepius by the Surgeon General of the United States for this purpose. It is worth noting that hospital stewards were not physicians; they played a supporting role preparing drugs for surgeons, supervising nurses and cooks, maintaining accounting and medical records, and in emergencies sometimes performed minor surgery or provided prescriptions.\n\nLater, in 1871, the Surgeon General designated the caduceus as the seal of the Marine Hospital Service (destined to become the U.S. Public Health Service in 1912). Gershen states that the change was for aesthetic reasons, whereas Friedlander states the caduceus was adopted by the Marine Hospital Service \"because of its relationship with merchant seamen and the maritime industry\".\n\nThe caduceus was formally adopted by the Medical Department of the United States Army in 1902 and was added to the uniforms of Army medical officers. According to Friedlander, this was brought about by one Captain Frederick P. Reynolds, although Bernice Engle states \"the use of the caduceus in our army I believe to be due chiefly to the late Colonel Hoff, who has emphasized the suitability of the caduceus as an emblem of neutrality. Reynolds had the idea rejected several times by the Surgeon General, but persuaded the new incumbent — Brig. Gen. William H. Forwood — to adopt it. This resulted in considerable controversy.\n\n\"The Army and Navy Register\" of 28 June 1902 discusses the argument, which reflects the fact that a number of medical officers were unhappy with the choice. The article editor claims that the symbol was not chosen for its medical connotations and proposes the following symbolic interpretation: \"the rod represents power, the serpents stand for wisdom and the two wings imply diligence and activity, qualities which are undoubtedly possessed by our Medical officers.\" The editor also points out that the majority of Medical Corps personnel are not even doctors. According to this line of reasoning, the caduceus was never intended to be a symbol of medicine. The inconsistency was noticed several years later by the librarian to the Surgeon General, but for reasons which are not entirely clear, the symbol was not changed.\n\nConsiderable light is shed on this confusion by an anonymous letter republished by Emerson, a historian of United States Army insignia and uniforms. He indicates that the April 1924 issue of \"The Military Surgeon\" printed a review of an earlier article that appeared in the \"Presse Medicale\" in which the author stated \"There is nothing in history to justify the use of the caduceus as the emblem of the physician [...] it is most unfortunate that the 'confusion' exists.\" In an anonymous rebuttal contained in a letter to the editor published three months later in \"The Military Surgeon\" it was claimed that the late Col. John R. van Hoff was a member of the board that selected the emblem (\"if he was not the one who was chiefly instrumental in its adoption\"). In the letter to the editor reproduced by Emerson, the anonymous author claims\n\nAccording to this view the caduceus was not intended to be a medical symbol (and, though explained differently, this reflects the view advanced by the editor commenting in \"The Army and Navy Register\" of 28 June 1902 discussed above). Nevertheless, after World War I the caduceus was employed as an emblem by both the Army Medical Department and the Navy Hospital Corps. Even the American Medical Association used the symbol for a time, but in 1912, after considerable discussion, the caduceus was abandoned by the AMA and the rod of Asclepius was adopted instead.\n\nThis shift back to use of the rod of Asclepius to symbolize medicine can also be seen in the United States military. The Army Medical Corps, having popularised the caduceus, whilst retaining the caduceus for its own plaque and insignia, is now part of the Army Medical Department, which has since adopted the Rod of Asclepius as its main symbol. Furthermore, when the U.S. Air Force designed new medical insignia, it also adopted the rod of Asclepius. (The Royal Air Force (UK) medical services have, however, used the caduceus as uniform collar insignia since the foundation of the RAF in 1918.)\n\nDespite widespread acceptance of the caduceus as a medical symbol in the United States, it has been observed that the rod of Asclepius has \"the more ancient and authentic claim to be the emblem of medicine\". Most attempts to defend its use in a medical context date from the last quarter of the 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th, and have been characterized as \"based on flimsy and pseudo-historical research\".\n\nIn a survey of 242 logos used by organizations related to health or medicine, Friedlander found that professional associations were more likely to display the rod of Asclepius (62%), while organizations with a commercial focus were more likely to use the caduceus (76%). Hospitals were an exception (37% used a staff of Asclepius whereas 63% used a caduceus). Friedlander felt it likely that this might reflect the fact that \"professional medical organizations have more often sought a real understanding of the meaning of the two symbols whereas commercial organizations have been less interested in the historical basis of their logo or insignia and more concerned with how well a certain symbol will be recognized by the iconographically unsophisticated audience they are trying to attract to their wares.\"\n\nThe use of the caduceus in a medical context has long been frowned upon by many professionals, academics and others who are familiar with the historical significance of both symbols. This has occasioned impassioned remarks by those frustrated with the continuing confusion.\n\nIt has been observed that the caduceus is particularly inappropriate for use as a medical symbol due to its long associations with the Greek god Hermes, who was patron of commerce and traders as well as thieves, liars, and gamblers.\n\nOn the other hand, it has also been remarked – not without considerable irony – that commercial aims in medicine, especially in the United States of America, make the caduceus \"an appropriate symbol\", at least for some physicians.\n\nOthers are unapologetic about the association of medicine with commerce, recognizing the importance of \"advertising essential for competitive marketing\", and suggesting that it is up to individual physicians to choose between the two symbols, based on their own views about what associations are appropriate. In 2009, conspiracy theorist David Icke suggested that the American Medical Association deliberately adopted the symbol due to their underlying profit motives, although the AMA has used the Rod of Asclepius for over a century, and its current logo since 2005.\n\nIn North America, there are calls to clarify the symbol and to move to a uniform use of the rod of Asclepius. For example, the director of communications of the Minnesota Medical Association is quoted as saying, \"If it's got wings on it, it's not really the symbol of medicine; some may find it hard to believe, but it's true. It's something like using the logo for the National Rifle Association when referring to the Audubon Society\".\n\nHowever, Andrew Weil, a proponent of alternative medicine, has suggested that the caduceus is appropriate as a medical symbol \"because it embodies an esoteric truth that must be grasped to gain practical control over the shifting forces that determine health and illness.\"\n\n"}

The 2001 Italian census found 3,263 residents of Italy born in Cape Verde, 628 of whom held Italian citizenship. In contrast, the Caboverde Informatics Project of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth estimated that by 1995 their population already had reached 10,000. Another study asserted that Italy had 4,004 Cape Verdean legal residents in 2002. The Cape Verdean embassy in Italy listed 9,978 of their nationals in Italy as of 2007.\n\nItaly's first Cape Verdean migrants arrived in 1957. Early migration was almost exclusively female. The migrants consisted of young women recruited for live-in domestic work in Italy by Capuchin friars living in São Nicolau, Cape Verde. Roughly 3,500 had come to Italy in this manner by the end of 1972. The migrants settled primarily in Rome and Naples, with much smaller concentrations in Palermo and Milan.\n\nDomestic work remains an important source of employment for Cape Verdean women, though most have shifted to hourly work and living away from their workplace. Two factors have limited the shift away from domestic work into other lines of employment such as heavy industry: only a limited number of Cape Verdean men have migrated to Italy, and the Cape Verdeans are concentrated in the less-industrialised southern parts of Italy. They face increasing employment competition from Eastern European migrants. There is a weak trend towards entrepreneurship and self-employment.\n\nMigrants generally had a low level of education upon their arrival. Illiteracy was common. However, many migrants took advantage of the education offered by the Portuguese School in Rome, which was officially recognised by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, and then afterwards entered into Italian universities.\n\nIn general, Cape Verdeans have not faced as severe a level of discrimination as other migrant groups like Moroccans. Officials generally view them as well-integrated and unproblematic. Their early presence in Italy was characterised by social and political invisibility, but by the 1980s and 1990s, as Italians began to understand that their country had become an importer rather than an exporter of migrant labour as it had traditionally been, more public attention was focused on the Cape Verdean presence.\n\nOne study found that roughly half of Cape Verdeans were married to Italians. It is common for children to be sent back to Cape Verde for their early education and then return to Italy when they are older.\n\n"}

He is depicted in imperial roof decorations and other ornamental motifs in traditional Chinese architecture and art.\n\nThis Chinese dragon name \"chiwen\" 螭吻 compounds \"chi\" \"hornless dragon; young dragon\" and \"wen\" \"(animal's) mouth; lips; kiss\". \"Chishou\" 螭首 and \"Chitou\" 螭頭 (both literally meaning \"hornless-dragon head\") are related architectural ornaments or waterspouts, comparable with Western gargoyles. Chiwen and Chishou are not the character in chinese mythology.\n\n\"Chiwen\" 螭吻 is alternatively written \"chiwen\" 鴟吻 (\"owl mouth\"), using the homophonous Chinese character \"chi\" \"owl; sparrowhawk; bird of prey\". The \"chiwei\" 鴟尾 (\"owl tail\") and \"chimeng\" 鴟甍 (\"owl roof-ridge\") are additional birdlike roof decorations.\n\nThe \"chiwen\" is listed second or third among the \"Long sheng jiuzi\" 龍生九子 (\"dragon gives birth to nine young\"), Nine Dragons (), which are traditional mythology creatures and become traditional Chinese fengshui architectural decorations. Each one of those creatures have a protective function. The Nine dragon are also used in many place names, such as Kowloon (\"nine dragons\" in Cantonese), in Hong Kong, but also numerous lakes, rivers or hamlets in mainland China.\n\nAccording to the Ming Dynasty \"Wuzazu\" 五雜俎 (tr. Visser 1913:101), \"The \"ch'i-wen\", which like swallowing, are placed on both ends of the ridgepoles of roofs (to swallow all evil influences).\"\n\nWelch describes \"chiwen\" as \"the dragon who likes 'to swallow things'\".\nThis is the fish-like, hornless dragon with a very truncated body and large, wide mouth usually found along roof ridges (as if swallowing the roof beams). His presence on roofs is also said to guard against fires. A paragraph in the Tang dynasty book \"Su Shi Yan Yi\" (苏氏演义) by Su E (苏鹗) says that a mythical sea creature called the \"chi wen\" was put on the roofs of buildings during the Han dynasty to protect the structures from fire hazards. This dragon is still found on the roofs of traditional Chinese homes today, protecting the inhabitants from fires. (2008:122-3) \nIn Fengshui theory, a \"chiwen\" or \"chiwei\" supposedly protects against not only fire, but also flood and typhoon.\n\nThe Japanese language borrowed these names for architectural roof decorations as Sino-Japanese vocabulary. \"Shibi\" 鴟尾 \"ornamental roof-ridge tile\" is more commonly used than \"chifun\" 螭吻 or \"shifun\" 鴟吻. In Japanese mythology, the \"Shachihoko\" 鯱 \"a mythical fish with a carp's arched tail, tiger's head, and dragon's scales\" roof decoration is believed to cause rain and protect against fire. This is a kokuji \"Chinese character invented in Japan\" that can also be read \"shachi\" for \"orca\".\n\n\n"}

It was incorporated into the Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra in the 1980s but preserved wide technical, pedagogical and financial autonomy. It conferred the \"bacharelato\" degree and the \"Diploma de Estudos Especializados\" (DESE) diploma. In the late 1990s, after the upgrading of the Portuguese polytechnical institutions to bachelor's degree-conferring institutions (the Portuguese \"licenciatura\"), the differences between this polytechnical school and the university institutions were drastically reduced, an achievement that would fully materialize after the Bologna Process in 2006/2007. Currently, the ESAC awards a 3-year 1st cycle bachelor's degree (\"licenciatura\"); and a 2-year 2nd cycle masters' degree in several fields including biotechnology, food engineering, organic farming, and forest engineering. In addition, ESAC has developed and expanded its own research units and programs.\n\nThe ESAC is located in the urban area of the city of Coimbra, on a campus with strong rural characteristics, with a significant area of farmland, pasture, forest and infrastructure support for a total of 140 ha. It has a vast architectural heritage, architecture typical of the traditional rural location, including a listed building. The natural heritage of ESAC is also known for its quality and diversity: the region's largest camphor tree, a forest of oaks, and woody teixos, a tash, a Sequoia and species protected by the Habitats Directive. There is also a great faunal diversity including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, which have been identified as species of community interest.\n\nThis set of semi-natural areas, infrastructure and equipment can be used in training activities, environmental education and recreation service to the community as the main activities of ESAC focus in teaching, research and services in the areas of agriculture, biotechnology, forestry, environment, agro-industries and eco-agritourism.\n\nThe Centro de Estudos de Recursos Naturais, Ambiente e Sociedade (CERNAS) is ESAC's research and development centre.

{"id": "465924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465924", "title": "Franco-Provençal language", "text": "Franco-Provençal language\n\nFranco-Provençal (also Francoprovençal or Arpitan) is a dialect group within Gallo-Romance spoken in east-central France, western Switzerland, northwestern Italy, and in enclaves in the Province of Foggia in Apulia, Italy. \n\nFranco-Provençal has several distinct dialects and is separate from but closely related to neighboring Romance dialects (the langues d'oïl and Occitan, Rhaeto-Romance, Lombard, Piedmontese).\n\nThe designation \"Franco-Provençal\" (Franco-Provençal: ; ; ) dates to the 19th century. Traditionally, the dialect group is also referred to as \"patois\"\n('), and since the late 20th century as Arpitan (Franco-Provençal: '; ), and its areal as \"Arpitania\". \n\nFormerly spoken throughout the territory of Savoy, Franco-Provençal speakers are now found spoken of in the Aosta Valley, an autonomous administrative division of Italy. \nThe language is also spoken in alpine valleys in the Metropolitan City of Turin, two isolated towns (Faeto and Celle di San Vito) in the Province of Foggia, and rural areas of the Swiss \"Romandie\". \nIt is one of the three Gallo-Romance language families of France and is officially recognized as a regional language of France, but its use is marginal. Organizations are attempting to preserve it through cultural events, education, scholarly research, and publishing.\n\nAside from regional French dialects (the \"Langues d'oïl\"), it is the most closely related language to French. The number of speakers of Franco-Provençal has been declining significantly. According to UNESCO (1995), Franco-Provençal is a \"potentially endangered language\" in Italy and an \"endangered language\" in Switzerland and France.\n\nFranco-Provençal emerged as a Gallo-Romance variety of Latin. The linguistic region comprises east-central France, western portions of Switzerland, and the Aosta Valley of Italy with the adjacent alpine valleys of the Piedmont. This area covers territories once occupied by pre-Roman Celts, including the Allobroges, Sequani, Helvetii, Ceutrones, and Salassi. By the 5th century, the region was controlled by the Burgundians. Federico Krutwig has also detected a Basque substrate in the toponyms of the easternmost Valdôtain dialect.\n\nFranco-Provençal is first attested in manuscripts from the 12th century, possibly diverging from the langues d'oïl as early as the 8th–9th centuries (Bec, 1971). However, Franco-Provençal is consistently typified by a strict, myopic comparison to French, and so is characterized as \"conservative\". Thus, commentators, like Désormaux, consider \"medieval\" the terms for many nouns and verbs, including \"pâta\" \"rag\", \"bayâ\" \"to give\", \"moussâ\" \"to lie down\", all of which are conservative only relative to French. As an example, Désormaux, writing on this point in the foreword of his Savoyard dialect dictionary, states:\nFranco-Provençal failed to garner the cultural prestige of its three more widely spoken neighbors: French, Occitan, and Italian. Communities where speakers lived were generally mountainous and isolated from one another. The internal boundaries of the entire speech area were divided by wars and religious conflicts. France, Switzerland, the Franche-Comté (protected by Habsburg Spain), and the duchy, later kingdom, ruled by the House of Savoy politically divided the region. The strongest possibility for any dialect of Franco-Provençal to establish itself as a major language died when an edict, dated 6 January 1539, was confirmed in the parliament of the Duchy of Savoy on 4 March 1540 (duchy was partially occupied by France since 1538). The edict explicitly replaced Latin (and by implication, any other language) with French as the language of law and the courts (Grillet, 1807, p. 65).\n\nThe name \"Franco-Provençal\" (\"franco-provenzale\") is due to Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1878), chosen because the dialect group was seen as intermediate between French and Provençal.\n\nFranco-Provençal dialects were widely spoken in their speech areas until the 20th century. As French political power expanded and the \"single-national-language\" doctrine was spread through French-only education, Franco-Provençal speakers abandoned their language, which had numerous spoken variations and no standard orthography, in favor of culturally prestigious French.\n\nThe Aosta Valley is nowadays the only region of the Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events have combined to stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region since 1948. An amendment to the constitution of Italy changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree and a federal law. Further, a regional law passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture in the school curriculum. Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).\n\nParadoxically, the same federal laws do not grant the language the same protection in the Province of Turin because Franco-Provençal speakers make up less than 15% of the population. Lack of jobs has caused migration out of the Piedmont's alpine valleys, abetting the language's decline.\n\nSwitzerland does not recognize Franco-Provençal (Romand) as one of its official languages (\"Romand\" should not be confused with \"Romansh\"). Speakers live in western cantons where Swiss French predominates and converse in dialects mainly as a second language. Currently, its use in agrarian daily life is rapidly disappearing. However, in a few isolated places the decline is considerably less steep. This is most notably the case for Evolène.\n\nFranco-Provençal has had a precipitous decline in France. The official language of the French Republic is French (article 2 of the Constitution of France). The French government officially recognizes Franco-Provençal as one of the \"languages of France,\" but it is constitutionally barred from ratifying the 1992 European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ECRML) that would guarantee it certain rights. Thus, Franco-Provençal has almost no political support. It also carries a generally low social status. This situation affects most regional languages that comprise the linguistic wealth of France. Speakers of regional languages are aging and mostly rural.\n\nFranco-Provençal's name would suggest it is a bridge dialect between French and the Provençal dialect of Occitan, but this is misleading. More precisely, Franco-Provençal is a separate Gallo-Romance language that transitions into the Oïl languages Morvandiau and Franc-Comtois to the northwest, into Romansh to the east, into the Gallo-Italic language Piemontese to the southeast, and finally into the Vivaro-Alpine dialect of Occitan to the southwest.\n\nThe philological classification for Franco-Provençal published by the Linguasphere Observatory (Dalby, 1999/2000, p. 402) follows:\n\nA philological classification for Franco-Provençal published by Stanford University (Ruhlen, 1987, pp. 325–326) is as follows:\n\nFranco-Provençal is an extremely fragmented language, with scores of highly peculiar local variations that never merged over time. The range of dialect diversity is far greater than that found in the Langue d'Oïl and Occitan regions. Comprehension of one dialect by speakers of another is often difficult. Nowhere is it spoken in a \"pure form\" and there is no a \"standard reference language\" that the modern generic label used to identify the language may indicate. This explains why speakers use local terms to name it, such as Bressan, Forèzien, or Valdôtain, or simply \"patouès\" (\"patois\"). Only in recent years have speakers not specialists in linguistics become conscious of the language's collective identity.\nThe language region was first recognized in the 19th century during advances in research into the nature and structure of human speech. Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1829–1907), a pioneering linguist, analyzed the unique phonetic and structural characteristics of numerous spoken dialects. In an article written about 1873 and published later, he offered a solution to existing disagreements about dialect frontiers and proposed a new linguistic region. He placed it between the \"langues d'oïl\" group of languages (\"Franco\") and the \"langues d'oc\" group (\"Provençal\") and gave Franco-Provençal its name.\n\nAscoli (1878, p. 61) described the language in these terms in his defining essay on the subject:\n\nAlthough the name Franco-Provençal appears misleading, it continues to be used in most scholarly journals for the sake of continuity. Suppression of the hyphen between the two parts of the language name in French (\"francoprovençal\") was generally adopted following a conference at the University of Neuchâtel in 1969, however, most English journals continue to use the traditional spelling.\n\nThe name Romand has been in use regionally in Switzerland at least since 1494, when notaries in Fribourg were directed to write their minutes in both German and \"Rommant\". It continues to appear in the names of many Swiss cultural organizations today. The term \"Romand\" is also used by some professional linguists who feel that the compound word \"Franco-Provençal\" is \"inappropriate\".\n\nA proposal in the 1960s to call the language Burgundian (French: \"burgondien\") did not take hold, mainly because of the potential for confusion with an Oïl dialect known as Burgundian, which is spoken in a neighbouring area, known internationally as Burgundy (). Other areas also had historical or political claims to such names, especially (Meune, 2007).\n\nSome contemporary speakers and writers prefer the name Arpitan because it underscores the independence of the language and does not imply a union to any other established linguistic group. \"Arpitan\" is derived from an indigenous word meaning \"alpine\" (\"mountain highlands\"). It was popularized in the 1980s by Mouvement Harpitanya, a political organization in the Aosta Valley. In the 1990s, the term lost its particular political context. The \"Aliance Culturèla Arpitana\" (Arpitan Cultural Alliance) is currently advancing the cause for the name \"Arpitan\" through the Internet, publishing efforts and other activities. The organization was founded in 2004 by Stéphanie Lathion and Alban Lavy in Lausanne, Switzerland, and is now based in Fribourg. In 2010 SIL adopted the name \"Arpitan\" as the primary name of the language in ISO 639-3, with \"Francoprovençal\" as an additional name form.\n\nThe language is called patouès (patois) or nosta moda (\"our way [of speaking]\") by native speakers. Some Savoyard speakers call their language sarde. This is a colloquial term used because their ancestors were subjects of the Kingdom of Sardinia ruled by the House of Savoy until Savoie and Haute-Savoie were annexed by France in 1860. The language is called gaga in the Forez region of France and appears in the titles of dictionaries and other regional publications. \"Gaga\" (and the adjective \"gagasse\") comes from a local name for the residents of Saint-Étienne, popularized by Auguste Callet's story \"La légende des Gagats\" published in 1866.\n\nThe historical linguistic domain of the Franco-Provençal language includes the following areas (also see: Jochnowitz, 1973):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Franco-Provençal dialect with the greatest population of active daily speakers is Valdôtain. Approximately 68,000 people speak the language in the Aosta Valley region of Italy according to reports conducted after the 2003 census. The alpine valleys of the adjacent province of Turin have an estimated 22,000 speakers. The Faetar and Cigliàje dialect is spoken by just 1,400 speakers who live in an isolated pocket of the province of Foggia in the southern Italian Apulia region (figures for Italy: EUROPA, 2005). Beginning in 1951, heavy emigration from the town of Celle Di San Vito established the Cigliàje variety of this dialect in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, where, at its peak, it was used daily by several hundred people. As of 2012 this community has dwindled to fewer than 50 daily speakers across three generations.\n\nContrary to official information reported by the European Commission, a poll by the Fondation Émile Chanoux in 2001 revealed that only 15% of all Aosta Valley residents claimed Franco-Provençal as their mother tongue, a substantial reduction to the figures reported on the Italian census 20 years earlier that was used in the commission report, though 55.77% said they know Franco-provençal and 50.53% said they know French, Franco-provençal and Italian. This opened a discussion about the concept of mother tongue when concerning a dialect, therefore confirming the fact that the Aosta Valley is the only area where franco-provençal is actively spoken nowadays. A report published by Laval University in Quebec City, which analyzed this data, reports that it is \"probable\" that the language will be \"on the road to extinction\" in this region in ten years. The most recent edition of ethnologue.com (Lewis, 2009) reports that there are 70,000 Franco-Provençal speakers in Italy. However, these figures are derived from the 1971 census.\n\nIn rural areas of the cantons of Valais and Fribourg in Switzerland, various dialects are spoken as a second language by about 7,000 residents (figures for Switzerland: Lewis, 2009). In the other cantons of Romandie where Franco-Provençal dialects used to be spoken, they are now all but extinct.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, Franco-Provençal dialects were the most widely spoken language in their domain in France. Today, regional vernaculars are limited to a small number of speakers in secluded towns. A 2002 report by the INED (\"Institut national d'études démographiques\") states that the language loss by generation: \"the proportion of fathers who did not usually speak to their 5-year-old children in the language that their own father usually spoke in to them at the same age\" was 90%. This was a greater loss than any other language in France, a loss called \"critical.\" The report estimated that fewer than 15,000 speakers in France were handing down some knowledge of Franco-Provençal to their children (figures for France: Héran, Filhon, & Deprez, 2002; figure 1, 1-C, p. 2).\n\nNote: The overview in this section follows Martin (2005), with all Franco-Provençal examples written in accordance with \"Orthographe de référence B\" (see \"Orthography\" section, below).\n\n\nFranco-Provençal has grammar similar to that of other Romance languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nFranco-Provençal does not have a standard orthography. Most proposals use the Latin script and four diacritics: the acute accent, grave accent, circumflex, and diaeresis (trema), while the cedilla and the ligature found in French are omitted.\n\n\nThe table below compares a few words in each writing system, with French and English for reference. (Sources: Esprit Valdôtain (download 7 March 2007), C.C.S. Conflans (1995), and Stich (2003).\n\nFranco-Provençal uses a decimal counting system. The numbers \"1\", \"2\", and \"4\" have masculine and feminine forms (Duplay, 1896; Viret, 2006).\n\n0) \"zérô\"; 1) \"yon\" , \"yona / yena\" ; 2) \"dos\" , \"does / doves / davè\" ; 3) \"três\"; 4) \"quatro\" , \"quat / quatrè\" ; 5) \"cinq\"; 6) \"siéx\"; 7) \"sèpt\"; 8) \"huét\"; 9) \"nô\"; 10) \"diéx\"; 11) \"onze\"'; 12) \"doze\"; 13) \"trèze\"; 14) \"quatôrze\"; 15) \"quinze\"; 16) \"sèze\"; 17) \"dix-sèpt\"; 18) \"dix-huét\"; 19) \"dix-nou\"; 20) \"vengt\"; 21) \"vengt-yon\" / \"vengt-et-yona\"; 22) \"vengt-dos\" … 30) \"trenta\"; 40) \"quaranta\"; 50) \"cinquanta\"; 60) \"souessanta\"; 70) \"sèptanta\"; 80) \"huétanta\"; 90) \"nonanta\"; 100) \"cent\"; 1000) \"mila\"; 1,000,000) \"on milyon / on milyona\".\n\nMany western dialects use a vigesimal (base-20) form for \"80\", that is, \"quatro-vingt\" , possibly due to the influence of French.\n\nThe chart below compares words in Franco-Provençal to those in selected Romance languages, with English for reference.\n\nBetween vowels, the Latinate \"p\" became \"v\", \"c\" and \"g\" became \"y\", and \"t\" and \"d\" disappeared. Franco-Provençal also softened the hard palatized \"c\" and \"g\" before \"a\". This led Franco-Provençal to evolve down a different path from Occitan and Gallo-Iberian languages, closer to the evolutionary direction taken by French.\n\nClassification of Franco-Provençal dialect divisions is challenging. Each canton and valley uses its own vernacular without standardization. Difficult intelligibility among dialects was noted as early as 1807 by Grillet.\n\nThe dialects are divided into eight distinct categories or groups. Six \"dialect groups\" comprising 41 \"dialect idioms\" for the Franco-Provençal language have been identified and documented by Linguasphere Observatory (Observatoire Linguistique) (Dalby, 1999/2000, pp. 402–403). Only two dialect groups – Lyonnaise and Dauphinois-N. – were recorded as having fewer than 1,000 speakers each. Linguasphere has not listed any dialect idiom as \"extinct\", however, many are highly endangered. A seventh isolated dialect group, consisting of Faetar (also known as \"Cigliàje\" or \"Cellese\"), has been analyzed by Nagy (2000). The Piedmont dialects need further study.\n\n\nSeveral modern orthographic variations exist for all dialects of Franco-Provençal. The spellings and IPA equivalents listed below appear in Martin (2005).\nExternal links:\n\nOther than in family names, the Franco-Provençal legacy survives primarily in placenames. Many are immediately recognizable, ending in -az, -o(t)z, -uz, -ax, -ex, -ux, -ou(l)x, -aulx, and -ieu(x). These suffixes are vestiges of an old medieval orthographic practice indicating the stressed syllable of a word. In polysyllables, 'z' indicates a paroxytone (stress on penultimate syllable) and 'x' indicates an oxytone (stress on last syllable). So, Chanaz (\"shana\") but Chênex (\"shèné\"). The following is a list of all such toponyms:\n\n\n\n\nA long tradition of Franco-Provençal literature exists, although no prevailing written form of the language has materialized. An early 12th century fragment containing 105 verses from a poem about Alexander the Great may be the earliest known work in the language. \"Girart de Roussillon\", an epic with 10,002 lines from the mid-12th century, has been asserted to be Franco-Provençal. It certainly contains prominent Franco-Provençal features, although the editor of an authoritative edition of this work claims that the language is a mixture of French and Occitan forms. A significant document from the same period containing a list of vassals in the County of Forez also is not without literary value.\n\nAmong the first historical writings in Franco-Provençal are legal texts by civil law notaries that appeared in the 13th century as Latin was being abandoned for official administration. These include a translation of the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" (known as the \"Justinian Code\") in the vernacular spoken in Grenoble. Religious works also were translated and conceived in Franco-Provençal dialects at some monasteries in the region. \"The Legend of Saint Bartholomew\" is one such work that survives in Lyonnais patois from the 13th century.\n\nMarguerite d'Oingt (ca. 1240–1310), prioress of a Carthusian nunnery near Mionnay (France), composed two remarkable sacred texts in her native Lyonnais dialect, in addition to her writings in Latin. The first, entitled \"Speculum \"(\"The Mirror\"), describes three miraculous visions and their meanings. The other work, \"Li Via seiti Biatrix, virgina de Ornaciu\" (\"The Life of the Blessed Virgin Beatrix d'Ornacieux\"), is a long biography of a nun and mystic consecrated to the Passion whose faith lead to a devout cult. This text contributed to the beatification of the nun more than 500 years later by Pope Pius IX in 1869. A line from the work in her dialect follows:\n\nReligious conflicts in Geneva between Calvinist Reformers and staunch Catholics, supported by the Duchy of Savoy, brought forth many texts in Franco-Provençal during the early 17th century. One of the best known is \"Cé qu'è lainô\" (\"The One Above\"), which was composed by an unknown writer in 1603. The long narrative poem describes l'Escalade, a raid by the Savoyard army that generated patriotic sentiments. It became the unofficial national anthem of the Republic of Geneva. The first three verses follow below (in Genevois dialect) with a translation:\n\nSeveral writers created satirical, moralistic, poetic, comic, and theatrical texts during the era that followed, which indicates the vitality of the language at that time. These include: Bernardin Uchard (1575–1624), author and playwright from Bresse; Henri Perrin, comic playwright from Lyon; Jean Millet (1600?–1675), author of pastorals, poems, and comedies from Grenoble; Jacques Brossard de Montaney (1638–1702), writer of comedies and carols from Bresse; Jean Chapelon (1647–1694), priest and composer of more than 1,500 carols, songs, epistles, and essays from Saint-Étienne; and François Blanc dit la Goutte (1690–1742), writer of prose poems, including \"Grenoblo maléirou\" about the great flood of 1733 in Grenoble. 19th century authors include Guillaume Roquille (1804–1860), working-class poet from Rive-de-Gier near Saint-Chamond, Joseph Béard dit l'Éclair (1805–1872), physician, poet, and songwriter from Rumilly, and Louis Bornet (1818–1880) of Gruyères. Clair Tisseur (1827–1896), architect of Bon-Pasteur Church in Lyon, published many writings under the pen name \"Nizier du Puitspelu\". These include a popular dictionary and humorous works in Lyonnaise dialect that have reprinted for more than 100 years.\n\nAmélie Gex (1835–1883) wrote in her native \"patois\" as well as French. She was a passionate advocate for her language. Her literary efforts encompassed lyrical themes, work, love, tragic loss, nature, the passing of time, religion, and politics, and are considered by many to be the most significant contributions to the literature. Among her works are: \"Reclans de Savoué\" (\"Echos from Savoy\", 1879), \"Lo cent ditons de Pierre d'Emo\" (\"One Hundred Sayings by Pierre du Bon-Sens\", 1879), \"Poesies\" (\"Poems\", 1880), \"Vieilles gens et vieilles choses: Histoires de ma rue et de mon village\" (\"Old people and old things: Stories from my street and from my village\", 1889), \"Fables\" (1898), and \"Contio de la Bova\" (\"Tales from the Cowshed\").\n\nThe writings of the \"abbé\" Jean-Baptiste Cerlogne (1826–1910) are credited with reestablishing the cultural identity of the Aosta Valley. His early poetry includes: \"L'infan prodeggo\" (1855), \"Marenda a Tsesalet\" (1856) and \"La bataille di vatse a Vertosan\" (1858); among his scholarly works are: \"Petite grammaire du dialecte valdotain\" (1893), \"Dictionnaire du dialecte valdôtain\" (1908) and \"Le patois valdotain: son origine litéraire et sa graphie\" (1909). The Concours Cerlogne – an annual event named in his honor – has focused thousands of Italian students on preserving the region's language, literature, and heritage since 1963.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, regional dialects of Franco-Provençal were disappearing due to the expansion of the French language into all walks of life and the emigration of rural people to urban centers. Cultural and regional savant societies began to collect oral folk tales, proverbs, and legends from native speakers in an effort that continues to today. Numerous works have been published.\n\nProsper Convert (1852–1934), the bard of Bresse; Louis Mercier (1870–1951), folk singer and author of more than twelve volumes of prose from Coutouvre near Roanne; Just Songeon (1880–1940), author, poet, and activist from La Combe, Sillingy near Annecy; Eugénie Martinet (1896–1983), poet from Aosta; and Joseph Yerly (1896–1961) of Gruyères whose complete works were published in \"Kan la têra tsantè\" (\"When the earth sang\"), are well known for their use of patois in the 20th century.\nLouis des Ambrois de Nevache, from Upper Susa Valley, transcribed popular songs and wrote some original poetry in local\npatois.\nThere are compositions in the current language on the album Enfestar, an artistic project from Piedmont \n\nThe first comic book in a Franco-Provençal dialect, \"Le rebloshon que tyouè!\" (\"The cheese that killed!\"), from the \"Fanfoué des Pnottas\" series by Félix Meynet, appeared in 2000. Two popular works from \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and one from the Lucky Luke series were published in Franco-Provençal translations for young readers in 2006 and 2007.\n\n\n"}

In addition to the Nganguela proper, this ethnographic category includes the Lwena (Luena), the Luvale, the Mbunda, the Lwimbi, the Camachi and others.\n\nAll of these peoples live on subsistence agriculture, the rearing of small animals, and from gathering wild fruit, honey and other foods. Each group has its own language, although these are related among themselves. Each group also has its own social identity; there exists no overarching social identity encompassing them all, so that one cannot speak of these groups as one people divided into subgroups.\n\nThe peoples called \"Ganguela\" have been known to the Portuguese since the 17th century, when they became involved in the commercial activities developed by the colonial bridgeheads of Luanda and Benguela which existed at that time. On the one hand, many of the slaves bought by the Portuguese from African middlemen came from these people. On the other hand, in the 19th and early 20th century the \"Ganguela\" peoples furnished wax, honey, ivory and others good for the caravan trade organised by the Ovimbundu for the Portuguese in Benguela.\n\nAfter the collapse of the caravan trade, the \"Ganguela\" were for long — in fact until the very end of the colonial period — of little interest for the Portuguese. This is why they were relatively late subjected to a colonial occupation to which — with the exception of the Mbunda — they offered near to no serious resistance.\n\nDuring the few decades under colonial rule, their way of life changed less than in most other regions of Angola. As a rule, they were neither the object of systematic missionary work, nor subject to heavy tax levy or the recruitment as paid labour. The only important economic activity developed by the Portuguese in their area was the production of timber, for factories in Angola or in Portugal.\n\nDuring the anti-colonial war, 1961–1974, and especially during the Civil War in Angola, some of these groups were affected to a greater or lesser degree, although their active involvement was rather limited.;; As a consequence, many took refuge in neighbouring Zambia and (to a lesser degree) Namibia. In particular, almost half of the Mbunda settled in Western Zambia, but this people maintains an overall cohesion through their traditional authorities both in Angola and Zambia.\n\n"}

{"id": "25416432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25416432", "title": "Guardians of Liberty", "text": "Guardians of Liberty\n\nGuardians of Liberty is a three volume set of books published in 1943 by Bishop Alma Bridwell White, author of over 35 books and founder of the Pillar of Fire Church. Guardians of Liberty is primarily devoted to summarizing White’s vehement anti-Catholicism under the guise of patriotism. White also defends her historical support of and association with the Ku Klux Klan while significantly but not completely distancing herself from the Klan. Each of the three volumes corresponds to one of the three books White published in the 1920s promoting the Ku Klux Klan and her political views which in addition to anti-Catholicism also included nativism, anti-Semitism and white supremacy. In \"Guardians of Liberty\", White removed most, but not all of the direct references to the Klan that had existed in her three 1920s books, both in the text and in the illustrations. In Volumes I and II, she removed most of the nativist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist ideology that had appeared in her predecessor books. However, in \"Guardians\" Volume III, she did retain edited versions of chapters promoting nativism, anti-Semitism and white supremecy. 86% of the Liberal party joined the movement in 1943.\n\nLike their predecessor books, each of the volumes is primarily a compendium of essays and sermons written by White and of illustrations by Reverend Branford Clarke. Most of the text and illustrations had originally been published in the pro-Ku Klux Klan political periodical \"The Good Citizen\", one of the numerous periodicals published by the Pillar of Fire Church at their communal headquarters in Zarephath, New Jersey. The Pillar of Fire ceased publication of \"The Good Citizen\" in 1933. \"Guardians\" was published when White was 81 years old, three years before her death, and one year before the second Ku Klux Klan declared bankruptcy.\n\nVolume one of \"Guardians of Liberty\" was an edited reprint of White’s 1925 book \"The Ku Klux Klan In Prophecy.\" Of the 13 chapters in \"Guardians\" Vol. I, 7 are edited chapters from \"KKK in Prophecy\", and one chapter is from \"Heroes of the Fiery Cross\" (1928).\n\nAn additional chapter, \"Rome’s Political Defeat\" defends the Pillar of Fire Church and its members' role in two violent incidents that occurred near Zarephath, New Jersey, the church's headquarters.\n\nIt is devoted nearly entirely to promoting White's deeply held fears and hatred of the Roman Catholic Church and of Roman Catholic individuals. Most of the material promoting anti-Semitism, racism, and white supremacy that had originally been published in \"KKK in Prophecy\" was omitted in \"Guardians\" Vol. I, although some more-subtle reference were still included. Furthermore, most but not all of the references to the Ku Klux Klan were either removed or substituted with the following euphemisms: Patriots, Patriots in White Robes, Our Patriots, Our American Patriots, 100-Per Cent Americans, A Great Patriotic Organization, Invisible Empire, Freedom, Liberty, The Star of Hope, and Our Guardians of Liberty. Two illustrations with Klan images were retained and included in \"Guardians\" Vol. 1.\n\nVolume two of Guardians of Liberty contains fifteen chapters, thirteen are from and one from The Ku Klux Klan In Prophecy.\n\n\n"}

More than 80 women in the film industry have since accused Weinstein of such acts. Weinstein denied \"any non-consensual sex\". Shortly after the local news stations reported Weinstein's allegations, he was dismissed from The Weinstein Company, expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other professional associations, and disappeared from public view.\n\nCriminal investigations into complaints from at least six women are ongoing in Los Angeles, New York City, and London. On May 25, 2018, Weinstein was arrested in New York, charged with rape and other offenses, and released on bail.\n\nThe \"Times\" and the \"New Yorker\" jointly won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their reporting on Weinstein. The scandal triggered many similar allegations against powerful men around the world, and led to the ousting of many of them from their positions. It also led a great number of women to share their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, or rape on social media under the hashtag #MeToo. The scandal's impact on powerful men in various industries came to be called the \"Weinstein effect\". \n\nHarvey Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, formed the film production company Miramax and led the company from 1979 to 2005. In March 2005, the Weinsteins founded The Weinstein Company (TWC) and departed from Miramax that September.\n\nRumors of Harvey Weinstein's \"casting couch\" practices circulated in Hollywood for years, and entertainment figures at times alluded to them. As early as 1998, Gwyneth Paltrow said on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that Weinstein \"will coerce you to do a thing or two\". In 2005, Courtney Love advised young actresses in an interview, \"If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don't go.\" In 2010, an article titled \"Harvey's Girls\" for \"Pajiba\" alluded to Weinstein's \"casting couch\" reputation: \"Every few years, Harvey picks a new girl as his pet\". In 2012, a character on the TV series \"30 Rock\" said: \"I'm not afraid of anyone in show business, I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions, out of five.\" While announcing the 2013 nominees for the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award, Seth MacFarlane joked: \"Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\" After the allegations were published, director Quentin Tarantino said that he had known about Weinstein harassing actresses for decades, and had confronted him about it. Ivana Lowell wrote in her book \"Why Not Say What Happened?\", published in 2010, about misbehavior by Weinstein when she worked for the books division of Miramax. The incidents described were in her office when she was alone with Harvey Weinstein, and in her home when a female friend of hers was present. She wrote that she \"knew about Harvey's reputation as a womanizer; tales of his trying to seduce every young actress in town were infamous.\"\n\nJournalists wrote or attempted to write about Weinstein's alleged behavior. David Carr found that no one allegedly assaulted by Weinstein would speak on the record; Ken Auletta and his editors decided that he could not mention an assault allegation without cooperation from the victim. In 2015, Jordan Sargent wrote in his Gawker article \"Tell Us What You Know About Harvey Weinstein's 'Open Secret'\" that \"rumors of the powerful producer leveraging his industry power for sexual satisfaction—consensual or otherwise—have tended to remain unaired, confined to hushed conversation and seedier gossip-blog comment threads.\" \"The New York Times\" later wrote that Weinstein had built a \"wall of invulnerability\", in part through his support of leading Democratic politicians. He boasted of being friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. The Clintons continued longstanding close relationships with him despite alleged warnings about Weinstein to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign from Lena Dunham and Tina Brown.\n\nIn 2015 \"The New York Times\" reported that Weinstein was questioned by police \"after a 22-year-old woman accused him of touching her inappropriately\". The woman, Italian model Ambra Gutierrez, cooperated with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to obtain an audio recording where Weinstein admitted to having inappropriately touched her. As the police investigation progressed and became public, tabloids published negative stories about Gutierrez that portrayed her as an opportunist. American Media, publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", allegedly agreed to help suppress the allegations by Gutierrez and Rose McGowan. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. decided not to file charges against Weinstein, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent, against the advice of local police who considered the evidence sufficient. The New York district attorney's office and the NYPD blamed each other for failing to bring charges.\n\nIn July 2018, after many allegations and criminal charges of sexual misconduct, Greek journalist Taki Theodoracopulos reported in \"The Spectator\" that his friend Weinstein told him in an interview that \"yes, I did offer them [girls] acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so did and still does everyone.\" Weinstein's lawyer later said that he had been present and that Weinstein had not said that, and Theodoracopulos stated that he \"may have misrepresented\" Weinstein.\n\nSubstantial allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein were first reported by \"The New York Times\" journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey on October 5, 2017. The story accused Weinstein of three decades of sexually harassing and paying eight settlements to actresses and female Miramax and Weinstein Company production assistants, temps, and other employees.\n\nFive days later, on October 10, NBC News correspondent Ronan Farrow reported in \"The New Yorker\" further allegations that Weinstein had sexually assaulted or harassed 13 women, and raped three. Farrow said he had wanted to break the story months earlier with NBC but implied the network was under pressure not to publish, which NBC denied. According to Farrow, 16 former or current executives and assistants connected with Weinstein said that they had witnessed or had been informed of Weinstein's non-consensual sexual advances to women. Four actresses relayed their suspicion that, after rejecting Weinstein's advances and complaining about him, he had them removed from projects or persuaded others to remove them. A number of Farrow's sources said Weinstein had referred to his success in planting stories in the media about individuals who had crossed him. \"The New Yorker\" also published the 2015 audio recording in which Weinstein admits to groping Gutierrez.\n\nThat November, Farrow reported that Weinstein had, through the lawyer David Boies, employed the private intelligence agencies Kroll, Black Cube and private investigator Jack Palladino. They were charged with spying on and influencing Weinstein's alleged victims as well as Kantor, Twohey, Farrow and other reporters who were investigating Weinstein, so as to prevent his conduct from becoming public.\n\nIncluding the initial reporting in 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault or rape. A group of them, led by Italian actress Asia Argento, released a list of over 100 alleged instances of sexual abuse by Weinstein in November 2017. The incidents alleged in the list date from 1980 to 2015, and include 18 allegations of rape.\n\nAccording to the women's reports, Weinstein invited young actresses or models into a hotel room or office on the pretext of discussing their career, and then demand massages or sex. He told them that complying with his demands would help their careers, repeatedly mentioning Paltrow (without the actress's knowledge) as someone he claimed to have had sex with.\n\nFormer colleagues and collaborators of Weinstein told reporters that these activities were enabled by employees, associates, and agents who set up these meetings, and lawyers and publicists who suppressed complaints with payments and threats; Bob Weinstein, for example, was allegedly involved in three settlements with accusers, the first in 1990. One Miramax executive reported being harassed by Weinstein after being promoted and praised by him; she and other employees allegedly found that the HR department protected Weinstein more than his employees.\n\nWomen who said they had been sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein include:\n\nThe women who have accused Weinstein of rape include:\n\nIn response to the \"New York Times\" report, Weinstein said: \"I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.\" He said he was due to take a sabbatical and was working with therapists to \"deal with this issue head on\". His consulting lawyer, Lisa Bloom, described him as \"an old dinosaur learning new ways\". Bloom was criticized for her handling of Weinstein's defense and ended her involvement for Weinstein on October 7, 2017. Two days later, Weinstein hired public relations company Sitrick and Company, which specializes in crisis PR; they dropped Weinstein as a client on April 3, 2018. Weinstein's attorney Charles Harder said his client would be suing the \"Times\", but as of October 15, Harder was no longer working for Weinstein.\n\nIn response to the report in \"The New Yorker\", a spokesperson for Weinstein stated:\n\nSubsequent reports and accusations of rape were likewise met with the response that \"any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein\".\n\nOn January 30, 2018, Weinstein's attorney released private emails from Ben Affleck and Jill Messick, Rose McGowan's former manager, that both contradicted McGowan's version of the incident. On February 7, 2018 Messick committed suicide. Both the released email and McGowan's own accusations against Messick led to increased negative public and media attention towards Messick, including cyberbullying. Messick's family blamed Weinstein, McGowan, the media and the public for her death.\n\nIn March 2018, Weinstein's lawyer and spokesperson Benjamin Brafman said in an interview with \"The Times\" of London, \"The casting couch in Hollywood was not invented by Harvey Weinstein.\"...\"If a woman decides that she needs to have sex with a Hollywood producer to advance her career and actually does it and finds the whole thing offensive, that's not rape.\" Rhetorically addressing such a woman, Brafman said, \"You made a conscious decision that you're willing to do something that is personally offensive in order to advance your career.\"\n\nIn October 2017, the New York City Police Department (NYPD), London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) were reviewing allegations against Weinstein following the reporting about his conduct.\n\nThe NYPD said on November 3, 2017 that they were preparing a warrant to arrest Weinstein for his alleged rape of Paz de la Huerta, an investigation that was still pending as of May 2018 and unrelated to the later arrest of Weinstein.\n\nOn May 25, 2018, Weinstein was charged by New York prosecutors with \"rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women\" following a month long investigation. After surrendering to police, he appeared in court before Judge Kevin McGrath. If convicted on the most serious charges, Weinstein could face between 5 and 25 years in prison. Weinstein was released same day on a million dollars cash bail. He agreed to surrender his passport and to wear an ankle monitor confining him to Connecticut and New York. His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said Weinstein intends to plead not guilty.\n\nIn July 2018, Weinstein was indicted on an additional charge of \"predatory sexual assault\" against a woman he allegedly forced into oral sex in 2006. The charge has a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nOn October 11, 2018 a New York judge dismissed one of the sex assault charges against Weinstein.\n\nThe LAPD investigation concerns an allegation of rape by an unnamed actress.\n\nAs of February 2018, the London MPS were investigating 15 alleged sexual assaults by Weinstein, dating back to the 1990s. The investigation is dubbed \"Operation Kaguyak\".\n\nOn October 23, 2017, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened a civil rights investigation into The Weinstein Company (TWC). He issued a subpoena for records related to sexual harassment and discrimination complaints at the company.\n\nIn January 2018, Weinstein's former personal assistant Sandeep Rehal sued both Weinstein brothers and TWC for discrimination and harassment, alleging that much of her work involved \"catering to Harvey Weinstein's sexual appetites and activities\", including working while he was naked. Weinstein denied these allegations.\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Ashley Judd sued Weinstein for allegedly making false statements about her after she rejected his sexual requests which damaged her career and cost her a role in a \"Lord of the Rings\" movie.\n\nWeinstein's alleged actions were widely criticized by prominent persons in entertainment and politics. They triggered a public discussion about, as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) put it, \"willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment\" in the film industry.\n\nOn October 8, 2017, The Weinstein Company's (TWC) board of directors dismissed Weinstein, and he resigned from the company's board nine days later.\n\nAfter Weinstein's ouster was announced, several companies ended their collaborations with TWC, including Apple (October 9), Hachette (October 12), Amazon (October 13), Lexus and Ovation (October 25). The AMPAS, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), the Producers Guild of America (PGA), and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) also stripped Weinstein of their memberships.\n\nProminent politicians condemned Weinstein's actions. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama denounced Weinstein's reported behavior on October 10, 2017. French President Emmanuel Macron initiated the revocation of Weinstein's Legion of Honor title. In the UK, Labour members of parliament requested the revocation of Weinstein's Commander of the Order of the British Empire honorary title.\n\nSeveral politicians Weinstein had supported gave his donations to charities, including Democratic Senators Al Franken, Patrick Leahy, and Martin Heinrich.\n\nWeinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announced her divorce on October 10, 2017. That month, the University at Buffalo, Weinstein's alma mater, revoked his honorary degree, and Harvard University rescinded Weinstein's 2014 W. E. B. Du Bois medal.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2018, more than 300 Hollywood actresses and other women published an open letter in the daily newspapers \"The New York Times\" and \"La Opinión\" appealing to support the initiative Time's Up.\n\nThe October 2017 allegations against Weinstein precipitated an immediate \"national reckoning\" against sexual harassment and assault in the United States, known as the \"Weinstein effect\". Compounded by other sexual harassment cases earlier in the year, the Weinstein reports and the subsequent \"#MeToo\" hashtag campaign, which encouraged individuals to share their suppressed stories of sexual misconduct, created a cavalcade of allegations across multiple industries that brought about the swift ouster of many men in positions of power both in the United States and, as it spread, around the world. In the entertainment industry, allegations led to the ousters of actors and directors alike. Most prominently, actor Kevin Spacey, comedian Louis C.K., and filmmaker Brett Ratner had projects canceled following at least six allegations apiece. Over 200 women accused filmmaker James Toback of sexual harassment. In journalism, allegations led to the ousters of editors, publishers, executives, and hosts. In other industries, the celebrity chef John Besh and other executives in finance and public relations were removed. As of November 25, 2017, the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating 28 sex crime cases involving media figures.\n\n\"Time\" magazine dubbed the \"Silence Breakers\" behind the #MeToo movement \"Time\" Person of the Year in 2017. American journalists in conversation at NPR wrote of the series of allegations feeling like a tipping point for societal treatment of sexual misconduct, distinguished from prior sexual misconduct public debates by the public trust put in the celebrity accusers, as opposed to prior cases of publicly unknown accusers. Other journalists doubted that the trend would hold.\n\n\"The New York Times\" and \"The New Yorker\" jointly won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service \"for their coverage of the sexual abuse of women in Hollywood and other industries around the world\".\n\nThe \"Me Too\" campaign spread to other countries and languages over social media in Asia, Europe, Latin and North America.\n\nIn North America, Canadian comedy festival founder Gilbert Rozon resigned and over a dozen individuals accused Quebec television host and producer Éric Salvail of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn Europe, allegations against multiple British politicians created a public scandal and led to the suspension and resignations of three officials. In France, political organizations close to the Socialist Party, in particular the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF), were accused of systemic sexual harassment. The French daily newspaper \"Le Monde\" published in November 2017 two articles on alleged sexual harassment and predation supported by former UNEF presidents, Jean-Baptiste Prévost and Emmanuel Zemmour. In an editorial, more than 80 UNEF female members and militants came forward to accuse the Union of \"sexual violence\".\n"}

Yunioshi is a fictional character in Blake Edwards' 1961 American romantic comedy \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", which was adapted for the screen by George Axelrod based on Truman Capote's 1958 novella of the same title. The character in the film is significantly different from the character as presented in Capote's original novella,\nand the film version of Mr. Yunioshi, as portrayed by Mickey Rooney, has been the subject of extensive critical commentary and review since its theatrical release.\n\nIn the early 1960s and before, racially charged humor was acceptable in American culture, although this general attitude began to change later in that decade, and more so afterwards. In 1961, \"The New York Times\" review of the film said that \"Mickey Rooney's bucktoothed, myopic Japanese is broadly exotic.\" Some reviewers of the day did note an issue over the characterization. James Powers' review in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated, \"Mickey Rooney gives his customary all to the part of a Japanese photographer, but the role is a caricature and will be offensive to many.\" In \"Variety\", Larry Tubelle wrote simply, \"Mickey Rooney’s participation as a much-harassed upstairs Japanese photographer adds an unnecessarily incongruous note to the proceedings.\"\n\nIn 1990, \"The Boston Globe\" described Rooney's portrayal as \"an irascible bucktoothed nerd and an offensive ethnic caricature\". In 1993, the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" wrote that the role \"would have been an offensive stereotype even played by an Asian; the casting of Mickey Rooney added insult to injury\".\n\nThe portrayal was referenced in the 1993 film \"\" as an example of Hollywood's racist attitudes about Asians that the Chinese Bruce Lee's success as a movie star would challenge. Specifically, when Lee and his girlfriend Linda Emery watch \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" in the theater, where despite laughing at the character, Linda suggests they leave midway through the picture after she notices that Bruce is upset at Rooney's stereotypical depiction of a Japanese man.\n\nMore recent characterizations include \"cringe-inducing stereotype\", \"painful, misguided\", \"overtly racist\" and \"Orientalist\", an \"inexcusable case of yellowface\", \"one of the most egregiously horrible 'comic' impersonations of an Asian ... in the history of movies\", and a portrayal \"border[ing] on offensive\" that is a \"double blow to the Asian community – not only is he fatuous and uncomplimentary, but he is played by a Caucasian actor in heavy makeup.\" Similarities between the character of Mr. Yunioshi and anti-Japanese wartime propaganda in the United States have been noticed by critics Jeff Yang and David Kerr.\n\nA free outdoor screening in Sacramento, California, scheduled for August 23, 2008, was replaced with the animated film \"Ratatouille\" after protests about the Yunioshi character. The protest was led by Christina Fa of the Asian American Media Watch.\n\nA screening was shown August 11, 2011 at Brooklyn Bridge Park's \"Movies with a View\" series in New York. Due to protests from a multi-ethnic group organized by an online petition at Change.org, the screening also included a short statement by the organizers which acknowledged and validated community concerns about Yunioshi and a brief documentary about Rooney's character and the portrayal of Asian Americans in other films that was edited from a DVD extra for the anniversary DVD. The aforementioned editorial in the \"New York Daily News\" by columnist Jeff Yang offered an alternative view regarding the protests: \"Far from boycotting the movie or even begrudgingly accepting it, I think it should be mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to fully understand who we are as a culture, how far we've come and how far we still need to go.\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview about the film, Rooney said he was shocked to hear that his role as Yunioshi had been branded racist by several Asian-American activists. Rooney said he was heartbroken about the criticism: \"Blake Edwards...wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director. They hired me to do this overboard, and we had fun doing it...Never in all the more than 40 years after we made it—not one complaint. Every place I've gone in the world people say, 'God, you were so funny.' Asians and Chinese come up to me and say, 'Mickey, you were out of this world.'\" Rooney also said that if he had known people would be so offended, \"I wouldn't have done it. Those that didn't like it, I forgive them and God bless America, God bless the universe, God bless Japanese, Chinese, Indians, all of them and let's have peace.\"\n\nThe 2009 DVD re-release of the film included what was described as \"a brief and necessary featurette on the character of Mr. Yunioshi, offering an Asian perspective on 'yellow face'\".\n\nA 2013 Broadway show based on the film cast Japanese-American actor James Yaegashi as a culturally assimilated Japanese-American Yunioshi born in California, as the character was written in Capote's original book.\n\n"}

{"id": "9396749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9396749", "title": "Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures", "text": "Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures\n\nThe causes and degree of Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures has been a subject of debate over many decades. Although the Olmecs are considered to be perhaps the earliest Mesoamerican civilization, there are questions concerning how and how much the Olmecs influenced cultures outside the Olmec heartland. This debate is succinctly, if simplistically, framed by the title of a 2005 \"New York Times\" article: “Mother Culture, or Only a Sister?”.\n\nNearly all researchers agree on a number of specific issues concerning the Olmec and the Olmec Heartland:\n\n\nWhile some of the hallmarks of Olmec culture, such as colossal heads or other sculptures, earthen platforms, and monolithic \"altars\", are to be found only within the heartland, many Olmec-style artifacts, designs, figurines, monuments, and motifs can be found in the archaeological records of sites hundreds of kilometers/miles distant. The most prominent of these sites are:\n\n\nOther sites showing Olmec influence include Takalik Abaj and Monte Alto in Guatemala, Las Bocas in Puebla, and Zazacatla. In all these cases, the archaeological record shows Olmec-influenced objects existing alongside objects in the local tradition. Often, for example at Las Bocas, Olmec inconography will even appear on objects created in the local tradition. \n\nThe Olmec influences in these sites all post-date San Lorenzo and the cultural pathways almost exclusively flow from the Olmec heartland to these distant sites, and not in the other direction (from, say, Chalcatzingo to San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan). This apparent one-way flow has led most researchers to declare Olmecs to be the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica. \n\nTo quote perhaps the most prominent of Mesoamerican archaeologists, Michael D. Coe, \"There is now little doubt that all later civilizations in Mesoamerica, whether Mexican or Maya, ultimately rest on an Olmec base.\" To this, Coe's student archaeologist Richard Diehl adds \"While not every archaeologist agrees with Coe, ... mounting evidence ... has convinced everyone but the most die-hard opponents\". \n\nThe concept of the Olmecs as a mother culture was first formally raised by Alfonso Caso at a 1942 conference on the \"Olmec problem\" in Tuxtla Gutiérrez where he argued that the Olmec were the \"cultura madre\" of Mesoamerica.\n\nThe proponents of the \"mother culture\" do not argue that the Olmec were the \"only\" contributors, but that the Olmecs first developed many of the features adopted by later Mesoamerican civilizations.\n\nThey argue that it was in San Lorenzo and the Olmec heartland that the hallmarks of the Olmec culture were first established, hallmarks that include the patio/plaza concept, monumental sculpture, Olmec iconography, archetypical Olmec figurines, and other portable art.\n\nThe \"sister culture\" proponents, on the other hand, state that Mesoamerican cultures evolved more or less simultaneously. Major proponents of this theory include Joyce Marcus and Kent V. Flannery, who argue that the Olmec were merely the first among equals, rather than the wellspring of cultural change.\n\nIn a subsequent paper, they imply, for example, that Olmec iconography may have originated in the early Tlatilco culture.\n\nThis viewpoint is echoed by a minority of other researchers including art historian Caterina Magni who nonetheless agrees that the Olmecs bequeathed a rich heritage to later cultures. However, Magni does not agree that what is presently labelled as Olmec culture was first and foremost the product of the heartland. \n\nMagni attributes these concepts to noted archaeologist Christine Niederberger.\n\nIn an effort to address questions concerning the geographic origins of Olmec artifacts — with implications concerning the geographic origins of Olmec culture — in March 2005 a team of archaeologists used instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) to compare over 1,000 Mesoamerican Olmec-style ceramic artifacts with 275 samples of clay so as to \"fingerprint\" the origin of that pottery. They found that \"the Olmec packaged and exported their beliefs throughout the region in the form of specialized ceramic designs and forms, which quickly became hallmarks of elite status in various regions of ancient Mexico\".\n\nIn August 2005 the results of another study were published. This study used petrography to analyze 20 pottery shards, and found that five of the samples from San Lorenzo were \"unambiguously\" from Oaxaca. Based on this evidence, the authors concluded that the \"exchanges of vessels between highland and lowland chiefly centers were reciprocal, or two way\" which \"contradicts recent claims that the Gulf Coast was the sole source of pottery\" in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe results of the INAA study were later defended in March 2006 in two articles in \"Latin American Antiquity\", in particular contrasting the sample size of the INAA study (roughly 1000) with the sample size of the petrography analysis (20).\n\nIn the early 21st century it seems that a middle ground between the mother and sister culture positions may be emerging. Pool (2007) thus concludes that while San Lorenzo emerged early as the largest the most developed polity of Mesoamerica and the earliest evidence of several of the defining traits of Mesoamerican culture is found there, the Olmecs emerge looking less like a mother culture than as a promiscuous father culture spawning offspring generously with many different mothercultures all over mesoamerica. This formulation emphasises the viewpoint that influence from the Olmec heartland merged with many local traditions creating local expressions with both Olmec and non-Olmec roots. it follows from this approach that the type and degree of Olmec influence varies greatly from location to location within Mesoamerica.\n\nIf Olmec influences flowed out of the heartland in what is generally seen as a less than bilateral transfer, then how did this happen? How were the hallmarks of Olmec culture transmitted to sites hundreds of kilometers/miles distant from the heartland? Many theories have been advanced including:\n\nThere is little or no evidence to support Olmec military domination. Very little Olmec or other Early Formative era art shows war or sacrifice. No stelae have been found extolling rulers' victories, unlike the later Maya or the contemporaneous Egyptian or Hittite cultures.\n\nOlmec colonization, that is the founding of new settlements by Olmec emigrants outside of the Olmec heartland, is unlikely. The archaeological records of Olmec-influenced sites show that each had pre-Olmec occupations as well as a significant number of indigenous artifacts created in a local tradition. The Tlatilco site as well as Xochipala figurines are two examples famous for a large number of figurines, which are unlike any found at La Venta or San Lorenzo.\n\nAlthough portable art, such as pottery, celts, or other items could have been transported the long distances between towns, the monumental art at Chalcatzingo or Teopantecuanitlan would need to be created locally. Therefore, it is very likely that sculptors and artists familiar with or experienced in heartland architecture were commissioned to create similar ceremonial sites far from the heartland. But while this can explain \"how\" monumental Olmec-style art was created at Chalcatzingo, it does not explain \"why\".\n\nSimilarly long-distance trade can explain the Olmec-style artifacts found in Teopantecuanitlan, as well the jade and obsidian artifacts found in the Olmec heartland, which is far from any jade or obsidian source. But trade by itself fails to explain the widespread adoption of Olmec-influenced artifacts and styles throughout Mesoamerica or Olmec iconography found on locally produced wares — while trade can explain the movement of objects, it does not explain the movement of ideas or styles. Therefore, according to archaeologist Jeffrey Blomster, \"we have to move beyond a purely economic model . . . The fact that trade involves ceramic vessels which display iconography, representing an underlying ideology and religion synthesized by the Gulf Coast Olmec, suggests that something much deeper is at stake than simply maintaining exchange relationships.\"\n\nTo explain the adoption of Olmec iconography and concepts throughout Mesoamerica, archaeologist F. Kent Reilly proposes a \"Middle Form rulers. That is, the styles and the iconography, as well as the artifacts, were used by the rising elites in the Formative chiefdoms to authenticate or to increase their power and prestige.\n\nThis is echoed, among others, by archaeologist Giselle Canto Aguilera. Working at the Zazacatla site in Morelos, she found that the inhabitants of Zazacatla adopted Olmec styles when they changed from a simple, egalitarian society to a more complex, hierarchical one: \"When their society became stratified, the new rulers needed emblems ... to justify their rule over people who used to be their equals.\"\n\nOlmec-influenced objects are found throughout Mesoamerica. The consensus among most, but by no means all, archaeologists and researchers is that Olmecs weren't purely a mother nor a sister to other Mesoamerican cultures, but the hallmarks of the Olmec iconography were developed within the Olmec heartland and that this iconography became, in the words of Michael Coe, an \"all-pervading art style\" throughout Mesoamerica (though Coe himself admits on the same page that there is \"nothing [in the Xochipala figurines ] which would lead into the Olmec pattern\"), promoting a \"powerful, unitary religion\" and an “official ideology”, an ideology that was adopted by distant indigenous chieftains and other elites eager to validate and bolster their claims to privilege.\n\n"}

STRIPLING: What was the other group that you handled? <br><br> MISS BENTLEY: We called it the Perlo group. It was actually an ex-Communist Party unit that I believe had been set up in Washington in the early thirties, and I gather, from what the members of the group told me, that they had been in a minor way collecting information for some years but not in an organized fashion. \n\nMuch useful additional information on the activities of the Perlo group was given by the Venona project. The first Venona transcript referencing the Perlo group gives the names of all the members in clear text, as code names had not yet been assigned.\n\nBentley advised that Jacob Golos informed her he had made contact with a group in Washington, D.C. through Earl Browder. After the death of Golos in 1943, two meetings were arranged with this group in 1944. The first meeting was arranged by Browder and was held in early 1944. The meetings were held in the apartment of John Abt in New York City and Bentley was introduced to four individuals identified as Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Harry Magdoff and Edward Fitzgerald.\n\nOn August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers testified before HUAC: \n\nMR. CHAMBERS: The apparatus was organized with a leading group of seven men, each of whom was a leader of the cell. <br><br> MR. STRIPLING: Could you name the seven individuals ? <br><br> MR.

STRIPLING: When Miss Bentley testified before the committee last Saturday, Mr. Chambers, she mentioned the name of Victor Perlo as being the head of an espionage group. You have named Victor Perlo as a member of the apparatus. <br><br> MR. CHAMBERS: Yes. <br><br>MR. STRIPLING: At that time do you know whether or not Victor Perlo was employed in the Government? <br><br> MR. CHAMBERS: I believe at that time Victor Perlo was employed by the Brookings Institution. <br><br> MR. MUNDT: I think we read his employment record into the record of the hearing while Miss Bentley was testifying, did we not? <br><br> MR. STRIPLING: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I have his employment history here. It is already in the record. <br><br> MR. MUNDT: He was employed with the Government several times? <br><br>MR. STRIPLING: That is true, and was with the Brookings Institution,also.\n\nIn his memoir (1952), Chambers recalled: \n\nA crisis, he (J. Peters) said, had developed in the (Harold Ware) Group (following Ware's accidental death). Victor Perlo believed that he should succeed Ware as Group leader. He was being stubborn and surly about it. All the other members of the leadership believed that Nathan Witt was Ware's natural heir. A deadlock had resulted, for, though the rest might easily have outvoted Perlo, they did not wish to risk trouble in the Group by alienating him. Peters was also for Witt. So was I. But Peters did not wish to use his authority to act against any member of the Group in favor of another member. Peters asked me if I would come in and, since my personal authority was high with the Group, give my reasons why I was for Witt. <br><br> I went in. I said that we must first of all treat the problem that had arisen as Communists, without personalities, and bearing in mind the peculiar nature of underground work and its unusual requirements, especially in the personal character of leadership. I asked Perlo's pardon for observing that he was a tense and nervous man, and that his very belief in his own qualifications for leadership, while perhaps quite justified, would actually be a handicap so long as it was not shared by the rest of the Group. Of course, we Communists did not believe in any mystical rightness of majorities over minorities, but we did believe in practical solutions to practical problems. Witt was acknowledged to be quiet, firm and solid. He had the confidence of all the members of the Group except Perlo. Therefore, I was for Witt. <br><br> Perlo, of course, was unconvinced, but he agreed to abide by discipline. Thereafter, he would scarcely speak to me. Later, according to Elizabeth Bentley, he rose to the leadership he coveted in her espionage group.\n\nThe Perlo group fits into the Venona project information when transcript # 687 of 13 May 1944 is examined. Iskhak Akhmerov in New York City personally prepared a report to MGB headquarters in Moscow advising that some unspecified action had been taken regarding Elizabeth Bentley in accordance with instructions of Earl Browder. Akhmerov then made reference to winter and also to Harry Magdoff. This latter reference was then followed by a statement that in Bentley's opinion \"they\" are reliable. It was also mentioned that no one had interested himself in their possibilities.\n\nThe name Golovin was mentioned, and it was then reported that Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Edward Fitzgerald and Harry Magdoff would take turns coming to New York every two weeks. Akhmerov said Kramer and Fitzgerald knew Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, whose cover name was later changed to \"Robert\".\n\nAllen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev in \"Haunted Wood\", a book written from an examination of KGB Archives in Moscow, report the KGB credits the Perlo group members with having sent, among other items, the following 1945 U.S. Government documents to Moscow:\n\n\"February\"\n\"March\"\n\"April\"\n\"June\"\nData concerning plans for a 1945–1946 aircraft production from the WPB;\n\"August\"\n\"October\"\n\nVictor Perlo headed the Perlo group. Perlo was originally allegedly a member of the Ware group before World War II. After receiving a master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1933, Perlo worked at a number of New Deal government agencies among a group of economists known as \"Harry Hopkins' bright young men.\" The group worked, among other things, for creation and implementation of the WPA jobs program, and helped push through unemployment compensation, the Wagner National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and Social Security. During World War II, Perlo served in several capacities, working first as chief of the Aviation Section of the War Production Board, then in the Office of Price Administration, and later for the Treasury Department. Perlo left the government in 1947. Perlo also worked for the Brookings Institution and wrote \"American Imperialism\". Perlo's code name in Soviet intelligence was \"Eck\" and \"Raid\" appearing in Venona project as \"Raider\".\n\n\n\n"}

Prostitution is an administrative offence and punishable by a fine. Keeping a brothel is a criminal offence and punishable by up to 6 years' imprisonment. In 2017 a draft law proposing to add heavy fines to the punishment for keeping a brothel was before the National Assembly. It has been estimated that there are 25,054 prostitutes in Azerbaijan, some of which are aged 15 to 18. \n\nDuring the Soviet era prostitution was uncommon except for those under the control of the KGB, many of whom were informants.\n\nIn the Badamdar district of the capital, Baku, there are many cafes where prostitutes solicit clients.

{"id": "182010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182010", "title": "Public library", "text": "Public library\n\nA public library is a library that is accessible by the general public and is usually funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by librarians and library paraprofessionals, who are also civil servants.\n\nThere are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries: they are generally supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute); they are governed by a board to serve the public interest; they are open to all, and every community member can access the collection; they are entirely voluntary in that no one is ever forced to use the services provided; and they provide basic services without charge.\n\nPublic libraries exist in many countries across the world and are often considered an essential part of having an educated and literate population. Public libraries are distinct from research libraries, school libraries, and other special libraries in that their mandate is to serve the general public's information needs rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population. Public libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy, quiet study and work areas for students and professionals, or book clubs to encourage appreciation of literature in adults. Public libraries typically allow users to \"borrow\" books and other materials, i.e., take off the premises temporarily; they also have non-circulating reference collections and provide computer and Internet access to patrons.\n\nThe culmination of centuries of advances in the printing press, moveable type, paper, ink, publishing, and distribution, combined with an ever-growing information-oriented middle class, increased commercial activity and consumption, new radical ideas, massive population growth and higher literacy rates forged the public library into the form that it is today.\n\nPublic access to books is not new. Romans made scrolls in dry rooms available to patrons of the baths, and tried with some success to establish libraries within the empire.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the push for truly public libraries, paid for by taxes and run by the state gained force. Matthew Battles states that:\nIt was in these years of class conflict and economic terror that the public library movement swept through Britain, as the nation's progressive elite recognized that the light of cultural and intellectual energy was lacking in the lives of commoners.\n\nPublic libraries were often started with a donation, or were bequeathed to parishes, churches, schools or towns. These social and institutional libraries formed the base of many academic and public library collections of today.\nThe establishment of circulating libraries in the 18th century, by booksellers and publishers provided a means of gaining profit and creating social centers within the community. The circulating libraries not only provided a place to sell books, but also a place to lend books for a price. These circulating libraries provided a variety of materials including the increasingly popular novels. Although the circulating libraries filled an important role in society, members of the middle and upper classes often looked down upon these libraries that regularly sold material from their collections and provided materials that were less sophisticated.\n\nCirculating libraries also charged a subscription fee, however the fees were set to entice their patrons, providing subscriptions on a yearly, quarterly or monthly basis, without expecting the subscribers to purchase a share in the circulating library. This helped patrons who could not afford to buy books, to be able to borrow books to read, and then return. This also created a more popular demand, as book fees were growing, and more books were being copied. Circulating libraries were very popular, the first one was located in 1725, in Edinbrough, Scotland by Allan Ramsay. \n\nCirculating libraries were not exclusively lending institutions and often provided a place for other forms of commercial activity, which may or may not be related to print. This was necessary because the circulating libraries did not generate enough funds through subscription fees collected from its borrowers. As a commerce venture, it was important to consider the contributing factors such as other goods or services available to the subscribers.\n\nThe Malatestiana Library (), also known as the Malatesta Novello Library, is a public library dating from 1452 in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna (Italy). It was the first European civic library, i.e. belonging to the Commune and open to everybody. It was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, Malatesta Novello. The works were directed by Matteo Nuti of Fano (a scholar of Leon Battista Alberti) and lasted from 1447 to 1452.\n\nHistorian Yahya ibn Said al-Antaki (d. 1066) reported that Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (r. 996–1021) financed and established libraries open to the public, where anyone, even the simple laymen, could choose whatever books they wanted and have them copied for them by public scribes, free of charge. However, as many of his other decisions, Al-Hakim later ordered this policy to be reversed. In Cesena Italy, the first community-run public library, the Malatestiana Library, was established in 1447, provided both secular and religious texts in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and was fully open to all members of the public.\nAnother early library that allowed access to the public was that of the Kalendars or Kalendaries, a brotherhood of clergy and laity who were attached to the Church of All-Hallowen or All Saints in Bristol, England. Records show that in 1464, provision was made for a library to be erected in the house of the Kalendars, and reference is made to a deed of that date by which it was \"appointed that all who wish to enter for the sake of instruction shall have 'free access and recess' at certain times\". In the early years of the 17th century, many famous collegiate and town libraries were founded in England. Norwich City library was established in 1608 (six years after Thomas Bodley founded the Bodleian Library, which was open to the \"whole republic of the learned\") and Chetham's Library in Manchester, which claims to be the oldest public library in the English-speaking world, opened in 1653.\n\nClaude Sallier, the French philologist and churchman, operated an early form of public library in the town of Saulieu from 1737 to 1750. He wished to make culture and learning accessible to all people.\n\nThe Załuski Library (, ) was built in Warsaw 1747–1795 by Józef Andrzej Załuski and his brother, Andrzej Stanisław Załuski, both Roman Catholic bishops. The library was open to the public and indeed was the first Polish public library, the biggest in Poland and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.\n\nAt the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks. Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public. In 1790, The Public Library Act would not be passed for another sixty-seven years.\nEven though the British Museum existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, for which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.\n\nHowever, up until the mid 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term, i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all. Only one important library in Britain, namely Chetham's Library in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public. However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis. Subscription libraries, both private and commercial, provided the middle to upper classes with a variety of books for moderate fees.\n\nThe increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial subscription libraries. Commercial subscription libraries began when booksellers began renting out extra copies of books in the mid-18th century. Steven Fischer estimates that in 1790, there were \"about six hundred rental and lending libraries, with a clientele of some fifty thousand\". The mid- to late 18th century saw a virtual epidemic of feminine reading as novels became more and more popular. Novels, while frowned upon in society, were extremely popular. In England there were many who lamented at the \"villanous profane and obscene books\" and the opposition to the circulating library, on moral grounds, persisted well into the 19th century. Still, many establishments must have circulated many times the number of novels as of any other genre.\n\nIn 1797, Thomas Wilson wrote in \"The Use of Circulating Libraries\": \"Consider, that for a successful circulating library, the collection must contain 70% fiction\". However, the overall percentage of novels mainly depended on the proprietor of the circulating library. While some circulating libraries were almost completely novels, others had less than 10% of their overall collection in the form of novels. The national average start of the 20th century hovered around novels comprising about 20% of the total collection. Novels varied from other types of books in many ways. They were read primarily for enjoyment instead of for study. They did not provide academic knowledge or spiritual guidance; thus they were read quickly and far fewer times than other books. These were the perfect books for commercial subscription libraries to lend. Since books were read for pure enjoyment rather than for scholarly work, books needed to become both cheaper and smaller. Small duodecimo editions of books were preferred to the large folio editions. Folio editions were read at a desk, while the small duodecimo editions could be easily read like the paperbacks of today.\n\nMuch like paperbacks of today, many of the novels in circulating libraries were unbound. At this period of time, many people chose to bind their books in leather. Many circulating libraries skipped this process. Circulating libraries were not in the business of preserving books; their owners wanted to lend books as many times as they possibly could. Circulating libraries had ushered in a completely new way of reading. Reading was no longer simply an academic pursuit or an attempt to gain spiritual guidance. Reading became a social activity. Many circulating libraries were attached to the shops of milliners or drapers. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends as coffee shops do today.\nAnother factor in the growth of subscription libraries was the increasing cost of books. In the last two decades of the century, especially, prices were practically doubled, so that a quarto work cost a guinea, an octavo 10 shillings or 12 shillings, and a duodecimo cost 4 shillings per volume. Price apart, moreover, books were difficult to procure outside London, since local booksellers could not afford to carry large stocks. Commercial libraries, since they were usually associated with booksellers, and also since they had a greater number of patrons, were able to accumulate greater numbers of books. The United Public Library was said to have a collection of some 52,000 volumes-–twice as many as any private subscription library in the country at that period. These libraries, since they functioned as a business, also lent books to non-subscribers on a per-book system.\n\nPrivate subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was the \"gentlemen only\" library. The gentlemen's subscription libraries, sometimes known as proprietary libraries, were nearly all organized on a common pattern. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred. The entrance fee, i.e. the purchase price of a share, was in early days usually a guinea, but rose sharply as the century advanced, often reaching four or five guineas during the French wars; the annual subscription, during the same period, rose from about six shillings to ten shillings or more. The book-stock was, by modern standards, small (Liverpool, with over 8,000 volumes in 1801, seems to have been the largest), and was accommodated, at the outset, in makeshift premises–-very often over a bookshop, with the bookseller acting as librarian and receiving an honorarium for his pains.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, former Boston apprentice printer turned Philadelphia printer and publisher, would become a founder of the first American Subscription Library known as The Library Company of Philadelphia. In 1727 he and some friends formed \"a club of mutual improvement,\" as he wrote in his autobiography. Calling themselves the \"Junto\" - meaning a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose - they met on Friday evenings to discuss politics, morals, and natural philosophy, as science was then termed. These men would share what books they possessed between one another through the subscription library.\n\nThe Liverpool Subscription library was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings. An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings. The most popular single work was John Hawkesworth's \"Account of Voyages ... in the Southern Hemisphere\" (3 vols) which was borrowed on 201 occasions. The records also show that in 1796, membership had risen by 1/3 to 198 subscribers (of whom 5 were women) and the titles increased five-fold to 4,987. This mirrors the increase in reading interests. A patron list from the Bath Municipal Library shows that from 1793 to 1799, the library held a stable 30% of their patrons as female.\n\nIt was also uncommon for these libraries to have buildings designated solely as the library building during the 1790s, though in the 19th century, many libraries would begin building elaborate permanent residences. Bristol, Birmingham, and Liverpool were the few libraries with their own building. The accommodations varied from the shelf for a few dozen volumes in the country stationer's or draper's shop, to the expansion to a back room, to the spacious elegant areas of Hookham's or those at the resorts like Scarborough, and four in a row at Margate.\n\nPrivate subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies. Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the 19th century, the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, \"designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes.\" There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings, and the subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.\n\nUnder the terms of the Museums Act of 1845, the municipalities of Warrington and Salford established libraries in their museums. Warrington Municipal Library opened in 1848.\n\nAlthough by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 subscription libraries and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the Public Libraries Act 1850. The Act first gave local boroughs the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the Chartist movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism than by demand from the lower social orders. Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.\n\nIn 1835, and against government opposition, James Silk Buckingham, MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the temperance movement, was able to secure the Chair of the Select Committee which would examine \"the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom\" and propose solutions. Francis Place, a campaigner for the working class, agreed that \"the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford\". Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on William Ewart MP and Joseph Brotherton MP, who introduced a bill which would \"[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums\". This became the Museums Act 1845.\n\nThe advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.\n\nObjections were raised about the increase in taxation, the potential infringement on private enterprise and the existing library provision such as mechanics' institutes and the fear that it would give rise to \"unhealthy social agitation\". The Bill passed through Parliament as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower crime rates.\n\nSalford Museum and Art Gallery first opened in November 1850 as \"The Royal Museum & Public Library\", as the first unconditionally free public library in England. The library in Campfield, Manchester was the first library to operate a \"free\" lending library without subscription in 1852. Norwich lays claim to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries—although not to buy books). Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after Winchester, Manchester, Liverpool, Bolton, Kidderminster, Cambridge, Birkenhead and Sheffield.\n\nThe 1850 Act was noteworthy because it established the principle of free public libraries.\nIn 1866, an amending Act was passed which eliminated entirely the population limit for the establishment of a library and replaced the two-thirds majority previously required for adoption with a simple majority. It also allowed neighbouring parishes to combine with an existing or potential library authority. Despite the rise in the level of tax public libraries could levy, it was still very difficult for boroughs to raise enough capital to fund new libraries. The growth of the public library movement in the wake of the 1850 Act relied heavily on the donations of philanthropists.\n\nCounty libraries were a later development, which were made possible by the establishment of County Councils in 1888. They normally have a large central library in a major town with smaller branch libraries in other towns and a mobile library service covering rural areas.\n\nThe modern public library grew at a great pace at the end of the 19th century especially in the English-speaking world. Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, Henry Tate and Andrew Carnegie, helped to fund the establishment of large numbers of public libraries for the edification of the masses.\n\nPublic libraries in North America developed from the 18th century to today; as the country grew more populous and wealthier, factors such as a push for education and desire to share knowledge led to broad public support for free libraries. In addition, money donations by private philanthropists provided the seed capital to get many libraries started. In some instances, collectors donated large book collections.\n\nThe first modern public library in the world supported by taxes was the Peterborough Town Library in Peterborough, New Hampshire. It was \"established in 1833.\" This was a small public library. The first large public library supported by taxes in the United States was the Boston Public Library, which was established in 1848 but did not open its doors to the public until 1854.\n\nThe Redwood Library and Athenaeum was founded in 1747 by a group led by Abraham Redwood. It was the first library in Rhode Island and the oldest lending library in America. Over half of its volumes were lost when it was used as the British Officers Club during the Revolutionary War. An effort was made to replace the original collection. Over 90% of the volumes lost were returned. The library is still in use.\n\nA total of 1,689 Carnegie libraries were built in the United States between 1883 and 1929, including some belonging to universities. By 1930, half the American public libraries had been built by Carnegie.\n\nThe first public library in Australia was the Melbourne Public Library (now the State Library of Victoria), which opened in 1856, just a few years after their introduction into Britain. This was however purely a reference library. In September 1869, the New South Wales (NSW) government opened as the Free Public Library, Sydney (now the State Library of New South Wales) by purchasing a bankrupt subscription library. In 1896, the Brisbane Public Library was established. The Library's collection, purchased by the Queensland Government from the private collection of Justice Harding. In 1935 the \"Free Library Movement\" was established in New South Wales advocating for free public libraries to be supported by municipal authorities.\n\nThe pioneer of modern public libraries in France was Eugène Morel, a writer and one of the librarians at the Bibliothèque nationale. He put forward his ideas in the 1910 book \"La Librairie publique\".\n\nThe main task of public libraries is to provide the public with access to books and periodicals. The American Library Association (ALA), addresses this role of libraries as part of \"access to information\" and \"equity of access\"; part of the profession's ethical commitment that \"no one should be denied information because he or she cannot afford the cost of a book or periodical, have access to the internet or information in any of its various formats.\"\n\nLibraries typically offer access to thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of books, the majority of which are available for borrowing by anyone with the appropriate library card. A library's selection of books is called its \"collection\", and usually includes a range of popular fiction, classics, nonfiction and reference works, books of public interest or under public discussion, and subscriptions to popular newspapers and magazines. Most libraries offer quiet space for reading, known as reading rooms. Borrowers may also take books home, as long as they return them at a certain time and in good condition. If a borrowed book is returned late, the library may charge a small library fine, though some libraries have eliminated fines in recent years. About two-thirds of libraries now provide access to e-books and digital or digitized periodicals as well as printed books. Many libraries offer assistance to borrowers, to select books, through specialist Readers' Advisory Services librarians. \nPublic libraries also provide books and other materials for children. These items are often housed in a special section known as a children's library and attended to by a specialized children's librarian. Child oriented websites with on-line educational games and programs specifically designed for younger library users are becoming increasingly popular. Services may be provided for other groups, such as large print or Braille materials, Books on tape, young adult literature and other materials for teenagers, or materials in other than the national language (in foreign languages).\n\nLibraries also lend books to each other, a practice known as interlibrary loan. Interlibrary loan allows libraries to provide patrons access to the collections of other libraries, especially rare, infrequently used, specialized and/or out-of-print books. Libraries within the same system, such as a county system, may lend their books to each other, or libraries in different states may even use an interlibrary loan system.\n\nThe selection, purchase and cataloging of books for a collection; the care, repair, and weeding of books; the organization of books in the library; readers' advisory; and the management of membership, borrowing and lending are typical tasks for a public librarian, an information professional with graduate-level education or experience in library and information science.\n\nIn the United States, libraries are responsible for supporting the First Amendment and how it relates to their facilities through policies such as the American Library Association's Library Bill of Rights. The right to freedom of speech and information is significant to public libraries; one way of upholding this doctrine is to protect the privacy of all patrons that belong to a library. The concept of confidentiality is important because the First Amendment may be violated if a patron's information could possibly be shared. Patrons may not feel free to check out certain materials for fear it would later be revealed. Members of society need to be reassured that even if they borrow controversial or embarrassing materials, their privacy will be upheld.\n\nA policy stating a library's view on privacy should be created and displayed where patrons can see when they enter the building. Some libraries require staff to talk about confidentiality or direct the patron to literature on the subject when creating a new library card for patrons.\n\nPart of the public library mission has become attempting to help bridge the digital divide. As more books, information resources, and government services are being provided online (see e-commerce and e-government), public libraries increasingly provide access to the Internet and public computers for users who otherwise would not be able to connect to these services. They can also provide community spaces to encourage the general population to improve their digital skills through Library Coding Clubs and Library makerspace. Almost all public libraries now house a computer lab. Internationally, public libraries offer information and communication technology (ICT) services, giving \"access to information and knowledge\" the \"highest priority\". While different countries and areas of the world have their own requirements, general services offered include free connection to the Internet, training in using the Internet, and relevant content in appropriate languages. In addition to typical public library financing, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and business fund services that assist public libraries in combating the digital divide.\nIn addition to access, many public libraries offer training and support to computer users. Once access has been achieved, there remains a large gap in people's online abilities and skills. For many communities, the public library is the only agency offering free computer classes, information technology learning and an affordable, interactive way to build digital skills. , 91% of libraries offer free wireless Internet to their patrons; 76% offer e-books for borrowing; and 90% offer formal or informal technology training. A significant service provided by public libraries is assisting people with e-government access and use of federal, state and local government information, forms and services.\nIn 2006, 73% percent of library branches reported that they are the only local provider of free public computer and Internet access. A 2008 study found that \"100 percent of rural, high poverty outlets provide public Internet access. Access to computers and the Internet is now nearly as important to library patrons as access to books.\n\nPublic libraries have a long history of functioning as community centers or public spaces for reading, study and formal and informal public meetings. In 1898, Andrew Carnegie, a prominent library philanthropist, built a library in Homestead, Pennsylvania, where his main steel mills were located. Besides a book collection, it included a bowling alley, an indoor swimming pool, basketball courts and other athletic facilities, a music hall, and numerous meeting rooms for local organizations. It sponsored highly successful semi-pro football and baseball teams. Even before the development of the modern public library, subscription libraries were often used as clubs or gathering places. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends, as coffee shops do today. Throughout history, public libraries were touted as alternatives to dance halls or gentleman's clubs, and frequently built, organized and supported because of their equalizing and civilizing influence.\nToday, in-person and on-line programs for reader development, language learning, homework help, free lectures and cultural performances, and other community service programs are common offerings. The library storytime, in which books are read aloud to children and infants, is a cultural touchstone. Most public libraries offer frequent storytimes, often daily or even several times a day for different age groups. Some libraries have begun offering sensory storytimes for children and adults on the autism spectrum. Sensory storytimes give patrons \"more ways to process information\", especially considering people on the autism spectrum are concrete thinkers and/or might have sensory issues to fluorescent lightning or ambient noise other patrons might not notice.\n\nOne of the most popular programs offered in public libraries is \"summer reading\" for children, families, and adults. Summer reading usually includes a list of books to read during summer holidays, as well as performances, book discussions or other celebrations of reading, culture and the humanities. Many libraries offer classes to the community such as tech clinics where patrons can bring in laptops and electronic devices and receive one on one attention in solving their problems and learning how to use them.\nLibraries may also offer free or inexpensive meeting space for community organizations and educational and entrepreneurial activity. The addition of makerspaces in libraries, beginning with the Fayetteville Free Library in 2011, offers the potential for new roles for public spaces and public libraries. Attendance at library programs increased by 22% between 2004 and 2008.\n\nWhile in the past libraries were merely buildings to house their collections, most now utilize their space to offer programs or clubs regularly. Although some libraries will have similar programs with different names, such as book club, writing club or computer programs, most programs will differ based on the specific library and the community they serve. New studies have shown that librarians must research what their specific community needs, “because communities differ, however, the ways libraries implement these services differ as well. The [example of service response] offered at one library may vary significantly from [the same example] offered by another library. The differences are perfectly appropriate if they result from a tailoring of services to address local needs.” Websites like Pinterest have numerous ideas for creating programs for local patrons, while the website Instructables has DIY tutorials, complete with pictures, which is helpful for libraries on a budget. \"Programs in the humanities and the arts that encourage people to think and talk about ethics and values, history, art, poetry, and other cultures are integral to the library’s mission.\"\n\nThe New York Public Library has over 93,000 programs offered to its patrons every year at its 87 different branches. Some adult programs include Excel classes, writing club, adult coloring club, chess club, knitting club, and a jewelry making class.\n\nThe Albuquerque Bernalillo County Library has an adult coloring club, a crochet/knitting/sewing club, a gardening club, a bead and string class, and a bilingual computer class.\n\nThe Tampa–Hillsborough County Public Library System has 31 branches that offer the usual book clubs and writing clubs for adults. However, they also offer an early morning walking club, chair yoga classes, beginning computer classes, genealogy classes, walk-in tech help, and a coffee and French talk class.\n\nThe Orange County Library System offers numerous teen activities such as a Maker/DIY program, Audio Equipment Training, Sewing classes, Knitting classes, ESL classes, Chess club, and more.\n\nThe Springfield Greene County Library has writing and book clubs as well as a tech training class, board game nights, movie nights, craft classes, and a My Little Pony club. \n\nThe Pikes Peak Library District has math tutors for their teen patrons. They also offer writing and book clubs, a Dungeons and Dragons club, a coding lab, an anime club, guided meditation, and an occasional Super Smash Bros. Tournament.\n\nThe Belmont Public Library offers an array of children’s programs including story times for various age groups, concerts, music classes, puppet shows, a maker club, and sing-along Saturdays.\n\nThe Saratoga Springs Public Library also has numerous story times as well as Yoga for children, parent/child workshops, Spanish workshops, a read-to-a-dog program, and a Kindness club.\n\nThe Chelmsford Public Library has a plethora of story times for ages birth to preschool. They also offer baby yoga, stay and play time, toddler rhyme time, a dads and donuts day, and an annual Gingerbread Festival.\n\nA significant goal in American libraries is to become more culturally diverse throughout the country. Public libraries are an equal access facility and want to make everyone feel welcome no matter the religion, race, ethnicity, sex, or financial status. To accomplish this goal, libraries are striving to find ways in which to make both staff and the library programs they provide more culturally sensitive. \nA starting point for most libraries is to find out the demographics in which they are located. Once the library system learns more about the community they serve, they can start building a collection and programs around it. Another suggestion from multiple experts says to hire staff that represents the society that the library is located in order to better relate and serve members of that society.\nBy making culturally diverse programs, a library can be inviting to many members of the community. A few ways libraries accomplish this goal are by providing programs which are inclusive to many different cultures such as having lectures or events in different languages, including celebrations and holidays that are diverse, and by inviting speakers and authors from different cultures to come and talk. \n\nLibrarians at most public libraries provide reference and research help to the general public. This can include assisting students in finding reliable sources for papers and presentations; helping the public find answers to questions or evidence in a debate; or providing resources related to a specific event or topic. Reference assistance is usually provided through a reference interview which is usually conducted at a public reference desk but may also be conducted by telephone or online. Reference librarians may also help patrons develop an appropriate bibliography or works cited page for an academic paper. Depending on the size of the library, there may be multiple reference desks that deal with different topics. Large public, academic or research libraries may employ librarians that are experts in specific topics or subjects. Often the children's section in a public library has its own reference desk. On the other hand, at a smaller library, circulation and reference may occur at the same desk.\nThe Internet has had a significant effect on the availability and delivery of reference services. Many reference works, such as the Encyclopædia Britannica, have moved entirely online, and the way people access and use these works has changed dramatically in recent decades. The rise of search engines and crowd-sourced resources such as Wikipedia have transformed the reference environment. In addition to the traditional reference interview, reference librarians have an increasing role in providing access to digitized reference works (including the selection and purchase of databases not available to the general public) and ensuring that references are reliable and presented in an academically acceptable manner. Librarians also have a role in teaching information literacy, so that patrons can find, understand and use information and finding aids like search engines, databases and library catalogs.\n\nPublic libraries may answer millions of reference questions every year. For example, the Boston Public Library answers more than one million reference questions annually.\n\nIn addition to their circulating collection, public libraries usually offer a collection of reference books, such encyclopedias, dictionaries, phone books and unique or expensive academic works. These books may not be available for borrowing, except under special circumstances. Reference books that are frequently used, such as phone books, may be housed in a special section called \"ready reference.\"\n\nSome libraries also keep historical documents relevant to their particular town, and serve as a resource for historians in some instances. For example, the Queens Public Library kept letters written by unrecognized Tiffany lamp designer Clara Driscoll, and the letters remained in the library until a curator discovered them. Some libraries may also serve as archives or government depositories, preserving historic newspapers, property records or government documents. Collections of unique or historical works are sometimes referred to as special collections; except in rare cases, these items are reference items, and patrons must use them inside the library under the supervision or guidance of a librarian. Local libraries' special collections may be of particular interest to people researching their family history. Libraries that are focused on collecting works related to particular families are genealogical libraries and may be housed in the same building as a public library.\nMany libraries—especially large, urban libraries—have large collections of photographs, digital images, rare and fragile books, artifacts and manuscripts available for public viewing and use. Digitization and digital preservation of these works is an ongoing effort, usually funded by grants or philanthropy. In 2005, the New York Public Library offered the \"NYPL Digital Gallery\" which made a collection of 275,000 images viewable over the web; while most of the contents are in the public domain, some images are still subject to copyright rules. Limited funding, copyright restrictions, a lack of expertise or poor provenance are barriers to the large-scale digitization of libraries' special collections.\n\nDepending on a community's desires and needs, public libraries may offer many other resources and services to the public. In addition to print books and periodicals, most public libraries today have a wide array of other media including audiobooks, e-books, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, and DVDs. In 2015, certain libraries started to stock general materials for borrowing, such as pots, pans, sewing machines, and similar household items in order to appeal to a larger population. Collections of books and academic research related to the local town or region are common, along with collections of works by local authors. Libraries' storage space and lending systems may be used to lend a wide range of materials, including works of art, cake pans, seeds, tools and musical instruments. Similar to museums and other cultural institutions, libraries may also host exhibits or exhibitions.\n\nAs more government services move online, libraries and librarians have a role in providing access to online forms and assistance with filling them out. For example, in 2013, American public libraries were promoted as a way for people to access online health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.\nIn rural areas, the local public library may have a bookmobile service, consisting of one or more buses or pack animals (such as burros, camels, donkey, or elephants) furnished as small public libraries, some equipped with Internet access points or computer labs, and serving the countryside according to a regular schedule. In communities that are extremely isolated or that have poor digital infrastructure, libraries may provide the only access to online education, telemedicine, or telework. Libraries also partner with schools and community organizations to promote literacy and learning.\n\n24-hour library access has been piloted in certain public libraries in North America, such as the Pioneer Library System's Norman Public Library in Oklahoma and Ottawa Public Library in Ontario. Such access may involve anywhere from a \"library vending machine\", in which print books are mechanically vended to (and dispensed from) patrons, to reduced staff during the night and early morning hours.\n\nLibraries promote cultural awareness; in Newark, New Jersey, the public library celebrated black history with exhibits and programs. One account suggested libraries were essential to \"economic competitiveness\" as well as \"neighborhood vitality\" and help some people find jobs.\nLibraries have in important role during emergencies and disasters, where they may be used as shelters, provide space to charge phones and access the Internet, and serve as locations for the distribution of aid, especially financial aid, which requires access to computers and the Internet. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency recognizes libraries as providing essential community service during times of disaster. Libraries have also had in increasingly important economic role during the recession, providing job search assistance, computer skills training and resume help to patrons.\n\nThe establishment or development of a public library involves creating a legal authorization and governing structure, building a collection of books and media, as well as securing reliable funding sources, especially government sources. Most public libraries are small, serving a population of under 25,000, and are (or were) established in response to specific local needs. In \"A Library Primer\", John Cotton Dana's 1899 work on the establishment and management of libraries in the United States, Dana wrote:\nEach community has different needs, and begins its library under different conditions. Consider then, whether you need most a library devoted chiefly to the work of helping the schools, or one to be used mainly for reference, or one that shall run largely to periodicals and be not much more than a reading room, or one particularly attractive to girls and women, or one that shall not be much more than a cheerful resting-place, attractive enough to draw man and boy from street corner and saloon. Decide this question early, that all effort may be concentrated to one end, and that your young institution may suit the community in which it is to grow, and from which it is to gain its strength.\nAfter being established and funded through a resolution, public referendum or similar legal process, the library is usually managed by a board of directors, library council or other local authority. A librarian is designated as the library director or library manager. In small municipalities, city or county government may serve as the library board and there may be only one librarian involved in the management and direction of the library. Library staff who are not involved in management are known in the United States and some other English-speaking countries as \"library paraprofessionals\" or \"library support staff.\" They may or may not have formal education in library and information science. Support staff have important roles in library collection development, cataloging, technical support, and the process of preparing books for borrowing. All of these tasks may be referred to as \"technical services\", whether or not they involve information technology. While the library's governing board has ultimate authority to establish policy, many other organizations may participate in library management or library fundraising, including civic and voluntary associations, women's clubs, Friends of the Library groups, and groups established to advise the library on the purchase and retention of books.\n\nState and national governments may also have a role in the establishment and organization of public libraries. Many governments operate their own large libraries for public and legislative use (e.g., state libraries, the Library of Congress, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, etc.). These governments can also influence local libraries by reserving formal recognition or funding for libraries that meet specific requirements. Finally, associations of library and information professionals, such as the American Library Association (ALA) and the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) help establish norms and standard procedures, secure funding, advocate at the state or national level and certify library schools or information schools.\n\nPublic libraries are funded through a wide combination of sources, the most significant which is usually local or municipal funding. The citizens who use a local library support it via the city or county government, or through a special-purpose district, which is a local government body that has independent leadership and may levy its own taxes. Local funding may be supplemented by other government funding. For example, in the United States, the state and federal governments provide supplementary funding for public libraries through state aid programs, the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) and E-Rate. State and local governments may also offer cities and counties large grants for library construction or renovation. Private philanthropy has also had a significant role in the expansion and transformation of library services, and, like other educational institutions, some libraries may be partially funded by an endowment. Some proactive librarians have devised alliances with patron and civic groups to supplement their financial situations. Library \"friends\" groups, activist boards, and well organized book sales also supplement government funding.\n\nPublic funding has always been an important part of the definition of a public library. However, with local governments facing financial pressures due to the Great Recession, some libraries have explored ways supplement public funding. Cafes, bakeries, bookstores, gift shops and similar commercial endeavors are common features of new and urban libraries. For example, the Boston Public Library has two restaurants and an online store which features reproductions of photographs and artwork. Pressure on funding has also led to closer partnerships between libraries, and between libraries and for-profit ventures, in order to sustain the library as a public space while providing business opportunities to the community. While still fairly uncommon, public-private partnerships and \"mixed-use\" or \"dual-use\" libraries, which provide services to the public and one or more student populations, are occasionally explored as alternatives. Jackson County, Oregon (US), closed its entire 15-branch public library system for six months in 2007, reopening with under a public-private partnership and a reduced schedule. Small fees, such as library fines or printing fees, may also offset the cost of providing library services, though fines and fees do not usually have a significant role in library funding.\n\nAlthough usage of public libraries has increased significantly in recent decades, libraries are under intense financial pressure and scrutiny. The American Library Association says media reports it has compiled in 2004 showed some $162 million in funding cuts to libraries nationwide. In 2009, 40% of states reported a decline in state aid for libraries. In 2012, Great Britain lost over 200 libraries to budget cuts, part of a general trend of fiscal austerity in Europe. However, there are signs of stabilization in library funding. , funding for construction and renovation of new libraries remains steady. Cities' plans to close public libraries are frequently cancelled or scaled back. In 2012, voters in 13 U.S. states approved new funding for library construction or operations. And in the UK, the new Library of Birmingham, opened in 2013, is the largest cultural space in Europe.\n\nSurvey data suggests the public values free public libraries. A Public Agenda survey in 2006 reported 84% of the public said maintaining free library services should be a top priority for their local library. Public libraries received higher ratings for effectiveness than other local services such as parks and police. But the survey also found the public was mostly unaware of financial difficulties facing their libraries. In various cost-benefit studies libraries continue to provide returns on the taxpayer dollar far higher than other municipal spending. A 2008 survey discusses comprehensively the prospects for increased funding in the United States, saying in conclusion \"There is sufficient, but latent, support for increased library funding among the voting population.\" A 2013 Pew Research Center survey reported that 90% of Americans ages 16 and older said that the closing of their local public library would affect their community, with 63% saying it would have a \"major\" impact.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45519", "title": "Seven deadly sins", "text": "Seven deadly sins\n\nThe seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).\n\nThis classification originated with the desert fathers, especially Evagrius Ponticus, who identified seven or eight evil thoughts or spirits that one needed to overcome. Evagrius' pupil John Cassian, with his book \"The Institutes,\" brought the classification to Europe, where it became fundamental to Catholic confessional practices as evident in penitential manuals, sermons like \"The Parson's Tale\" from Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales,\" and artworks like Dante's \"Purgatory\" (where the penitents of Mount Purgatory are depicted as being grouped and penanced according to the worst capital sin they committed). The Catholic Church used the concept of the deadly sins in order to help people curb their inclination towards evil before dire consequences and misdeeds could occur; the leader-teachers especially focused on pride (which is thought to be the sin that severs the soul from Grace, and the one that is representative and the very essence of all evil) and greed, both of which are seen as inherently sinful and as underlying all other sins to be prevented. To inspire people to focus on the seven deadly sins, the vices are discussed in treatises and depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on Catholic churches as well as older textbooks.\n\nWhile the seven deadly sins as we know them did not originate with the Greeks or Romans, there were ancient precedents for them. Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\" lists several positive, healthy human qualities, excellences, or virtues. Aristotle argues that for each positive quality there are two negative vices that are found on each extreme of the virtue. Courage, for example, is the human excellence or virtue in facing fear and risk. Excessive courage makes one rash, while a deficiency of courage makes one cowardly. This principle of virtue found in the middle or \"mean\" between excess and deficiency is Aristotle's notion of the golden mean. Aristotle lists virtues like courage, temperance or self-control, generosity, \"greatness of soul,\" proper response to anger, friendliness, and wit or charm.\n\nRoman writers like Horace extolled the value of virtue while listing and warning against vices. His first epistles says that \"to flee vice is the beginning of virtue, and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom.\"\n\nThe modern concept of the seven deadly sins is linked to the works of the fourth-century monk Evagrius Ponticus, who listed eight \"evil thoughts\" in Greek as follows:\n\n\nThey were translated into the Latin of Western Christianity (largely due to the writings of John Cassian), thus becoming part of the Western tradition's spiritual pietas (or Catholic devotions), as follows:\n\nThese \"evil thoughts\" can be categorized into three types:\n\n\nIn AD 590 Pope Gregory I revised this list to form the more common list. Gregory combined \"tristitia\" with \"acedia\", and \"vanagloria\" with \"superbia\", and added \"envy,\" in Latin, \"invidia\". Gregory's list became the standard list of sins. Thomas Aquinas uses and defends Gregory's list in his \"Summa Theologica\" although he calls them the \"capital sins\" because they are the head and form of all the others. The Anglican Communion, Lutheran Church, and Methodist Church, among other Christian denominations, continue to retain this list. Moreover, modern day evangelists, such as Billy Graham have explicated the seven deadly sins.\n\nMost of the capital sins, with the sole exception of sloth, are defined by Dante Alighieri as perverse or corrupt versions of love for something or another: lust, gluttony, and greed are all excessive or disordered love of good things; sloth is a deficiency of love; wrath, envy, and pride are perverted love directed toward other's harm. In the seven capital sins are seven ways of eternal death. The capital sins from lust to envy are generally associated with pride, which has been labeled as the father of all sins, etc.\n\nLust, or lechery (Latin, \"luxuria\" (carnal)), is intense longing. It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire, which leads to fornication, adultery, rape, bestiality, un-natural sexual practices and other immoral sexual acts. However, lust could also mean simply desire in general; thus, lust for money, power, and other things are sinful. In accordance with the words of Henry Edward Manning, the impurity of lust transforms one into \"a slave of the devil\".\n\nLust, if not managed properly, can subvert propriety.\n\nGerman philosopher Schopenhauer wrote as follows:\n\nDante defined lust as the disordered love for individuals, thus possessing at least the redeeming feature of mutuality, unlike the graver sins, which constitute an increasingly agonised focusing upon the solitary self (a process begun with the more serious sin of gluttony). It is generally thought to be the least serious capital sin as it is an abuse of a faculty that humans share with animals, and sins of the flesh are less grievous than spiritual sins (love excessive, not love turning ever further awry toward hatred of man and God). \n\nIn Dante's \"Purgatorio\", the penitents walk deliberately through the purifying flames of the uppermost of the terraces of Mount Purgatory so as to purge themselves of lustful thoughts and feelings and finally win the right to reach the Earthly Paradise at the summit. In Dante's \"Inferno\", unforgiven souls guilty of the sin of lust are whirled around for all eternity in a perpetual tempest, symbolic of the passions by which, through lack of self-control, they were buffeted helplessly about in their earthly lives.\n\nGluttony (Latin, ) is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste. The word derives from the Latin \"gluttire\", meaning to gulp down or swallow.\n\nIn Christianity, it is considered a sin if the excessive desire for food causes it to be withheld from the needy.\n\nBecause of these scripts, gluttony can be interpreted as selfishness; essentially placing concern with one's own impulses or interests above the well-being or interests of others.\n\nDuring times of famine, war, and similar periods when food is scarce, it is possible for one to indirectly kill other people through starvation just by eating too much or even too soon.\n\nMedieval church leaders (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) took a more expansive view of gluttony, arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals, and the constant eating of delicacies and excessively costly foods. Aquinas went so far as to prepare a list of five ways to commit gluttony, comprising:\n\n\nOf these, \"ardenter\" is often considered the most serious, since it is extreme attachment to the pleasure of mere eating, which can make the committer eat impulsively; absolutely and without qualification live merely to eat and drink; lose attachment to health-related, social, intellectual, and spiritual pleasures; and lose proper judgement: an example is Esau selling his birthright for ordinary food of bread and pottage of lentils. His punishment was that of the \"profane person . . . who, for a morsel of meat sold his birthright.\" We learn that \"he found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears.\" \n\nGreed (Latin, ), also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness, is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of desire. However, greed (as seen by the Church) is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions. Thomas Aquinas wrote, \"Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.\" In Dante's Purgatory, the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated excessively on earthly thoughts. Hoarding of materials or objects, theft and robbery, especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by Greed. Such misdeeds can include simony, where one attempts to purchase or sell sacraments, including Holy Orders and, therefore, positions of authority in the Church hierarchy.\n\nIn the words of Henry Edward, avarice \"plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god.\"\n\nAs defined outside Christian writings, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs, especially with respect to material wealth. Like pride, it can lead to not just some, but all evil.\n\nSloth (Latin, \"tristitia\" or (\"without care\")) refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states. It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.\n\nIn his \"Summa Theologica\", Saint Thomas Aquinas defined sloth as \"sorrow about spiritual good\".\n\nThe scope of sloth is wide. Spiritually, \"acedia\" first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to God. Mentally, \"acedia\" has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, \"acedia\" is fundamentally associated with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in laziness, idleness, and indolence.\n\nSloth includes ceasing to utilize the seven gifts of grace given by the Holy Spirit (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Knowledge, Piety, Fortitude, and Fear of the Lord); such disregard may lead to the slowing of one's spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of charity towards the neighbor, and to animosity towards those who love God.\n\nSloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do. By this definition, evil exists when \"good\" people fail to act.\n\nEdmund Burke (1729–1797) wrote in \"Present Discontents\" (II. 78) \"No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united Cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\"\n\nUnlike the other capital sins, which are sins of committing immorality, sloth is a sin of omitting responsibilities. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.\n\nEmotionally and cognitively, the evil of \"acedia\" finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. \"Acedia\" takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From \"tristitia\", asserted Gregory the Great, \"there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair...\" Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of \"acedia\", counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and \"wrawnesse\", the last variously translated as \"anger\" or better as \"peevishness\". For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. \"Acedia\" in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.\n\nSloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders the man in his righteous undertakings and thus becomes a terrible source of human's undoing.\n\nIn his \"Purgatorio\" Dante portrayed the penance for acedia as running continuously at top speed.\n\nDante describes acedia as the \"failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul\"; to him it was the \"middle sin\", the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.\n\nWrath (Latin, ) can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance. In its purest form, wrath presents with injury, violence, and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of wrath can manifest in different ways, including impatience, hateful misanthropy, revenge, and self-destructive behavior, such as drug abuse or suicide.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it's directed against an innocent person, when it's unduly strong or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. \"If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin.\" (CCC 2302) Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm. (CCC 2302-03)\n\nPeople feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are certain someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or cope with it.\n\nIn her introduction to Purgatory, Dorothy L. Sayers describes wrath as \"love of justice perverted to revenge and spite\".\n\nIn accordance with Henry Edward, angry people are \"slaves to themselves\".\n\nEnvy (Latin, ), like greed and lust, is characterized by an insatiable desire. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else. It arises from vainglory, and severs a man from his neighbor.\n\nMalicious envy is similar to jealousy in that they both feel discontent towards someone's traits, status, abilities, or rewards. A difference is that the envious also desire the entity and covet it. Envy can be directly related to the Ten Commandments, specifically, \"Neither shall you covet... anything that belongs to your neighbour\" - a statement that may also be related to greed. Dante defined envy as \"a desire to deprive other men of theirs\". In Dante's Purgatory, the punishment for the envious is to have their eyes sewn shut with wire because they gained sinful pleasure from seeing others brought low. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another's reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either \"joy at another's misfortune\" (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or \"grief at another's prosperity\" (if he fails); the third stage is hatred because \"sorrow causes hatred\" .\n\nEnvy is said to be the motivation behind Cain murdering his brother, Abel, as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.\n\nBertrand Russell said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness, bringing sorrow to committers of envy whilst giving them the urge to inflict pain upon others.\n\nIn accordance with the most widely accepted views, only pride weighs down the soul more than envy among the capital sins. Just like pride, envy has been associated directly with the devil, for Wisdom 2:24 states:\" the envy of the devil brought death to the world,\".\n\nPride (Latin, ) is considered, on almost every list, the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins: the perversion of the faculties that make humans more like God—dignity and holiness. It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins. Also known as hubris (from ancient Greek ), or futility, it is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of other people.\n\nIn even more destructive cases, it is irrationally believing that one is essentially and necessarily better, superior, or more important than others, failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and excessive admiration of the personal image or self (especially forgetting one's own lack of divinity, and refusing to acknowledge one's own limits, faults, or wrongs as a human being).\n\nAs pride has been labelled the father of all sins, it has been deemed the devil's most prominent trait. C.S. Lewis writes, in \"Mere Christianity\", that pride is the \"anti-God\" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: \"Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.\" Pride is understood to sever the spirit from God, as well as His life-and-grace-giving Presence.\n\nOne can be prideful for different reasons. Author Ichabod Spencer states that \"[s]piritual pride is the worst kind of pride, if not worst snare of the devil. The heart is particularly deceitful on this one thing.\" Jonathan Edwards said \"[r]emember that pride is the worst viper that is in the heart, the greatest disturber of the soul's peace and sweet communion with Christ; it was the first sin that ever was, and lies lowest in the foundation of Satan's whole building, and is the most difficultly rooted out, and is the most hidden, secret and deceitful of all lusts, and often creeps in, insensibly, into the midst of religion and sometimes under the disguise of humility.\"\n\nIn Ancient Athens, hubris was considered one of the greatest crimes and was used to refer to insolent contempt that can cause one to use violence to shame the victim. This sense of hubris could also characterize rape. Aristotle defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for the committer's own gratification. The word's connotation changed somewhat over time, with some additional emphasis towards a gross over-estimation of one's abilities.\n\nThe term has been used to analyse and make sense of the actions of contemporary heads of government by Ian Kershaw (1998), Peter Beinart (2010) and in a much more physiological manner by David Owen (2012). In this context the term has been used to describe how certain leaders, when put to positions of immense power, seem to become irrationally self-confident in their own abilities, increasingly reluctant to listen to the advice of others and progressively more impulsive in their actions.\n\nDante's definition of pride was \"love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour\".\n\nPride is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999).\nAs one might expect, pride is not always associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of pride have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).\n\nPride is generally associated with an absence of humility. It may also be associated with a lack of knowledge. John Gay states that \"By ignorance is pride increased; They most assume who know the least.\"\n\nIn accordance with the Sirach's author's wording, the heart of a proud man is \"like a partridge in its cage acting as a decoy; like a spy he watches for your weaknesses. He changes good things into evil, he lays his traps. Just as a spark sets coals on fire, the wicked man prepares his snares in order to draw blood. Beware of the wicked man for he is planning evil. He might dishonor you forever.\" In another chapter, he says that \"the acquisitive man is not content with what he has, wicked injustice shrivels the heart.\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin said \"In reality there is, perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as \"pride\". Disguise it, struggle with it, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history. For even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\" Joseph Addison states that \"There is no passion that steals into the heart more imperceptibly and covers itself under more disguises than pride.\"\n\nThe proverb \"pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall\" (from the biblical Book of Proverbs, 16:18)(or pride goeth before the fall) is thought to sum up the modern use of pride. Pride is also referred to as \"pride that blinds,\" as it often causes a committer of pride to act in foolish ways that belie common sense. In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, \"that pride that goes just before the fall.\" In his two-volume biography of Adolf Hitler, historian Ian Kershaw uses both 'hubris' and 'nemesis' as titles. The first volume, \"Hubris\", describes Hitler's early life and rise to political power. The second, \"Nemesis\", gives details of Hitler's role in the Second World War, and concludes with his fall and suicide in 1945.\n\nMuch of the 10th and part of 11th chapter of the Book of Sirach discusses and advises about pride, hubris, and who is rationally worthy of honor. It goes:\n\nJacob Bidermann's medieval miracle play, \"Cenodoxus\", pride is the deadliest of all the sins and leads directly to the damnation of the titulary famed Parisian doctor. In Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", the penitents are burdened with stone slabs on their necks to keep their heads bowed.\n\nAcedia (Latin, \"without care\") (from Greek ἀκηδία) is the neglect to take care of something that one should do. It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to melancholy: \"acedia\" describes the behaviour and \"melancholy\" suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God; by contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in time of need.\n\nAcēdia is negative form of the Greek term κηδεία, which has a more restricted usage. 'Kēdeia' refers specifically to spousal love and respect for the dead. The positive term 'kēdeia' thus indicates love for one's family, even through death. It also indicates love for those outside one's immediate family, specifically forming a new family with one's \"beloved.\" Seen in this way, 'acēdia' indicates a rejection of familial love. Nonetheless, the meaning of 'acēdia' is far more broad, signifying indifference to everything one experiences.\n\nPope Gregory combined this with \"tristitia\" into sloth for his list. When Thomas Aquinas described \"acedia\" in his interpretation of the list, he described it as an \"uneasiness of the mind\", being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability. Dante refined this definition further, describing acedia as the \"failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul\"; to him it was the \"middle sin\", the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.\n\nAcedia is currently defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as spiritual sloth, which would be believing spiritual tasks to be too difficult. In the fourth century, Christian monks believed acedia was not primarily caused by laziness, but by a state of depression that caused spiritual detachment. \n\nVainglory (Latin, ) is unjustified boasting. Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded \"vainglory\" into pride for his listing of sins. According to Thomas Aquinas, it is the progenitor of envy.\n\nThe Latin term \"gloria\" roughly means \"boasting\", although its English cognate – \"glory\" – has come to have an exclusively positive meaning; historically, the term \"vain\" roughly meant \"futile\" (a meaning retained in the modern expression \"in vain\"), but by the 14th century had come to have the strong narcissistic undertones, that it still retains today. As a result of these semantic changes, \"vainglory\" has become a rarely used word in itself, and is now commonly interpreted as referring to \"vanity\" (in its modern narcissistic sense).\n\nWith Christianity, historic Christian denominations such as the Catholic Church and Protestant Churches, including the Lutheran Church, recognize seven virtues, which correspond inversely to each of the seven deadly sins. \nConfession is the act of admitting the commission of a sin to a priest, who in turn will forgive the person in the name (in the person) of Christ, give a penance to (partially) make up for the offense, and advise the person on what he or she should do afterwards.\n\nAccording to a 2009 study by Fr Roberto Busa, a Jesuit scholar, the most common deadly sin confessed by men is supposedly lust, and by women, pride. It was unclear whether these differences were due to the actual number of transgressions committed by each sex, or whether differing views on what \"counts\" or should be confessed caused the observed pattern.\n\nThe second book of Dante's epic poem \"The Divine Comedy\" is structured around the seven deadly sins. The most serious sins, found at the lowest level, are the abuses of the most divine faculty. For Dante and other thinkers, a human's rational faculty makes humans more like God. Abusing that faculty with pride or envy weighs down the soul the most. Abusing one's passions with wrath or a lack of passion as with sloth also weighs down the soul but not as much as the abuse of one's rational faculty. Finally, abusing one's desires to have one's physical needs met via greed, gluttony, or lust abuses a faculty that humans share with animals. This is still an abuse that weighs down the soul, but it does not weigh it down like other abuses. Thus, the top levels of the Mountain of Purgatory have the top listed sins, while the lowest levels have the more serious sins of wrath, envy, and pride.\n\n\nThe last tale of the Canterbury Tales, the \"Parson's Tale\" is not a tale but a sermon that the parson gives against the seven deadly sins. This sermon brings together many common ideas and images about the seven deadly sins. This tale and Dante's work both show how the seven deadly sins were used for confessional purposes or as a way to identify, repent of, and find forgiveness for one's sins.\n\nThe Dutch artist created a series of prints showing each of the seven deadly sins. Each print features a central, labeled image that represents the sin. Around the figure are images that show the distortions, degenerations, and destructions caused by the sin. Many of these images come from contemporary Dutch aphorisms.\n\nSpenser's work, which was meant to educate young people to embrace virtue and avoid vice, includes a colourful depiction of the House of Pride. Lucifera, the lady of the house, is accompanied by advisers who represent the other seven deadly sins.\n\nThe seven sins are personified and they give a confession to the personification of Repentance. Only pride is represented by a woman, the others all represented by male characters.\n\nThis work satirized capitalism and its painful abuses as its central character, the victim of a split personality, travels to seven different cities in search of money for her family. In each city she encounters one of the seven deadly sins, but those sins ironically reverse one's expectations. When the character goes to Los Angeles, for example, she is outraged by injustice, but is told that wrath against capitalism is a sin that she must avoid.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1949, the American painter Paul Cadmus created a series of vivid, powerful, and gruesome paintings of each of the seven deadly sins.\n\nFerdinand Mount maintains that liquid currentness, especially through tabloids, has surprisingly given valor to vices, causing society to regress into that of primitive pagans: \"covetousness has been rebranded as retail therapy, sloth is downtime, lust is exploring your sexuality, anger is opening up your feelings, vanity is looking good because you're worth it and gluttony is the religion of foodies\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23796563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23796563", "title": "Sexual consent", "text": "Sexual consent\n\nSexual consent is consent to engage in sexual activity. Sexual activity without consent is considered rape or other sexual assault. In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that society must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than \"no means no\" or \"\". Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.\n\nIn Canada \"consent means…the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity\" without abuse or exploitation of \"trust, power or authority\", coercion or threats. Consent can also be revoked at any moment.\n\nSince the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of \"yes means yes\" and affirmative models, such as Hall's definition: \"the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment.\" Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be \"free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness' to engage in sexual activity.\" Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the \"yes means yes\", or in the \"no means no\", model.\nWithin the scholarly literature, definitions surrounding consent and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus. Dr James Roffee, a senior lecturer in criminology in the Monash University School of Social Sciences, argues that legal definition needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrates how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime. Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting. Similarly, some minors under the legal age of consent may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However, the law does not view this as legitimate. While there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align.\n\nSome individuals are unable to give consent, or even if they can verbally indicate that they consent, they are deemed to lack the ability to make informed or full consent (e.g., minors below the age of consent or an intoxicated person). People may also consent to unwanted sexual activity. \n\nIn Canada, implied consent has not been a defence for sexual assault since the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada case of \"R v Ewanchuk\", where the court unanimously ruled that consent has to be explicit, instead of merely \"implied\". In the United States, the defense may a chance to convince the court that consent was in some way implied by the victim. Many actions can be perceived by the court as implied consent: having a previous relationship with the alleged rapist (e.g. befriending, dating, cohabitating, or marrying), consenting to sexual contact on previous occasions, flirting, or wearing \"provocative\" clothing.\n\nUnwanted sexual activity can involve rape or other sexual assault, but it may also be distinguished from them. Jesse Ford, the author of a 2018 study that showed that men are having unwanted sex with women to \"prove they are not gay\", states that \"[a]ll sexual assault is unwanted sex, but not all unwanted sex is sexual assault.\"\n\nThere can be verbal or nonverbal consent, or a mix of the two types, depending on different policies and laws. According to \"Bustle\" writer Kae Burdo, \"only verbal consent counts\". Dartmouth College's rules on consent state that a communication in intimate encounters is often nonverbal cues such as smiling, nodding, and touching another person; however, it states that \"...body language often isn't enough\" because interpreting body language is risky, so the best option is to use \"explicit verbal communication\". \"The New York Times\" reports that men typically use nonverbal indicators to determine consent (61 percent say they perceive consent through a partner's body language), but women typically wait till a partner verbally asks them before they indicate consent (only 10 percent say they indicate consent through body language), a differing approach that may lead to confusion in heterosexual couples' encounters.\n\nBurdo does acknowledge that BDSM situations in which a participant has voluntarily put on a gag or has agreed to be in subspace make it hard to consent verbally. As well, some people have disabilities which make it impossible to speak and give verbal consent. In cases of BDSM or speech-affecting disabilities, Burdo suggests using \"clear, nonverbal consent\". Mary Spellman, the dean of students at Claremont McKenna College, states that her college allows either verbal or non-verbal consent, with non-verbal consent being assessed by looking at whether the other person is \"actively participating\" and touching the other person when he is touching her or encouraging the first person\", signs which indicate that a \"...person is an active participant in whatever is going on.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Dot\" states that verbal consent is best because both participants can clearly indicate what they want, ask questions and seek clarification; in contrast, nonverbal consent is may not be clear, as people \"...have different understandings of gestures, “vibes,” and nonverbal cues\", which can lead to \"ambiguity and misunderstanding\". Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist and neuroscientist, states that in a sexual consent context, \"[f]ace and body movements aren’t a language\" that participants can rely on, because the human \"brain is always guessing\" about how to interpret smiles and expressions; as such, \"...facial movements are terrible indicators of consent, rejection and emotion in general\" and they are \"not a replacement for words.\"\n\nChildren or minors below a certain age, the age of sexual consent in that jurisdiction, are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. The age of consent is the age below which a minor is considered to be legally incompetent to consent to sexual acts. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a minor younger than the age of consent cannot claim that the sexual activity was consensual, and such sexual activity may be considered statutory rape. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim and his or her sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances. Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a position of trust; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age.\n\nLikewise, persons with Alzheimer's disease or similar disabilities may be unable to give legal consent to sexual relations even with their spouse. New York does not consider it to be consent in cases where people have a physical disability that makes them unable to communicate that they do not consent, either using words or physically or if they have a mental illness or other mental condition that makes them unable to understand the sexual activity. South Carolina has a 10 year penalty for a person who has sex with a person who is mentally challenged or incapable of movement. Law profesor Deborah Denno argues that people with some types of mental challenges should be able to consent to sex; she says they \"...have the right to do so, and unnecessarily broad and moralistic restrictions infringe upon that right\".\n\nIn some jurisdictions, individuals who are intoxicated from alcohol or drugs cannot consent. For example, Michigan Criminal Sexual Conduct Laws states that it is a crime to have sex with a “mentally incapacitated” person who cannot control their conduct or consent.\n\nIn Canada, intoxication is a factor that affects whether a person can legally consent to sexual activity. However, the level of intoxication that will make consent impossible varies according to circumstances, which include how intoxicated the person is and whether they voluntarily consumed the alcohol or drugs. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that a person drunk to the point of unconsciousness cannot consent to sex; the court ruled that once a person loses consciousness, they cannot consent. There was public outrage after a Canadian judge ruled that an intoxicated person can consent; however, a legal expert interviewed by CBC stated that \"a drunken consent is still a consent\" under Canadian law.\n\nIn Canada, a person who is asleep or unconscious cannot consent to sex.\n\nWhen determining if a sexual encounter was consensual, Canadian courts will consider if the accused was in a \"position of trust or authority\" regarding the complainant, as this undermines consent. While this general principle is part of Canadian law, the courts are debating exactly what the definition of a position of trust and authority is. Some examples of people in positions of trust or authority include a teacher, employer or boss, camp counselor, health care professional, or coach.\n\nSexual encounters where one party uses deception or deceit to obtain consent could be non-consensual. As such, if A gives consent to have sex with B, but B has lied about a pertinent issue, A has not given fully informed consent. Deception could include false statements about using contraception, age, gender, whether one is married, religion or employment, sexually transmitted infections testing status, giving the impression that one is someone’s partner, and falsely making the person think that a sexual activity is some type of medical procedure. Examples include a California man who snuck into the bedroom of an 18-year old woman right after her boyfriend left the bedroom, so she thought he was her boyfriend; an Israeli man who lied and told a woman he was a pilot and a medical doctor to have sex with her; and a US man who falsely claimed to be an NFL football player as a way to get sexual encounters.\n\nIn Alexandra Sims' article entitled \"Trans people could 'face rape charges' if they don’t declare sexual history, warns trans activist\" she states that the UK \"Sexual Offences Act\" requires transgender people to tell partners about their gender history as part of its requirements that people making sexual consent decisions have access to information so that they can make informed consent about whether to have sex; trans activist Sophie Cook states that the law is an infringement on trans peoples' human rights and on their privacy.\n\nInitiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula. In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on \"consensual sexual relationships,\" \"the meaning and importance of consent\" as well as \"rape myths\". In U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school’s policies. In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication. Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues. \n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that Oxford and Cambridge have added sexual consent workshops; one such workshop included a \"quiz about the rates of sexual or gender crimes\" and a discussion of three fictional \"scenarios of sexual contact\", including a story of groping at a party, a relationship in which one partner stopped participating, but the other person, who was sexually excited, continued to proceed to new sex acts, and a case in which a couple was drunk and had sex. The aim of the workshop was to consider if consent was asked for and obtained in these scenarios. While Sydney University has introduced an online sexual consent course, Nina Funnell states that it has been criticized by students, professors and sexual assault prevention leaders as \"tokenistic\", inexpensive, and ineffective in changing student attitudes or actions.\n\nSome UK universities are launching bystander intervention programs that teach people to intervene when they see potential sexual misconduct situations, for example, by moving a male friend at a party away from an intoxicated woman he is talking to, if she seems unable to consent to his advances. One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male, as white students feel \"less personal responsibility\" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) created the \"No Means No\" campaign in the 1990s to increase awareness by university students about \"sexual assault, acquaintance rape, and dating violence\" and decrease the incidence of these issues. The CFS developed a “No Means No” campaign that included research on sexual assault and producing and distributing buttons, stickers, posters and postcards with the slogan and other information. According to the CFS, \"No Means No\" to set in place a no tolerance approach to sexual violence and harassment and educate students about these issues.\n\nConcerns about the \"no means no\" approach developed, however, because some people cannot say no, either because they are not conscious, intoxicated or facing threats or coercion, with the coercion issue being especially important in cases where there is a power imbalance between two people in a sexual encounter. To address these concerns, there was a shift from 'no means no' to 'yes means yes' (affirmative consent), to ensure that people were not having sexual actions taken on them due to not speaking up or not resisting. Amanda Hess states that a person may not be able to say no, or they may be intoxicated or passed out, or they may freeze up from fear.\n\nSherry Colb criticizes the \"no means no\" approach on the grounds that it makes sexual contact the \"default\" option when two people have agreed to be in private in a date-like situation, at least until the woman says \"no\" to the other person's advances. Colb says that under the \"no means no\" approach, a man who is in private with a woman in a romantic context can undress her and penetrate her if she does not say \"no\", even if she is staring ahead and saying and doing nothing, which Colb says treats being quiet or not moving as an invitation to sex. She says that under a \"no means no\" approach, there is not a metaphorical \"Do Not Trespass\" sign on a woman's body, and as such, women have to fear that accepting a date and being in private with the partner could lead to unwanted sex.\n\nAffirmative consent (\"yes means yes\") is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures. With \"yes means yes\", a person can still say \"no\" after an initial yes. \"Yes means yes\" was developed by a group of women at the US liberal arts school Antioch College in 1991, who \"...successfully petitioned for a conduct-code amendment that explicitly defined sexual consent as requiring an enthusiastic “yes” from everyone involved. Prior to this, sex was considered consensual as long as neither party said “no.”\" (the \"no means no\" approach). As of 2014, at Antioch College, students must \"...get explicit verbal permission before making any sexual advance\", asking \"'Can I do this?' And the [other] person has to respond verbally, 'Yes.' And if they don't, it's considered nonconsent, and that's a violation of...[college] policy\"; a pre-arranged hand signal can also be used if the students made a \"prior verbal agreement\".\n\nThe \"yes means yes\" approach involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S., who describe consent as an \"affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.\" Claremont McKenna College Dean of Students Mary Spellman says \"yes means yes\" can be expressed nonverbally by determining \"[i]s the [other] person actively participating?...Are they touching me when I am touching them? Are they encouraging me when I'm doing various different things? Those would all be signs that the person is an active participant in whatever is going on.\"\n\nAccording to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., \"Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing.\" Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity (\"Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity,\" a university policy reads). By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.\n\nThere are three pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or \"the way we let others know what we're up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex.\"\n\nThey are:\n\n\nTo obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say \"no\", one gives and seeks an explicit \"yes\". This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that while the words used in \"yes means yes\" may vary, the main idea is that both people are agreeing to do sex acts. She says that \"yes means yes\" requires a major change in how we think of sexual assault, as it requires men and women to agree to and actively participate in sex. T.K. Pritchard says that even after consent is given, participants in an encounter should be \"constantly checking in\", and that there should be checking in before sexual contact, during sex, and after sex, to ensure consent was given. Lauren Larson states that a person should check in with their sex partner before kissing or sex, and also, even during sex, when they change the speed of an action, switch to a different position, or move their hands to a new body area.\n\nEven in a \"yes means yes\" paradigm, if a partner asks in a way where there is not room or a \"no\", or if they get a no and then use guilt to manipulate the person, that can be considered sexual coercion rather than consent; other examples include if a partner seeking sex complains that their need for sex is not being met, shows passive-aggressive behaviour, or persistently asks again and again until they get a \"yes\". Conn Caroll states that social conservatives may support the \"yes means yes\" laws, as the increased risk of being found guilty of sexual misconduct will lessen student interest in \"hook up culture\" and create an incentive for men to form long-term, committed relationships with women, rather than just seeking out one-night stands.\n\nIn a \"Time\" article, Cathy Young states that the California \"yes means yes\" law is unlikely to make sexual predators less likely to attack or keep victims safe; she says it creates unclear and capricious rules on sexual activity and moves the burden of proof to those who are accused, who are typically male. Young states that when the \"San Gabriel Valley Tribune\" asked a lawmaker how an innocent accused person could prove that he obtained consent, she was told “Your guess is as good as mine.” A judge overruled a University of Tennessee-Chattanooga ruling that a male student did not obtain consent; the judge wrote that \"...[a]bsent the tape recording of a verbal consent or other independent means to demonstrate that consent was given, the ability of an accused to prove the complaining party's consent strains credulity and is illusory\". \n\nRobert Shibley notes that Jonathan Chait has expressed concern that colleges with \"yes means yes\" rules are removing due process; Shibley argues that fairness and consistency are needed in disciplinary systems; he states that even though college tribunals are not law courts, they still have elements of court trials, as they are based on an allegation, an investigation is done, a hearing is held, evidence is brought forward, sentences are handed down, and there is an appeal that can be made. Shibley states that accused do not have core protections and he states that the college does the investigation, judges the case in the trial, and hears the appeal, which means there is not a separation of functions. Camille Paglia calls \"yes means yes\" laws \"drearily puritanical\" and totalitarian. In \"Consent: It’s Not Sexy\", Victoria Campbell criticizes affirmative consent on the grounds that it \"...values proof and evidence over the lived experience of those involved\" and it turns sex into a contractual activity in a manner akin to the way marriage traditionally provided contractual consent to sex. Sarah Nicole Prickett criticizes affirmative consent because these rules are premised on the idea of feminine passivity; under this cultural paradigm, she says that if a woman shows sexual interest during an encounter, she is seen as \"slutty or crazy\" or as showing \"too much\" sexuality.\n\nIn \"When Saying ‘Yes’ Is Easier Than Saying ‘No’\", Jessica Bennett says that one challenge is \"gray zone sex\" where a woman says yes to an initiator in a sexual encounter when she \"desperately\" means \"no\", engaging in what she calls \"begrudgingly consensual sex\" because saying yes is easier than explaining a \"no\" or exiting the situation, and because Western culture teaches women to be \"‘nice’ and ‘quiet’ and ‘polite\" and to \"protect others’ feelings\" at the expense of the woman's own feelings and desires. Julianne Ross states that in a Western society where sexual narratives focus on male desire, what women want can be deemed less important; as such, in this context, women in heterosexual encounters may feel a pressure to say yes to certain sex acts for fear that they may be criticized as a \"prude\" if they do not agree, or because the women want to fit into social expectations in their group, or because they are seeking validation.\nA variant of \"yes means yes\" consent is enthusiastic consent. Project Respect states that \"positive sexuality\" needs to start with enthusiastic consent\" in which a person is as \"excited and into someone else’s enjoyment\" a they are, an engaged partner. Planned Parenthood says that enthusiastic consent can be seen when a partner is \"...happy, excited, or energized\". Australia's NSW Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward has called for an enthusiastic consent, with has been defined as an approach that helps to ensure that both participants want to be in the encounter. A sexual assault survivor who supports the enthusiastic consent model states that \"...if it's not an enthusiastic yes, then it's not enough.\" Dr Nicola Henry stated that \"legislating and determining \"enthusiastic\" [consent] in a court would be challenging. Benedict Brook defines \"enthusiastic consent\" as “yes mean yes” with more vigour and with \"constant checking in between partners that all is well.\" \n\nGaby Hinsliff, in a \"The Guardian\" article entitled \"Consent is not enough: if you want a sexual partner, look for enthusiasm\", states that \"enthusiasm, the unmistakable sense of not being able to keep your hands off each other [in an encounter]...is harder to mistake for anything else. And if it was there, but suddenly evaporates – well, you could always ask what’s wrong. If those two words kill the mood dead, it almost certainly wasn’t the right mood to start with.\" It is \"...meant to help clarify the places at which [sexual] initiators unintentionally and sometimes unknowingly cross from sexual experience to sexual assault.” In Robyn Urback's article \"To McGill activists, a 'yes' doesn't mean consent\", she states that the \"Forum on Consent hosted at McGill suggests that a meek “yes,” or a nonchalant “yes,” or a “yes” without emphatic body language does not constitute consent. According to the panel “It must be loud and clear\"\". \n\nThe \"enthusiastic consent\" model has been criticized by asexual people and sex workers, as people in these categories may choose to have sex with people even though they are not \"particularly wanting it or enjoying it themselves\". Lily Zheng states that while enthusiastic consent is good theory, it is a \"nightmare in real-life intimacy\" and she says that since it cannot \"...move beyond guesswork, cues and assumptions [it] plays right into normative — straight, white, cisgender, middle-class — ideas about society\", which means it does not work well for Asians, blacks, queer communities and other racial or sexual minorities. Zheng states that the enthusiastic consent model is \"so vague\" that \"determining whether or not a real interaction was “enthusiastic” or not becomes next to impossible\". Julianne Ross states that consenting adults may have sex that they both want to have without giving \"enthusiastic consent\", such as couples having sex to get pregnant or couples who want to please each other. One challenge with getting people to give enthusiastic consent in the bedroom is that women may be reticent to speak about their sexual desires because of a fear that they may be \"slut-shamed\". Robert Tracinski asks \"how can you tell if she is saying yes with sufficient enthusiasm?\"\n\nThe advocacy group named The Affirmative Consent Project is providing 'sexual consent kits' at US universities. The kits include a contract which the parties can sign, stating that they consent to having sexual relations. The kits suggest that the couple take a photo of themselves holding the contracts. NYU law professor Amy Adler commented about the depiction of consent contracts in the novel \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"; she states the signing of the legal contract before sex could help to avoid uncertainty in sexual encounters. In Emma Green's article about the film, entitled \"Consent Isn’t Enough: The Troubling Sex of Fifty Shades\", she disagrees with consent contracts as a solution on the grounds that \"even explicit consent\" may not be enough in hard-drinking college dorm environments where most students have little experience with negotiating sexual permission.\n\nIn the 2010s, smartphone apps have been developed to give couples the ability to electronically consent to sexual relations. Apps include We-Consent, Sa-Sie, LegalFling and Good2Go. LegalFling uses blockchain and sets out each person's terms and conditions, such as requiring condom use or agreeing to specific acts. However, concerns have been raised about these \"consent apps\". The Good2Go app gives a record of sexual consent that the company claims can be used as evidence of consent and capacity, from an intoxication perspective, for consent; however, the app was removed from sale because both men and women did not like clicking on a smartphone in the bedroom to record their consent. A lawyer states that legally, apps are redundant and could only serve as circumstantial evidence, because they generally do not take into account a person's right to withdraw consent at any point in the sexual interaction.\n\nIn Reina Gattuso's article entitled \"Seven reasons consent apps are a terrible idea\", she criticizes consent apps on the grounds that: a person can withdraw consent at any point, including minutes after clicking yes on the app; the binary yes or no approach of the apps simplifies the complexity of consent; the app cannot legally confer agreement to each change in sex acts; they make consent too much about legal proofs and setting down evidence; and they change what should be a continuous process of communication into a quick action. Cricket Epstein states that using consent apps have a \"victim-blaming\" mentality that suggests that the person who is asked to click on the app may become a false accuser; as well, she says the app may protect perpetrators, because once agreement is clicked on the app, it will be harder for a complainant to say that she or he had sex acts done without consent.\n\nLegal scholar Robin West stated in a 2000 article that the use of consent as an ethical premise for life decisions may increase happiness in the world, except for women. She states that women technically consent to many of the life experiences that lead to misery for women, such as pregnancies they did not wish to have, marriages to spouses who beat them, or jobs where a boss sexually harasses them, since they consented to the sex, marriage or taking the job, respectively (even if they did not want the adverse results, such as on-the-job harassment). West states that if we make consent the key ethical standard in life, then all of these negative experiences for women will be not able to be criticized, as people will say that the woman chose of her own free will to enter that situation. \n\nIn \"Why Yes Can Mean No\", Jordan Bosiljevac states that \"yes\" does not necessarily mean consent for \"...poor, disabled, queer, non-white, trans, or feminine\" people; she states that consent approaches are a form of privilege created for well-to-do, hetero, cis, White, able-bodied people. Donna Oriowo states that \"...when we talk about consent, we very rarely are talking about black women or women of color\", and the focus is usually on white women, with black women accusers continuing to face doubt and blame due to tropes depicting black women as \"...over-sexed and only want[ing] sex.\" Some younger feminists argue that consent is not truly possibly when there is a power disparity between partners in an encounter; Laura Kipnis disagrees, arguing that it is \"...precisely the dynamics of power—of status, money, appearance, age, talent—that create desire\" between people in a sexual context, with desire being one of the elements Kipnis thinks we should focus on.\n\nKate Lockwood Harris argues that consent initiatives, such as \"no means no\" and \"yes means yes\" use views about communication which she sees as false myths, such as the claim that communication during sex can and should be a binary, unambiguous \"no\" or \"yes\". Harris states that by calling for this type of response, anti-assault advocates are lowering the complexity of communication competence between the two people and lessening the opportunities to make consent a political act.\n\nJed Rubenfeld of Yale Law School wrote in a review that consent should not be the (sole) criterion to judge whether a sexual contact is legal or not. First, in stark contrast to other legal areas (e.g. qualification for a mortgage or an insurance, see misrepresentation), there is generally no requirement to be truthful before obtaining sexual consent. Secondly, rape laws intend to protect sexual autonomy, but yet the only thing that can override somebody's autonomy is coercion, or exploiting somebody's incapacitation. In Rubenfeld's view, the defenselessness of a person, or the use (or threat) of force, is therefore the only criterion which can define rape in a logical way.\n\nConcepts of affirmative consent are more challenging in BDSM encounters, particularly in settings where the participants agree to \"consensual non-consent\", also called meta-consent and blanket consent, a mutual agreement to be able to act as if consent has been waived. It is an agreement where comprehensive consent is given in advance, with the intent of it being irrevocable under most circumstances. This often occurs without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned. Even if two participants in a BDSM encounter agree that they consent to violence, in Canada, the law limits what violent sexual act people can consent to; specifically, Canadians cannot consent to getting seriously injured.\nEzra Klein supports California's \"yes means yes\" law for the state's colleges on the grounds that there are too many sexual assaults; as such, he endorses broad new legal measures like California's newly created law. While he acknowledges that the law impinges on the personal sexual lives of people, he says that to work, the new law needs to have \"overreach\", so that it will create a \"cold spike of fear\" among college men about whether a sexual encounter is consensual. Klein states that cases where it is unclear whether consent was or was not given will be a necessary part of the law's effectiveness, as these cases will help to reduce sexual assaults, as students become aware of the disciplinary process and the consequences for those found guilty. Freddie deBoer states that if \"yes means yes\" becomes widespread, it would lead to a lower standard of proof being available to law enforcement and justice institutions which have thus far shown evidence of using racial or class-based prejudice when assessing and trying cases (e.g., driving while black); this could lead to \"yes means yes\" charges and punishments falling disproportionately on students of color or those from working class backgrounds.\n\nPhilip Henry states that the male gay community tolerates and even encourages non-consenting grabbing and groping of butts and crotches in gay venues because the boundaries of consent are blurred in the gay club environment, particularly when there is drinking and semi-nude patrons dancing. He says that when a gay man does experience unwanted groping and expresses concern, he is often told to \"calm down\" or that groping \"comes with the territory” in a gay venue. Gay men in the chemsex scene, where couples or groups consume GHB or crystal meth prior to extensive sex, have stated that consent is not clearly defined and there can be a perception that anyone at a \"party and play\" get-together is assumed to consent. \n\nIn \"Discussing Consent in Gay Spaces Requires Nuance, Not Sex Panic\", Rennie McDougall states that adding modern consent approaches to gay spaces such as gay bars and saunas would have a negative effect on gay men's sexual interactions, because non-consensual but non-threatening hands of a stranger on a bottom, chest or crotch can be a \"positive part of sexual discovery\" for gay men. An article about queer students at McGill University states that in queer sexual encounters, there is not a set script of activities, as with heterosexual sex, and queer sex is more exploratory; as such, there are more discussions about consent between queer partners about every step and act. However, Rebecca Kahn states that in queer encounters where one person is cis-gender and one person is trans, the cis person may have more power in the relationship that can give the trans person \"...feelings of fear, or more subtly...a desire to please the more privileged partner\" in the encounter; Kahn says that to address these power differentials, the privileged partner should make sure the marginalized person feels comfortable by letting them know that consent is not assumed.\n\n"}

It also goes by the name Prasuni (Prasun).\n\nVasi-vari belongs to the Indo-European language family, and is on the Nuristani group of the Indo-Iranian branch. Vasi-vari is the most isolated of the Nuristani languages.\n\nIts speakers are 100% Muslim. Literacy rates are low: below 1% for people who have it as a first language, and between 15% and 25% for people who have it as a second language.\n\nWasi-wari is a language spoken by the Vâs’i people who are located in the Pârun Valley, known as Vâs’i gul, at the beginning of the Pech River Basin in the Nurestân Province of Northeastern Afghanistan. The Vâs’i refer to the language as Vâs’i-vari or Vâs’i-vare, but it is also known as Prasuni, Paruni, Parun, Vasi-vari, Prasun, Veron, Verou, Veruni, Wasi-veri, Wasi-weri, Wasin-veri, Vasi Vari, and Pārūnī. The population of Vâs’i gul is between 3000-6000, and there are approximately 8000 native speakers, which makes it a vulnerable language.\n\nWasi-wari is broken up into three dialects that are spoken in six villages. The upper dialect, Ṣup'u-vari, is spoken in the northernmost village, Ṣup'u. The central dialect, üšʹüt-üćʹü-zumʹu-vari, is spoken in the middle four villages, S’eć, Üć’ü, Üšʹüt, and Zum’u. The Lower dialect, Uṣ'üt-var’e, is spoken in Uṣ'üt, the lowest village.\n\nWasi-wari is part of the Nuristani branch of the Indo-Iranian languages, which has both Iranian and Indo-Aryan influences. Nuristani languages were formerly considered to be Dardic languages, however, they are dissimilar enough from the other Dardic languages to constitute their own branch of the Indo-Iranian language tree. There was also previously confusion on whether Wasi-wari and Prasun were the same or separate languages, but it was determined that both names referred to the same language. Although it is substantially different than the other Nuristâni languages, Wasi-wari forms the northern cluster of Nuristâni languages with Kâmk’ata-Mumkst’a-vari, so they share some similarities.\n\nWasi-wari has eight vowels, â, u, o, i, e, ü, ö, and the unmarked vowel, a, which is pronounced as a high central vowel, [ɨ]. Long vowels are denoted with :, such as [i:].\n\n"}

Of this population, 40-80 million reside in India. India plays an active role in the disability rights movement and has ratified and signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007. However, it does not adequately address the challenges faced by these groups of people, such as lack of accessibility throughout the country. Another crucial issue is the promotion of negative stereotypes about disability in films, like those from Bollywood. \n\nBrotherhood is an organization that has been actively fighting for the rights of disabled communities since 2002. They have pioneered the disability rights movement by carrying out conversations, and taking advantage of the influence of audio-visual media. Through various initiatives, they strive to utilize documentaries and film to dispel stereotypes and misconceptions pertaining to disabilities, and to raise awareness among the Indian public as well as global audiences.\n\nDrawing on the aforementioned UN treaty, Brotherhood - in collaboration with the United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, UNESCO, National Trust (a Statutory Body of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment) and Apeejay Institute of Mass Communication - organize the We Care Film Festival every year. This year marked the festival's thirteenth year, a milestone because it is the only international film festival that is officially recognized as a UNESCO partner, according to the New Delhi Declaration, which was adopted by UNESCO and signed by 203 countries as of November 2015.\n\nDr. Sushma Batra, Professor of Social Work at the University at Delhi, and K. Kannan, a New Delhi-based journalist, are advocates of the movement toward disability rights. They write:\nKannan and Dr. Batra acknowledge the strong sphere of influence that cinema has in societies, nationally and internationally. They point out that due to the goal of entertaining the masses, filmmakers undermine the experiences of disabled populations through some very negative stereotypes and tropes. Many Bollywood films either over-dramatize disabled characters or mock them through cartoon-esque and pity-inducing depictions.\n\nThis section will examine common tropes – highlighted by Kannan and Dr. Batra – employed by filmmakers in Bollywood film, notions that this film festival seeks to dispel. \n\nDisabled characters may be utilized as a comic interlude for the entertainment of audiences. A film series that perfectly illustrates this is Golmaal. They may be regarded with pity and a sense of condescension. The trope, a patronizing attitude, is used to paint the “hero” or protagonist of a film in a positive light by means of looking down upon the disabled character. Disability has been used by filmmakers as a convenience to enhance the plot of the story. An example is Koyla (1997 film). \n\nSome films depict disabled characters as heroes, which can be very problematic. Through the language and behaviors used in certain films, disabled peoples are portrayed as being liabilities and burdensome unproductive members of society. \n\nFilms may downplay the magnitude of disabilities by imparting the idea that there are “quick fixes” to an individual’s disabilities, like Deewane Huye Paagal (2005 film). Lastly, films portray disabled peoples as being “cured” by external forces, such as by aliens in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003 film).\n"}

Altogether, 12,531,000 złotys were stolen, which in late 2000s (decade) prices, would make some 18 million złotys. It was the biggest bank robbery in the history of the People's Republic of Poland, to the point that the Polish government for a while considered withdrawing all 50-złoty and 100-złoty bills from the market, which would help find the robbers.\n\nThe robbery was described with details in a local newspaper \"Głos Pracy\", which dedicated large part of its October 19, 1962, issue to the \"job\". According to the article, which was written two months after the robbery, on Sunday, August 19, 1962, a group of robbers approached a guard, who was entering the bank to work the night shift. The guard was bound, and left in the cellar, while the robbers entered the main hall, quickly finding the safe. \n\nThe robbers got into the safe through a hole cut in the wall by a jack-screw. They stole 12,531,000, all in 500-, and 100-złoty notes. The loot was staggering for these times, as back then, the biggest lottery jackpots were up to 1 million złotys. \n\nAccording to Colonel Stanisław Gorniecki of the local police department, the guard spent the whole night in the cellar, and was found on the next day at 4:30 a.m., by a cleaning lady, who upon entering the building noticed that the main door had not been locked. The woman then heard moaning coming from the cellar, and she went down to spot the guard. Soon afterwards the police were informed, and all local roads were closed, and the officers checked all trunks. Criminals and thieves known to the police were investigated, and on the same day (Monday, August 20), a group of police experts came by plane from Warsaw. The investigation was dubbed W-62.\n\nThe experts found out that the robbers had used a Warszawa car, also, due to several traces left on the ground, they managed to tell the type of tires. Also, the vehicle hit a pile of broken bricks, so search immediately started. Furthermore, on the ripped safe there were traces of paint of the tools used. It looked like all tools were painted in the same color, so the detectives tried to locate a shop or a workshop to which the tools belonged. As the robbery was very quick, it was suggested that one of the criminals was a person associated with the bank, who knew the details of the inside. Therefore, all employees were investigated. Finally, it was established that all stolen banknotes belonged to the AP and AR series (for 500 złoty notes), and DI, DK and DR series (100 złoty notes). All bank tellers and cashiers in the country were informed about it.\n\nHundreds of tip-offs came to the police from uninvolved individuals around the country, and the first significant information came from Pruszcz Gdański, where a woman came to a bank to deposit 18,000 złotys. Among the money, there were a lot of bills from the marked series, and the teller immediately informed the police. A short investigation concluded that the woman was related to a person from Wołów, who was a customer of the bank, and turned out to be one of the robbers. \n\nThe second tip came from Ostrów Wielkopolski, where a bank teller noticed that a 500-złoty note was very damaged and probably fake. The manager of the bank checked it - the note was real, but it was purposely tattered to look old and worn. Altogether, there were nine such notes in the Ostrów Wielkopolski bank. All were taken to the laboratory, which confirmed that the money was new, and probably washed in a laundry machine.\n\nOne day later, on October 1, 1962, a woman entered a textile store in the Kluczbork. She picked an expensive carpet, and handed the seller a 500-złoty bill. The female employee immediately realized that it was the wanted note, but at the same time the customer sensed she was in trouble. She wanted the money back, but also suggested a bribe. The seller would not hear of it, locked the store and called the police. The customer was the wife of a man from Wołów, who turned out to be one of the brains of the gang. A search of their house resulted in finding a great deal of stolen money that belonged to the marked series. It was a breakthrough moment of the investigation, and in the next three days, all the robbers were caught.\n\nThe police were shocked to learn that none of the robbers were seasoned criminals, but a group of otherwise law-abiding citizens of the town. Their brains was an electrician Stanisław J., who had worked for the bank, and who had ordered his comrades to stay quiet for a while, and avoid any big purchases, not to bring heat on the gang. All were sentenced to 25 years, but left prison after 17 years, in 1979. The police recovered almost all the money stolen in the heist.\n\nIn 1975, film director Mieczysław Waskowski made a movie \"Hazardzisci\" (\"The Gamblers\"), which is dedicated to the 1962 robbery.\n\nAlso, in 2008, Polish Radio Wrocław created a radio show, telling the story of the robbery, and Polish TV Wroclaw, together with \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" filmed a documentary titled \"Napad na bank\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "430478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=430478", "title": "Yishuv", "text": "Yishuv\n\nThe Yishuv (, literally \"settlement\") or Ha-Yishuv (\"the Yishuv\", ) or Ha-Yishuv Ha-Ivri (\"the Hebrew Yishuv\", ) is the term referring to the body of Jewish residents in the land of Israel (corresponding to Ottoman Syria until 1917, OETA South 1917–1920 and later Mandatory Palestine 1920–1948) prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. The term came into use in the 1880s, when there were about 25,000 Jews living across the Land of Israel, then comprising the southern part of Ottoman Syria, and continued to be used until 1948, by which time there were some 630,000 Jews there. The term is used in Hebrew even nowadays to denote the Pre-State Jewish residents in the Land of Israel.\n\nA distinction is sometimes drawn between the Old Yishuv and the New Yishuv:\nThe Old Yishuv refers to all the Jews living there before the aliyah (immigration wave) of 1882 by the Zionist movement. The Old Yishuv residents were religious Jews, living mainly in Jerusalem, Safed, Tiberias and Hebron. Smaller communities were in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki'in, Acre, Nablus, Shfaram and until 1779 also in Gaza. In the final centuries before modern Zionism, a large part of the Old Yishuv spent their time studying the Torah and lived off charity (halukka), donated by Jews in the Diaspora.\n\nThe New Yishuv refers to those who began building homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s, to the founders of the Moshava of Petah Tikva and the First Aliyah of 1882, followed by the founding of neighbourhoods and villages until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.\n\nThe Old Yishuv were the Jewish communities of the southern Syrian provinces in the Ottoman period, up to the onset of Zionist aliyah and the consolidation of the New Yishuv by the end of World War I. As opposed to the later Zionist aliyah and the New Yishuv, which came into being with the First Aliyah (of 1882) and was more based on a socialist and/or secular ideology emphasizing labor and self-sufficiency, the Old Yishuv, whose members had continuously resided in or had come to \"Eretz Yisrael\" in the earlier centuries, were largely ultra-orthodox Jews dependent on external donations (Halukka) for living.\n\nThe Old Yishuv developed after a period of severe decline in Jewish communities of the Southern Levant during the early Middle Ages, and was composed of three clusters. The oldest group consisted of the Ladino-speaking Sephardic Jewish communities in Galilee and the Judeo-Arabic speaking Musta'arabim who settled in Eretz Yisrael in the Ottoman and late Mamluk period. A second group was composed of Ashkenazi and Hassidic Jews who had emigrated from Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. A third wave was constituted by Yishuv members who arrived in the late 19th century. The Old Yishuv was thus generally divided into two independent communities – the Sephardim (including Musta'arabim), mainly constituting the remains of Jewish communities of Galilee and the four Jewish holy cities, which had flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries; and the Ashkenazim, whose immigration from Europe was primarily since the 18th century.\n\nThe 'Old Yishuv' term was coined by members of the 'New Yishuv' in the late 19th century to distinguish themselves from the economically dependent and generally earlier Jewish communities, who mainly resided in the four holy cities of Judaism, and unlike the New Yishuv, had not embraced land ownership and agriculture. Apart from the Old Yishuv centres in the four holy cities of Judaism, namely Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed, smaller communities also existed in Jaffa, Haifa, Peki'in, Acre, Nablus and Shfaram. Petah Tikva, although established in 1878 by the Old Yishuv, nevertheless was also supported by the arriving Zionists. Rishon LeZion, the first settlement founded by the Hovevei Zion in 1882, could be considered the true beginning of the \"New Yishuv\".\n\nThe Ottoman government was not supportive of the new settlers from the First and Second Aliyah, as the Ottoman government officially restricted Jewish immigration. The Yishuv relied on money from abroad to support their settlements.\n\nIn 1908 the Zionist Organization founded the Palestine Office, under Arthur Ruppin, for land acquisition, agricultural settlement and training, and later for urban expansion. The first Hebrew high schools were opened in Palestine as well as the Technion, the first institution for higher learning. Hashomer, a Zionist self-defence group, was created to protect the Jewish settlements. Labor organizations were created along with health and cultural services, all later coordinated by the Jewish National Council. By 1914, the old Yishuv was a minority and the new Yishuv began to express itself and its Zionist goals.\n\nThe Zionist movement tried to find work for the new immigrants who arrived in the Second Aliyah. However, most were middle class and were not physically fit or knowledgeable in agricultural work. The Jewish plantation owners had previously hired Arab workers who accepted low wages and were very familiar with agriculture. The leaders of the Zionist movement insisted that plantation owners (those who arrived in the First Aliyah) only hire Jewish workers and grant higher wages. The conquest of labor was a major Zionist goal. However, this caused some turmoil in the Yishuv for there were those who felt that they were discriminating against the Arabs just as they had been discriminated against in Russia. The Arabs became bitter from the discrimination despite the small number of Arabs that were affected by this.\n\nThe First Aliyah was the very beginning of the creation of the New Yishuv. More than 25,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. The immigrants were inspired by the notion of creating a national home for Jews. Most of the Jewish immigrants came from Russia, escaping the pogroms, while some arrived from Yemen. Many of the immigrants were affiliated with Hovevei Zion. Hovevei Tzion purchased land from Arabs and other Ottoman subjects and created various settlements such as Yesud HaMa'ala, Rosh Pinna, Gedera, Rishon LeZion, Nes Tziona and Rechovot. These agricultural settlements were supported by philanthropists from abroad, chiefly Edmond James de Rothschild. and Alphonse James de Rothschild.\n\nEliezer Ben-Yehuda also immigrated during the first Aliyah. Ben-Yehuda took it upon himself to revive the Hebrew language, and along with Nissim Bechar started a school for teaching Hebrew, later on founding the first Hebrew newspaper.\n\nDuring the Second Aliyah, between 1903 and 1914, there were 35,000 new immigrants, primarily from Russia.\n\nDuring World War I, the conditions for the Jews in the Ottoman Empire worsened. All those Jews who were of an enemy nationality were exiled and others were drafted into the Ottoman army. Many of those exiled fled to Egypt and the United States. Those who remained in the Ottoman ruled Palestine faced hard economic times. There was disagreement whether to support the British or the Turks. A clandestine group, Nili, was established to pass information to the British in the hope of defeating the Ottomans and ending their rule over Palestine. The purpose and members of the Nili were discovered. All involved were executed by the Ottomans except its founder, Aaron Aaronsohn, who escaped to Egypt. During World War I, the Jewish population in Palestine diminished by a third due to deportations, immigration, economic trouble and disease. During World War I, there were two British battalions of Jews, called the Zion Mule Corps, who were to fight on the front of Palestine. They helped in the British capture of Ottoman Syria (including Palestine), leading to the Turkish surrender. The members of the Zion Mule Corps later made up the Yishuv's defence groups that would fight against the British.\n\nWorld War I ended, along with the Ottoman Empire. Britain gained control of Palestine through the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which partitioned Ottoman Syria into French-ruled Syria and Lebanon and British-controlled Palestine and Transjordan. There was a hope that British control would allow the creation of a Jewish national homeland as promised in the Balfour Declaration. The British Mandate was formalized in 1922 based on the Balfour Declaration. The British were supposed to help the Jews build a national home and promote the creation of self-governing institutions. The mandate provided for an agency in which the Jews could represent Jewish interests and promote Jewish immigration. It was called the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and was only created ten years later, serving as the de facto government of the Yishuv.\n\nAlong with a Jewish agency there was to be a general self-governing institution created in Palestine including Jews and Arabs. The Yishuv feared such an institution due to the Arab majority, but none was created in the end due to the Arabs' refusal to cooperate with the Jews or British.\nThe optimism that existed in the beginning of the British mandate soon diminished due to continued hardships in the Yishuv. Most of the European funds that supported the Jewish settlements before World War I ended. The Arabs, opposed to the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate, instigated riots against the Jews. The British limited immigration through yearly quotas; only those who received \"certificates\" could make Aliyah.\n\nMany women who immigrated to Israel came out of national Zionist motives who wanted the same rights as men and wanted to rebuild their land. In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and Rosa Welt-Straus, who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death. The constituent assembly was voted upon in 1920 and 14 women were elected out of the three hundred and fourteen delegates. As well as the increase in the number of women filling public positions, the rate of women participating in the labor force increased steadily during the British mandate period in the Yishuv. With that being said, the employment opportunities at the beginning of the mandate period were very low and women were mainly limited to typical female occupations because the only other option would be to work in construction, which only pioneer women committed to as part of their feminist-nationalist outlook because those roles were considered inappropriate for women. Women were consistently more unemployed when compared to their male counterparts, regardless of cyclical fluctuations.The wages for working women were constantly lower than the wages of their male counterparts, and throughout the Yishuv period, the average wage for women were 50 to 70 percent of male's wage.\n\nNot only were non-religious women fighting for equality, but so were religious women. Female religious Zionists were faced with double the amount of barriers than a non-religious female Zionist because they were rejected from religious society because of their gender and they were rejected from secular society because of their religiosity In 1926 the haredim, who preferred not to face the possibility of a plebiscite, left the yishuv's Assembly of Representatives, and that year an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming \"equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv – civil, political, and economic.\" In 1935, the establishment of the national organization of religious pioneer women emerged. Its main goal was to improve the material status and spiritual welfare of the religious women workers and gain admittance to the Ha-Po'el ha-Mizrachi. This organization grew from eight-hundred members in 1935 to six-thousand members in 1948. Women gained rights with the establishment of the religious kibbutz movement by participating in Torah studies with men and by taking part in the co-ed activities that the Kibbutz offered.\n\nThere were Arab riots throughout 1920–21 in opposition to the Balfour Declaration. The Arabs tried to show the British the instability of Palestine and that a Jewish homeland was ungovernable. Riots increased in 1929 after the fourth Aliyah – 133 Jews were killed by Arab mobs during the 1929 riots. The Arabs claimed that Jewish immigration and land purchases were displacing them and taking their jobs away. These riots were also instigated by false rumours that the Jews were planning on building a synagogue near the Western Wall. These riots led to the evacuation of Hebron's indigenous – largely non-Zionist – Jewish population.\n\nThe British responded to the Arab riots with the White Paper of 1939. It was based on the Hope Simpson Report, which stated that Palestine after economic development could support only 20,000 more immigrant families without infringing on the Arab population's placement and employment. It therefore attempted to curtail immigration to Palestine. Upon Jewish criticism of this policy, it was clarified that immigration would not be stopped entirely but would be restricted by quotas.\n\nThere were many Jewish immigrants that arrived throughout the 1930s in the fifth Aliyah, despite the immigration quotas. Many who came were fleeing persecution in Eastern Europe. Those that came from Nazi Germany were able to come because of the Haavara Agreement. This allowed Jews to escape from Germany to Palestine in return for paying a ransom to the Reich. By then, the Yishuv had a population of about 400,000.\n\nThe increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants and land purchases, unchallenged by the British Mandate, angered and radicalized many Arabs. In April 1936, Arabs attacked a Jewish bus, leading to a series of incidents that escalated into a major Arab rebellion. The British were caught by surprise and were unable to prevent the deaths of thousands of Arabs and hundreds of Jews in the revolt. The Haganah protected the Yishuv's settlements while the Irgun, a more radical group, attacked Arab settlements. A coalition of recently formed Arab political parties formed the Arab Higher Committee (AHC). It declared a national strike in support of three basic demands: cessation of Jewish immigration, an end to all further land sales to the Jews, and the establishment of an Arab national government. The Arabs threatened that if the British didn't comply with their demands then they would join the adversaries of the British. This concerned the British for World War II was just beginning and they knew they would need Middle Eastern oil.\n\nThe British worked with their Arab allies to bring a halt to the AHC riots. The Peel Commission reported, in July 1937, that the British obligations to the Arabs and Zionists were irreconcilable and the mandate unworkable. It suggested the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, with the British mandate governing over Nazareth, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem along with a corridor from Jerusalem to the coast. The Jews accepted the general principle of a partition while the Arabs refused any partition plan. The British government sent a technical team called the Woodhead Commission to detail the plan. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to \"political, administrative and financial difficulties\".\n\nThe Arab Revolt broke out again in the autumn of 1937. The British ended the revolt using harsh measures, deporting many Palestinian Arab leaders and shutting down the AHC. In the Yishuv, the Arab Revolt reinforced the already firm belief in the need for a strong Jewish defence network. Finally, the Arab agricultural boycott that began in 1936 forced the Jewish economy into even greater self-sufficiency. The Haganah during this period changed from being a small clandestine militia to a large military force. The British security forces at this time cooperated with the Haganah to respond to the Arabs.\n\nIn 1938 Captain Orde Wingate created the Special Night Squads (SNS) that were composed mostly of Haganah members. SNS used the element of surprise in night raids to protect the Jewish settlements and attack the Arabs.\n\nThe British suppressed the Arab revolt and published the White Paper of 1939. It allowed for a total of only 75,000 Jews to enter Palestine over a five-year period. During this time the Yishuv entered a period of relative peace with the Arabs.\n\nThe Yishuv wanted to help their fellow Jews, who were being murdered by the Nazis in Europe. Many Jews from Europe were prevented from fleeing to Mandatory Palestine by strict immigration quotas established by the white papers. The Jewish Agency organized illegal immigration from 1939 through 1942 with the help of the Haganah. Those who arrived illegally to Israel during this time were part of the Aliyah Bet. This was a dangerous operation, for these illegal immigrants arrived by boat and had to be careful not to be caught by the British or Nazis. Many of these ships sank or were caught, such as the \"Patria\", \"Struma\" and . Compared with the number of attempts, few ships actually arrived successfully to Mandatory Palestine, but tens of thousands of Jews were saved by the illegal immigration.\n\nThe Yishuv also wanted to help on the front lines in Europe to try to save Jews from the Nazi atrocities. In 1942 the Jewish agency turned to the British to offer their assistance by sending Jewish volunteers to Europe as emissaries of the Yishuv to organize local resistance and rescue operations among the Jewish communities. The British accepted the proposal but on a much smaller scale than the Jewish agency had hoped. They only took Jewish parachutists who were recent immigrants from certain targeted countries that they wanted to infiltrate. The British Special Forces and military intelligence both consented to the volunteers' dual role as British agents and Jewish emissaries. 110 Yishuv members were trained; however only 32 were deployed. Many of them succeeded in helping the POWs and uprisings in the Jewish communities, while others were caught.\n\nThere were two periods during the war when the Yishuv faced a direct threat from Nazi forces. The first occurred following Germany's conquest of France in 1940, since the pro-Nazi Vichy regime controlled the northern Levant, from which an invasion of Palestine could take place. However, in 1941 British forces successfully fought Vichy forces for control of Syria and Lebanon, thus removing the threat of invasion from the north, at least as long as German armies in Eastern Europe could be held back by the Red Army and thus unable to easily advance towards the Near East from the north. In 1942 however, as Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps swept across North Africa with the intent of capturing the Suez Canal, the likelihood of a German invasion from the south became a real possibility, causing great anxiety in the Yishuv and prompting plans to be drawn for its defense. Knowing that Nazi control of Palestine meant certain annihilation of the Yishuv, a debate raged among Yishuv leadership whether, in the event Nazi occupation was to take place, the inhabitants of the Yishuv should evacuate together with British forces eastwards towards British possessions in Iraq and India or undertake a Masada-like last stand in Palestine, likely doing so in a fortified zone to be hastily constructed around the Carmel Mountains. This military operation was officially named Palestine Final Fortress. Fortunately for the Yishuv, the advance of German forces eastwards in Egypt was halted during the Second Battle of El Alamein, thus lifting the threat of invasion from the south. The anxious time leading to the Nazi loss at El Alamein became known as the 200 days of dread.\n\nDespite the reports of Nazi atrocities and the desperation of Jews needing a safe haven the British kept the gates of Palestine almost closed to Jewish immigration. The Zionist leaders met at the Biltmore Hotel in New York in May 1942 and called for unrestricted Jewish immigration and the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors were being held in Displaced Persons Camp (DP Camps) aching to go to Mandatory Palestine. The British received much international pressure, specifically from U.S. president Harry Truman, to change their policy on immigration. Despite Britain's dependence on American economic aid, the British refused, claiming that they were experiencing too much resistance from the Arabs and Jews already in Palestine and feared what would happen if more were allowed to enter. The refusal to remove the white paper policy angered and radicalized the Yishuv. The Yishuv's militia groups set out to sabotage the British infrastructure in Palestine and continue in their illegal immigration efforts. In 1946, the British responded to the Yishuv's efforts and began a two-week search for Jews suspected of anti-British activities, arresting many of the Haganah's leaders. While the British were busy looking for the Haganah, the Irgun and Lehi carried out attacks on British forces. The most famous of their attacks was on the King David Hotel, the site of the British military command and the British Criminal Investigation Division. This location was chosen because a few weeks before a large quantity of documents was confiscated from the Haganah and brought there. Despite being warned by the Yishuv and told to evacuate the building the British officials decided not to cave in to the pressure. The Yishuv attacked anyway, resulting in 91 casualties, 28 of who were British and 17 who were Palestinian Jews.\n\nBy 1947 the British had 100,000 troops in Palestine trying to maintain order and protect themselves. The British mandate was a major expense to the Exchequer, forcing them to present the Palestine problem to the United Nations on May 15, 1947. The United Nations proposed a partition of the British Mandate for Palestine into 2 states—Arab and Jewish (UN Resolution 181). The Jews accepted it, while the Arabs stated that they would do everything in their power to prevent it.\n\nThe AHC, determined to prevent Resolution 181 from coming into effect, began to attack and besiege the Jews. The British sided with the Arabs in an attempt to prevent the Yishuv from arming themselves. Jerusalem was held under a siege with no access to weapons, food or water. The Provisional Government seemed helpless until it received a large shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia. The Haganah started fighting offensively from April through May. The Haganah mounted a full-scale military plan, Operation Nachson. After much fighting and the crucial construction of a new road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the siege of Jerusalem was broken, allowing supplies to be brought into the city.\n\nThis operation's success helped Harry S. Truman recognize that the Jews would be able to protect themselves. The United States decided therefore, it would support the establishment of a Jewish state. On May 14, 1948 the Jews proclaimed the independent state of Israel and the British withdrew from Palestine.\n\nThe 1920 Nabi Musa riots left four Arabs and five Jews killed, with 216 Jews and 23 Arabs wounded. The majority of the victims were members of the old Yishuv. About 300 Jews from the Old City were evacuated following the riots.\n\nDuring the Jaffa riots in 1921, thousands of Jewish residents of Jaffa fled for Tel Aviv and were temporarily housed in tent camps on the beach. Tel Aviv, which had previously been lobbying for independent status, became a separate city due in part to the riots. However Tel Aviv was still dependent on Jaffa, which supplied it with food and services, and was the place of employment for most residents of the new city.\n\nFollowing the 1929 Palestine riots, which left 133 Jews dead, the Jewish community members of Gaza and Hebron were ordered to evacuate by the British forces, in fear of their security.\n\nDuring the Arab revolt of 1936–1939, the Jewish residents of Akko were ousted from the city by local Arab residents. The same fate was forced on the ancient Jewish community of Peki'in.\n\nThe Assembly of Representatives was the elected parliamentary assembly of the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine. It was established on 19 April 1920, and functioned until 13 February 1949, the day before the first Knesset, elected on 25 January, was sworn in. The Assembly met once a year to elect the executive body, the Jewish National Council, which was responsible for education, local government, welfare, security and defense. It also voted on the budgets proposed by the Jewish National Council and the Rabbinical Council.\n\nThe most notable Jewish paramilitaries in the British Mandate of Palestine were the Haganah, the Irgun and Lehi. In October, 1945, during the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine, those organizations joined to form the Jewish Resistance Movement. It was established by the Jewish Agency and activated for some ten months, until August, 1946. The alliance coordinated acts of sabotage and attacks against British authorities.\n\n\n"}
