They are listed as a Scheduled Tribe, in the 5th schedule of the Indian Constitution. They are known for the Sekrenyi celebrations every February. The Angami Nagas are settled in Kohima District and Dimapur District.\n\nThe territory of the Angamis is made up of the present Kohima district and Dimapur District,which is divided into four regions:\nThis region is located to the south of \"Kohima\" on the foothills of Mt Japfü.\n\nThe Western Angami region is located to the west of \"Kohima\".\nThis region is located to the north of Kohima.\n\nMostly small villages around Dimapur district, with large villages being Medziphema, Chumoukedima, Sovima, Rüzaphema, etc. Other villages include Piphema, Tsiepama, Vidima, Kirha, Pherima, etc.)\n\nThe former Eastern Angami have separated and are now recognised as Chakhesang.\n\nThe Angami Nagas are hill people depending basically on cultivation and livestock-rearing. The Angamis are known for terraced wet-rice cultivation; because of this labor-intensive cultivation, land is the most important form of property among them. They are one of the only two groups of Nagas out of the seventeen who practice wet-rice cultivation on terraces made on the hill slopes. This allows them to cultivate the same plot year after year. They depend, to a very small extent, on slash-and-burn cultivation. \n\nAngamis were traditionally warriors. The Angami men spent the majority of their time in warfare with hostile villages and taking heads. Since 1879, when the British succeeded in annexing their territory, the inter-village feuds have come to an end. With the introduction of Christianity in the region several Angamis changed their faith to Christianity.\n\nSocial stratification is not observed in the Angami community. Traditionally, property was divided equally among sons with daughters also receiving a share; in modern families it is shared among children. The youngest male in the family inherits the parental home, \"Kithoki\", which means he is responsible for their care until they pass away.\n\nThe Angami Christians are composed of five major denominations: Baptist, Revival, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal and Seventh-day Adventist. Baptists constitute more than 80% of the total Angami Christian population and all the Baptist churches in their region are under the Angami Baptist Church Council.\n\nAlthough more than 98% of the Angamis are Christians, they are one of the last Naga tribes having an animist population. The Angami animists practice a religion known as Pfutsana. According to the 1991 census, there were 1,760 Angami practitioners, but 10 years later the figure had halved to 884. Currently there are several hundred adherents of the Pfutsana religion, scattered in nine villages of the southern Kohima district. A religious organization, 'Japfuphiki Pfutsana', was founded in 1987 to streamline indigenous religious practices among the Angamis. According to the 2011 Census, 98.62% of the Angami are Christian, 0.47% are Buddhist, 0.37% Hindu, 0.24% Muslim and 0.19% Pfutsana.\n\nThe Angamis celebrate a ten-day festival called Sekrenyi (sometimes also called Phousanyi) in February. The term Sekrenyi literally means sanctification festival (\"sekre\" = sanctification; \"nyi\" = feast; \"thenyi\" = festival). The festival takes places after the harvest and falls on the twenty-fifth day of the month Kezei (January–February).\n\nThe festival follows a circle of ritual and ceremony, the first being \"kizie\". A few drops of rice water taken from the top of a type of jug called \"zumho\" are put on leaves. These are placed at the three main posts of the house by the lady of the household. On the first day, the young and old go to the village well to bathe.\n\nIn the night, two young men clean the well. Some of the village youth guard the well, as no one is allowed to fetch water after the cleaning. As women are especially not allowed to touch the well water at this time, they must make sure that water is fetched for the household before then. Early next morning, all the young men of the village attend the washing ritual. They wear two new shawls (the white \"Mhoushü\" and the black \"Lohe\") and sprinkle water on their chests, knees, and right arms. This ceremony is called \"dzüseva\" ('touching the sleeping water'); in it, the well water symbolically washes away all their ills and misfortunes.\n\nOn their return from the well, a rooster is sacrificed. It is taken as a good omen when the right leg falls over the left leg as it falls down. The innards of the rooster are then hung outside the house for the village elders to inspect. A three-day session of singing and feasting starts on the fourth day of the festival.\n\nThe most interesting part is the \"thekra hie\". The \"thekra hie\" is when the young people of the village sit together and sing traditional songs throughout the day. Jugs of rice beer and plates of meat are placed before the participants. On the seventh day, the young men go hunting. The most important ceremony falls on the eighth day when the bridge-pulling, or gate-pulling, is performed and inter-village visits are exchanged. All field work ceases during this season of feasting and song.\n\nThe following is a list of prominent people belonging to the Angami tribe\n\n\n\n"}

Armenians are the largest ethnic minority in Tbilisi at 4.8% of the population. Armenians migrated to the Georgian lands in the Middle Ages, during the Muslim rule of Armenia. They formed the single largest group of city's population in the 19th century. Official Georgian statistics of 2014 put the number of Armenians in Tbilisi 53,409 people.\n\nTbilisi or Tiflis (as most Armenians call it) was the center of cultural life of Armenians in the Russian Empire from early 19th century to early 20th century.\n\nThe Armenian history and contribution to the capital city of Tbilisi (known as Tiflis in Armenian, Russian, Persian, Azerbaijani and Turkish) is significant. After the Russian conquest of the area, Armenians fleeing persecution in the Ottoman Empire and Persia caused a jump in the Armenian population until it reached about 40% of the city total. Many of the mayors and business class were Armenian, and much of the old city was built by Armenians. Until recently the neighborhoods of Havlabar and the area across the river were very heavily Armenian, but that has changed a great deal in the last two decades.\n\nAn Armenian community has been known to have existed in Tbilisi since at least the 7th century, however a large Armenian community was not formed until the Late Middle Ages. By the late Middle Ages, there were some 24 Armenian churches and monasteries in and around the city. According to Tournefort, Armenians constituted three-quarters of the population of Tiflis in the 18th century, and owned 24 churches.\n\nUnder the Russian Empire, the city of Tiflis became the center of Russian rule for the whole viceroyalty of Caucasia. During the 19th century, Tiflis became the center of the Eastern Armenian cultural revival and an Armenian cultural hub second only to Constantinople.\n\nUntil recently, the neighborhoods of Avlabari (Havlabar) and the area across the river were very heavily Armenian. The older Armenian neighborhood of Tbilisi, on both sides of the river between Freedom Square and Havlabar carry Armenian names, including Tumanyan, Abovian, Akopian, Alikhanian, Sundukian, Yerevan, Ararat and Sevan.\n\nThe Diocese Church (the Saint Gevorg Church) in Tbilisi where the Armenian primate of Tbilisi sits is very close to the city fortress. In front of the church is the tomb of the 18th-century Armenian–Georgian bard, Sayat-Nova. In Havlabar, the other Armenian Church of Echmiadzin is undergoing renovation and reconstruction. The Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi has the tombs of many famous Armenians including writers Hovhannes Tumanyan and Raffi.\n\nAccording to Tournefort, Armenians constituted three-quarters of the population of Tiflis in the 18th century, and owned 24 churches. Ten of the churches were destroyed in the 1930s, and as of 1979, fourteen were still standing.\n\nThere are still two working Armenian Churches in the city, and an Armenian Theatre. The Armenian Pantheon, where prominent Armenians are buried has the tombs of some of Armenian's favorite personalities ever, including Raffi and Hovhannes Tumanyan. The adjacent Armenian cemetery was taken over by the Georgian Church and their new national cathedral was built upon it. The remaining space in between the Pantheon and the new Georgian cathedral is now the construction site of what appears to be a Georgian Seminary. Again, the Armenian tombs here are being ignored, and human bones are being moved around like dirt.\n\nA number of Armenian churches have been confiscated by the Soviet state and then passed to the Georgian Church in the post-Soviet era. According to the United States State Department: \"The Roman Catholic and Armenian Apostolic Churches have been unable to secure the return of churches and other facilities closed during the Soviet period, many of which later were given to the Georgian Orthodox Church by the State. The prominent Armenian church in Tbilisi, Norashen, remained closed, as did four other smaller Armenian churches in Tbilisi and one in Akhaltsikhe. In addition, the Roman Catholic and Armenian Apostolic Churches, as with Protestant denominations, have had difficulty obtaining permission to construct new churches due to pressure from the GOC.\" \n\nPetros Adamian Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theatre was established in 1858 by the Armenian theatre figure George Chmshkian. The first staging was \"Adji Suleyman\" performance. From 1922 through 1936 before building of the new current theatre building the theatres name was \"Artistic theatre\". In 1936 was built a new theatre building which was named Stepan Shahumian Armenian Theatre, after Bolshevik Stepan Shahumian. The first performance was Mkrtich (Nikita) Djanan's performance \"Shahname\". Here worked Petros Adamian, Siranoush (Merobe Kantarjian), Vahram Papazian, Hovhannes Abelian, Olga Maysourian, Isaac Alikhanian, Mariam Mojorian, Artem and Maria Beroians, Artem Lusinian, Babken Nersesian, Darius Amirbekian, Ashot Kadjvorian, Emma Stepanian, Armenian directors: Arshak Bourdjalian, Leon Kalantar, Stepan Kapanakian, Alexander Abarian, Ferdinand Bzhikian, Hayk Umikian, Mickael Grigorian, Ivan Karapetian, Roman Chaltikian, Roman Matiashvili, Robert Yegian. Music for theatres often was written by Aram Khachaturian, Armen Tigranian, Alexander Spendiarian, and others.\n\nNowadays Peter Adamian Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theatre is the main spiritual and public center of Georgian-Armenian community.\n\nOnce formally known as Paskevich Yerevanski Square, then Lenin Square, it was commonly called Yerevan Square. Ivan Paskevich was a Russian general and was called Paskevich of Yerevan (\"Yerevanski\") in honor of his taking of Yerevan for the Russian Empire. Abutting the north side of Freedom Square is a small open space with a fountain. Buried between the bust of Pushkin and the fountain is the Bolshevik revolutionary Kamo (Simon Ter-Petrossian). His grave has been paved over and is unmarked.\n\nThe heavily Armenian old neighborhoods of Tbilisi still have many Armenian street names, though some have been changed over time. Leselidze Street was once called Armenian Bazaar Street.\n\nVera cemetery was used by local Armenians before the Soviet takeover. Now it is used by Georgians.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tracing its history back to 1914 and being incorporated by royal charter in 1941, the Australian Red Cross Society is the Australian National Society of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The Australian Red Cross is guided by the Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and as such is a secular, neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organisation. \n\nThe Australian Red Cross provides a range of services and programmes including international aid across the Asia-Pacific region, international humanitarian law advocacy, migration support, emergency management, blood donation via the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, and community services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, youth, families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. \n\nHis Excellency General The Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove , Governor-General of Australia, is the Patron of the Australian Red Cross Society and a non-voting member of the National Council. The National Council is the peak governance decision-making body and is made up of 53 voting members including the President and the National Board. The National Council delegates operational and management decisions and other responsibilities to the National Board and the CEO.\n\nIn 2013, the Australian Red Cross was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards.\n\nA branch of the British Red Cross was established in Australia in 1914, nine days after the start of World War I, by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson. The British Red Cross Australian Branch changed its name to the Australian Red Cross Society and was incorporated by royal charter on 28 June 1941. \n\nThe organisation grew at a rapid rate. Lady Helen wrote to the mayors of every shire and municipality in Australia asking them to initiate a local branch. Typically, a letter was published in the local newspaper and a meeting called. By November 1914, New South Wales had 88 city or suburban branches and 249 country branches, all established within the previous four months. The Society was accepted by the community from the beginning. Much of the World War I home front activities such as knitting socks and rolling bandages was done by local Red Cross branches. The Red Cross Information Bureau was established in 1915 in order to coordinate information gathered on the dead and their burial beyond what was provided by the armed forces. The Red Cross Wounded and Missing files were extensive with searchers sometimes sent overseas to clarify information, make better judgements and to resolve conflicting accounts. In 1916 the Australian Red Cross Society sent a team of 21 civilian nurses to France; these nurses were dubbed the \"Bluebirds\" in reference to the colours of their specially-designed uniforms.\n\nDuring World War II the Red Cross provided assistance to the sick, wounded, maimed and their dependents. By agreement with the federal government they provided hostel accommodation to those with no living relatives or friends to support them upon returning home from war. At the time the majority of the volunteers were unemployed married women. High rates of membership in the organisation were attributed to their annual, national, recruitment drive. Membership grew from 260,000 in 1941 to 450,000 in 1944. The Australian Red Cross proved to be an important link between the public and Japanese prisoners of war.\n\nIn 2005, the organisation made an agreement with the Maldives Government to help clear debris created by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In December 2010, aid workers from the Australian Red Cross were sent to Christmas Island to assist the survivors of the 2010 Christmas Island boat disaster. Australian Red Cross volunteers were also active after Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin, the Ash Wednesday bushfires, the Black Saturday bushfires and the 2010–2011 Queensland floods.\n\nThe passion and commitment of the volunteers is widely acknowledged. They rise to natural disaster or personal crisis from bushfire to flood or drought. Today there are more than 60,000 trained volunteers and the entire Australian Red Cross program is funded by public donations and corporate partnerships.\n\nThe eight priority areas of Red Cross in Australia are:\n\n\n"}

They rented properties at above-market rates in the Centenaire area, and remained in the country even after Senegalese president Abdou Diouf's administration granted official recognition to the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan in 1996. The ROC's diplomatic success was not matched by the development of economic relations; instead, the traders from the PRC, actually on the ground in Senegal, were able to cultivate political and popular support. Their efforts paid off in October 2005, when Senegal broke off relations with the ROC and restored its relations with the PRC, an event which was greeted with celebrations by local Chinese migrants. The ROC responded by accusing the PRC of \"buying\" Senegal's allegiance by pledging US$600 million in foreign aid.\n\nIn 2004, the PRC's official \"People's Daily\" published an estimate of 300 Chinese in Senegal. In 2008, the \"South China Morning Post\" published official numbers from an unspecified source stating that 150 Chinese families totalling 200 to 300 people lived in Dakar alone, but Chinese in Senegal who were interviewed estimated the true number might be as high as 1,000. Another report by Radio Australia's Chinese edition in January 2009 put the total number at 2,000.\n\n, there were roughly 200 Chinese-owned shops in Dakar, largely concentrated around Dakar's Boulevard du Centenaire. The area is rapidly becoming known as the local \"Chinatown\", though it still lacks some of the visual features associated with Chinatowns in other countries, such as Chinese lanterns. Chinese merchants typically convert their buildings into shophouses, with living space in the back and retail space in the front. According to a Voice of America report, Chinese wholesalers can gross several thousand dollars per day. Their influence has largely shifted the centre of commerce in Dakar away from the historic Sandaga market to the Centenaire area.\n\nChinese merchants largely sell imported goods; in 2006, imports from China to Senegal accounted for 94% of the two countries' total trade relationship. Larger Senegalese traders who compete with the Chinese shops them often blame them for flooding the market with cheap goods, and even organised a strike in 2004 through their business association UNACOIS (a French acronym for \"Senegalese Union of Traders and Industrialists\") to demand caps on Chinese immigration. In particular, they accuse Chinese merchants of paying bribes and evading taxes. However, the low prices they offer benefit both consumers as well as small itinerant vendors who go door-to-door in poor neighbourhoods reselling goods they purchase from the Chinese. The head of Senegalese consumer association ASCOSEN even organised a counter-protest in opposition to UNACOIS's 2004 protest, in turn accusing them of cheating consumers by selling goods imported from China at prices up to ten times as much as those offered by Chinese traders. Others credit Chinese traders with creating jobs for locals. Each shop employs about two or three local assistants, and one local observer noted that they have had the effect of decreasing crime, as \"young kids who used to be pickpockets are now hired as messengers\".\n\nAs a result of the low prices they offer, Chinese traders have not only been able to outcompete large Senegalese merchants in Dakar, but have also begun to displace diasporic Lebanese from their traditional position as the market-dominant minority there as well; members of those two groups have begun to shift to a business pattern of buying goods from the Chinese and reselling them in more remote areas of the country where no Chinese migrants live. Chinese wholesalers also attract merchants from nearby West African countries, especially Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali, who find it cheaper to come to Senegal to purchase Chinese goods for resale in their home countries, rather than go through the expensive and time-consuming process of obtaining a PRC visa and flying to China themselves.\n\nChinese shop-owners often teach their African employees Mandarin and learn Wolof and French from them in return, a form of language exchange. However, they have little contact with local people outside of work, instead mostly socialising with and living near other Chinese people. They are perceived by local people as a secretive community.\n\nChinese in Senegal have formed a variety of community associations, including:\nChinese traders in Senegal often become the victims of violent crime. In 2002, a woman went missing and was never heard from again; in 2004, Sun Fengzhi and her son Wang Kun were murdered in their home in Dakar. In February 2009, after the murder of businessman Zhao Suiqin (赵遂勤) from Henan, 214 Chinese-owned shops held a work stoppage to protest the slow police investigations of violence against them; some Senegalese merchants also closed their shops in solidarity.\n\n"}

{"id": "1593393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1593393", "title": "Cultural feminism", "text": "Cultural feminism\n\n\"Cultural feminism\" is the view that there is a \"female nature\" or \"female essence\" or related attempts to revalidate attributes ascribed to femaleness. It is also used to describe theories that commend innate differences between women and men.\n\nUnlike radical feminism or socialist feminism, cultural feminism was not an ideology widely claimed by proponents, but was more commonly a pejorative label ascribed by its opponents. Alice Echols, a feminist historian and cultural theorist, credits Brooke Williams with applying the term \"cultural feminism\" in 1975 to describe the depoliticisation of radical feminism, which led to the term being picked during the 1990s by academic feminists to describe various individuals. However, the term surfaced as early as 1971, when Tor Bay, in a letter printed in \"Off Our Backs\", condemned the literary magazine \"Aphra\" as having \"served the cause of cultural feminism.\" Socialist feminist Elizabeth Diggs, in 1972, used the label \"cultural feminism\" to apply to all of radical feminism. In 1974, editors of \"The Lesbian Tide\" asked: \"[I]s dyke-separatism a logical extension of cultural feminism?\" As these varied uses reveal, no single definition of the term existed even among participants in the women's movement.\n\nAlthough the term \"cultural feminist\" is generally applied to individuals in the 1970s, similar lines of thought have been traced to earlier periods. Jane Addams and Charlotte Perkins Gilman argued that in governing the state, cooperation, caring, and nonviolence in the settlement of conflicts society seem to be what was needed from women’s virtues. Josephine Donovan argues that the nineteenth century journalist, critic and women's rights activist, Margaret Fuller, initiated cultural feminism in \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" (1845). She stressed the emotional, intuitive side of knowledge and expressed an organic worldview that is quite different from the mechanistic view of Enlightenment rationalists.\n\nHowever, it was Linda Alcoff's argument in \"Cultural Feminism Versus Post-Structuralism: the Identity Crisis in Feminist Theory\" that led to the widespread adoption of the term to describe contemporary feminists, not their historical antecedents. Alcoff claims cultural feminism places women in an overly determined position overdetermined by what she sees as patriarchal systems. She contends that: Man has said that woman can be defined, delineated, captured, understood, explained, and diagnosed to a level of determination never accorded to man himself, who is conceived as a rational animal with free will. Alcoff makes the point that \"the cultural feminist reappraisal construes woman's passivity as her peacefulness, her sentimentality as her proclivity to nurture, her subjectiveness as her advanced self-awareness\".\n\nTaylor and Rupp have argued that critiques of cultural feminism are often an attack on lesbian feminists. Suzanne Staggenbourg's case study of Bloomington, Indiana led her to conclude that engagement in activities labeled as cultural feminist \"provides little evidence ... a decline in political activity in the women's movement.\"\n\nThe theory emerged in the mid-1970's where it exposed women's oppression in gendered constructions that devaluate feminine attributes. Mary Daly, a cultural feminist theorist, linked \"female energy,\" or her term Gyn/Ecology to the essential life-affirming, life-creating condition of the female spirit/body. Women-only spaces were made by cultural feminists to challenge negative gendered constructions, where they were ran \"by women for women.\" Women only events were being criticized because they excluded men and by excluding men, they were being defined as the problem, rather than locating the problem in the structures of patriarchy.\n\n"}

Dr. West pronounced her one of the most brilliant pupils he had ever known. \n\nAfter graduating, in 1869, she took a post-graduate course, and then spent some time at Brooklyn Heights Seminary as a teacher of the higher branches, and in giving weekly lectures in the Senior and Junior departments. Then came years of continued study and literary pursuits. \n\nAs the temperance enthusiasm spread from Ohio eastward, Greenwood became interested in the movement in her own city. When the Women's Crusade opened, she enlisted at once. She was conspicuous in the white-ribbon movement throughout New York and the nation. When scientific temperance instruction in the New York City schools was being provided for, Greenwood did important work with the legislature, as State superintendent of that department. She served as national superintendent of juvenile work. \n\nBeginning in the WCTU, and many of the churches of Brooklyn, her work extended to nearly all the conservative churches of the large cities and towns in the Eastern seaboard. She was equally at home in jails, asylums, factories, and saloons. For years, served as president of the WCTU on the Hill in Brooklyn, as superintendent of its juvenile work, and as lecturer and evangelist. She spent her summers in the Berkshire Hills, Massachusetts where she preached on Sundays to large audiences. In 1888, she was made superintendent of the evangelistic department of the National WCTU. \"She was but 24 years old,\" wrote Frances E. Willard in 1889, \"when the woman's crusade began. Her remarkable quickness and versatility, her culture and her consecration admirably adapted her to the variety of methods in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Beginning as an evangelist in her own city and a lecturer upon literary and other themes, her work extended through its own success, throughout the Nation.\" As superintendent of the New York State Department of Temperance Instructions in Schools and Colleges, a position she was instrumental in creating through her tireless efforts to bring about the law warranting it, Greenwood made a strenuous campaign in favor of the bill, which carried her all over the State of New York, and worked for it unceasingly. The measure was signed by President Grover Cleveland. \n\nIn 1889, she visited Europe, and there she continued her reform efforts. She did frequent work abroad as a lecturer and evangelist. Greenwood was also keenly interested in woman's suffrage and was one of its early champions in the United States. \n\nFor eighteen years, she was a preacher of the Gospel at Collinsville, Connecticut, and for an even longer period at Sheffield, Massachusetts, where, at the request of neighbors, she commenced a summer Sunday service in the old Ward School House near her home. These services eventually became so crowded that a regular church was opened for her nearby. It was attended by a congregation drawn from a dozen different towns. For seven years, Greenwood occupied the pulpit of the Mayflower Mission of Henry Ward Beecher's church in Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1914, she suffered a breakdown which made her a semi-Invalid and forced her virtual retirement from active work in the field. For the last eight or nine years, she was forced to curtail her active interests in the varied crusades to which she gave her life, but to the last, she read magazines of current events. She died November 28, 1922 at her Brooklyn home after a lingering illness. She was buried Greenwood Cemetery. Greenwood was survived by a sister, Mrs. William C. Hitter; a brother, William Greenwood, and two nieces. \n\n"}

In Sierra Leone, membership of an ethnic group often overlaps with a shared religious identity.\n\nThe largest contest within Sierra Leone's political culture centres upon the competition between the ethnic Temne in Sierra Leone's north-west, and the Mende in Sierra Leone's south-east.\n\nThe vast majority of the Mende support the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). The majority of the Temne support the All People's Congress (APC).\n\nThe largest ethnic group is the Temne at about 36% of Sierra Leone's population. The Temne predominate in the Northern Sierra Leone and the areas around the capital of Sierra Leone.\n\nThe vast majority of Temne are Muslims, with a small Christian minority.\n\nThe Temne are thought to have come from Futa Jallon, which is in present-day Guinea. Sierra Leone's former president Ernest Bai Koroma is the first ethnic Temne to be elected to the office. The majority of the Temne support the All People's Congress (APC).\n\nA major ethnic group are the Mende, at about 33% of Sierra Leone's population. The Mende predominate in the Southern Province and Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of Kono District).\n\nThe Mende are a Muslim majority group, though with a large Christian minority. The Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the Mane, originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe vast majority of the Mende support the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP).\n\nOne of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the Fula at around 3.4% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fulani migrant settlers from the Fouta Jallo, Fouta Toro, and Maasina regions of Guinea, Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania. The Sierra Leone Fula people settled in the Western Area region of Sierra Leone more than four hundred years ago as settlers from mainly the Fouta Djallon Kingdom that expanded to northern Sierra Leone (Kabala, Bombali).\n\nThe Sierra Leonean Fula are traditionally a nomadic, pastoralist, trading people, herding cattle, goats and sheep across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations. Many of the large shopping centers in Sierra Leone are owned and run by the Fula community.\n\nA significant number of the Sierra Leone Fula population are found in all regions of Sierra Leone as traders, and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.\n\nThe third largest ethnic group are the Limba at around 6,4% of the population. The Limba are Indigenous people of Sierra Leone and speak various dialects of a language largely unrelated to other tribal languages in Sierra Leone. They are primarily found in the Northern Province, particularly in Bombali District, Koinadugu and Kambia District. During Sierra Leone's colonial era thousands of Limbas migrated to the capital city of Freetown and its Western Area. As a result, a significant number of Limbas can be found in Freetown and its surrounding Western Area. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, many Limba people were shipped to North America as slaves.\n\n \nA significant ethnic group are the Mandingo (also known as Mandinka). They are descendants of traders from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country.\n\nThey predominate in the large towns, most notably Karina, in Bombali District in the north; Kabala and Falaba in Koinadugu District in the north; and Yengema, Kono District in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims. Sierra Leone's third president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and Sierra Leone's first Vice President Sorie Ibrahim Koroma were both ethnic Mandingo.\n\nNext in proportion are the Kono, who live primarily in Kono District in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana is an ethnic Kono.\n\nThe small but significant Krio people (descendants of freed African American, West Indian and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of Freetown and its surrounding Western Area. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated - they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.\n\nThe Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciacy and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians, though with a significant Muslim minority.\n\nOther minority ethnic groups are the Kuranko, who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in Koinadugu District.\n\nThe Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. Sierra Leone current Finance Minister Kaifala Marah is an ethnic Kuranko.\n\nThe Loko in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority.\n\nThe Susu and their related Yalunka are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea. They are virtually all Muslims.\n\nThe Kissi live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone. They predominate in the large town of Koindu and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District. The vast majority of Kissi are Christians.\n\nThe much smaller Vai are primarily found in Kailahun and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Vai are largely Muslim.\n\nThe Kru are also primarily found in Kailahun and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown. The Kru are largely Christian.\n\nOn the coast in Bonthe District in the south are the Sherbro. Native to Sierra Leone, they have occupied Sherbro Island since it was founded. The Sherbro are primarily fisherman and farmers, and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District. The Sherbro are virtually all Christians, and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders.\n\nA small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full Lebanese ancestry, descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century. They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas, primarily in Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Koidu Town and Makeni.\n"}

She has held numerous leadership roles on Academic boards and public policy councils, and she has authored many publications the social studies of science and technology.\n\nNowotny grew up in Vienna, Austria during World War II. In interviews, she has recalled first wanting to become a scientist at the age of 8, when she was sent to Vorarlberg, the westernmost province of Austria, and quickly learned the local dialect.\n\nNowotny received her doctorate of jurisprudence at the University of Vienna in 1959. After completing her degree, she faced opposition to her application for an assistant professorship in the Department of Criminology there on the basis of her being a woman. She agreed with the hiring professor that if a more capable man applied for the position, he could have the job. In the end, she was hired to the position. It was there that she became interested in the sociology of science. In 1965, she moved to New York City with her husband, where she enrolled in a sociology doctoral program. There, she met Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton, who mentored her throughout her education.\n\nIn 1969, Nowotny earned her Ph.D. in sociology at Columbia University, New York, where she completed her thesis on macrosociology and its methodology. She returned to Vienna to work as an Associate Professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies.\n\nNowotny's work in the 1970s and 1980s includes topics such as scientific controversies and technological risks, social time, coping with uncertainty, self-organization in science and gender relations in science, resulting in major monographs, co-edited and edited books and numerous articles. In 1989, she published the book \"Eigenzeit\" (English title: \"Time: The Modern and Postmodern Experience),\" which has since been translated into several languages.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1995 Helga Nowotny has been President of the International Society for the Study of Time. \nFrom the 1990s onwards she focused her research activities on new topics in social studies of science and technology. She conducted an empirical study on the discovery of high-superconductivity research and its impact on research policy (with Ulrike Felt) and increasingly on the changing relationship between science and society.\n\nIn 1994 Nowotny helped coin the term “Mode 2” for a new mode of applied research focused on solving specific problems. By contrast, “Mode 1” is basic research done within disciplines, initiated by the interest of the investigator, not from external demand.\n\nNext to her teaching and research activities, carried out at several universities and research institutions in Europe, Nowotny had always been intensely engaged in research policy. From 1985-1992 she was Chair of the Standing Committee for the Social Sciences of the European Science Foundation. She has been chair and member of the scientific advisory boards of numerous research institutions and policy-related committees throughout Europe. From 2001 until early 2006 she was Chair of EURAB, the European Research Advisory Board of the European Commission.\n\nNowotny is one of the founding members of the European Research Council, which has been established to fund frontier research at EU level based on the sole criteria of scientific excellence and pan-European competition. There she served as the Vice President and in February 2010, Nowotny was unanimously elected to the position of President of the European Research Council after the resignation of the founding president, Fotis Kafatos. As president of the ERC, she promoted increases in research funding across Europe, and advised new EU member states to increase funding support for their own research programs to prevent a \"brain drain\". She held the position until December 2013.\n\nIn 2014, she was appointed chair of the ERA Council Forum Austria, which advises the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research at the interface of European and national research policy.\n\nCurrently, Nowotny is Chair of the International Advisory Board of the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1981-1982 and 2003-2004 Nowotny was a Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin and from 1992-1999 Permanent Fellow at Collegium Budapest/Institute of Advanced Study. Before moving to ETH Zurich, she was Professor and Head of the newly founded Institute for Theory and Social Studies of Science of the University of Vienna.\n\nFrom 1998 on, Nowotny was Director of the Collegium Helveticum at ETH Zurich. She was the founding director of the post-graduate fellowship programme based at ETH “Society in science: the Branco Weiss Fellowship” until 2004, when she returned to her native Vienna. From 2008 to 2014, Nowotny was a member of the Holberg Committee, which awards the Holberg prize to scholars who have made outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law or theology.\n\nNowotny has held teaching and research positions at the Institute of Advanced Study in Vienna, King's College, Cambridge, UK, the University of Bielefeld, the Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. Nowotny is vice president of the council for the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings.\n\nNowotny is a Member of Academia Europaea and Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences since 2006. Among other honours she has been awarded the J.D. Bernal Prize for her lifelong achievements in social studies of science. In October 2015, she received an honorary doctorate at the University of Bergen. She has also received an honorary doctorate from the Weizmann Institute of Science and the University of Twente.\n\nIn September 2017, she was awarded the President's Medal of the British Academy \"for her contribution to the founding and shaping of the European Research Council, and positively influencing the shape of research funding and research policy in the UK and Europe\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9337359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9337359", "title": "Internalized racism", "text": "Internalized racism\n\nInternalized racism is a form of internalized oppression, defined by sociologist Karen D. Pyke as the \"internalization of racial oppression by the racially subordinated.\" In her study \"The Psychology of Racism, \" Robin Nicole Johnson emphasizes that internalized racism involves both \"conscious and unconscious acceptance of a racial hierarchy in which whites are consistently ranked above People of Color.\" These definitions encompass a wide range of instances, including, but not limited to, belief in negative racial stereotypes, adaptations to white cultural standards, and thinking that supports the status quo (i.e. denying that racism exists).\n\nInternalized racism as a phenomenon is a direct product of a racial classification system, and is found across different racial groups and regions around the world where race exists as a social construct. In these places, internalized racism can have adverse effects on those who experience it. For example, high internalized racism scores have been linked to poor health outcomes among Caribbean black women, higher propensity for violence among African American young males, and increased domestic violence among Native American populations in the US.\n\nResponses to internalized racism have been varied. Many of the approaches focus on dispelling false narratives learned from racial oppression. An example of opposition to internalized racism is the \"Black is beautiful\" cultural movement in the US, which sought to \"directly attack [the] ideology\" that blackness was ugly.\n\nAlthough some definitions of internalized racism only include when racial stereotypes are internalized by the racial marginalized groups, internalized racism has been used to discuss much more than this. The creators of the Appropriated Racial Oppression Scale (AROS) note that perhaps a more accurate phrase would be \"appropriated racial oppression,\" because this distances the usage away from potentially \"victim blaming\" implications that the internalization of racist ideals and attitudes is due to some failure of the oppressed. Additionally, the term \"appropriation\" indicates that internalized racism is learned from context, and therefore a product of socialization in a racialized society.\n\nAlternatively, Bianchi, Zea, Belgrave, and Echeverry propose that internalized racism is a \"state of racial self-conceptualization,\" conforming to racial oppression, as opposed to dissonance, resistance or the internalization of a positive racial identity.\n\nInternalized racism has also been referred to as indoctrination and mental colonization. These phrases draw attention to the historical context of colonialism being used to create and maintain a system of white superiority.\n\nInternalized racism is also explored in the Nigrescence model, introduced by William E. Cross in 1971. It explains how internalized racism in Black Americans involves the belief that white cultural values are superior than their own. Cross writes, “The driving force behind this need requires Afro-Americans to seek approval from whites in all activities, to use white expectations as the yardstick for determining what is good, desirable or necessary.” This conviction can be corrected when black individuals self-determine their identities apart from the influence of their white counterparts.\n\nScholars have picked different dimensions to categorize internalized racism. Psychologists David and Okazaki proposed that examples of internalized racism could be divided into the following: \"internalized inferiority, feelings of shame and embarrassment, physical characteristics, within-group discrimination, and minimization or acceptance of oppression.\" Alternatively, Campón and Carter use this list: \"appropriations of negative stereotypes, thinking that maintains status quo (denying racism), adaptation to white cultural standards, devaluation of own group, and emotional reactions.\" These categories influence how scholars organize their measurements of internalized racism.\n\nAcademics have attempted to create reliable measures of internalized racism, in order to test its correlation to health outcomes and other variables of interest. Some examples of existing scales are the Nadanolitization (NAD) and Internalized Racial Oppression Scales (used for Black Americans), the Colonial Mentality scale (used for Filipinos), and the Mochichua Tepehuani Scale (used for Chicanx/Latinx populations). The Appropriated Racial Oppression Scale (AROS) is designed as measure for all racial minorities. In the AROS, Campón and Carter use items such as \"There have been times when I have been embarrassed to be a member of my race,\" \"I would like for my children to have light skin,\" and \"People take racial jokes too seriously\" to assess an individual's level of internalized racism.\n\nTo explore the dimensions of internalized racism mentioned above, here are some of the ways in which scholars have observed the effects of internalized racism.\nAn empirical example of internalized racism is Kenneth and Mamie Clark's doll experiment, which was done in America at a time when black and white children were segregated. It involved an African-American child being presented with two dolls that were identical apart from skin and hair color, one doll being white with yellow hair and the other being brown with black hair. The child was asked which doll they would prefer to play with and why. All children in the study expressed a clear preference for the white doll.\n\nIn 2006 Kiri Davis recreated the experiment with 21 African-American preschool children for her documentary \"A Girl Like Me\". Davis found that 15 of the children chose white dolls over black dolls, giving similar reasons as the original study subjects that associated white with \"pretty\" or \"good\" and black with \"ugly\" or \"bad.\"\n\nThere is also an industry behind skin whitening products, which can be found from India to China to the United States. Because lighter skin is associated with desirable characteristics, people purchase such products in order to become lighter skinned.\n\nStereotype threat is a phenomenon studied in psychology in which members of a stigmatized group risk conforming to negative stereotypes through internalization of their validity. In a 2018 study from Taylor, Garcia, Shelton and Yantis, note that both stereotype threat and a \"black sheep effect\" are products of internalized racism. Through being reminded of negative stereotypes associated with their race, participants responded with increased uncertainty, lower performance on tasks, and emotional reactions of anger and shame. They also sought to distance themselves from ingroup, stereotype confirming members, so as to avoid being targeted with negative generalizations.\n\nStereotype threat from internalized racism goes beyond the individual. Those who experience internalized racism may end up projecting internalized negative attitudes onto others in their racial group. For example, teachers of color in the United States risk seeing their students through the lens of internalized racism. Because a teacher's expectations for a student's success can have empirical impacts on their educational outcomes, this puts students of color at an increased risk for impaired educational development.\n\nInternalized racism manifests itself in both intraracial and interracial discrimination. As an example of the intraracial case, Karen Pyke uses the term \"defensive othering\" to describe an individual or collective act of distancing oneself from members within one's own race that have a closer proximity to negative stereotypes. Defensive othering includes the use of the derogatory term \"FOB\" (short for \"Fresh Off the Boat\") among Asian Americans. Although the racism towards newly arrived immigrants of Asian origin is neither the fault of the immigrants themselves or other Asian Americans, immigrants are often socially ostracized by members of their shared race because of internalized racism.\n\nIn terms of interracial discrimination among the non-dominant racial groups, Robert E. Washington discusses \"brown racism,\" his term for prejudice among non-black people of color towards black people, worldwide. With examples from Egypt, China, India and other regions, Washington notes that, through internalized racism, non-black people of color are reproducing white desirability and a devaluation of blackness. Internalized racism goes beyond negative attitudes and beliefs about one's own group: one can internalize racism directed towards other races as well.\n\nThe educational environment students are surrounded in can result in the development of internalized racism. When students from a minority group are placed in a school where the teachers and/or peers are majority white, the lack of diverse representation can produce feelings of inferiority. The perception of the majority group as superior can compel minority students to take on the cultural norms of that group in order to prevent alienation. Furthermore, the predominately white curriculum incorporated into the education system can give minority students the impression that only Eurocentric history is important. This further makes underrepresented students internalize that the history of their origins are insignificant. \n\nAlthough much of the literature that has been produced on internalized racism has been confined to the African American experience in the United States, internalized racism is characteristic of systemic racism. The following is a look at internalized racism in different geographical regions around the world.\n\nIn order to create the nation of the United States on land that was already inhabited, a narrative of native inferiority was often employed to justify their subjugation. As a result of an overgeneralized picture of native peoples as being defeated and white invaders as victors, internalized racism continues to present itself in Native American communities. Julian Rice notes that apathy towards cultural traditions, self-centeredness, and materialistic obsession could all be seen as a adoption of narratives from the US government or missionaries that emphasized the superior mindset of whiteness. Lisa Poupart adds to these assertions, saying that Native Americans are forced into a \"double consciousness,\" of being simultaneously deprived of past traditions and constantly reminded that those traditions were taken from them. Although she does not seek to use internalized racism to dismiss blame in cases of alcoholism, family violence, and sexual assault, she describes how the combination of stereotypes about the stoic and savage native, the introduction of physical violence to native communities through requiring children to go to boarding schools, and the adoption of white notions of patriarchy combined to create these types of violence and abuses in American Indian communities, where they had been virtually coexistent before European contact. In the case of alcoholism especially, internalized racism about native inferiority created conditions of dependency on European superiority, leading to the creation of negative stereotypes.\n\nBecause Brazilians have many different ethnic origins, race in brazil is often conceptualized as a racial democracy: a system that involves so much interracial marriage and interaction that systemic racism isn't a national problem. However, many scholars actually contest this definition, referring to this idea as \"the myth of racial democracy,\" because prejudice and discrimination based on race is still prevalent. Nonetheless, it is important to note that race, as a social construct, has a unique conceptualization in Brazil. As opposed the \"one-drop\" rule employed in the US (i.e. \"one-drop\" of black blood constitutes a person's blackness), Brazilians recognize a spectrum of race and color-based identities.\n\nThe first major instance of internalized racism in Brazil comes out of this spectrum. A 1976 national survey found that there were over 100 colloquial terms in use to describe race-related phenotypes. Examples of these terms include \"black (preto, negro), white (branco), brown or mixed (moreno, mulato), dark (escuro), light (claro), closed (fechado), freckled (sarard), and others.\" The use of various terms for color and race often serves as evidence of the following notions, among others: whiteness is beauty, whiteness is clean, whiteness is successful and blackness is dirty. Anthropologist Elizabeth Hordge-Freeman found this especially apparent when working with and around pregnant women in a poor and working-class neighborhood in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Women expressed a clear desire and preferential treatment for child that were \"whiter\" in appearance, even engaging in practices of pinching an infant's nose to try to make it smaller. Many of the women she worked with were racially black, or mixed race.\n\nAdditionally, race in Brazil is not confined to physical indicators. Individuals who are black can gain higher economic status and gain recognition as \"white\" or \"whitened\" by both black and white Brazilians alike. This conflates economic success with whiteness and poverty with blackness, as well as incentivizing the idea of \"whitening,\" whether through \"money whiteness\" or interracial mixture. This furthers the incidence of internalized racism by getting Brazilians of all race to have largely positive associations with whiteness and largely negative associations with blackness.\n\nIn a study designed to compare the incidence of internalized racism in a country that underwent direct European colonization (Zimbabwe) and a country that has maintained is pre-colonial monarchy to date (Swaziland), social science researchers investigated the role of historical context and education in internalized racism. A major motivating factor for this study was the fact that internalized racism has largely gone unstudied in the African continent. The study found that, despite the scholars' hypothesis that Zimbabwe would have more internalized racism, there was no significant difference in internalized racism incidence between the countries. They believe that this is due to the widespread nature of racism systems, which still came into contact with Swaziland through trade relations. They also found increased education had a significant negative correlation with internalized racism.\n\nThe case of China is of interest because some have argued that racism, and race itself doesn't exist in China. However, Dutch Historian Frank Dikötter argues that everything from the practice of using cranium weight between races as a measure of white and Chinese superiority to the physical attacks and demonstrations of Chinese university students against African students make it clear that race is indeed recognized in China. Indeed the context of race and racism in China is heavily affected by the fact that the large majority of the county is identified as Han Chinese (90.56% of the reported population in 2005). 55 minority ethnic groups are recognized by the government, giving the government the power to dictate different groups as legitimate (and therefore eligible for less taxes, more subsidies and less restrictions) or illegitimate. This creates an environments in which groups attempt to gain their validation and sense of worth from the dominant Han Chinese and the state, internalizing a subordinate position. Because this system involves policing of social groups, it also involves discriminatory practices which are then internalized by both recognized and unrecognized minority groups.\n\nThis section discusses the implications of internalized racism, and why the topic is significant. It should be noted that examples of psychological harm related to internalized racism are not given in attempt to describe internalized racism as product of the psyche of the oppressed. Internalized racism is not defined as a weakness in the minds of the oppressed.\n\nHigh scores on internalized racism have been repeatedly correlated with a variety of poor psychological and physical health outcomes among sample populations including African Americans, US-Born Caribbean Blacks, foreign-born Caribbean Blacks, Filipino Americans, non-American Pacific Islanders and multiracial samples of Americans. \n\nA study conducted by researchers Mouzon and McLean found that there is a positive correlation between internalized racism in black individuals and the state of their mental health, specifically depression and psychological distress. The results showed that African-Americans and US-born Caribbean Blacks embodied more internal racism, and thus experienced poorer mental health than foreign born Caribbean Blacks. A similar study by researchers Graham and West discovered that anxiety is also correlational to internalized racism in black individuals. This conclusion is significant considering that, “... anxiety disorders have been found to be more persistent in Black American populations as compared to other racial groups.” The same study goes on to describe the methods therapists can take to mitigate the anxiety in black individuals caused by internalized racism, such as rationalizing negative thoughts.\n\nAsian Americans are also subject to internalized racism, and the Internalized Racism in Asian Americans Scale (IRAAS) was created by researchers to determine the extent in which Asian Americans accepted the negative stereotypes about themselves. This results revealed that there is a correlation between mental health and the degree in which Asian Americans subscribe to the adverse racial stereotypes. These effects include lower self esteem, symptoms of depression, and general psychological distress. \n\nFor more examples of studies that show significant relations of internalized racism to increased incidence of anxiety and depression, low individual and collective self-esteem, low sense of ethnic identity, lower levels of life satisfaction, higher body fat measures and other measures of psychological distress, please see the Further Reading section below. These studies imply that internalized racism subjects the racially oppressed to a wide range of adverse mental and physical health outcomes.\n\nIn her book, \"What Does It Mean to Be White? Developing White Racial Literacy\", Robin DiAngelo describes the cycle of racism as a feedback loop that uses power, control, and economics to go from (1) systematic mistreatment of a group to creation of misinformation to, (2) societal acceptance of misinformation to, (3) internalized oppression and internalized dominance to, (4) racism perpetuated and enforced by institutions, leading to, (4) justification for further mistreatment. In other words, internalized racism is involved in reinforcing racism, and ensuring that it continues. It creates a justification for continued mistreatment of the racially subjugated. Additionally, it can create an acceptance of the status quo, leading some to conclude that racism is not an issue that needs to be addressed. If members of racially oppressed groups internalize the validity of their own oppression, they have no reason to contest the system. Internalized racism can also be seen as a means of \"dividing and conquering\" racially subordinate groups to create conflicts between them and suppress united efforts to contest racism.\n\nMany have offered approaches to address internalized racism. Ron Chisom, the co-founder and executive director of The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond in New Orleans, suggests a six-point approach for those who experience internalized racism:\n\n\nDavid W. Concepción notes that because confronting internalized oppression often creates a paradox for people having to see themselves as both a victim and perpetrator of that oppression, a major factor in addressing internalized oppression is being able to confront false narratives while at the same time employing self-forgiveness.\n\nMarc Weinblatt and Cheryl Harrison emphasize that one must acknowledge that race is a social category with real implications while at the same time reject the falsehoods behind racist attitudes. Because finding this balance can be difficult, it is often helpful to have separate spaces for those who experience internalized oppression and those who experience internalized privilege. Additionally, Weinblatt makes it clear that there is a need for those with privilege to risk it in order to seek the end of racism.\n\nAn example of a movement that considers some of the above considerations is the \"Black is Beautiful\" movement. These efforts began during the Black Power movement in the 1960s in the United States. In order to contest the narratives that blackness was something ugly, inferior and less valuable, members of the Black community began fighting back with advertising and other media campaigns. The idea behind the movement has persisted to the present day, with social media based movements such as \"Black Girl Magic\" and \"Black Boy Joy\" that aim to celebrate blackness.\n\nDr. Watts-Jones indicates in her study that there is a possible method in which African Americans can overcome their internalized racism. By finding sanctuary within the African American community, members are able to achieve mental and physical security from their racist environment. Dr. Watts-Jones states that the collective experience of pain in African Americans work in tandem to heal together. However, the process of healing can be extended outside the African American community, by allowing other racial groups to perceive African Americans’ internalized racism as well. In doing so, White people can be utilized as an ally rather than another force of oppression.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1107228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1107228", "title": "Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs", "text": "Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) is an Israeli research institute specializing in public diplomacy and foreign policy founded in 1976. Currently, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs's research portfolio consists of five primary initiatives: the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA), Defensible Borders Initiative, Jerusalem in International Diplomacy, Iran and the New Threats to the West, and Combating Delegitimization. More broadly, the think-tank concentrates on the topics of Iran, Radical Islam, the Middle East, Israel, the Peace Process, Jerusalem, Anti-Semitism, and World Jewry.\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also publishes the academic journal, \"Jewish Political Studies Review\". The journal is published biannually and is \"the first and only journal dedicated to the study of Jewish political institutions and behavior, Jewish political thought, and Jewish public affairs.\" The research institute is a registered non-profit organization and produces content in English, Hebrew, French, and German.\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also produces the \"Daily Alert\" for the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a daily news summary and analysis concerning Israel, Iran, radical Islam, and other regional security issues distributed through email. Much of the research behind the \"Daily Alert\" is conducted by the Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs Director of Internet Publishing Mark Amiel. Because the \"Daily Alert\" is published in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs office in Jerusalem, the time-zone difference between its publication and much of its targeted audience in Europe and North America is greatly beneficial. In part, the project was conceived to ensure that politicians and thought leaders would have an authoritative source of the most important daily news on their desk every morning. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs website, a member of the United States Department of State commented that, \"The [Daily] \"Alert\" is one of the first things I turn to in the morning for information and insight on what may be the talk of the town that day. I'm better prepared because of them.\"\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs was established in 1978 by Daniel Elazar as an umbrella organization encompassing the Center for Jewish Community Studies and the Jerusalem Institute for Federal Studies. Elazar personally raised most of the funds for the operation of the organization and the restoration of an historic building on Tel Hai Street in Jerusalem, named in honor of the Milken family. The building, Beit Milken, served as the Embassy of Uruguay from 1957 to 1980, when Uruguay decided to move their embassy to Tel Aviv. In 1989, the 1,200 ton building was moved 16 meters on rails to reach the site it currently occupies.\n\nDr. Dore Gold, Israel’s former ambassador to the UN and former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, headed the Jerusalem Center from 2000 to 2015, when he took a leave of absence to become director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dore Gold has returned as president of the Jerusalem Center.\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is an organisation which largely focuses on Israeli security, regional diplomacy, and international law. The essence of the organization's positions regarding final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians was articulated within their \"Defensible Borders Initiative\". A continuing project dating back to the early-2000s, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has made explicit their stance on the matter, particularly in a YouTube video released in May 2010.\n\nRegarding the Jordan Rift Valley, the organization is opposed to the presence of international peacekeeping troops given their poor track-record in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and Southern Lebanon (see United Nations Emergency Force and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon). Accordingly, the organization argues that Israel must retain control of the Jordan Valley. Concerning the future of the Palestinian territories, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs advocates for demilitarization and Israel's ability to exercise control of airspace and electromagnetic communications throughout Judea and Samaria (otherwise known as the West Bank).\n\nResearch conducted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs fellow Nadav Shragai, as well as, the organization's program \"Jerusalem in International Diplomacy\" maintain that Jerusalem should remain unified and under Israeli sovereignty. Also, the organization is unequivocally opposed, and actively seeks to undermine, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Another core program of the institute, \"Combating Delegitimization and BDS\", alongside the work of scholar Dan Diker demonstrates the movement's objectives of achieving a one-state solution, dismantling Israel, and its correlation with anti-Semitism incidents.\n\nThe think-tank is a supporter of the two-state solution calling for a \"demilitarized Palestinian state\" alongside Israel.\n\nAs well, it should be noted that the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs does not comment, publish, or advocate any explicit policy decisions concerning Israeli domestic security. Accordingly, no articles, videos, or major publications on the think-tank's website will discuss political coalitions in Israel nor mention its major parties (e.g. Likud, Zionist Union, etc.).\n\nThe Jerusalem Center founded the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA) jointly with the Wechsler Family Foundation. The current director of the ICA is Ambassador Alan Baker. Through this outlet, the JCPA publishes \"Jerusalem Issue Briefs\" and \"Jerusalem Viewpoints\". They also publish the twice-yearly \"Strategic Perspectives\", special reports presenting studies on Israeli security and diplomacy topics by the Contributing Editors board of the ICA. The JCPA is also the publisher of the \"Jewish Political Studies Review\", an academic journal which publishes articles on Jewish public affairs, Jewish institutions and behavior, and Jewish political thought. It is published twice yearly.\n\nIn 2008, JCPA founded the Institute for Global Jewish Affairs in response to growing international anti-Semitism. Directed by Manfred Gerstenfeld, the institute addresses a variety of topics related to Jewish communities around the world. The institute helps direct the \"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project\" and its associated monthly publication \"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism,\" both of which attend to global anti-Semitism. More can be learned about these below in the Programs and Initiatives section. The JCPA also produces a related publication entitled \"Changing Jewish Communities,\" which is less focused on global anti-Semitism and, therefore, addresses a wide variety of issues related to global Jewish communities. Additionally, the JCPA has organized a publication called \"Jewish Environmental Studies,\" which looks deeply at Jewish environmental studies as a separate and important field and analyzes Jewish environmental thought through references from the Bible and classic Jewish texts.\n\nIn addition to their written publications, the JCPA produces numerous videos that analyze a variety of issues pertaining to Israel and the Middle East. These include videos created by the center as well as videos of JCPA contributors appearing in various news outlets or conference venues. The videos can be found on the JCPA website or on the JCPA’s YouTube page.\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has recently published multiple studies relating to Israeli security, international diplomacy, and the status of Jerusalem. As part of the organization's emphasis on making their material public and accessible, all of their major survey studies are digitalized and published on their website.\n\nIn the wake of the so-called 'Knife Intifada', the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs published a collection edited by in-house scholar Fiamma Nirenstein. The collaborative project features articles by, among others, former Ambassadors Dore Gold, \nAlan Baker, and Freddy Eytan, as well as Brigadier General Yossi Kuperwasser and Dan Diker. The overarching theme of the publication focused on the similarity, rather than the misconceived differences, between terrorism in Israel and Europe. Moreover, several articles presented a valuable sociological exploration of Israeli society and its penchant for preparedness, vigilance, and resilience.\n\nAnother seminal work published in 2016 by in-house scholar Dan Diker was an in-depth exploration of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction (BDS) movement. Entitled \"BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends\", Diker traces the roots of the BDS movement arguing that it represents only the most recent incarnation of a historical attempt to boycott Israel. The publication also references foundational members of BDS (e.g. Omar Barghouti) in demonstrating the movement's support for the one-state solution and dismantling of the Israeli state. The book also demonstrates a powerful relationship between BDS activities and anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses.\n\nJerusalem also features largely in the think-tank's work. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs scholar, Nadav Shragai, published a historical and legal evaluation of Jerusalem and the city's role in final status peace negotiations entitled \"\". Informed, in part, by recent polling data from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Shragai argues that a majority of Jerusalem's Arabs favour preserving their Israeli citizenship rather than substituting it for a Palestinian one. More importantly for Shagrai, Jerusalem's Arab community is increasingly being incorporated into the Jewish municipal fabric and represents a valuable dimension to future negotiations over the status of Jerusalem.\n\nOn March 24, 2014, the Jerusalem Center held a conference entitled \"Europe and Israel: A New Paradigm.\" The conference focused on the complicated relationship between Israel and Europe, including topics such as economics and the BDS movement, security and anti-Semitism. The conference was well attended and received a significant amount of press, including articles in \"The Times of Israel\", \"The Jerusalem Post\", J-Wire, Ynetnews, and CBN News.\n\nOne of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs major research initiatives, Defensible Borders for Israel, seeks to \"analyzes current terror threats and Israel's corresponding territorial requirements, particularly in the strategically vital West Bank.\" The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs maintains that Israel must continue to exercise this right to preserve Israel's security requirements.\n\nThe program's inception dates back to a joint conference with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in 2004. Accordingly, the think-tank deepened its ties with organizations including the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Herzliya Conference based on presentations concerning \"defensible borders\". According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the organization played a pivotal role in publicizing the term \"defensible borders\" and its ascension within the lexicon of contemporary Middle Eastern security issues.\n\nThe Jerusalem Center for Public Affair's most recent publication emanating from this initiative was published in 2014 entitled, \"Israel's Critical Requirements for Defensible Borders: The Foundation for a Secure Peace\". The monograph is the latest version of an earlier study, \"Israel's Critical Security Requirements for Defensible Borders: The Foundations for a Viable Peace\". Most of the updated material was added in late 2013 and early 2014. The publication included sections written by Moshe Yaalon, Dore Gold, Uzi Dayan, Yossi Kuperwasser, and Dan Diker. The content ranged from Israel's long-term security needs and defensible borders, to the shortcomings of United Nations Resolution 242 and key principles for a demilitarized Palestinian state.\n\nA core component of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs concerns efforts by the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to delegitimize Israel. According to the organization's website, the initiative \"is a major multilingual public diplomacy program\" which seeks to expose those who undermine Israel's very legitimacy. This programme entails reinforcing the connection between \"the Jewish people and their historical homeland including Jerusalem.\" Many of the institute's scholars, including Dan Diker and Ambassador Alan Baker, have published extensively on subjects pertaining to this initiative. This includes Dan Diker's \"BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends\" as well as Ambassador Baker's \"Palestinian Manipulation of the International Community\".\n\nJerusalem's centrality to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has ensured that it is a subject which garners disproportionate scrutiny. The intermingling of religious, political, and legal dimensions has encouraged the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs to publish extensively on the subject. Spearheaded by Nadav Shragai, the initiative has led to such publications as, \"Jerusalem: Delusions of Division\" (2015), \"Jerusalem: Correcting the International Discourse\" (2012), and \"The 'Al-Aksa Is in Danger Libel: The History of a Lie\" (2012). As outlined in the organization's policy video, the interlocking Arab and Jewish neighbourhoods of Jerusalem make division unfeasible. Mindful of Jerusalem's history during the Jordanian occupation when religious freedoms were curtailed, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs believes that the city must remain undivided and under Israeli sovereignty.\n\nThis program focuses on security threats posed by Iran to Israel and the West. The program began with a publication entitled “Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide,” authored by Dore Gold and Elie Wiesel, among others. The publication was created in response to multiple threats directed toward Israel by the Iranian leader, including a 2006 declaration that “Israel should be wiped off the map.” The JCPA continues to monitor security threats posed by Iran in the post-Ahmadinejad era with this program.\n\nInitiated by Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld, the program focuses on anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and \"its origins and lessons, manifestations and mutations.\" The initiative produces a monthly publication which addresses issues concerning past and presents acts directed against World Jewry and, among other issues, highlights anti-Israel boycotts, the manipulation of Holocaust history, and anti-Semitism emanating from Muslim and Christian communities. The program consists of conferences, seminars, lectures, interviews, and essays. As well, its content is available in English and French. The most recent publication, \"Why a New Academic Discipline of Post-Holocaust Studies Should Be Established and What Its Content Should Be\", argues that while the Holocaust has been instrumental in shaping modern society, its study is often confined to mass murder while its continued influence today is often neglected.\n\nThis program covers issues pertaining to Israel and international law. The goal of the program is to “protect Israel’s legal rights in its conflict with the Palestinians, the Arab world, and radical Islam.” Topics include the legality of settlements, human rights, and Israeli border issues, among others. Avi Bell directs the program. Additional contributors include Robert Sabel, Ruth Lapidoth, Irit Kohn, Alan Baker, Meir Rosenne, and Justus Weiner.\n\nThe following individuals have presented some form of involvement with the JCPA.\n\n\n"}

Within Israel's system of local government, an urban municipality can be granted a city council by the Interior Ministry when its population exceeds 20,000. The term \"city\" does not generally refer to local councils or urban agglomerations, even though a defined city often contains only a small portion of an urban area or metropolitan area's population.\n\nIsrael has 15 cities with populations over 100,000, including Jerusalem at over 500,000 (including occupied East Jerusalem), and Tel Aviv. In all, there are 77 Israeli localities granted \"municipalities\" (or \"city\") status by the Ministry of the Interior.

According to Census 2011, there are 36,683 people of Lithuanian birth resident in the Republic of Ireland. Approximately one third of these Lithuanians live in County Dublin.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, thousands of Lithuanian Jews lived in Ireland. Robert Briscoe, who served as lord mayor of Dublin in 1956-57 and 1961–62, was son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to Ireland. In contrast, the current immigration is of majority Catholic Lithuanians, as Lithuania contained few Jews in 2000.\n\nIn 1935, Feliksas Vaitkus, the sixth person who had a successful flight over Atlantic Ocean with a single engine single seat fixed-wing aircraft, landed in Ireland. Vaitkus flew his transatlantic flight with \"Lituanica II\". Vaitkus had to fight the worst possible weather conditions and was helped considerably by hourly broadcasts from an Irish radio station. He learned that Dublin was fogged in, as well as all areas heading east as far as the Baltic Sea. He knew that he could not make it to Kaunas due to his low fuel supply, and being exhausted after a 23-hour struggle fighting the elements, he felt it was best to come down somewhere in Ireland. He spotted an open field in Cloongowla at Ballinrobe, County Mayo and came down, with the aircraft suffering extensive damage. He was lucky to survive and not sustain any significant injuries. \"Lituanica II\" was crated for shipment to Lithuania, where it was restored. Vaitkus made his way to Kaunas, by ship and train, where he was given a hero’s welcome.\n\nThe Lithuanian Association in Ireland Limited, officially registered in January 2005, has been active since 1999.

The name \"Pahari\" (not to be confused with the various other languages with that name) is Grierson's term.\n\nThe Pahari languages fall into three groups.\n\n\n\n\nIn Eastern and Central Pahari the verb substantive is formed from the root \"ach\", as in both Rajasthani and Kashmiri. In Rajasthani its present tense, being derived from the Sanskrit present \"rcchami\", I go, does not change for gender. But in Pahari and Kashmiri it must be derived from the rare Sanskrit particle \"*rcchitas\", gone, for in these languages it is a participial tense and does change according to the gender of the subject. Thus, in the singular we have: – Here we have a relic of the old Khasa language, which, as has been said, seems to have been related to Kashmiri. Other relics of Khasa, again agreeing with north-western India, are the tendency to shorten long vowels, the practice of \"epenthesis\", or the modification of a vowel by the one which follows in the next syllable, and the frequent occurrence of disaspiration. Thus, Khas \"siknu\", Kumauni \"sikno\", but Hindi \"sikhna\", to learn; Kumauni \"yeso\", plural \"yasa\", of this kind.\n\nMaterials regarding Western Pahari are not so complete. The speakers are not brought into contact with Tibeto-Burman languages, and hence we find no trace of these. But the signs of the influence of north-western languages are, as might be expected, still more apparent than farther east. In some dialects epenthesis is in full swing, as in (Churahi) \"khata\", eating, fern, \"khaiti\". Very interesting is the mixed origin of the postpositions defining the various cases. Thus, while that of the genitive is generally the Rajasthani ro, that of the dative continually points to the west. Sometimes it is the Sindhi \"khë\". At other times it is \"jo\", where is here a locative of the base of the Sindhi genitive postposition \"jo\". In all Indo-Aryan languages, the dative postposition is by origin the locative of some genitive one. In vocabulary, Western Pahari often employs, for the more common ideas, words which can most readily be connected with the north-western and Pisaca groups. (See Indo-Aryan Languages.)\n\nThe Himalayas run along Nepal, India and Pakistan. The word 'Pahar' means a 'mountain' in most local languages such as Nepalese, Hindi (Parbat being a synonym) as well as Urdu (Koh being a synonym). Due to its mass prevalence and usage in the Himalayan Region, the language is also known as Himalayan. Like all other languages of the region, the Pahari languages are also from the Indo-European, and in particular Indo-Iranian branch of languages. As mountains have the tendency of isolating communities from change, dialects in the mountains tend to have their own characteristics with some similarity to others mountain dialects while remaining isolated from one another – there does seem to be a dialect continuum. All of these dialects are commonly referred to as the 'Pahari' languages, and most people from the Himalayan range as known as Paharis.\n\nHimachali Pahari Language\n"}

Subsequently, he became one of the leading actors for about two decades, along with Shantaram, Prithviraj Kapoor, Motilal etc. He starred in about 170 feature films in a variety of roles. He directed a few films such as \"Mohar\", \"Mala\" (1943), \"Pratima\", \"Rajghar\" and \"Saagar\" (1951), which he produced. In 1980, he was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest award for films in India, for his contributions to Indian cinema.\n\nJairaj was born in Karimnagar, Hyderabad State (of which the present day Telangana State was a part) on 28 September 1909. A nephew of Sarojini Naidu, he had three brothers - Paidipati Sundararaja Naidu, Paidipati Deendayal Naidu (Artist) and Paidipati Jairaj was the youngest.\n\nJairaj developed an interest in theatre and films during his graduate studies at Nizam College, and left for Bombay in 1929. He made his acting debut in 1929 with the silent film \"Star Kling Youth\", and subsequently he acted in about eleven silent films including \"Triangle of Love\", \"Mathru Bhoomi\", \"All for Lover\", \"Mahasagar Mothi\", \"Flight into Death\", \"My Hero\" etc.\n\nJairaj's effective dialogue delivery, and experience in Telugu theatre made him an instant choice to play the roles of the sword wielding Rajputs. He played the characters of Amar Singh Rathore [1957], Prithviraj Chauhan [1959], and Maharana Pratap [1960] among notable films. He also essayed the roles of Shah Jahan [1947], Tipu Sultan [1959] and Haider Ali [1962] with equal aplomb. His other memorable portrayals have been in films such as \"Sassi Punnu\" [1947], \"Hatimtai\" [1956], \"Chandrashekar Azad\" [1963] and \"Durga Das\" [1964] among others. Jairaj did six films with Suraiya in the 1940s and 1950s, five of them, viz. \"Humaari Baat\" (1943), \"Singaar\" (1949), \"Amar Kahani\" (1949), \"Rajput\" (1951) and \"Resham\" (1952) as her hero, and one of them, \"Lal Kunwar\" (1952), as second lead. In 1952, he produced and directed his own film \"Sagar\", which was not very well received by the audiences. But his commitment to cinema remained undisputed.\n\nHe married a Punjabi woman, Savitri, from Delhi. It was an arranged marriage. Prithviraj Kapoor's father had chosen the bride for him. He had two sons and four daughters. His wife died a year before him of cancer. His daughter Geeta looked after him in his last year. Rajan Shahi, TV producer-director, is his daughter's son (maternal grandson), the sole person of Jairaj's extended family in Bollywood. Jairaj died in Mumbai on 11 August 2000.\n\nA one-hour documentary, Life journey of Jairaj, was made by the Government of Telangana in 2018 to celebrate his life.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25244875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25244875", "title": "Rath tribe", "text": "Rath tribe\n\nThe Rath (Rajasthani: रथ ) are a Rajput community, found in the state of Rajasthan in India. They also settled in Punjab and Sindh provinces Pakistan. They are also known as Rathi, although their preferred self-designation is Rajput.\n\nThe Rath are said to get their name from the Rathi breed of cattle, which they used to and still herd. They are divided into three major sub-groups, the Parihar or sometimes referred to as Parhar Rath, the Joyia or and the Bohar, and a number of minor lineages, such as the Chanar, Larr, Chhachhar and Chandani. According to the traditions of the Parhar Rath, they were originally Parihar Rajputs of Mandore, who were defeated by the Rathores, and fled to Sindh. During their period of exile, the Parhar were converted to Islam. The community than moved to the desert regions of Bikaner State, and spread over time to the Cholistan desert region. While the Bohar and Johiya Rath both claim descent from the Bhatti Rajputs, and have different traditions as to their conversion to Islam. As a community, they have a strong self-identification as being a Rajput community. They are culturally close to tribesmen of the Cholistan region of Punjab, Pakistan, who are also largely Rath.\n\nHistorically, the Rath were a community of pastoral nomads, breeding mainly cows and sheep, as well as cultivating dry crops, and migrating three to nine months of the year. Till about the 1950s, no recognized rights to the land existed. This was in marked contrast to the related Pachhada community, who were found in Hissar and Mahendargarh districts of Haryana, who was forced to settle down by the British authorities in the late 19th Century. With the construction of the Indira Gandhi Canal, land was divided up, and a large number granted to settlers. This led to a drastic reduction in the grazing area, and process that has led to the abandoning of the nomadic lifestyle. The community are now only partially nomadic, with some members taking the cattle and sheep to their grazing areas, while the majority remaining in the village.\n\nThe Rath speak Seraiki among themselves, and Marwari with others. They are also closely related to the Pachhadas, a community once found in Hissar and Mahendragarh districts of Haryana, but now found in Punjab in Pakistan.\n\nThe Parhar Rath community is further divided into a number of clans, known as gotras. Their main clans include the Parihar, Kotowar, Daiya, Seikh, Lad and Koria. The various gotras observe a set pattern with regards to marriage. For example, the Parihar and Kotowar receive girls from the Koria, while the Daiya and Parihar give girls to the Kotowar and Seikh. Other Rathi communities include the Bohar and Johiya tribal groupings, found mainly in the Bikaner, Ganganagar and the neighbouring region of Cholistan of Pakistan. Marriages tend to take place within the three sub-divisions, but marriages are forbidden within the gotra.\n\nThe Rath are found mainly in Barmer, Bikaner, Ganganagar and Jaisalmer districts. They are still essentially a community of pastoralists. Agriculture is the other main pursuit of this community. For six months of the year, from May to October, they cultivate their fields, and for the other six months, they herd their cattle. Their villages are found in the Thar Desert region, and most of their villages are without electricity.\nLike other North India communities, they have a council of elders which settles intra-community disputes, and punishes the guilty. Each lineage has an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat. This acts as an instrument of social control, by punishes those who breach community norms, such as marriage out with the community, or marriage within the gotra. The Rath are Sunni Muslims, but incorporate many folk beliefs.\n\n"}

Her father was a direct descendant of Hasidic Masters, going back to the Magid Dov Ber of Mezeritch (1704–1772), the disciple and successor of the Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760). She had two sisters, Antoinette Feuerwerker (1912-2003) and Hendel (Hedwig) Naftalis (1913-?), and a brother Salomon Gluck (born 1914-died during WWII).\n\nHer parents had moved from Tarnów in Galicia, Poland, to Belgium, then to Switzerland, during World War I. The family moved further to Germany, and finally to France in 1921, settling in Strasbourg. There she went to the famous Lycée des Pontonniers, now called Lycée International des Pontonniers. After moving to Paris, with her family, she studied in 1941 and 1942 to become a nurse, in the modern Ecole de puériculture, 26, boulevard Brune, in Paris 14. She worked before World War II at the COJASOR, a Jewish social service organization, together with Lucie Dreyfus (née Hadamard; 1869–1945), the widow of Alfred Dreyfus.\n\nDuring World War II, she joined her sister, Antoinette Feuerwerker, and her husband, Rabbi David Feuerwerker, in Brive-la-Gaillarde. They worked together with Edmond Michelet, the future Senior Minister of Charles de Gaulle, in the major Movement of the French Resistance, Combat. In Michelet's Memoirs, she is mentioned as one of the active agents for Combat. Her name in the Résistance was Marie Rose Girardin.\n\nShe was arrested in the Synagogue of Brive in March 1944, taken to Drancy internment camp, and from there, on convoy 72, on 29 April 1944, to Auschwitz concentration camp. Her sister Antoinette Feuerwerker succeeded in getting her a nurse's uniform when she was at Drancy internment camp. She wore that uniform on her arrival in Auschwitz. Dr Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor, singled her out for survival. Later, he operated on her, without anesthesia. She survived three selections in Auschwitz concentration camp (Auschwitz-Birkenau), and later was transferred to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, before being liberated by the Russian Army in February 1945. The number tattooed on her arm at Auschwitz was 80598. Underneath there is a triangle, meaning she is a Jew.\n\nConvoy 72 took her to Auschwitz on 29 April 1944. Serge Klarsfeld described the convoy:\n\n\"This convoy takes 1004 Jews, and includes 398 men and 606 women. Among them were 174 children below 18. The poet Itzak Katznelson (Itzhak Katzenelson) is among the deportees of this convoy, as well as many Poles, arrested as he was in Vittel, after having been transferred from Poland. There are families: the children Dodelzak, Ita 12, Georges 3 and Arkadius 3 months; the Rottenberg, Naphtalie 7, Nathan 5, Esther 4, Frantz 2...\"\n\" On arrival at Auschwitz, 48 men were selectioned with the numbers 186596 to 186643 and 52 women, whose numbers are around 80600. In 1945, there were 37 survivors, including 25 women.\"\n\nHer brother, Dr. Salomon Gluck was deported on the next convoy, convoy 73, leaving Drancy internment camp on 15 May 1944.\n\nAt Birkenau, she was assigned to a group of 50 women who were forced by a kapo to knit undershirts for German newborns. She worked hard, and was well thought-of, but when they were asked to knit socks for men, she resisted by making big knots inside the garments so as to render them unusable. In her block in Auschwitz was another detainee that she saw daily, the future politician Simone Veil.\n\nThe Gross-Rosen concentration camp was situated near Breslau (called today Wrocław in Poland) railway station. There Warfman was made to work in a munitions factory from six in the evening to six in the morning, with one half-hour break, and regular beatings.\n\nAfter the war, she returned to Paris. She became the first and only employee of the new Israeli Airlines, El Al, when it opened in Paris, with a director, Mr. Massis. She welcomed and guided many Israeli leaders during their stays in Paris, including Golda Meir, and David Ben-Gurion. She was involved in the adventure of the Exodus (ship) (Exodus1947). Together with Abbé Alexandre Glasberg, recognized posthumously as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem, Jerusalem, Israel, for saving Jews during the war, she made the false identity cards for the passengers of the Exodus.\n\nShe was awarded the title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French Government for her work in the Résistance, on 10 February 1959. She also was awarded la Médaille Militaire 1939–1945, la Croix de guerre 1939–1945, and la Croix du combattant volontaire de la Résistance. On 10 April 2009, the French Government made her an Officer of the Legion of Honor.\n\nShe was married to Nachman Warfman a Doctor in Law (University of Grenoble) and a certified public accountant (CPA). She had three children: Bernard, Salomon David, and Anne. She moved to Manchester, England, to be close to her children, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren.

{"id": "413447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413447", "title": "Russian mafia", "text": "Russian mafia\n\nRussian organized crime or Russian mafia (, ), sometimes referred to as Bratva (: \"brotherhood\"), is a collective of various organized crime elements originating in the former Soviet Union. The acronym OPG is Organized Criminal (Prestupnaya in Russian) Group, used to refer to any of the Russian mafia groups, sometimes modified with a specific name, e.g. Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes the acronym is translated and OCG is used.\n\nOrganized crime in Russia began in the imperial period of the Tsars, but it was not until the Soviet era that \"vory v zakone\" (\"thieves-in-law\") emerged as leaders of prison groups in \"lagerya\" (plural form for Russian \"lager\" – an informal nickname for a prison labor camp in the Soviet Union), and their honor code became more defined. With the end of World War II, the death of Joseph Stalin, and the fall of the Soviet Union, more gangs emerged in a flourishing black market, exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy. Louis Freeh, former director of the FBI, said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to U.S. national security in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups, with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders. In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of Interpol, stated \"Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad\", while in August 2010, Alain Bauer, a French criminologist, said that it \"is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"\n\nThe Russian mafia can be traced back to Russia's imperial period, which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were peasants, in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned Robin Hood-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming folk heroes. In time, the \"Vorovskoy Mir\" (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the Bolshevik Revolution came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. Vladimir Lenin attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into Joseph Stalin's reign.\n\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to \"gulags\" (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become \"vorami v zakone\" (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.\n\nAfter Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who refused to fight in the war referred to the traitors as \"suka\" (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the \"suki\" separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of Bitch Wars from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from \"gulags\". Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the Brezhnev era, and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. Then, in the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing Soviet Jews, with most settling in a southern Brooklyn area known as Brighton Beach (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little Odessa\"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US. The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the \"Potato Bag Gang,\" a group of con artists disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold rubles for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was Evsei Agron.\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization, and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld, his bodyguard, moved on to employ under Marat Balagula, who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of Merrill Lynch customers, and was found in Frankfurt, West Germany in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nBalagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 credit card fraud in 1992. Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the \"Polish Al Capone\", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business. In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.\n\nWhen the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-KGB agents and veterans of the Afghan war offering their skills to the crime bosses. Gangster summit meetings had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top \"vory v zakone\" could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist state. It was agreed that Vyacheslav \"Yaponchik\" Ivankov would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America. Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, narcotics, money laundering, and prostitution and made ties with the American Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, eventually extending to Miami, Los Angeles, and Boston. Those who went against him were usually killed.\n\nPrior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next \"vory v zakone\". Monya Elson, leader of Monya's \"Brigada\" (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides. Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life. Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998) and in Italy in 1995, respectively.\n\nIvankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence. Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the \"Solntsevskaya Bratva\"), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in Vienna rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the \"Orekhovskaya\" gang, Segei \"Sylvester\" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.\n\nBack in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss Semion Mogilevich held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in Anděl, a neighborhood of Prague. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the \"Solntsevskaya Bratva\". However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the \"Solntsevskaya\" were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and \"Solntsevskaya\" leader Sergei Mikhailov had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to Hungary.\n\nOne person who was not there was Mogilevich himself. He claimed that \"[b]y the time I arrived at U Holubu, everything was already in full swing, so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning.\" Mikhailov would later be arrested in Switzerland in October 1996 on numerous charges, including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group, but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much.\n\nThe global extent of Russian organized crime wasn't realized until Ludwig \"Tarzan\" Fainberg was arrested in January 1997, primarily because of arms dealing. In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to Miami and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an ambassador among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt Russian military. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a submarine for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover DEA agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed for his testimony against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.\n\nAs the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan. New Mafia bosses sprang up, while imprisoned ones were released. Among the released were Johanithan Pochival Slokavich, Marat Balagula and Vyacheslav Ivankov, all three in 2004. The latter was extradited to Russia, but was jailed once more for his alleged murders of two Turks in a Moscow restaurant in 1992; he was cleared of all charges and released in 2005. Four years later, he was assassinated by a shot in the stomach from a sniper. Meanwhile, Monya Elson and Leonid Roytman were arrested in March 2006 for an unsuccessful murder plot against two Kiev-based businessmen.\n\nIn 2009, FBI agents in Moscow targeted two suspected Mafia leaders and two other corrupt businessmen. One of the leaders is Yevgeny Dvoskin, a criminal who had been in prison with Ivankov in 1995 and was deported in 2001 for breaking immigration regulations; the other is Konstantin \"Gizya\" Ginzburg, who was reportedly the current \"big boss\" of Russian organized crime in America before his reported assassination in 2009 , it being suspected that Ivankov handed over control to him. Some sources state that Sheaib was present in Eastern Europe right before the death of Vyacheslav Ivankov as well as Aslan Usoyan.\n\nIn the same year, Semion Mogilevich was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for his involvement in a complex multimillion-dollar scheme that defrauded investors in the stock of his company YBM Magnex International, swindling them out of $150 million. He was indicted in 2003 and arrested in 2008 in Russia on tax fraud charges, but because the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he was released on bail. Monya Elson said, in 1998, that Mogilevich is the most powerful mobster in the world.\n\nAround the world, Russian mafia groups have popped up as dominating particular areas: Alec Simchuk and his group robbed unsuspecting tourists and businessmen in South Florida, leading Rick Brodsky of the FBI to say that \"Eurasian organised crime is our no. 1 priority\"; Russian organized crime has a rather large stronghold in the city of Atlanta where members are distinguished by their tattoos. Russian organized crime was reported to have a stronger grip in the French Riviera region and Spain in 2010; and Russia was branded as a virtual \"mafia state\" according to the WikiLeaks cables.\n\nIn 2009, Russian mafia groups had been said to reach over 50 countries and, in 2010, had up to 300,000 members. According to recordings released in 2015, Alexander Litvinenko, shortly before he was assassinated, claimed that Semion Mogilevich has had a \"good relationship\" with Vladimir Putin since the 1990s.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, 33 Russian mafia affiliates and members were arrested and charged by the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and NYPD for extortion, racketeering, illegal gambling, firearm offenses, narcotics trafficking, wire fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft, fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices; based in Atlantic City and Philadelphia, murder-for-hire conspiracy and cigarette trafficking. They were also accused of operating secret and underground gambling dens based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and using violence to those who owed gambling debts, establishing nightclubs in order to sell drugs, plotting to force women associates to rob male strangers by seducing and drugging them with chloroform, and trafficking over 10,000 pounds of stolen chocolate confectionery; the chocolate was stolen from shipment containers. It is believed that 27 of the arrested are connected to the Russian mafia \"Shulaya clan\" which are largely based in New York. According to the prosecution, the \"Shulaya\" also has operations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Nevada. According to law enforcement and the prosecution, this is one of the first federal arrests against a Russian mafia boss and his underboss or co-leader.\n\nOn 26 September 2017, as part of a 4-year investigation, 100 Spanish Civil Guard officers carried out 18 searches in different areas of Malaga, Spain related to Russian mafia large scale money laundering. The raids resulted in the arrests of 11 members and associates of the \"Solntsevskaya\" and \"Izmailovskaya\" clans. Money, firearms and 23 high-end vehicles were also seized. The owner of Marbella FC, Alexander Grinberg, and manager of AFK Sistema, a local Malaga Spanish football club, were among those arrested.\n\nOn 19 February 2018, 18 defendants were accused of laundering over $62 million through real estate, including with the help of Vladislav Reznik, former chairman of Rosgosstrakh; one of Russia's largest insurance companies. The accused stood trial in Spain. The Tambov and Malyshev Russian mafia organisations were involved.\n\nNote that these positions are not always official titles, but rather are understood names for roles that an individual performs.\n\nIn the Russian Mafia, \"Vor\" (plural: Vory) (literally, \"Thief\") is an honorary title denoting a made man. The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title. When you become a member of the Vor-world you have to accept the code of the Vor v Zakone (\"Thief in law\").\n\nAlthough Russian criminal groups vary in their structure, there have been attempts to devise a model of how they work. One such model (possibly outdated by now, as it is based on the old style of Soviet criminal enterprises) works out like this:\n\n\nGroups based in and around the City of Moscow:\n\n\nGroups based in other parts of Russia and the former Soviet Union:\nGroups based in and around The United States of America:\nGroups based in other areas:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3607125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3607125", "title": "Salagama", "text": "Salagama\n\nSalagama (also known as \"Saliya\") is a Sinhalese caste found mostly in the southern coastal areas of Sri Lanka. The community was traditionally associated with the cultivation and management of cinnamon and were formerly also involved as weavers.\n\nThe Salagamas were also known as \"Saliya,\" also spelled \"Chaliya\". The name is presumably derived from Chale of Kerala.\n\nThe Salagamas trace their roots back to the Coromandel Coast and Malabar Coast of South India, and settled in the southern coastal areas of Sri Lanka. Their ancestors were a weaving community who were known as \"Saliya\". Some Salagamas also have the \"vasagama\" or surname \"Nambudirige\" meaning \"of the Nambudiri\", indicating a connection to the Brahmin Nambudiri's of Kerala. Like the other coastel castes such as the Karavas and Duravas, the Salagamas migrated to Sri Lanka between 13th to 18th century.\n\nUnder Portuguese rule, many Karavas and Salagamas converted to Catholicism, which opened way to education and administrative careers. \n\nThe Portuguese continued the tradition of using Salagamas as cinnamon planters, who had to provide cinnamon as a tax. Queyroz mentions 'Chaleaz' as among the 'high castes' and that they prepared Cinnamon for the 'great tax'. \n\nWhen the Dutch East India Company (VOC) took over the coastal areas, it re-organised cinnamon cultivation on modern capitalist lines, with plantations located within the boundaries of VOC rule, mainly in the Galle district. The Salagamas were converted from a feudal caste into a modern proletariat.The Dutch demand for cinnamon was more intense than that of the Portuguese, and by the era of British control mortality rates among Salagamas had increased sharply. It became common practice for cinnamon peelers' children to be registered under the names of other castes in order to spare them a life of ever-growing misery.\n\nThe census of 1824 identified the Salagamas as about 7.5% of the coastal Sinhalese population. However, they were concentrated in the Galle district, where about half of them lived and where they made up almost 20% of the population.\n\nTraditionally, the Salagama were divided into four sub-castes:\n\nHowever, in modern times there is a simple twofold division between the \"Hewapanne\" and the \"Kurundukara\". The former are of higher status, including landowners in their ranks, the \"Kurundukara's\" enjoyed a high status in Sinhala society, before being punished by the King of Kotte in 1406 and downgraded to a lower status, who also imposed cinnamon as a tax, at one stage the tax exceeded their manpower, and became virtually unbearable, and it took a heavy toll in their mortality rate, some of them were subsequently forced to change their names to other castes to escape it.\n\nToday, the Salagama predominance in cinnamon cultivation has declined, the higher status gained by the caste leading to its members abandoning their traditional occupation. Many Salagamas in the Hikkaduwa area became coral miners until the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 swept away their villages. The coral-lime kilns gave employment to many more.\n\nThe Railway made access to employment in Colombo and other urban centres very much easier, and the caste became a very important part of the working class. Its higher echelons became notable in the engineering profession, mainly due to the influence of Sir Cyril de Zoysa, who owned the South Western Omnibus Company (see Ceylon Transport Board) and the Associated Motorways Group, and other businessmen in the motor trade.\n\nBy the mid 18th century, \"upasampada\" (higher ordination, as distinct from samanera or novice ordination) had become extinct in Sri Lanka. The Buddhist order had become extinct three times during the preceding five hundred years and was re-established in the reigns of Vimala Dharma Suriya I (1591–1604) and Vimala Dharma Suriya II (1687–1707) as well. These re-establishments were short lived. On the initiative of Ven. Weliwita Saranankara (1698–1778) the Thai monk Upali Thera visited Kandy during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (1747–1782) and once again reestablished the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka in 1753. It was called the Siyam Nikaya after the \"Kingdom of Siam\".\n\nIt is said that in 1764, merely a decade after the re-establishment of the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka by reverend Upali, a group within the newly created Siyam Nikaya conspired and succeeded in restricting the Nikaya's higher ordination only to the Radala and Govigama caste, Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) being the last nongovigama monk receive upasampada. This was a period when Buddhist Vinaya rules had been virtually abandoned and some members of the Buddhist Sangha in the Kandyan Kingdom privately held land, had wives and children, resided in the private homes and were called Ganinnanses. It was a period when the traditional nobility of the Kandyan Kingdom was decimated by continuous wars with the Dutch rulers of the Maritime Provinces. In the maritime provinces too a new order was replacing the old. Mandarampura Puvata, a text from the Kandyan perid, narrates the above radical changes to the monastic order and shows that it was not a unanimous decision by the body of the sangha. It says that thirty two ‘senior’ members of the Sangha who opposed this change were banished to Jaffna by the leaders of the reform. However, Queyroz mentions that in the 17th century no-one save \"appuhamies\" (gentlemen) and their relatives could be a monk, which suggests that elitism in the Buddhist order was of greater antiquity.\n\nThe Govigama exclusivity of the Sangha was challenged by other castes who, without the patronage of the King of Kandy or of the British, held their own upasampada ceremony at Totagamuwa Vihara in 1772. Another was held at Tangalle in 1798. Neither of these ceremonies were approved by the Siam Nikaya which claimed that these were not | in accordance with the Vinaya rules.\n\nHoping to rectify this situation, wealthy laymen from the maritime provinces financed an expedition to Burma to found a new monastic lineage. In 1799, Ambagahapitiye Gnanavimala Thera a monk from the Salagama caste, from Balapitiya on the south western coast of Sri Lanka, departed for Burma with a group of novices to seek a new succession of Higher ordination. The first bhikkhu was ordained in Burma in 1800 by the sangharaja of Burma in Amarapura, his party having been welcomed to Burma by King Bodawpaya.\n\nThe initial mission returned to Sri Lanka in 1803. Soon after their return to the island they established a \"udakhupkhepa sima\" (a flotilla of boats moved together to form a platform on the water) on the Maduganga river, Balapitiya and, under the most senior Burmese monk who accompanied them, held an upasampada ceremony on Vesak Full Moon Day. The new fraternity came to be known as the \"Amarapura Nikaya\" and was soon granted recognition by the colonial British government.\n\nThe Amarapura Nikaya was of pivotal importance in the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the 19th century. The Salagamas, who became overwhelmingly Buddhist, were in the vanguard of this movement.\n\nThe traditional Salagama areas around Balapitiya, Kosgoda, Ratgama, Hikkaduwa and Boossa were centres of the pan-Sinhalese populist movement of Anagarika Dharmapala(who was not from the Salagama community). The key issues around which this movement emerged were anti-casteism and anti-colonialism.\n\nThe same areas were in the vanguard of the independence struggle and became hotbeds of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and of the Communist Party. These areas were at the forefront of the Hartal of 1953.\n\n\n\n"}

It was started in 1871 as an exclusive gentlemen's club.\n\nAlthough the province of Sind is now spelled Sindh, the Sind Club still uses the old spelling given by its founders.\n\nIt was an exclusive club for the British colonists, and natives were not allowed inside, almost till the independence of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nA competition was held to select the best design for the club. Richard Burton had warned against the use of Gothic architecture for the club building. Having seen Frere Hall he had said: \"the Veneto-Gothic, so fit for Venice, so unfit for Karachi. It is to be hoped that the new club will not adopt Veneto-Gothic.\" Since limited funds were available for the new club building, a design prepared by a committee member, Le Mesurier, was chosen. When completed, Le Mesurier's building was considered a \"princely residence\". The first of the Sind Club buildings, which now houses the ladies bar and the dining room, was designed in a southern Italian style. The building suits comfortably in its spacious grounds, its facade employing simple arcading which is composed of semi-circular openings on the ground and first floors, and terminates in pitched roofs.\n\nThe other blocks, which were constructed later, generally follow the Indo-Italianate style of the original structure. The club buildings are provided with a generous back set from the road, creating a feeling of exclusiveness and inaccessibility, even though the architectural style is informal and does not rely on pediments and porticoes for effect.\n\nThe Sind Club was exclusively a men's club. Women were only allowed in to attend a ladies' dinner held every two months and the celebrated Sind Club Ball organized once a year. Until 1950 when the Prime Minister of Pakistan lived across the road, the Sind Club was still used almost exclusively by Europeans.\n\nThe sign \"Women and dogs not allowed\" was removed only a day after Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah took his oath as Governor-General of Pakistan on August 14, 1947.\n\nThe first Pakistani members joined the club in 1952. These included Syed Wajid Ali, Colonel Iskander Mirza and Cowasjee Rustom Fakirjee. It took almost two decades before a Pakistani, Masud Karim, became president of the club in 1965. Since then, however, many of Pakistan's social elite have become members.\n\nAlthough women are still not allowed to become members in their own right, they can enter and use the club facilities as wives, daughters and guests of members. In addition, a member's widow can continue using the club after the death of her spouse.\n\nFacilities at the Sind Club include a swimming pool; tennis and squash courts; a walking track; a billiards room; an outdoor barbecue; a full bakery; a sauna; guest rooms and a newly built fitness centre.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31659679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31659679", "title": "Women in Armenia", "text": "Women in Armenia\n\nWomen in Armenia have been officially guaranteed gender equality since the establishment of the Republic of Armenia in 1991. This has enabled women to actively participate in all spheres of Armenian life. Armenian women have attained prominence in entertainment, politics and other fields.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Grant Thornton International business survey, 29% of top-level managerial positions in Armenia were occupied by women in 2010. However, this figure declined to 23% in 2011. Based on a report by the United Nations, there were 24 female mayors and community leaders in Armenia in 2011; a further 50 women held lower-level administrative positions.\n\nAlthough some nationalist feminists from the early 20th century to the present have concocted a view of ancient Armenian society and law as being woman-friendly, there is virtually no evidence for this assertion. The law code of Mkhitar Gos, dating to the 12th century, sought to raise women's status from its former level, however the code explicitly enshrined male domination and forbade divorce, even in the case of domestic violence or marital rape. Its most progressive elements seem to have never been applied in society at large, and in the 18th and 19th centuries both outsider and insider reports overwhelmingly commented on the low status of women in traditional Armenian society. Married women lived as virtual slaves of their husbands' families, although the situation improved gradually with age. During the first year of marriage, they were not permitted to speak to anyone except their husband, and were forbidden from leaving the house. In some villages, these restrictions continued even after the birth of the first child, and may have lasted more than ten years. Female suicide was more common than male suicide, in striking contrast to the situation in the west.\n\nIn spite of the inferior position of women in Armenian society, the Armenian Apostolic Church allowed women greater opportunities for assuming clerical roles than most other Christian traditions. Unlike the Eastern Orthodox, however, they were strongly opposed to divorce, and as a result the divorce rate in traditional Armenia has always been among the lowest in the Christian world.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, between 10% and 60% of Armenian women suffered domestic abuse and violence in 2002; the uncertainty of the data was due to the underreporting of domestic violence in Armenia. Underreporting is said to occur because of the treatment of domestic violence as a private family matter. There are no well-established laws against domestic aggression and gender-based prejudice in Armenia. Furthermore, divorcing a husband – even an abusive one – causes \"social disgrace\", with the families of women who file for divorce or report domestic violence being considered to be shamed. Other contributing factors include Armenian women's lack of, or lower level of, education regarding their rights and how to protect themselves from abuse.\n\nIn May 2007, through the legislative decree known as \"the gender quota law\", more Armenian women were encouraged to get involved in politics. That year, only seven women occupied parliamentary positions. Among these female politicians was Hranush Hakobyan, the longest-serving woman in the National Assembly of Armenia. The relative lack of women in Armenia's government has led to Armenian women being considered \"among the most underrepresented\" and \"among the lowest in the world\" by foreign observers. In addition, Armenian women's place in politics is often located in the private sphere. Often their entry in the public sphere is only valued when they reflect the image of the feminine ideal based on social expectations, which continue to put a barrier on the political, social, and economic accessibility for women. In 2015, Arpine Hovhannisyan became the first Armenian Woman to hold the position of Justice Minister in Armenia, a role she held until 2017. Hovhannisyan is also a politician and lawyer.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, during Women’s Month and as part of the \"For You, Women\" charitable program, the Surb Astvatcamayr Medical Center in the Armenian capital of Yerevan offered free gynecological and surgical services to the women of Armenia for a full month. Women from across the country arrived seeking treatment.\n\nSex selective abortion is reported as being a problem in the country, due to patriarchal social norms which consider having a son preferable to having a daughter. Nevertheless, due to strong emigration under the form of \"brain drain\", where young Armenian men go abroad in search of work, there are more young women than men in the country, especially among those in their 20s: women make up 55.8% of the population aged 15–29.\n\nThe oldest literary expression by Armenian women available to us today in writing is the poetry of two 8th-century CE women, Khosrovidukht of Goghtn and Sahakdukht of Syunik. Following the Armenian literary renaissance of the 19th century, and the spread of educational opportunities for women, a number of other writers emerged, among them the 19th-century feminist writer Srpouhi Dussap, considered the first female Armenian novelist. She, like her contemporary, Zabel Sibil Asadour, is generally associated with Constantinople and the Western Armenian literary tradition. Zabel Yesayan, also born in Constantinople, bridged the gap with Eastern Armenian literature by settling in Soviet Armenia in 1933. The literary renaissance and its accompanying voice of protest also had its representatives in the East with poet Shushanik Kurghinian(1876–1927) of Aleksandrapol (today, Gyumri). Sylvia Kaputikyan and Maro Markarian are probably the best-known women poets from the Republic of Armenia of the 20th century, and continued the tradition of political speech through poetry.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48617162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48617162", "title": "Youth in Guatemala", "text": "Youth in Guatemala\n\nYouth in Guatemala are the largest segment of the nation's population. Youth includes individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 Over half of the population is under 19 years old in 2011, the highest proportion of young people of any country in Latin America. The health, education, and work opportunities for young people differ by ethnicity (\"ladino\" or indigenous) and social class.\n\nMale literacy rate is 89.3% and the female literacy rate is 85.6%. Secondary education participation is around 17%. 30.3% of youth are married by the age of 18.\n\nPoverty and inequality affect a youth's access to healthcare. Females experience less access to health care and education than males. The lack of adequate nutrition and health care in Guatemala has adverse effects on a youth's overall health. One example being stunted growth of half of the Guatemalan youth. The Millennium Development Goals works to these inequalities and barriers.\n\nVulnerable youths who are at-risk for joining a gang are males between the ages of living in marginalized urban areas and have limited access to education. A program called Open Schools combats forces that push youth into dangerous situations and works to overcome barriers that Guatemalan youth face. \n\nEducation in Guatemala has less than full participation. Primary schools do not achieve 100% enrollment and from there, enrollment drops until it reaches about 17% at the high school level. Females are less represented, with 44.3% net enrollment ratio, compared to males at 48%. This contributes to a higher participation in the informal market.\n\nGuatemala's public university is USAC, Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. \"From every 100 graduate students enrolled in San Carlos of Guatemala University only 13 successfully completed their programs\". Youth who successfully complete secondary education typically obtain a degree in the social sciences, with 1334 social science master's degrees granted of the 2093 total degrees. The medical field, as well as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields, should be a top priority but are not a focus of higher education. Social connections and ties, as well as nepotism, are viewed as more important than Education.\n\nTeachers in Guatemala often encounter youth who were left behind by their parents who migrated elsewhere. They often dissuaded their students from migrating due to loss of human capital experienced during migration.\n\nOpen Schools, a program launched in 2008, helps prevent violence and protect youth by providing them opportunity to constructively use their free time. Open Schools is not a formal educational environment but it aims to help youth who are disadvantaged through culture, art, sports, and technology. Open Schools program is available to students on the weekends where youth can socialize and participate in constructive activities. Child Aid is another program that helps a youth's educational experience by increasing literacy.\n\n140,000 Guatemalan youth enter the labor market each year. About 25,000 of those youth gain access to formal employment. Formal employment is often classified as training for the job and social security. It is estimated that jobs in the informal market have reached about 5.1 million. Youth who obtain a degree are not properly utilized in the formal job market, as they are outcompeted by their foreign counterparts. Work after graduation is limited because it is assumed that youth who hold degrees would not be willing to work low paying jobs.\n\nWithin the public sector, youth are discouraged from participation in the workforce because of poor salaries and disincentives. Youth often enter into the informal job market at a young age, sometimes dropping out of school to support themselves or their families. Informal jobs provide youth with income but are untaxed and unmonitored by the state, examples being farmers or domestic workers. These jobs do not provide youth or other individuals with government protections, like insurance. PILAR, a program which stands for Promoting Informal Labor Rights, works to provide more protection for those in the informal sector.\n\nOpen Schools provides leadership training and job training to both youth and adults to help ensure steady income and employment.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals, or MDG's, targets causes of poverty such as gender inequality, education, and environmental stability. \"Education and training in business administration and large-scale marketing operations are essential for the youth to join the economic life of the country\". MDG's purpose is to prevent youth from entering into poverty by providing educational and economic stability.\n\nEmelin, a 13-year-old female, spoke at the United Nations in March 2015 and emphasized the need for health care in her community. A majority of Guatemalans pay for their health costs out-of-pocket, creating unequal access to services. She said, \"The biggest problems we face as adolescents in my community are early pregnancy, [child]birth, sexual violation and lack of education and health care\". 20% of female adolescents and 24% of male adolescents have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV. 14.3% of females living in rural areas have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV and 31.5% of females living in urban areas have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV. In Guatemala, there is little contraception awareness and use among Youth. Guatemala has the highest fertility rate in Latin America even with half of its population under the age of 19.\n\nA mission called Continuing Promise works to provide health care and community assistance to Latin American youth. \n\nCrime in Guatemala is one issue facing youth. Guatemala has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and lies within one of the most dangerous regions of the hemisphere - Central America. Violence most often emerges in the presence of gangs and drug trafficking, promoting crimes such as theft and kidnapping. \"Gang youth are widely perceived to be the single most important contributors to violence and insecurity in Central American cities\". Guatemalan youth struggle with transitions out of a gang to a more stable environment. The Evangelical-Pentecostal religion provides hope to Guatemalan youth, attempting to exit gangs, through conversion.\n\nIn Guatemala, the Evangelical-Protestant Church receives funding from United States Agency for International Development to help at-risk youth. The funding is used to help correct structural factors that push delinquent youth into gang participation. The ties within the Church provide youth with social capital and connections that may aid in seeking employment.\n\nA great risk of death exists for youth attempting to exit Guatemalan gangs. Religious organizations believe that the root causes of gang participation are \"poverty, weak schools, and unemployment\".\n\nYouth participation in violence has become normalized. While reliable data regarding crime is sparse, there are widespread fears of crime facing Guatemalan youth. \"Maras [gangs] are generally associated with low-income urban areas, due to high levels of inequality and the lack of social, economic and cultural alternatives available in this context\", making Guatemala City one of the most dangerous areas in Guatemala. Gangs dominate public space, often limiting areas where others can interact. An estimated 53-330 gangs reside in Guatemala City.\n\nGangs can provide youth with a sense of identity. Youths gain a large amount of social capital in their participation in gangs, making gangs attractive and luring for youth who lack resources. Youth male gang members who are often the perpetrators of violence also fear for their own safety within the gang. Young men in gangs are threatened by members of their affiliated gang and sometimes victims of violence within the gang.\n\nOpen Schools works to help at risk youth by providing alternatives to participation in gangs.\n\nA youth's parents may leave home and migrate to coastal areas or other countries where education and health services are more comprehensive. Parents also migrate to the United States, Mexico, and Canada to support their family and search of economic opportunity. Political corruption and violence are factors that cause a parent to leave their child or children with other caretakers. Youth left behind feel guilt for their parents' sacrifice and often leave school to find work. \"9% of children living in migrant households receiving remittances dropped out of school\". Adverse effects on youth of parents migrating include: insecurity, drug use, sexual promiscuity, anxiety, and loneliness.\n\nYouth whose parents migrated to the United States often defend them, saying, \"they are not criminals, because they are going to search for a better life for their family members\", normalizing their experience. Guatemalan youth see the allure of moving to various other areas as economic incentives but the threats of violence and deportation as well as loss of social capital dissuade many youth from migrating.\n"}
