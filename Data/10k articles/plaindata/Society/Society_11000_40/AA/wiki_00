{"id": "27202445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27202445", "title": "Cannabis use disorder", "text": "Cannabis use disorder\n\nCannabis use disorder (CUD), also known as cannabis addiction or marijuana addiction, is defined in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and ICD-10 published by World Health Organization as the continued use of cannabis despite clinically significant impairment, ranging from mild to severe.\n\nMarijuana use and abuse has symptoms that affect behavior, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial aspects of a person's life. Symptoms include agitation, bloodshot eyes, challenges in problem solving, and paranoia.\n\nCannabis use is associated with comorbid mental health problems, such as mood and anxiety disorders, and discontinuing cannabis use is difficult for some users. Psychiatric comorbidities are often present in dependent cannabis users including a range of personality disorders.\n\nThe use of cannabis at a young age such as the teenage years, can have serious impacts on depression and anxiety in youth and later in life. There is evidence that cannabis use during adolescence, at a time when the brain is still developing, may have deleterious effects on neural development and later cognitive functioning. The brain is not completely developed until a person reaches the age range of 22-27. Excessive use of marijuana can cause harm to this development.. Based on an annual survey data 7 percent of high school seniors that smoke daily function at a lower rate in school than students that do not. The sedating and anxiolytic properties of THC in some users might make the use of cannabis an attempt to self-medicate personality or psychiatric disorders.\n\nProlonged marijuana use produces both pharmacokinetic changes (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) and pharmacodynamic changes (how the drug interacts with target cells) to the body. These changes require the user to consume higher doses of the drug to achieve a common desirable effect (known as a higher tolerance), reinforcing the body's metabolic systems for eliminating the drug more efficiently and further downregulating cannabinoid receptors in the brain. These effects compound themselves in that the chronic user must consume more frequently to overcome the accelerated clearance, and higher doses to overcome the blunted response to receptor activation.\n\nCannabis users have shown decreased reactivity to dopamine, suggesting a possible link to a dampening of the reward system of the brain and an increase in negative emotionality and addiction severity.\n\nCannabis users can develop tolerance to the effects of THC. Tolerance to the behavioral and psychological effects of THC has been demonstrated in adolescent humans and animals. The mechanisms that create this tolerance to THC are thought to involve changes in cannabinoid receptor function.\n\nAccording to the National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre in Australia, a sign of cannabis dependence is that an individual spends noticeably more time than the average recreational user recovering from the use of or obtaining cannabis. For some, using cannabis becomes a substantial and disruptive part of an individual's life and he or she may exhibit difficulties in meeting personal obligations or participating in important life activities, preferring to use cannabis instead. People who are cannabis dependent have the inability to stop or decrease using cannabis on their own.\n\nMarijuana addiction is more common among heavy users. Marijuana use can lead to increased tolerance and, in some users, withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop.\n\nCannabis withdrawal symptoms can occur in one half of patients in treatment for cannabis use disorders. These symptoms include dysphoria (anxiety, irritability, depression, restlessness), disturbed sleep, gastrointestinal symptoms, and decreased appetite. Most symptoms begin during the first week of abstinence and resolve after a few weeks. The withdrawal symptoms are usually not severe, even after heavy use.\n\nCannabis addiction is often due to prolonged and increasing use of the drug. Increasing the strength of the cannabis taken and an increasing use of more effective methods of delivery often increase the progression of cannabis dependency. It can also be caused by being prone to becoming addicted to substances, which can either be genetically or environmentally acquired. \n\nCertain factors are considered to heighten the risk of developing cannabis dependence and longitudinal studies over a number of years have enabled researchers to track aspects of social and psychological development concurrently with cannabis use. Increasing evidence is being shown for the elevation of associated problems by the frequency and age at which cannabis is used, with young and frequent users being at most risk.\n\nThe main factors in Australia, for example, related to a heightened risk for developing problems with cannabis use include frequent use at a young age; personal maladjustment; emotional distress; poor parenting; school drop-out; affiliation with drug-using peers; moving away from home at an early age; daily cigarette smoking; and ready access to cannabis. The researchers concluded there is emerging evidence that positive experiences to early cannabis use are a significant predictor of late dependence and that genetic predisposition plays a role in the development of problematic use.\n\nA number of groups have been identified as being at greater risk of developing cannabis dependence and, in Australia, for example, have been found to include adolescent populations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people suffering from mental health conditions.\n\nYoung people are at greater risk of developing cannabis dependency because of the association between early initiation into substance use and subsequent problems such as dependence, and the risks associated with using cannabis at a developmentally vulnerable age.\n\nCannabis use disorder is recognized in the fifth version of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5), which added cannabis withdrawal as a new condition.\n\nSome healthcare facilities have been known to diagnose patients with Cannabis Use Disorder, even when the patient does not exhibit or experience any of the criteria for the disorder, simply on the basis that the patient uses cannabis in any manner. Patients receiving this false diagnosis have, in some cases, been denied insurance benefits and employment as a result of the false diagnosis, leaving the healthcare facilities vulnerable to legal action.\n\nClinicians differentiate between casual users who have difficulty with drug screens, and daily heavy users, to a chronic user who uses multiple times a day. \n\nPsychological intervention includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), contingency management (CM), supportive-expressive psychotherapy (SEP), family and systems interventions, and twelve-step programs.\n\nEvaluations of Marijuana Anonymous programs, modelled on the 12-step lines of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, have shown small beneficial effects for general drug use reduction. In 2006, the Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles implemented a program that helps primary care physicians identify and address marijuana use problems in patients.\n\nResearch that looks at barriers to cannabis treatment frequently cites a lack of interest in treatment, lack of motivation and knowledge of treatment facilities, an overall lack of facilities, costs associated with treatment, difficulty meeting program eligibility criteria and transport difficulties.\n\nIn the US, , cannabis is the most commonly identified illicit substance used by people admitted to treatment facilities. Demand for treatment for cannabis use disorder increased internationally between 1995 and 2002. In the United States, the average adult who seeks treatment has consumed cannabis for over 10 years almost daily and has attempted to quit six or more times.\n\nNo medications have been found effective for cannabis dependence as of 2014, but psychotherapeutic models hold promise.\n\nTreatment options for cannabis dependence are far fewer than for opiate or alcohol dependence. Most treatment falls into the categories of psychological or psychotherapeutic, intervention, pharmacological intervention or treatment through peer support and environmental approaches. Screening and brief intervention sessions can be given in a variety of settings, particularly at doctor's surgeries, which is of importance as most cannabis users seeking help will do so from their general practitioner rather than a drug treatment service agency.\n\nThe most commonly accessed forms of treatment in Australia are 12-step programmes, physicians, rehabilitation programmes, and detox services, with inpatient and outpatient services equally accessed. In the EU approximately 20% of all primary admissions and 29% of all new drug clients in 2005, had primary cannabis problems. And in all countries that reported data between 1999–2005 the number of people seeking treatment for cannabis use increased.\n\nAs of 2012, there is no medication that has been proven effective for treating cannabis use disorder; research is focused on three treatment approaches: agonist substitution, antagonist, and modulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Dronabinol is an agonist that is legally available; in some cases and trials, it reduced symptoms of withdrawal and reduced cannabis use. Entacapone was well-tolerated and decreased cannabis cravings in a trial on a small number of patients. Acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased cannabis use and craving in a trial. Atomoxetine in a small study showed no significant change in cannabis use, and most patients experienced adverse events. Buspirone shows promise as a treatment for dependence; trials show it reducing cravings, irritability and depression. Divalproex in a small study was poorly tolerated and did not show a significant reduction in cannabis use among subjects.\n\nCannabis is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. In the United States, 49% of people have used cannabis. an estimated 9% of those who use cannabis develop dependence. 34.8% of Australians aged 14 years and over have used cannabis one or more times in their life. In the United States, 42% have used cannabis. In the U.S., cannabis is the most commonly identified illicit substance used by people admitted to treatment facilities. Most of these people were referred there by the criminal justice system. 16% of admittees either went on their own, or were referred by family or friends.\n\nThere is a high prevalence of cannabis use in the US. Cannabis dependence develops in 9% users, significantly less than that of heroin, cocaine, alcohol, and prescribed anxiolytics, but slightly higher than that for psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. Of those who use cannabis daily, 10–20% develop dependence.\n\nColumbia University, in collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is undertaking a clinical trial that looks at the effects of combined medication on cannabis dependency, to see if lofexidine in combination with dronabinol is superior to placebo in achieving abstinence, reducing cannabis use and reducing withdrawal in cannabis-dependent patients seeking treatment for their marijuana use. Men and women between the ages of 18–60 who met DSM-IV criteria for current marijuana dependence were enrolled in a 12-week trial that started in January 2010.\n\nGeorgotas & Zeidenberg (1979) conducted an experiment where they gave an average daily dose of 210 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the ingredient in cannabis which is responsible for its psychological effects, to a group of volunteers over a 4-week period. After the test ended, the subjects were found to be \"irritable, uncooperative, resistant and at times hostile,\" and many of the patients experienced insomnia. These effects were likely due to withdrawal from the drug and lasted about 3 weeks after the experiment.\n\nA 2014 Cochrane Collaboration review found insufficient data to evaluate the effectiveness of gabapentin and acetylcysteine in the treatment of cannabis dependence and that it warrants further investigation.\n\n"}

Facilities differ, but most include a television, an electronic console, and wireless internet connection. The capsules are stacked side-by-side, two units high, with steps providing access to the second level rooms, leading to comparisons to corpse drawers in a morgue. The open end of the capsule can be closed, for privacy, with a curtain or a fiberglass door. Luggage is stored in a locker and washrooms are communal. Guests are asked not to smoke or eat in the capsules. Some hotels also provide restaurants (or at least vending machines), pools, and other entertainment facilities. Capsule hotels vary in size, from fifty or so capsules to 700, and they are used primarily by men. Some capsule hotels offer separate sections for male and female guests. Clothes and shoes can sometimes be exchanged for a \"yukata\" and slippers on entry. A towel may also be provided.\n\nThe benefit of these hotels is convenience and low price, usually around ¥2000–4000 (USD –) a night. They provide an alternative for those who (especially on weeknights) may be too drunk to return home safely, or too embarrassed to face their spouses. With continued recession in Japan, as of early 2010, more and more guests – roughly 30% at the Capsule Hotel Shinjuku 510 in Tokyo – were unemployed or underemployed who had become homeless during the crisis and were temporarily renting capsules by the month.

(Some members of the PMRC also went on to start the East Penn Traction Club several years later.) When first started, the space was an 80' x 35' unfinished crawl space directly under the original 1890's chapel. Finishing the space took weeks, with the removal of 4' of dirt before 20 cubic yards of concrete was used for the new floor.\nThe first layout in the space was started in July 1962, with the framing and scenery built before the track was laid, and the first spike driven on August 30, 1962. This layout was 27 by 55 feet in size, and was of a double-track folded dogbone design, built with traditional square tabletop framing, plaster scenery, and relay control. Eventually it grew to have over 4000 linear feet of track, in both standard and 3-foot gauges, with some dual gauge mixed in. It existed through to January 1999, when it was torn down due to growing problems with accessibility and electrical characteristics. Many of the original structures and switches have been saved, for eventual inclusion on the new layout. Most notable of these is a 1940s train station model which had previously been salvaged from the layout at the PMRC location on Chestnut Street.\n\n2012 was officially recognized as the club's 50th anniversary, by proclamation of the Merchantville Town Council, at their October public session.\n\nThe new layout was started in 2001, is of a double-track looped-8 design; but has been built around the walls, with several reversing loops, curved laminate benchwork, more than 2000 linear feet of track, and a scale model of Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. Scenery has been built with a mix of hydrocal and extruded styrofoam board, and North Coast Engineering (NCE) Digital Command Control has been installed to allow running of multiple trains without the need for complex relay systems. The layout also features working signals that display proper occupancy, as well as scale-sized lighting fixtures for night scenes. Additionally, a new On30 narrow gauge branchline is being constructed at one end of the layout, with plans to expand it as time and resources allow. Rolling stock is owned by the individual members, with the club jointly owning the layout and control system. This rolling stock represents all periods of history, and is a mixture of brass, bronze, tin, white metal, plastic, resin, wood, paper, cardboard, and die-cast models; most of which has been extensively kitbashed/modified, features custom paint and water-slide decals; and has been weathered to better replicate real-world conditions.\n\nAlthough the original layout did have a short section of catenary, most of it was destroyed when the layout was torn down. However, the new layout is being constructed with a full PRR-Style compound catenary system over the entire layout. This catenary system is being integrated into the power distribution, so that the electric locomotives and MU cars will receive power via their operating pantographs.\n\nThe club is governed by president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary. All officers serve, on a voluntary basis, as the organization's Board of Directors.\n\nMeetings are held each Thursday evening. Business meetings are typically held on the second Thursday of the month.\n\nEvery year, the club traditionally has several \"Open House\" weekends near the end of the year, in conjunction with the Merchantville annual Christmas parade and Tree Lighting ceremony. The first such Open House weekends were held Friday and Saturday, November 9–10 and 16-17, 1962. Admission is free (donations requested).\n\nThe Club hosts two O-scale-only \"Swap Meets\" a year, usually on a single first Saturday in both March and September. Admission to the Dealer's Hall is set at $5, and includes a tour of the layout. No meet has been scheduled for 2017.\n\nClub membership is open to everyone over the age of 18. Annual dues is $150.00 and new members have a six-month probation period.\n"}

While often looked over, communication noise can have a profound impact both on our perception of interactions with others and our analysis of our own communication proficiency.\n\nForms of communication noise include psychological noise, physical noise, physiological and semantic noise. All these forms of noise subtly, yet greatly influence our communication with others and are vitally important to anyone’s skills as a competent communicator.\n\nPsychological noise results from preconceived notions we bring to conversations, such as racial stereotypes, reputations, biases, and assumptions. When we come into a conversation with ideas about what the other person is going to say and why, we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time psychological noise is impossible to free ourselves from, and we must simply strive to recognize that it exists and take those distractions into account when we converse with others.\n\nEnvironmental noise is the summary of noise pollution from outside, caused by transport, industrial and recreational activities.\n\nPhysical noise is any external or environmental stimulus that distracts us from receiving the intended message sent by a communicator (Rothwell 11). Examples of physical noise include: others talking in the background, background music, a startling noise and acknowledging someone outside of the conversation.\n\nThis is noise caused by the sender. i.e., the encoder. This type of noise occurs when grammar or technical language is used that the receiver (the decoder) cannot understand, or cannot understand it clearly.\nIt occurs when the sender of the message uses a word or a phrase that we don't know the meaning of, or which we use in a different way from the speakers.

They number up to 500,000, or slightly over 1% of the Sudanese population. Due to their advanced education, their role in the life of the country has been more significant than their numbers suggest. They have occasionally faced forced conversion to Islam, resulting in their emigration and decrease in number.\n\nModern immigration of Copts to Sudan peaked in the early 19th century, and they generally received a tolerant welcome there. However, this was interrupted by a decade of persecution under Mahdist rule at the end of the 19th century. As a result of this persecution, many were forced to relinquish their faith, adopt Islam, and intermarry with the native Sudanese. The Anglo-Egyptian invasion in 1898 allowed Copts greater religious and economic freedom, and they extended their original roles as artisans and merchants into trading, banking, engineering, medicine, and the civil service. Proficiency in business and administration made them a privileged minority. However, the return of militant Islam in the mid-1960s and subsequent demands by radicals for an Islamic constitution prompted Copts to join in public opposition to religious rule.\n\nGaafar Nimeiry's introduction of Islamic Sharia law in 1983 began a new phase of oppressive treatment of Copts, among other non-Muslims. After the overthrow of Nimeiry, Coptic leaders supported a secular candidate in the 1986 elections. However, when the National Islamic Front overthrew the elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi with the help of the military, discrimination against Copts returned in earnest. Hundreds of Copts were dismissed from the civil service and judiciary.\n\nIn February 1991, a Coptic pilot working for Sudan Airways was executed for illegal possession of foreign currency. Before his execution, he had been offered amnesty and money if he converted to Islam, but he refused. Thousands attended his funeral, and the execution was taken as a warning by many Copts, who began to flee the country.\n\nRestrictions on the Copts' rights to Sudanese nationality followed, and it became difficult for them to obtain Sudanese nationality by birth or by naturalization, resulting in problems when attempting to travel abroad. The confiscation of Christian schools and the imposition of an Arab-Islamic emphasis in language and history teaching were accompanied by harassment of Christian children and the introduction of hijab dress laws. A Coptic child was flogged for failing to recite a Koranic verse. In contrast with the extensive media broadcasting of the Muslim Friday prayers, the radio ceased coverage of the Christian Sunday service. As the civil war raged throughout the 1990s, the government focused its religious fervour on the south. Although experiencing discrimination, the Copts and other long-established Christian groups in the north had fewer restrictions than other types of Christians in the south.\n\nToday, the Coptic Church in Sudan is officially registered with the government, and is exempt from property tax. In 2005, the Sudanese government of National Unity (GNU) named a Coptic Orthodox priest to a government position, though the ruling Islamist party's continued dominance under the GNU provides ample reason to doubt its commitment to broader religious or ethnic representation.\n\n\n"}

Its connotations of pleasure-seeking often contrasted with wealth and ruling class behavior.\n\nThe term 'demi-monde' is French for \"half-world\". It derives from a comedy called \"Le Demi-Monde\", by Alexandre Dumas, fils, published in 1855.\n\nThe term was often used as one of disapprobation, the behavior of a person in the demimonde being contrary to more traditional or bourgeois values. Such behaviors often included drinking or drug use, gambling, high spending (particularly in pursuit of fashion, as through clothing as well as servants and houses), and sexual promiscuity. The term \"demimondaine\" referred to a woman who embodied these qualities; later it became a euphemism for a courtesan or prostitute.\n\nAs the twentieth century dawned, changing social mores resulted in the demarginalization of the demimonde. Women's suffrage and the flapper movements resulted in the label \"demimondaine\" becoming obsolete. The term commonly used to refer to the class that became 'starving artists'.\n\nExternally, the defining aspects of the demimonde were an extravagant lifestyle of fine food and clothes, often surpassing that of other wealthy women of their day with a steady income of cash and gifts from their various lovers. Internally, their lifestyle was an eclectic mixture of sharp business acumen, social skills, and hedonism. Intelligent demimondaines, like the fictional Gigi's grandmother, would invest their wealth for the day when their beauty faded. Others ended up penniless and starving when age took its toll on their beauty, unless they managed to marry.\n\nA famous beauty was Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione, who came to Paris in the 1850s with very little money of her own and soon became mistress of Napoleon III; after that relationship ended she moved on to other wealthy men in government, finance and European royalty. She was one of the most aristocratic and exclusive of the demimondaines—reputed to have charged a member of the British aristocracy one million francs for 12 hours in her company. \n\nAnother woman who doubtless influenced later images of the demimondaine was the dancer and adventuress Lola Montez, though she died before the term came into general use.\n\nThe actress Sarah Bernhardt was the illegitimate child of a courtesan; in her day all actresses were generally considered demimondaines. Her many lovers and extravagant lifestyle fit the type, though her genuine successes as an artist and innovator eventually gained her a kind of public esteem most demimondaines never achieved.\n\nDescriptions of the demimonde can be found in \"Vanity Fair\" (1848), a novel which satirizes nineteenth century society, written by William Makepeace Thackeray. Although it does not mention the terms 'demimonde' and 'demimondaine' (they were coined later), the terms were later used by reviewers and other authors in reference to three characters in it. Lady Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington White are demimonde characters, both of whom Captain Rawdon Crawley lusts after in his younger days. Becky Sharp is perceived as a demimondaine before she is presented at court, and then becomes one when she travels through Europe after her husband abandons her.\n\nPossibly the most famous portrayal of the demimonde, albeit from before the word was coined, is in Verdi's opera \"La traviata\" (1853). The opera, in turn, was inspired by Alexandre Dumas the younger's \"La Dame aux Camélias;\" Marguerite Gautier, the heroine of the book and subsequent play, was based on Marie Duplessis, 1840s Paris courtesan and mistress to a number of prominent men, including Dumas.\n\nIn writing his 1924 play \"Easy Virtue\", Noël Coward stated his object was to present a comedy in the structure of a tragedy \"to compare the déclassée woman of to-day with the more flamboyant demi-mondaine of the 1890s.\"\n\nColette's \"Gigi\" (1944) also describes the demimonde and their lifestyle. Gigi is schooled from childhood to be a kept woman, to stifle her feelings in return for a life of ease. \"We never marry in our family\", says Gigi's mother. But Gigi finds herself a misfit in the demimonde of Paris in the 'Gay Nineties', as she desires true romance with Gaston.\n\nIn \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\" (1976) the character Lola Devereaux is labeled a demimondaine by the character Sigmund Freud.\n\nIn Henryk Sienkiewicz's \"Without Dogma\" (1891), the \"demimonde\" refers to the affluent, pleasure-seeking portion of society, unbound by morals, religion or tradition, and is loosely analogous to the \"Jet Set\" of modern times.\n\nIn Marcel Proust's \"Swann's Way\" (1913), Odette de Crécy is described as a demimondaine. \n\nFrancoise Sagan, in her novel \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1954), uses the term 'demimondaine' to refer to the character Elsa, a young, stunningly attractive woman who leverages her appearance into support by wealthy men, which allows her entrance into the social-world of the upper classes.\n\nThe high society men in Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor's novella \"The Old Forest\" (from the story collection of the same name, 1985) use \"demimonde\" to refer to a group of \"adventurous\" and intelligent young women in 1937 Memphis, Tennessee; in the story, it is common for the men to continue courting such \"demimondames\" right up until the time they are married to high society women.\n\nThe term appears repeatedly in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\".\n\nIn Kim Stanley Robinson's \"Mars trilogy\" (1990s), the \"demimonde\" refers to a semi-tolerated, \"off the net\" society of commerce and education.\n\n\n\n"}

One woman told Amnesty International that during her five years of marriage, she was not allowed to leave her husband's home, while another reported that she had been raped by her boyfriend, who threatened to kill her if she told anybody, and continued to coerce her into sex for four months. The law prohibits rape, which is punishable by up to 20 years’ imprisonment. There is no separate statute for spousal rape. \n\nMany women are subjected to harsh treatment by husbands or in-laws upon marriage. Most Tajik women leave school early to be wed, leaving them without an adequate education, and are often pushed into the lowest paying jobs, leaving them economically dependent on their husbands. \n\nIn 2013, Tajikistan enacted the \"Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence\", its first law against domestic violence.\n\nDomestic violence is often seen as justified by society: a UNICEF survey found that 62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.\nAnother survey also found that women and men largely\nagreed that it was justifiable for a husband or mother-in-law to beat a wife/daughter-in-law who had \"talked back\", disobeyed, left the house without permission, had not prepared dinner on time, or had not cared for the children properly.\n\nPolice are often unwilling to intervene in domestic violence incidents. The de facto policy of the authorities is to promote reconciliation. The police often blame the women for their abuse, and sometimes insult women trying to report abuse. Women trying to report cases of abuse to the police are often told to file a complaint, or are sent away. Judiciary, police, and medical staff are not trained to deal with cases of domestic violence. Abusive husbands are rarely arrested or prosecuted.\n\n"}
{"id": "2470711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2470711", "title": "Dymkovo toys", "text": "Dymkovo toys\n\nDymkovo toys, also known as the Vyatka toys or Kirov toys (\"Дымковская игрушка\", \"вятская игрушка\", \"кировская игрушка\" in Russian) are moulded painted clay figures of people and animals (sometimes in the form of a pennywhistle). It is one of the old Russian folk art handicrafts, which still exists in a village of near Kirov (former Vyatka). Traditionally, the Dymkovo toys are made by women.\n\nThe tradition of making pennywhistles in the form of a horse, a horse rider, and a bird goes back to the ancient magic ritual images and has to do with the agricultural calendar holidays. Later, the little figures lost their magic meaning and turned into toys for children, the making of which would become an artistic handicraft. Up until the 20th century, this toy production had been timed to the spring fair called \"свистунья\", or whistler. The first recorded mentioning of this event took place in 1811, but it is believed to have existed for some 400 years, thus dating the history of the Dymkovo toy at least from the 17th century.\n\nIn the late 19th century the handicraft fell into decline because the Dymkovo toys had been forced out of the market by the factory-made moulded plaster statuettes, which imitated porcelain articles. During Soviet times, however, the Dymkovo handicraft was revived. In 1933, they organized an artel called \"Вятская игрушка\" (The Vyatka Toy), which would turn into a workshop of the Artistic Fund of the RSFSR (). These days, the Dymkovo toys are known as a popular Russian souvenir.\n\nThe Dymkovo toys are moulded from a mixture of local potter's clay and river sand. The parts are then fastened together with watery clay. After the toys are dried and tempered in a furnace, they are whitewashed with chalk diluted in milk, then painted with tempera (before 1953, the artists used aniline paints ground with eggs) in 4 to 10 (or more) colors, and decorated with gold leaf.\n\nModern Dymkovo toys include ancient motifs, as well as those of the second half of the 19th century, such as \"барыни\" (barynyas, or landladies), \"няньки\" (nyanki, or nannies), \"водоноски\" (vodonoski, or female watercarriers) and others. In the 1930s, the Dymkovo toys began to depict fairy tales and a contemporary lifestyle. There were also multi-character compositions on stands, and figures of people taller than 30 cm.\n\nMassive, abstract, and somewhat grotesque forms of the Dymkovo toys are emphasized by ruffles, puffed collars, and other features. The improvised bright painting of the toys represents a geometric ornament of circles, checks, and dots of different colors and sizes.\n\n\n"}

This includes Poles due to Partitions of Poland. During the Second World War, after Nicaragua's allies declared war on Germany, German immigrants not naturalized were persecuted and imprisoned. Some were deported to Germany or to concentration camps in other countries. Although Germans have emigrated to Nicaragua since the 19th century, most of the German Nicaraguans still speak both Spanish and German.\n\nThe first German who settled in Nicaragua was the merchant of Leon in 1810, known simply as \"Don Alemán\" (Don German), known by Orlando W. Roberts, (although the real name of German was not mentioned). In 1852, a group of German immigrants, primarily single men, began to settle in northern Nicaragua with the purpose of cultivating 200 blocks of land per person, which were granted by the Government. They were required to cultivate the land and have an initial capital equivalent to about $2,500 per person. Over time, these settlers built farms, established towns and increased the wealth of Nicaragua. North Nicaragua became the epicenter of this economic prosperity. The next settlement upstream, Castillo Viejo (Old Castle), likely had a number of German settlers by the year 1852.\nThe Germans continued to arrive on ships at Granada and rode down to areas where they would soon establish settlements. Other immigrants came to Leon and began their journey to \nMatagalpa. Many of the Germans, who then moved to Costa Rica in 1853 had come to Nicaragua with the emigrant ship \"Antoinette\".\n\nAt the beginning of World War II in 1939, Nicaragua's allies - France and the United Kingdom - declared war on Germany. The Government of Nicaragua prompted a wave of persecution against the Germans in Nicaragua. During this period, fifty young men of German descent were attacked in La vaterland. They were those who had been encouraged to farm coffee plantations by the 'Thirty Years' Conservative governments (1857-1892) and then by the Liberal government of José Santos Zelaya (1893-1909). To promote the cultivation of coffee he donated 200 acres of land in the wilderness areas of Matagalpa and Jinotega. These Germans were the ones who started the promotion, production, processing, transportation and marketing of coffee in northern Nicaragua.\n\nThe president of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza Garcia declared war against Germany in 1941, and the Germans in Nicaragua were victims of this European war. Somoza began \"hunting\" Germans to imprison them. The older people were arrested and the younger were taken to the Quinta Eitzen, a property which Somoza had seized from the German Ulrich Eitzen. \nOnce imprisoned they were not given food. \n\nOnly Germans who were naturalized Nicaraguans were not imprisoned or were released from the jail. However, some Germans were deported to Germany. Some German groups from Nicaragua were in refugee camps in other countries but once the war and the German persecution started, some returned to Nicaragua. Some groups of German (and other ethnic groups) were deported to concentration camps in the United States from Nicaragua. Those who refused to be deported were confined on Ellis Island, a small island in New York, used as a quarantine site for immigrants.\n\nThe descendants of those Germans today live in the mountains, in fincas, as did their ancestors. Most of them can still speak both Spanish and German. Many German Nicaraguans speak additional languages including English and French. They maintain the use of elements of German culture such as the use of fireplaces in their homes, which are unusual in Hispanic America. The German Nicaraguans have their own school in Managua, Nicaragua.\n\nThe German Culture Festival in Nicaragua is celebrated between 4 and 15 June. As part of this festival, there are events celebrating gastronomy, cinema, philosophy and musical heritage. All the events are free to attend, except for the Grand Concert \"Germany in the heart of Nicaragua\", held at the córdobas Ruben Dario National Theater.\n\n\n"}

In 2005, the area was renamed Chinese Massacre Cove, and a memorial was placed there in 2012 in three languages, Chinese, English, and Nez Perce.\n\nTwo groups of Chinese miners, led by Chea Po and Lee She, departed Lewiston in October 1886 and headed upriver along the Snake into Oregon's Hells Canyon to search for gold. Chea's group stopped on the Oregon side of the Snake, near Robinson Gulch and the cove where Deep Creek empties into the Snake. Lee's group continued upriver to Salt Creek. Chea Po had chosen a location just upstream of Dug Bar, a ford used by horse and cattle thieves to cross the Snake. Dug Bar was named for Thomas J. Douglas, a thief who had used the area to graze his horses. Douglas was killed in 1883, and a gang led by Bruce Evans, known locally as \"Old Blue\", began using Douglas's abandoned cabin in the spring of 1887, approximately downstream from Chea Po's camp. The gang consisted of Evans, J.T. (\"Tigh\") Canfield, C.O. (Homer) LaRue, Frank Vaughn, Carl (or Hezekiah) Hughes, Hiram Maynard and Robert McMillan, a fifteen-year-old boy.\n\nIn late May 1887 (May 25, according to Stratton) the gang of seven white horse gang members robbed, murdered, and mutilated between 10 and 34 Chinese employees of the Sam Yup Company, reportedly for their gold. Estimates of the value of gold stolen range from $4,000 to $50,000. According to a contemporaneous news article, the gold dust was given to Canfield for safekeeping, but he double-crossed the rest of the gang and fled the county.\n\nRobert McMillan made a deathbed confession to his father Hugh recounting details of the massacre, which were published in 1891. According to Hugh McMillan, the Chinese miners were ambushed by a party consisting of Robert McMillan, Bruce Evans, J.T. Canfield, Max Larue, and Frank Vaughn in late April 1887. Hiram Maynard and Carl Hughes were traveling with the others, but did not participate in the ambush. Canfield and Larue first attacked the camp of thirteen Chinese from the bluffs overlooking the cove, driving them towards Evans and Vaughn, who were in the path of their retreat. Twelve Chinese were killed in the initial fusillade, then the remaining man had \"his brains beaten out\", retrieving $5,500 in gold dust. The next day, eight more Chinese returned to the camp by boat, where the gang shot and killed them, throwing the 21 bodies into the Snake River. The gang then stole the boat and traveled to the next Chinese camp, where they killed 13 more and retrieved $50,000 in gold. Hugh McMillan stated that Robert was only present for the first day's events, but the gang had discussed the next day's plans before Robert left the others.\n\nAccording to a modern account, Vaughn stayed behind to prepare dinner while the other six rode to ambush the miners. McMillan minded the horses; Canfield and LaRue shot from the rim of Robinson Gulch, while Evans shot from the river level; Hughes and Maynard were positioned upstream and downstream to catch any miner who tried to flee along the river. Their surprise attack was successful, and all ten of the miners at the camp were killed, the last with a rock after the gang had run out of ammunition. The gang returned to the Douglas cabin and restocked their ammunition; the next day, the Evans, Canfield, and LaRue ambushed a group of eight Chinese miners who returned to the cove, then sailed to a second camp and killed thirteen more miners.\n\nThe bodies of some murder victims began washing ashore soon afterward, swept downstream to places as far away as Lime Point (south of the mouth of the Grande Ronde River), Log Cabin Island (now the site of the Lower Granite Dam), and Penawawa, Washington. Each body bore unmistakable markings of great violence; J.K. Vincent, a federal official who investigated the crime, later wrote \"every one was shot, cut up and stripped and thrown in the River.\" Lee She's group went to visit Chea Po's group at Robinson Gulch in early June 1887, and found three bodies in the deserted, ransacked camp; they fled in terror to Lewiston, where they reported the crimes.\n\nA news article published in July 1887 called the corpses a \"severe warning to Chinese miners\" and blamed the victims: \"More than likely it was the whites who look with an evil eye upon Chinese intrusion in American mines. The American miner kicks hard at the Chinese miner.\" Other local Chinese Americans believed that all Chinese miners along the Snake had been killed once the mutilated bodies began to surface. Initially, \"a thorough investigation\" described in a July 17, 1887 article concluded the Chinese had been murdered by rival Chinese miners, since the victims had been \"shot in the back and mutilated by cleavers, a weapon in general use by the Chinese.\" George S. Craig owned the Douglas cabin and discovered numerous skeletons in the area when he returned to winter his stock in the fall of 1887.\n\nFrank Vaughn confessed to the crime in 1888 and his testimony led to the indictment of the other six gang members on March 23, 1888. In follow-up testimony given on April 16, Vaughn blamed Evans, Canfield, and LaRue for the massacre, and said that he, Hughes, Maynard, and McMillan had not participated. Vaughn himself was arrested on April 18. By the time he was arrested, almost the entire gang had left America, save Vaughn and Hughes.\n\nThree of the gang (Maynard, McMillan, and Hughes) were brought to trial but none were convicted. The trio were arraigned on August 28, 1888, and pleaded not guilty on August 29. Their testimony was consistent with Vaughn's, namely, that blame for the crime fell squarely on Evans, Canfield, and LaRue, all absent. The jury found the three men innocent on September 1, 1888, following a short trial.\n\n\nIn 1995, Charlotte McIver discovered a cache of documents relating to the 1888 trial in an old safe being donated to the Wallowa County Museum. When the news came to the attention of R. Gregory Nokes, a reporter for \"The Oregonian\", he began his own research into the massacre, going on to publish a journal article in 2006 and a nonfiction book in 2009 after his retirement in 2003 allowed him to conduct research full-time.\n\nThe five acre site was named Chinese Massacre Cove in 2005 over the objections of Wallowa County commissioners. The Chinese Massacre Memorial Committee placed a granite monument measuring in May 2012, engraved with the words \"Chinese Massacre Cove. Site of the 1887 massacre of as many as 34 Chinese gold miners. No one was held accountable\" written in English, Chinese, and Nez Perce. It was dedicated on June 22, 2012.\n\n\"Deep Creek\", a fictionalized account of the massacre and its aftermath written by William Howarth and Anne Matthews under the pen name \"Dana Hand\", was selected by The Washington Post as one of the best novels of 2010.\n\nTwo episodes of the television show \"Ghost Mine\", first aired in October 2013, covered the investigation of paranormal activity at Chinese Massacre Cove.\n\nPeter Ludwin wrote and published a collection of poetry in 2016, \"Gone to Gold Mountain\". He states he was inspired after reading \"Massacred for Gold\", the 2009 book by R. Gregory Nokes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24872654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24872654", "title": "History of medical diagnosis", "text": "History of medical diagnosis\n\nThe history of medical diagnosis began in earnest from the days of Imhotep in ancient Egypt and Hippocrates in ancient Greece but is far from perfect despite the enormous bounty of information made available by medical research including the sequencing of the human genome. The practice of diagnosis continues to be dominated by theories set down in the early 20th century.\n\nAn Egyptian medical textbook, the Edwin Smith Papyrus written by Imhotep (fl. 2630-2611 BC), was the first to apply the method of diagnosis to the treatment of disease.\n\nA Babylonian medical textbook, the \"Diagnostic Handbook\" written by Esagil-kin-apli (fl. 1069-1046 BC), introduced the use of empiricism, logic and rationality in the diagnosis of an illness or disease. The book made use of logical rules in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis. He described the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis which both played significant roles in the practice of Babylonian medicine.\n\nPredated by Babylonian and Egyptian medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was described in an ancient Chinese text, the Yellow Emperor's\nInner Canon or Huangdi Neijing which dates to the first or second century BCE.\nThe four diagnostic methods of TCM\nwhich are still being practiced today are inspection,\nlistening and smelling,\ninquiry and palpation.\n\nOver two thousand years ago, Hippocrates recorded the association between disease and heredity. In similar fashion, Pythagoras noted the association between metabolism and heredity (allergy to Fava beans). The medical community, however, has only recently acknowledged the importance of genetics and its relevance to mainstream medicine.\n\nThe Arabic physician, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis), wrote on hematology in his \"Al-Tasrif\" (1000). He provided the first description on haemophilia, a hereditary genetic disorder, in which he wrote of an Andalusian family whose males died of bleeding after minor injuries.\n\nThe Persian physician, Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037), in \"The Canon of Medicine\" (1025), pioneered the idea of a syndrome in the diagnosis of specific diseases.\n\nPhysicians used many different techniques to analyze the imbalance of the four humours in the body. Urosocpy was most widely used for diagnosing illness. Physicians would collect patients urine in a flask called “matula”. The matula was specific in shape and had four regions – circulus, superficies, substantia, and fundus – that corresponded to regions of the body. The circulus corresponded to the head; the superficies corresponded to the chest; the substantia corresponded to the abdomen; the fundus corresponded to the reproductive and urinary organs. Urine was inspected based on four criteria: color, consistency, odor, and presence of precipitate. Physicians analyzed the urine for the four criteria and used that to point out where there was an imbalance of the four humours based on the location in the matula. Physicians also examined blood via phlebotomy, they would observe the viscosity and color of the blood as it was draining from the patient and/or contained in a vial. The color and viscosity denoted whether the patient had an acute, major, or chronic disease; which also assisted the physician with the next course of action. Physicians would also observe a patients pulse by palpation; this technique was performed by carefully noting the rate, power, and tempo of a pulsing artery. By interpreting the pulse of the physician could diagnose the type of fever the patient had. Astrological diagnosis was the least used technique for diagnosing illness. Diagnosis was based on the position of the moon in relation to the constellations, which were associated with different regions of the body (head, arms, chest, etc.). Physicians would diagnose illness with the combined knowledge of zodiac signs and humoral medicine.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the well-known British physiologist Marshall Hall emphasized the necessity of maintaining a close relationship between the theory and practice in medicine. He wrote \"On diagnosis\" (1817) and \"The Principles of Diagnosis\" (1834).\n\nThe ideals of William Osler, who transformed the practice of medicine in the early 1900s, were based on the principles of the diagnosis and treatment of disease. According to Osler, the functions of a physician were to be able to identify disease and its manifestations and to understand its mechanisms and how it may be prevented or cured. For his medical students he believed that the best textbook was the patient himself—analysis of morbid anatomy and pathology were the keys. The Oslerian ideal continues today as the basis of the doctor's strategy is, \"What disease does this patient have, and what is the best way for treatment?\" The emphasis is on the classification of the disease in order to use the remedies available for its effects to be reversed or ameliorated. The human being in question is representative of a class of people with this type of disease; this person's biological individuality is not given any great weight.\n\nThe successor to William Osler as Regius Professor at Oxford was Archibald Garrod. Garrod echoed the observations of his Greek counterparts of two millennia ago, \"...our chemical individualities are due to our chemical merits as well as our chemical shortcomings; and it is more nearly true to say that the factors which confer upon us our predispositions to and immunities from various mishaps which are spoken of as diseases, are inherent in our very chemical structure; and even in the molecular groupings which confer upon us our individualities, and which went into the making of the chromosomes from which we sprang.\" Because Garrod practiced in the early 1900s, well before the knowledge of DNA encoding genes that in turn encoded proteins responsible for bodily structure and functions were discovered, it took some time before medicine could fully appreciate the fundamental importance of his concept of diagnosis.\n\nWhereas Osler laid the founding principles by which medicine should be practiced, Garrod placed these principles in a greater context of a chemical individuality that is inherited and is subject to the mechanisms of evolutionary selection. The Oslerian ideal of medical practice continues to dominate medical philosophy today. The patient is a collective of symptoms to be characterized and analyzed algorithmically in order to draw a diagnosis and subsequently produce a strategy of treatment. Medicine is about problems based solutions. In keeping with this philosophy, today's pathology reports provide a momentary snapshot of the patient's biochemical profile, highlighting the end result of the disease process.\n\nGarrod's conception of biological individuality was confirmed with the advent of the sequencing of the human genome. Finally the subtle relationship between inheritance, individuality and environment became apparent via the variations detected in DNA. In each patient's DNA lies a script for how their bodies will change and become ill as well as how they will handle the assaults of the environment from the beginning of their life to its end. It is hoped that by knowing a patient's genes that the biological strengths and weaknesses in respect to these assaults will be revealed and disease processes can be predicted before they have the opportunity to manifest. Although knowledge in this area is far from complete, there are already medical interventions based on this. More importantly, the physician, forewarned with this knowledge can guide the patient towards appropriate lifestyle changes to anticipate and mitigate disease processes.\n\n"}

This term is not generally recognized by Grenadians or indeed Caribbeans. They usually refer to themselves simply as Grenadian or possibly Caribbean. This group was first introduced during the second half of the 19th century when Grenada experimented with indentured labour. By the second half of the 20th century Indians were so integrated into Grenada’s society that a distinct Indian cultural identity was generally invisible. In addition, Indians were involved in every aspect of Grenadian life. Currently there are over 12,000 Grenadians of Indian and mixed-Indian descent (11% of the total population).\n\nHistorian S. N. Yadav described the history of Indo-Grenadians as \"essentially the history of a relatively powerless ethnic group submitting without any organised resistance to an environment unfavourable to it in almost every sense\". Historian Raymond D. Viechweg wrote in 2007, \"the beginning of the trade in Indian indentures ... meant the continuous intermixing, or creolizing, of cultures that would eventually place the Grenadian Indian in a position of cultural vulnerability. When Indians arrived in Grenada in 1857, they found themselves in a position subordinate to a dominant Anglo-African creolization. In Grenada, Indians have functioned within and alongside the dominant Afro-Grenadian cultural formation for 150 years now.\" Following the abolition of slavery in 1833 and the full emancipation of African slaves in Grenada in 1838, plantation owners in the region sought to find alternate sources of labour. Grenadian planters initially made unsuccessful attempts to replace African slave labour with indentured workers from Africa, Malta and Portugal.\n\nPlanters in the West Indies began using indentured workers from British India as labour on their plantations. Learning of the success of the approach, planters in Grenada also sought to hire Indian indentured workers. British Grenada legalised immigration in 1856 to facilitate the arrival indentured migrant workers. The first ship carrying indentured workers from India, the \"Maidstone\", departed from Calcutta on 27 January 1857 with 375 Indians on board. It arrived at Irwin’s Bay in St. Patrick Parish, Grenada on 1 May 1857. Eighty-six Indians died during the voyage. Most of the workers on the \"Maidstone\" were distributed to plantation estates in St. Patrick and St. Mark parishes, as well as other parishes. None were sent to plantations in St. John parish. The \"Fulwood\" brought 362 live Indian workers to Grenada in 1858 and the \"Jalawar\" brought 249 workers the following year. Between 1857 and 1878, ships transported a total of 3,033 Indians to Grenada, excluding those who died during the voyage. The last ship carrying 175 indentured Indian labourers arrived on the island some time between 1881 and 1885. In total, nearly 3,206 Indians were brought to Grenada, excluding those who died during the voyage. Only about 15% of them returned to India, while the rest remained in the country even after their indenture period ended in 1890. These Indians are the origin of the Indo-Grenadian community.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of the first arrival of Indians in Grenada was commemorated in 1957. This was the first ever commemoration of the day in Grenada. The next commemoration would occur more than five decades later in 2009. The International Conference on The Indian Diaspora in Grenada and the Wider Caribbean was held from 29 April to 1 May 2009 to commemorate the event, as well as to discuss Indo-Caribbean history. The conference was by the Indo-Caribbean Cultural Centre Co. Ltd, the Indian Cultural Organisation (Grenada) Inc., and the Indo-Grenadian Heritage Foundation (IHF) with support from Belmont Estate Group of Companies, and the High Commission of India in Trinidad and Tobago. It was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister Keith Mitchell.\n\nOn 29 April 2009, the Government of Grenada declared that the 1st of May would officially be designated as Indian Arrival Day and observed annually alongside the existing Labour Day. The date was already a public holiday in Grenada, on account of Labour Day. The Government also announced that Boucherie Road, the road leading to the site of the arrival of the \"Maidstone\", would be officially renamed Maidstone Road to honour the arrival of Indians in Grenada. The renaming was officially carried out in a ceremony at 10:30 AM at La Fortune Junction, St. Patrick on 2 May 2009. Governor General Sir Carlyle Glean unveiled a granite plaque commemorating the arrival of the first Indians in Grenada. The plaque bears the inscription, \"On 1st May 1857, in this bay the sailing vessel “Maidstone” anchored and landed 287 passengers having left India three months earlier, with 304 passengers. Between the years 1857 and 1890 other ships anchored in this and other bays bringing a total of 3,200 persons from India to work as agricultural indenture labourers in Grenada. This monument is dedicated to those who became the genesis of the Indo-Grenadian population of our nation\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40637136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40637136", "title": "List of Mbunda Chiefs in Zambia", "text": "List of Mbunda Chiefs in Zambia\n\nMbunda people started migrating to Barotseland now Western Province of Zambia in the latter part of the 18th Century. The first Mbunda Chiefs to migrate were Chief Mundu of the Mbalango language, followed by his nephew Chief Kandala Viemba and then King Chitengi Chingumbe Chiyengele, in frustration after his succession to his father's throne, in opposition to the Mbunda custom of a nephew. The three were all received by the Aluyi King Mulambwa. Most of the Mbunda chiefs started migrating at the beginning of the 20th century due to the Mbunda resistance to Portuguese colonial occupation, when the Portuguese colonialists abducted the twenty first (21st) Mbunda Monarch, King Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova.\n\nDue to the Mbunda/Aluyi interaction since the end of the 18th Century in Barotseland, the Mbunda named the Aluyi King Lubosi \"Litunga Liwanika lya mafuti, Njamba kalimi, lifuti limulimina\". This is a Mbunda name meaning, \"Builder and Uniter of Nations\" and depicting an Elephant (Njamba in Mbunda), a Mbunda monarch symbol. This was in recognition of King Lubosi's justice on discovery of the concealment of Aluyi fighters who killed Mbunda commanders after the Aluyi/Tonga war, for fear of the Mbunda getting the credit for the victory over the Tonga, and after the absorption of not only the conquered Makololo, but also the Mbunda immigrants, the Ndebele raiders and the ever-increasing European presence in Barotseland since 1864.\n\nMbunda Chiefs and their people have continued to be subjective to the Barotse Royal Establishment. Negative reactions from different quarters between the two peoples could be attributed to lack of correct information of subject matters. Mbunda Chieftainships obtaining in Barotseland and else where in Zambia are \"Mbunda Institutions\" which would not be substituted, and will remain in existence even when a chief in a person is dethroned, by replacement of another Mbunda from the same royal family tree.\n\nInteractive approaches by the 23rd Mbunda Monarch, His Majesty King Mbandu III Mbandu Lifuti of Angola to his counterpart the 24th King of Barotseland, His Majesty Lubosi Imwiko II, in appreciating the time long co-existence with his people and for the continued cordial relationship between the two peoples indicate exemplary statesmanship. Whereas parallel structures of introducing a Mbunda Royal Council or Establishment in Barotseland has never been considered by the Mbunda Monarch in Angola, however, the Mbunda Chiefs in Zambia and Barotseland in particular, having to be installed by the Mbunda Monarch in Angola, while maintaining their subjectivity to the Litunga, for those in Barotseland as practiced in like manner by the Paramount Chief Undi of the Chewa people of Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique would help preserve the Mbunda culture and traditions.\n\nTraditional Mbundaland in Angola recognize chieftainship of all migrant ethnicity living in the land and continue living with them all in harmony, while paying allegiance to their central chieftainship in their countries of origin. Equally, Mbunda people in the diaspora pay allegiance to the Mbunda Monarch in Angola, while recognizing and being subjective, but not subservient to authorities that be in the diaspora.\n\nFollowing is a list of Mbunda chiefs in Zambia, who ascribe to the 23rd Mbunda monarch His Majesty, King Mwene Mbandu III Mbandu Lifuti in Lumbala Nguimbo, Moxico, Angola:\n\nThe first Mbunda Chiefs to settle in Bulozi were of the Mbunda language (Vambalango). The ancestor of the Mbunda Mbalango was a woman chief called Vamwene Nungu in Mbundaland now Angola. Not all of the children succeeded to chieftainship. Sometimes the succession followed Lozi custom as the Vambalango lived among the Lozi and tended to adopt Lozi customs.\n\nThe second Mbunda Chiefs to settle in Bulozi were also of the Mbunda Mbalango dialect (Vambalango). During the reign of Chief Mundu Kalomo ka Chompe, Chief Kandala Vyemba, nephew to Chief Mundu Man'ulumbe fled into Bulozi. Chief Kandala had come into Bulozi to seek asylum for he was being sought for by King Ngonga I Chiteta of the Mbunda ya Mathzi after a domestic dispute between them which had erupted from a theft case that involved the two Royalties in which Chief Kandala's people had stolen an antelope from King Ngonga I Chiteta's hunting trap. Sometimes the succession followed Lozi custom as the Vambalango lived among the Lozi and tended to adopt Lozi customs.\n\nThe third Mbunda Chiefs to settle in Bulozi were from the central Mbunda Mathzi Chieftainship, which left Mbundaland in frustration due to violation of the Mbunda custom of a son ascendance to the throne rather than a nephew.\n\nAfter the death of King Mulambwa, the Makololo defeated and occupied Bulozi. Some Aluyi and Mbundas migrated from Bulozi to other places.\nThe Mbunda who had supported Prince Mubukwanu, one of Mulambwa's sons left for the now Kabompo. Most of them went to Nakalomo in present-day Lukulu. Here they abandoned their stockade due to Makololo attacks. When Nxaba (Ngabe) in his pursuance to invade the Makololo came to Kakenge's area, (ruler of the Luvale) in the north, he failed to break through the Mbunda fortress at Nakalomo. He then negotiated and tried to persuade the Mbunda to join him and his group, in an alliance against the Kololo. The Mbunda however remained suspicious and merely supplied the Mandebele with guides who took them across the Zambezi westwards in the direction of the Kololo who at that time were pursuing the Luyana fleeing to Nyengo. Those Mandebele were all killed in the valley which was named after them as \"Matebele Valley\". \nThose Mbunda who in 1830 had, due to Makololo invasion, abandoned Nakalomo went to settle east of Manyinga river finding there only a few Nkoya villages. Prior to 1920 the now Kabompo District was uninhabited. Amongst those that migrated to Manyinga, were Prince Namiluko the son of Mulambwa with his son Chikufele. They took the Nkoya under control and established the headquarters of their leader Chikufele (Sikufele) at what came to be known as Lukwakwa. Prince Namiluko and his son Prince Chikufele established the Mbunda Chieftainship at Kabompo, after the expulsion of the Kalolo inversion. After that, many of the Mbundas returned to Barotseland but the Chikufele family remained at Lukwakwa. In those years the Chokwes, the Luvales and the Luchazis had not yet migrated to Kabompo. Though there were some Lozi rulers who were allowed to the Lukwakwa throne, it basically remained under the control of the Mbunda. Sikufele became the main chief of all the Manyinga Native Authorities and the Administrative Court remained under the Mbunda after it was restored from the Lunda. While power was being firmly wrestled by the Mbunda in Manyinga area their influence at the Central Throne of the Lozi Kingdom was still felt. After Lubosi Lewanika fled the throne at the insurrection by Mataa and Numwa in 1884, Tatila Akufuna, one who knew not a single word in Luyana nor in Chikololo (Sikololouthe new Lozi), but spoke Mbunda, was called upon to take up the central throne. Tatila Akufuna (son of Imbue) was a direct product of the Mbunda at Lukwakwa.\n\nThis is a Mbunda Chieftainship related to Chief Chitengi Chingumbe Chiyengele, which was later recognised after the Kaonde/Lozi war, which the Lozis won with the help of the Mbunda war machinery, resulting in the Mbunda Chieftainship of Chief Mwene Kathimba having firmly been established at the confluence of the Lalafuta and Kyamenge in 1893, opposite Chief Mushima Njivumina of the Kaonde. The chieftainship of the Chief Mwene Kathimba brought peace to the area. It is said that when the first Mwene Kathimba arrived, Nkoya inhabiitants of the area were forced to live in stockaded villages for fear of the Kaonde who were their enemies at that time. But today all three peoples co-exist with mutual respect in Kaoma District of the Western Province of Zambia.\n\nThis is a Mbunda Chieftainship from King Mwene Chingumbe Chingumbe Cha Choola and related to Chief Chiyengele Chitenge Chingumbe the 15th Mbunda monarch, who migrated to Kayombo in the now Kabompo District. The succession list though is not complete, more data will be added in future.\n\nThe Mwene Kandombwe chieftainship originates from the central Mbunda royal line (Mbunda-Mathzi). The first Mwene Kandombwe was the son of Chieftainess Vamwene Machalo, one of the three sisters of King Mwene Yambayamba and King Mwene Chingumbe with the Luvale prince-consort named Chivinda cha Nkoshi, in Angola.\n\nThe Mwene Kasavi chieftainship originates from the central Mbunda royal line (Mbunda-Mathzi). The first Chief Mwene Kasavi was the son of King Mwene Nyumbu Luputa (one of the nephews of King Mwene Yambayamba and King Mwene Chingumbe) whose mother Queen Valishano Chikanda was from the Mbunda - Mbalango branch of the Mbunda chieftainship.\n\nThe Mwene Lindeho chieftainship originates from Vamwene Singisingi or Thingithingi, a daughter of Vamwene Ngambo Lyambayi. The first Mwene Lindeho Kanyanyu came to Kalabo District from Nengu in the district of Lumbala Ngimbu in Angola.\n\n\n\n"}

Butler also served as an adjunct professor at Marquette University Law School.\n\nButler campaigned for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2000, but lost his election bid to incumbent Diane Sykes by a wide margin. After being appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2004, he was defeated by the Judge Michael Gableman in the April 1, 2008 elections. Butler was the first sitting Wisconsin Supreme Court justice to be defeated in a reelection campaign since 1967.

{"id": "26790549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26790549", "title": "Mangrove tree distribution", "text": "Mangrove tree distribution\n\nGlobal mangrove distributions have fluctuated throughout human and geological history. The area covered by mangroves is influenced by a complex interaction between land position, rainfall hydrology, sea level, sedimentation, subsidence, storms and pest-predator relationships). In the last 50 years, human activities have strongly affected mangrove distributions, resulting in declines or expansions of worldwide mangrove area. Mangroves provide several important ‘free services’ including coastal stabilization, juvenile fish habitats, and the filtration of sediment and nutrients). Mangrove loss has important implications for coastal ecological systems and human communities dependent on healthy mangrove ecosystems. This English Wikipedia page presents an overview of global Mangrove Forest biome trends in s distribution, as well as the cause of such changes.\n\nAs of 2012, mangroves are found in 105 nations globally. Although distributed across 105 nations, the top 10 mangrove holding nations contain approximately 52% of the global mangrove stock with Indonesia alone containing between 26% and 29% of the entire global mangrove stock. The largest continuous area of mangrove forest is likely in-and-around the Sundarbans National Park in India and the Sundarbans Mangrove Forests in Bangladesh, which are both recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Although existing almost exclusively in the tropics and near-tropics, warm ocean currents support mangrove forests as far north as Walsingham Nature Reserve (Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve) in Bermuda and as far south as Snake Island, Australia.\n\nIn the last five decades, worldwide mangrove area has fallen across all regions. Different data sources or survey methods make estimates more problematic, as many nations have high variations of mangrove change.\n\nPercentage of original area lost per year\n\n(based on data from) \"(Annual loss rates calculated from the mean number of years between original area and present area for each region: 24, 25, 7, 11, and 17\nyears for Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and the world, respectively.) \"\n\nFrom 2000 to 2012, the global mangrove deforestation rate was between 0.16% and 0.39% annually but as high as 3.58% to 8.08% in Southeast Asia. The most recent and comprehensive global assessment of mangrove distribution was conducted by Hamilton and Casey (2016) and provides a high-resolution global database of mangrove loss at the 1 arc-second level at annual intervals from 2000 to 2012 with estimates for 2013 and 2014. In the 1980s and 1990s the greatest amount of loss occurred, while in the period of 2000 to 2005 the rate has fallen significantly across all regions. Some projections estimate that worldwide mangrove area will decline by a further 25% by 2025, particularly in developing nations. It is estimated that since 1970, 28% of mangrove lost has been directly displaced by commercial aquaculture.\n\nPeople’s perception of mangrove ecosystems has been instrumental in the loss of mangroves. Commonly, they have been undervalued and considered ‘wastelands’ with low productivity (,). Concerns for the fate of mangroves have historically been restricted to scientific communities, with little transfer of knowledge to local communities and governments. Mangroves are a common pool resource, creating difficulties in enforcing restrictions on exploitative activities.\nMore recently, perceptions have shifted to a broader acknowledgment within communities and governments of the value of mangroves in coastal ecosystems and local communities. The declining rate of mangrove loss since 2000 across all regions is indicative of this, bringing forth an increasing number of conservation projects and legislation.\n\nA variety of factors have led to the declining trends in mangrove distribution (refer to table fig of causes). These factors are predominantly anthropogenic in origin, as mangrove destruction is positively correlated to human population density. Up to 35% of mangrove forests worldwide have been lost since 1980, reflecting the increased pressure from high population densities residing at the coast. Mangrove losses to climate change are considered a probable long term threat to future distribution. Despite a wide variety of factors linked to mangrove loss (insert figure of causes), the main drivers of recent (i.e. after 1980) mangrove destruction are linked to four main activities: urban sprawl, tourism, agriculture and aquaculture. The causes of declines in mangrove areas vary between regions. In Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America, aquaculture and tourism development are the greatest threat. In Oceania, tourism development is the greatest threat while in Africa, conversion of mangroves for agricultural and urban development is most apparent.\n\nAquaculture – This activity is considered the greatest contributor to worldwide mangrove loss. Since the 1980s, shrimp aquaculture dramatically increased, replacing mangroves with ponds and degrading surrounding areas with associated pollution. Aquaculture has dramatically affected some regions. For example, 50-80% of mangroves were lost in Asia in the past decades. Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America have been most affected by aquaculture\n\nUrban expansion – As population density increases at the coast, areas of mangrove forest have been replaced to provide urban and industrial lands.\n\nTourism – infrastructure supporting tourism often requires the reclamation of substantial tracts of mangrove forests. In the Americas and Oceania, tourism is a major driver of mangrove loss. Where tourism is a main contributor to an economy (such as Pacific Island nations), construction of resorts and related infrastructures have reduced mangrove area in past decades.\n\nAgriculture – Conversion of mangrove forests for agriculture has occurred across all regions historically, freeing up land for activities such as rice or salt production (.\n\nIn many South-east Asian nations, shrimp aquaculture has been instrumental in mangrove loss, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. Due to high economic returns, shrimp farming was promoted to improve economic conditions in many countries. The social and economic benefits of shrimp farming are substantial. Shrimp farms are located close to the coast to reduce costs by using tidal energy and short canal lengths to the coast. Consequently, vast tracts of mangrove forest have been replaced by numerous ponds. Compounding mangrove losses is the short life span of individual ponds (5–10 years), imposing a shifting cultivation pattern to shrimp farming.\n\nAfter 1980, shrimp farming became far more intensive, with high productivity (per unit area) ponds proliferating across the landscape. Dramatic reductions in mangrove forests were reported with shrimp pond intensification. In Thailand, mangrove forests literally halved between 1975–1993 The impact of such losses has been linked to the disruption of ecological and economic functioning of mangroves. For example, loss of income for local Thai fishermen has been reported due to reduced catches from the degradation of juvenile fish habitat.\nSome consider that the number of shrimp farms in South-east Asia peaked in the late 1990s, with the rate of mangrove loss declining accordingly. This decline is in part due to increased conservation and restoration projects, and improved management practices.\n\nIncreases in temperature, CO2, precipitation, storms, and sea level are likely to threaten mangroves in the future. Sea level rise is considered the greatest climate change related threat to mangrove regions. The natural ability of mangroves to ‘keep up’ with rising sea level through peat or sediment accumulation could be exceeded, leading to mangrove die back.Low island mangroves are most at risk, as demonstrated in Bermuda, where sea level rise has exceeded peat accumulation rates periodically, resulting in landward die back of mangrove stands. Climate change may reduce global mangrove area by 10-15%, but it is a long term, less significance threat to the current 1-2% annual loss from human activities.\n\nSeveral nations have experienced an expansion of their mangrove area. These expansions include human activities promoting seaward or landward expansion from climatic or other local factors, as well as conservation and reforestation programmes. Globally, this stability and expansion is far outweighed by the magnitude of mangrove loss from human activities.\n\nSeaward mangrove expansion is considered a natural response to high inputs of sediment and nutrients from human activity in adjacent catchments;. Mangroves naturally encourage sediment deposition by slowing currents and attenuating waves. However, with high sediment inputs, the elevation of intertidal flats can rise above the low tide limit of the original mangrove forest, resulting in a seaward expansion of new mangrove habitat. Once new mangroves establish, they too begin to trap more sediment, raising the tidal flat elevation and generating more mangrove habitat. Seaward expansions are likely in regions with modified catchments (i.e. deforestation or urban development) with high topography where high sediments loads are delivered to mangroves at the coast. Extremely high rates of sediment input can exceed tolerance thresholds and induce mangrove die backs. Excess sedimentation is the primary control, but nutrients (i.e. from agricultural runoff) can enhance mangrove expansion, particularly when combined with high levels of sedimentation. Seaward expansions highlight the interconnectivity of mangrove ecosystems to adjacent catchments and the need to consider catchment alteration when managing mangroves.\n\nIn New Zealand (NZ), temperate mangroves (Avicennia marina) are common in estuaries, harbours and tidal creeks north of 38° latitude. Following European colonization, mangrove area declined, but since the 1970s rapid, ongoing seaward expansion has occurred in many areas. For example, in the last 50 years mangrove area has expanded 120% in Tuaranga Harbour. Such expansion is strongly correlated with elevated rates of sediment deposition. Catchment activities such as deforestation and more recently, urban development have been blamed for the expansion.\nConsiderable debate over whether to protect or remove NZ mangroves exist. Proponents for protection cite the ecological and coastal protection values of mangrove stands, while removal advocates aim to restore recreational values and prevent encroachment into non-mangrove ecosystems. A shift in the management strategy of regional councils from protection to mangrove ‘management’ has occurred recently Removals may take place when human amenities or non-mangrove habitats are deemed threatened by mangrove encroachment. Some researchers caution comparisons being made between NZ and tropical mangroves, suggesting NZ mangroves are unique in their ecology and require a tailored management approach.\n\nIn contrast to seaward expansions in NZ, landward expansions are documented in a number of regions (Thailand, Australia, and Hawaii). The cause of landward expansions is not always clear. In Eastern Australia expansions have replaced salt marshes with various suggestions for the cause of landward expansion (increased rainfall, changes in hydrology, to local subsidence). Expansions in Hawaii are thought to be the result of invasions by exotic mangrove species.\n\nMore recently, awareness of the economic, social, and ecological values of mangroves have led to an increase in the number of initiatives to protect and restore mangrove areas. Broader recognition of the connection of mangroves to coastal food chains, coastal protection and socio-economic welfare has driven recent conservation. For example, Bangladesh has undertaken extensive coastal afforesation (mass plantings) projects since 1966, leading to an increase in mangrove area in recent decades; 2005;. Many nations with mangroves have signed on to the 1971 Ramsar Convention on wetlands in the last two decades, making a commitment to wetland preservation. However, the adoption of protective legislation is not evenly spread. For instance, community initiatives to protect mangroves are common in Africa but little legislation exists compared to other regions, such as Asia.\n\nMuch attention has been given to mangroves by the scientific community, as well as a largely universal acknowledgement among communities and governments of the ecological and economic values. Despite this awareness, global mangrove area continues to decline through human activities. A lack of communication between biologists, effected residents, and governments could partly account for this. Calls have been made for greater collaboration between international researchers and residents of affected nations.\nEfforts to assess changes in worldwide mangrove distribution have been hindered by a lack of long term data, or limited to no data at all for some nations. Without accurate data on distributions, an accurate forecast of mangrove loss or expansion becomes problematic. This in turn may hinder the progress of conservation projects.\nDespite large volumes of scientific literature on mangroves, many uncertainties still exist. These include how mangroves will respond to increases in greenhouse gases and sea level, sustainable yields for silviculture, the difference in ecological functioning between tropical and temperate species, and why within the same species we get seaward and landward expansions. Obtaining this knowledge will help nations to better predict future mangrove behavior, and administer appropriate management policies.\n\nMangrove loss has been a worldwide trend for the last 50 years due primarily to anthropogenic activities that compete for land area. Expansions in mangrove area do occur, but have a limited ability to offset the extensive losses. Recently the rate of loss has been declining due to a greater awareness of mangrove values, with legislation and conservation projects becoming more commonplace. It can only be hoped that this declining rate of loss continues, allowing future generations to appreciate the many benefits of mangroves.\n"}

{"id": "2719497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2719497", "title": "National Driver Register", "text": "National Driver Register\n\nThe National Driver Register (NDR) is a computerized database of information about United States drivers who have had their driver's licenses revoked or suspended, or who have been convicted of serious traffic violations, such as driving under the influence or drugs or alcohol. (see 23 Code of Federal Regulations 1327 Appendix A for a complete list of violations). The records are added and maintained and deleted by the motor vehicle agency (MVA) of the state that convicted the driver or withdrew the driver's license.\n\nWhen a person applies for a driver's license, either as a new applicant or as a renewing applicant in a participating state, the state MVA must check if the name is on the NDR's Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) (as required by federal regulation—see 23 CFR 1327.5(b)(1)). If a person has been reported to the NDR by any state as a \"problem driver\", the prospective licensing state must investigate the driver's history from the state that added the NDR record. Depending on the results of the investigation and the state's own laws, the prospective licensing state may be required to deny the license. Thus, this \"PDPS check\" enables the state MVAs to prevent someone with a suspended or revoked driver's license in one state from obtaining a driver's license in another state. The PDPS check also makes it harder for a person to obtain more than one driver's license at any one time.\n\nNote that not all records on the NDR are correct. Some may have been added in the past incorrectly for misdemeanor violations, such as not returning license plates in New York state. Some records may identify the wrong driver. Some records for specific convictions may have met data retention requirements and are eligible for deletion. A driver must contact the state that added the record to have that state delete an incorrect record. To find out if you have a record on NDR PDPS, see the next section.\n\nNote also that the NDR may not contain all required records. For example, a man in Pennsylvania was convicted of driving under the influence of marijuana cigarettes and crack cocaine in 1997, and was never put on the NDR.\n\nCurrently, and for the past few decades, all U.S. states participate in NDR, to avoid losing federal funding. Federal Regulation 23 CFR 1327.1 states, \"This part provides procedures for States to participate in the National Driver Register (NDR) Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) and for other authorized parties to receive information from the NDR. It includes, in accordance with section 204(c) of the NDR Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-364), procedures for a State to notify the Secretary of Transportation of its intention to be bound by the requirements of section 205 of the Act (i.e., requirements for reporting by chief driver licensing officials) and for a State to notify the Secretary in the event it becomes necessary to withdraw from participation. The rule also contains the conditions for becoming a participating State as well as conditions and procedures for other authorized users of the NDR.\"\n\nThe following groups are authorized to receive information from the NDR:\n\n\nUnder the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and Title 23 § 1327.7, you are entitled to request a file search to see if you have a record on the NDR. As a private citizen, you must send a notarized letter commonly referred to as a \"privacy act request\" to the NDR indicating that you would like an NDR file check. There is no charge for this service.\n\nAccording to National Drivers Register officials, problem drivers' records posted to the NDR database by the states are made available to all states in the U.S. Information supplied by one state to the NDR is obtained by another state from the NDR using the first four letters of the driver's first and last names, date of birth, and, often, if it is published, that driver's social security number and/or license number.\n\n\n"}

This term applies to people of Indonesian birth and descent who are citizens or residents of temporary status.\n\nMany Indonesians go abroad as students, or labourers (known as \"Tenaga Kerja Indonesia\" or TKI). Most of them settle in Malaysia, UAE, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Netherlands, United States, and Australia.\n\nMalaysia shares a land border with Indonesia and both countries share many aspects of their culture, including mutually intelligible national languages. Populations have long moved between the areas which make up the modern-day states. Since the distinction between thre two regions emerged in the early 19th century, many people from Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi, which are located in modern-day Indonesia, migrated and settled in the Malay Peninsula and in Malaysian Borneo. These earlier populations have mostly effectively or partially assimilated with the larger Malaysian-Malay community due to religious, social and cultural similarities. Currently, it is also estimated that there are around 2 million Indonesian citizens in Malaysia at any given time, ranging from all types of background with a significant majority of them consisting of labour migrants, with a considerable number of professionals and students.\n\nThe Malays in Singapore (Malay: Orang Melayu Singapura) make up about 14% of the country's population. Most of them came from what we know today as Indonesia and southern Malaysia. In the 19th century, Singapore was part of Johor-Riau Sultanate. Many Indonesian people, mainly Bugis and Minangkabau settled in Singapore. From 1886 till 1890, as many as 21,000 Javanese became bonded labourers with the Singapore Chinese Protectorate, an organisation formed by the British in 1877 to monitor the Chinese population. They performed manual labour in the rubber plantations. After their bond ended, they continued to open up the land and stayed on in Johore. Famous Singaporeans of Indonesian descent are the first president of Singapore Yusof bin Ishak, and Zubir Said who composed the national anthem of Singapore \"Majulah Singapura\".\n\nAccording to the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore, as of 2010 there are 180,000 Indonesian citizens in Singapore. As much as 80,000 work as domestic helpers/TKI, 10,000 as sailors, and the rest are either students or professionals. But the number can be higher as registering one's residence is not compulsory for Indonesians, putting the number to around 200,000 people.\n\nIndonesia was a colony of the Netherlands from 1605 until 1945. In the early 20th century, many Indonesian students studied in the Netherlands. Most of them lived in Leiden and were active in the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (Indonesian Association). During and after the Indonesian National Revolution, many Moluccans and Indo people, people of mixed Dutch and Indonesian ancestry migrated to the Netherlands. Most of them were ex-KNIL army. In this way around 360,000 Indo people (Indo's)and Totok's (white people) and 12,500 persons from Maluke ancestry were settled in the Netherlands. Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Denny Landzaat, Roy Makaay, Mia Audina, and Daniel Sahuleka are notable people of Indonesian ancestry from the Netherlands. These 372,500 first generation people and their 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation offspring account for some 1.6 million Dutch passport-holders. This is as much as about 10% of the overall population of the Netherlands.\n\nIn the United States, most Indonesians are students and professionals. Boston University and Harvard University are examples of favourite universities for Indonesians. In the Silicon Valley region of Northern California, there are many professional Indonesian-American engineers in the high-tech industry that are employed in companies such as Cisco Systems, KLA Tencor, Google, Yahoo, Sun Microsystems, and IBM. Sehat Sutardja, CEO of Marvell Technology Group, is one of the successful Indonesian professional in USA.\n\nIn April 2011 the Special English service of Voice of America reported on a push for American universities to get more Indonesians to study in America as part of reaching out fast-growing economies like Indonesia in order to compete with students' preferred universities in Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nIndonesian pilgrims have long lived in Hejaz, a region along the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Among them was Ahmad Khatib, who served as the Imam of the Shafi'i school of law at the mosque known as Masjidil Haram, Mecca. \n\nMost of Indonesians in Saudi Arabia are female domestic workers, with a minority of other types of labour migrants and students. Most of the \"santri\" extension studied in Saudi, as well as Islamic University in Madina. A number of Indonesian expatriates in Saudi Arabia work in diplomatic sectors or are employees to local or foreign companies located in various province of Saudi Arabia such as SABIC, Schlumberger, Halliburton, or Indomie. Many of Indonesians are also employees to the world's biggest oil company Saudi Aramco. Most Indonesians in Saudi Arabia reside in Riyadh, Jeddah, and all around Dammam area.\n\nThere are about 39,000 Indonesian citizens in the State of Qatar according to the Indonesian Embassy.\n\nBefore Dutch and British sailors arrived in Australia, Indonesians from Southern Sulawesi have explored the Australia northern coast. Each year, the Bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern monsoon in their wooden pinisi. They would stay in Australia for several months to trade and take \"tripang\" (or dried sea cucumber) before returning to Makassar on the dry season off shore winds. These trading voyages continued until 1907.\nNowadays, mostly Indonesian whose reside in Australia are either foreign students or workers, the main ethnic group mostly are the Chinese from Indonesia.\nFurthermore, the Cocos Malays are descendants of native Indonesians were brought by the Clunies-Ross family to work in the copra industry in the 19th century.\n\nPeople of Indonesian descent, mainly Javanese, make up 15% of the population of Suriname. In the 19th century, the Dutch sent the Javanese to Suriname as contract workers in plantations. The most famous person of Indonesian descent is Paul Somohardjo as the speaker of the National Assembly of Suriname.\n\nIn 2013 approximately 20,000 Indonesians living in Japan, including about 3,000 illegal Indonesians. These numbers dropped from the previous years because of various reasons, reasons include the high cost of living in Japan and the difficulties to find jobs in Japan. Most of them are in Japan for short term and deportation remains high for Indonesian residents.\n\nIndonesian are the second largest foreigner group after Filipino, mainly are the female domestic helper from Java Island, there are also several Chinese Indonesians family and student that reside in Hong Kong. Central and Wan Chai are the main district that mostly Indonesians living in.\n\nIndonesians in the Philippines number anywhere from 43,871 to 101,720. They reside mostly in the island of Mindanao, in the Muslim parts with a noticeable community in Davao City that has an international school for the overseas community. They tend to be protective of their separate ethnic identity. Most are Muslims, while many others are also Christian, coming from Minahasan-speaking ancestry.\n\n"}
{"id": "23821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23821", "title": "Prague Spring", "text": "Prague Spring\n\nThe Prague Spring (, ) was a period of political liberalization in Czechoslovakia as a Communist state after World War II. It began on 5 January 1968, when reformist Alexander Dubček was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), and continued until 21 August 1968 when the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded the country to suppress the reforms.\n\nThe Prague Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dubček to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic. This dual federation was the only formal change that survived the invasion.\n\nThe reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. \"The New York Times\" cited reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. Non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, sabotage of street signs, defiance of curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country, the resistance held out for eight months until it was finally circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). It became a high-profile example of civilian-based defense; there were sporadic acts of violence and several protest suicides by self-immolation (the most famous being that of Jan Palach), but no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained controlled by the Soviet Union until 1989, when the Velvet Revolution peacefully ended the communist regime; the last Soviet troops left the country in 1991. \n\nAfter the invasion, Czechoslovakia entered a period known as \"normalization\": subsequent leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ. Gustáv Husák, who replaced Dubček as First Secretary and also became President, reversed almost all of the reforms. The Prague Spring inspired music and literature including the work of Václav Havel, Karel Husa, Karel Kryl and Milan Kundera's novel \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\".\n\nThe process of de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the completion of socialism, and the new constitution accordingly adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but did not take place until 1967.\n\n, Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn. The Soviet model of industrialization applied poorly to Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was already quite industrialized before World War II and the Soviet model mainly took into account less developed economies. Novotný's attempt at restructuring the economy, the 1965 New Economic Model, spurred increased demand for political reform as well.\n\nAs the strict regime eased its rules, the Union of Czechoslovak Writers cautiously began to air discontent, and in the union's gazette, \"Literární noviny\", members suggested that literature should be independent of Party doctrine.\n\nIn June 1967, a small fraction of the Czech writer's union sympathized with radical socialists, specifically Ludvík Vaculík, Milan Kundera, Jan Procházka, Antonín Jaroslav Liehm, Pavel Kohout and Ivan Klíma.\n\nA few months later, at a party meeting, it was decided that administrative actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a small part of the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over \"Literární noviny\" and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.\n\nAs President Antonín Novotný was losing support, Alexander Dubček, First Secretary of the regional Communist Party of Slovakia, and economist Ota Šik challenged him at a meeting of the Central Committee. Novotný then invited the secretary-general of the Communist Party of Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, to Prague that December, seeking support; but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia's leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by Ludvík Svoboda, who later gave consent to the reforms.\n\nEarly signs of change were few. When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) Presidium member Josef Smrkovský was interviewed in a \"Rudé Právo\" article, entitled \"What Lies Ahead\", he insisted that Dubček's appointment at the January Plenum would further the goals of socialism and maintain the working class nature of the Communist Party.\n\nHowever, right after Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became chairman of the \"Union of Czechoslovak Writers\" and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly \"Literární noviny\", which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstücker tested the boundaries of Dubček's devotion to freedom of the press when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny's previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.\n\nDespite the official government statement that allowed for freedom of the press, this was the first trial of whether Dubček was serious about reforms. Goldstücker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers' Union published the first copy of the censor-free \"Literární listy\". By August 1968, \"Literární listy\" had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's \"Victorious February\", Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism. He emphasized the need to \"enforce the leading role of the party more effectively\" and acknowledged that, despite Klement Gottwald's urgings for better relations with society, the Party had too often made heavy-handed rulings on trivial issues. Dubček declared the party's mission was \"to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations ... a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties ...\"\n\nOne of the most important steps towards the reform was the reduction and later abolition of the censorship on 4 March 1968. It was for the first time in Czech history the censorship was abolished and it was also probably the only reform fully implemented, albeit only for a short period. From the instrument of Party's propaganda media quickly became the instrument of criticism of the regime.\n\nIn April, Dubček launched an \"Action Programme\" of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that \"Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy.\" It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of the ČSSR into two equal nations. The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations. It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo.\n\nThose who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post-war Communist regime, only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness. For instance, the immediate post-war situation had required \"centralist and directive-administrative methods\" to fight against the \"remnants of the bourgeoisie.\" Since the \"antagonistic classes\" were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary. Reform was needed for the Czechoslovak economy to join the \"scientific-technical revolution in the world\", rather than relying on Stalinist-era heavy industry, labour power, and raw materials. Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening Marxism-Leninism. The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were \"filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres\" in order to compete with capitalism.\n\nAlthough it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately. Radical elements became more vocal: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press on 26 June 1968, the Social Democrats began to form a separate party, and new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership. At the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April, Dubček announced a political programme of \"socialism with a human face\". In May, he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September. The congress would incorporate the Action Programme into the party statutes, draft a federalization law, and elect a new Central Committee.\n\nDubček's reforms guaranteed freedom of the press, and political commentary was allowed for the first time in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.\n\nOn 27 June Ludvík Vaculík, a leading author and journalist, published a manifesto titled \"The Two Thousand Words\". It expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and so-called \"foreign\" forces. Vaculík called on the people to take the initiative in implementing the reform programme. Dubček, the party Presidium, the National Front, and the cabinet denounced this manifesto.\n\nDubček's relaxation of censorship ushered in a brief period of freedom of speech and the press. The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly \"Literarni noviny\", renamed \"Literarni listy\".\n\nFreedom of the press also opened the door for the first honest look at Czechoslovakia's past by Czechoslovakia's people. Many of the investigations centered on the country's history under communism, especially in the instance of the Joseph Stalin-period. In another television appearance, Goldstücker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writers' Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert, to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world. Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily \"Prace\" (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists' Union, which by March 1968 had already persuaded the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions to foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.\n\nThe press, the radio, and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstücker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new freedom of the press and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.\n\nInitial reaction within the Communist Bloc was mixed. Hungary's János Kádár was highly supportive of Dubček's appointment in January, but Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which they feared might weaken the position of the Communist Bloc during the Cold War.\n\nAt a meeting in Dresden, East Germany on 23 March, leaders of the \"Warsaw Five\" (USSR, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany) questioned a Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms, suggesting any talk of \"democratization\" was a veiled criticism of other policies. Władysław Gomułka and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms levelled by the Czechoslovak media, and worried the situation might be \"similar to the prologue of the Hungarian counterrevolution\". Some of the language in April's KSČ Action Programme may have been chosen to assert that no counterrevolution was planned, but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at, but not resentful of, Soviet suggestions.\n\nThe Soviet leadership tried to stop, or limit, the changes in the ČSSR through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at Čierna nad Tisou, near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, from 29 July to 1 August, with attendance of Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin, Nikolai Podgorny, Mikhail Suslov and others on the Soviet side and Dubček, Svoboda, Oldřich Černík, Smrkovský and others on the Czechoslovak side, Dubček defended the proposals of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, and František Kriegel) who supported Dubček, and conservatives (Vasil Biľak, Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance.\n\nBrezhnev decided on compromise. The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb \"anti-socialist\" tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and control the press more effectively. The Soviets agreed to withdraw their armed forces (still in Czechoslovakia after manoeuvres that June) and permit the 9 September Party Congress.\n\nOn 3 August representatives from the \"Warsaw Five\" and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration. The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against \"bourgeois\" ideology and all \"anti-socialist\" forces. The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a \"bourgeois\" system—a pluralist system of several political parties representing different factions of the capitalist class—was ever established. After the Bratislava conference, the Soviet Army left Czechoslovak territory but remained along its borders.\n\nAs these talks proved unsatisfactory, the Soviets began to consider a military alternative. The Soviet Union's policy of compelling the socialist governments of its satellite states to subordinate their national interests to those of the \"Eastern Bloc\" (through military force if needed) became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine. On the night of 20–21 August 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary—invaded the ČSSR.\n\nThat night, 200,000 troops and 2,000 tanks entered the country. They first occupied the Ruzyně International Airport, where air deployment of more troops was arranged. The Czechoslovak forces were confined to their barracks, which were surrounded until the threat of a counter-attack was assuaged. By the morning of 21 August Czechoslovakia was occupied.\n\nNeither Romania nor Albania took part in the invasion. Soviet command refrained from drawing upon East German troops for fear of reviving memories of the Nazi invasion in 1938. During the invasion by the Warsaw Pact armies, 72 Czechs and Slovaks were killed (19 of those in Slovakia), 266 severely wounded and another 436 slightly injured. Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. Nevertheless, there was scattered resistance in the streets. Road signs in towns were removed or painted over—except for those indicating the way to Moscow. Many small villages renamed themselves \"Dubcek\" or \"Svoboda\"; thus, without navigational equipment, the invaders were often confused.\n\nOn the night of the invasion the Czechoslovak Presidium declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without the knowledge of the ČSSR government, but the Soviet Press printed an unsigned request – allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders – for \"immediate assistance, including assistance with armed forces\". At the 14th KSČ Party Congress (conducted secretly, immediately following the intervention), it was emphasized that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention. More recent evidence suggests that conservative KSČ members (including Biľak, Švestka, Kolder, Indra, and Kapek) did send a request for intervention to the Soviets. The invasion was followed by a previously unseen wave of emigration, which was stopped shortly thereafter. An estimated 70,000 fled immediately with an eventual total of some 300,000.\n\nThe Soviets attributed the invasion to the \"Brezhnev Doctrine\", which stated that the U.S.S.R. had the right to intervene whenever a country in the Eastern Bloc appeared to be making a shift towards capitalism. There is still some uncertainty, however, as to what provocation, if any, occurred to make the Warsaw Pact armies invade. Preceding the invasion was a rather calm period without any major events taking place in Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, especially in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech.\n\nThe generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary. Dubček, who had been arrested on the night of 20 August, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. There, he and several other leaders (including all the highest-ranked officials, President Svoboda, Prime Minister Černík and Chairman of the National Assembly Smrkovský) signed the Moscow Protocol, under heavy psychological pressure from Soviet politicians, and it was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and a programme of moderate reform would continue.\n\nOn 25 August citizens of the Soviet Union who did not approve of the invasion protested in Red Square; seven protesters opened banners with anti-invasion slogans. The demonstrators were brutally beaten and arrested by security forces, and later punished by a secret tribunal; the protest was dubbed \"anti-Soviet\" and several people were detained in psychiatric hospitals.\n\nA more pronounced effect took place in Romania, where Nicolae Ceaușescu, General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, already a staunch opponent of Soviet influences and a self-declared Dubček supporter, gave a public speech in Bucharest on the day of the invasion, depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms. Albania withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in opposition, calling the invasion an act of \"social imperialism\". In Finland, a country under some Soviet political influence, the occupation caused a major scandal.\n\nLike the Italian and French Communist parties, the majority of the Communist Party of Finland denounced the occupation. Nonetheless, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President Ludvík Svoboda, on 4 October 1969. The Portuguese communist secretary-general Álvaro Cunhal was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being counter-revolutionary. along with the Luxembourg party and conservative factions of the Greek party.\n\nMost countries offered only vocal criticism following the invasion. The night of the invasion, Canada, Denmark, France, Paraguay, the United Kingdom and the United States requested a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. At the meeting, the Czechoslovak ambassador Jan Muzik denounced the invasion. Soviet ambassador Jacob Malik insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were \"fraternal assistance\" against \"antisocial forces\". \n\nOne of the nations that most vehemently condemned the invasion was China, which objected furiously to the so-called \"Brezhnev doctrine\" declaring the Soviet Union alone had the right to determine what nations were properly Communist and could invade those Communist nations whose communism did not meet the Kremlin's approval. Mao Zedong saw the Brezhnev doctrine as the ideological basis for a Soviet invasion of China, and launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia, despite his own earlier opposition to the Prague Spring. Speaking at a banquet at the Romanian embassy in Beijing on 23 August 1968, the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for \"fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism and social imperialism\", going on to compare the invasion of Czechoslovakia to the American war in Vietnam and more pointedly to the policies of Adolf Hitler towards Czechoslovakia in 1938-39. Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the Red Army. \n\nThe next day, several countries suggested a resolution condemning the intervention and calling for immediate withdrawal. Eventually, a vote was taken with ten members supporting the motion; Algeria, India, and Pakistan abstained; the USSR (with veto power) and Hungary opposed. Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work toward the release of the imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders.\n\nBy 26 August a new Czechoslovak representative requested the whole issue be removed from the Security Council's agenda. Shirley Temple Black visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U.S. citizens from the country. In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the Velvet Revolution that ended 41 years of Communist rule.\n\nIn April 1969, Dubček was replaced as first secretary by Gustáv Husák, and a period of \"normalization\" began. Dubček was expelled from the KSČ and given a job as a forestry official.\n\nHusák reversed Dubček's reforms, purged the party of its liberal members, and dismissed from public office professional and intellectual elites who openly expressed disagreement with the political transformation. Husák worked to reinstate the power of the police and strengthen ties with the rest of the Communist bloc. He also sought to re-centralize the economy, as a considerable amount of freedom had been granted to industries during the Prague Spring. Commentary on politics was forbidden in mainstream media, and political statements by anyone not considered to have \"full political trust\" were also banned. The only significant change that survived was the federalization of the country, which created the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic in 1969.\nIn 1987, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed a great deal to Dubček's \"socialism with a human face\". When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and Gorbachev's own reforms, a Foreign Ministry spokesman replied, \"Nineteen years.\"\n\nDubček lent his support to the Velvet Revolution of December 1989. After the collapse of the Communist regime that month, Dubček became chairman of the federal assembly under the Havel administration. He later led the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, and spoke against the dissolution of Czechoslovakia prior to his death in November 1992.\n\nThe Warsaw Pact invasion included attacks on media establishments, such as Radio Prague and Czechoslovak Television, almost immediately after the initial tanks rolled into Prague on 21 August 1968. While both the radio station and the television station managed to hold out for at least enough time for initial broadcasts of the invasion, what the Soviets did not attack by force they attacked by reenacting party censorship. In reaction to the invasion, on 28 August 1968, all Czechoslovak publishers agreed to halt production of newspapers for the day to allow for a \"day of reflection\" for the editorial staffs. Writers and reporters agreed with Dubcek to support a limited reinstitution of the censorship office, as long as the institution was to only last three months. Finally, by September 1968, the Czechoslovak Communist Party plenum was held to instate the new censorship law. In the words of the Moscow-approved resolution, \"The press, radio, and television are first of all the instruments for carrying into life the policies of the Party and state.\"\n\nWhile this was not yet the end of the media's freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the beginning of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies \"Reporter\" and \"Politika\" responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in \"Politika\", the government banned \"Reporter\" for a month, suspended \"Politika\" indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.\n\nThe intellectuals were stuck at a bypass; they recognized the government's increasing normalization, but they were unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek's promises for reform, Milan Kundera published the article \"Cesky udel\" (Our Czech Destiny) in \"Literarni listy\" on 19 December. He wrote: \"People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting that there are not enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty.\"\n\nIn March 1969, however, the new Soviet-backed Czechoslovakian government instituted full censorship, effectively ending the hopes that normalization would lead back to the freedoms enjoyed during the Prague Spring. A declaration was presented to the Presidium condemning the media as co-conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubcek's liberalization measures. Finally, on 2 April 1969, the government adopted measures \"to secure peace and order\" through even stricter censorship, forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the thawing of Eastern Europe for the return of a free media.\n\nFormer students from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech refugees from the crisis, who were able to escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists with Soviet views. It contributed to the growth of Eurocommunist ideas in Western communist parties, which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union, and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups.\nA decade later, a period of Chinese political liberalization became known as the Beijing Spring. It also partly influenced the Croatian Spring in Communist Yugoslavia. In a 1993 Czech survey, 60% of those surveyed had a personal memory linked to the Prague Spring while another 30% were familiar with the events in another form. The demonstrations and regime changes taking place in North Africa and the Middle East from December 2010 have frequently been referred to as an \"Arab Spring\".\n\nThe event has been referenced in popular music, including the music of Karel Kryl, Luboš Fišer's \"Requiem\", and Karel Husa's \"Music for Prague 1968\".\nThe Israeli song \"Prague\", written by Shalom Hanoch and performed by Arik Einstein at the Israel Song Festival of 1969, was a lamentation on the fate of the city after the Soviet invasion and mentions Jan Palach's Self-immolation.\n\"They Can't Stop The Spring\", a song by Irish journalist and songwriter John Waters, represented Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2007. Waters has described it as \"a kind of Celtic celebration of the Eastern European revolutions and their eventual outcome\", quoting Dubček's alleged comment: \"They may crush the flowers, but they can't stop the Spring.\"\n\nThe Prague Spring is featured in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" during the Prague Spring. It follows the repercussions of increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. \"The Liberators\", by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, from the point of view of a Soviet tank commander. \"Rock 'n' Roll\", a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir \"Under a Cruel Star\" with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.\n\nIn film there has been an adaptation of \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\", and also the movie \"Pelíšky\" from director Jan Hřebejk and screenwriter Petr Jarchovský, which depicts the events of the Prague Spring and ends with the invasion by the Soviet Union and their allies. The Czech musical film, \"Rebelové\" from Filip Renč, also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.\n\nThe number \"68\" has become iconic in the former Czechoslovakia. Hockey player Jaromír Jágr, whose grandfather died in prison during the rebellion, wears the number because of the importance of the year in Czechoslovak history. A former publishing house based in Toronto, 68 Publishers, that published books by exiled Czech and Slovak authors, took its name from the event.\n\nAnarchist Colin Ward argues that a significantly anarchist street culture developed during the Prague Spring as citizens became increasingly defiant of government authorities and began to occupy workplaces while creating mutual aid networks between telephone workers, truck drivers and university students. Furthermore, during the Soviet invasion, anarchists took to the streets and battled tanks and soldiers with rocks, molotov cocktails and improvised weapons.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also used contemptuously in other Spanish-speaking countries, especially Bolivia and Peru, to refer to Chileans in a derogatory manner. Otherwise, despite its defects, the roto is also considered a figure of national identity and pride in Chile.\n\nThe term \"roto\" has been used in Peru since the times of the Spanish conquest, when Diego de Almagro's disappointed troops returned to Cuzco (after a failed gold-seeking expedition in Chile) with their torn clothes, due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot through the Atacama desert.\n\nThis term became more used after the Chilean campaigns against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation in 1839 —Chilean troops defeated the confederation at the Battle of Yungay on 20 January 1839.

{"id": "10181116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10181116", "title": "Sequence learning", "text": "Sequence learning\n\nIn cognitive psychology, sequence learning is inherent to human ability because it is an integrated part of conscious and nonconscious learning as well as activities. Sequences of information or sequences of actions are used in various everyday tasks: \"from sequencing sounds in speech, to sequencing movements in typing or playing instruments, to sequencing actions in driving an automobile.\" Sequence learning can be used to study skill acquisition and in studies of various groups ranging from neuropsychological patients to infants. According to Ritter and Nerb, “The order in which material is presented can strongly influence what is learned, how fast performance increases, and sometimes even whether the material is learned at all.” Sequence learning, more known and understood as a form of explicit learning, is now also being studied as a form of implicit learning as well as other forms of learning. Sequence learning can also be referred to as sequential behavior, behavior sequencing, and serial order in behavior.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Margaret Floy Washburn, John B. Watson, and other behaviorists believed behavioral sequencing to be governed by the reflex chain, which states that stimulation caused by an initial movement triggers an additional movement, which triggers another additional movement, and so on. In 1951, Karl Lashley, a neurophysiologist at Harvard University, published “The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior,” addressing the current beliefs about sequence learning and introducing his hypothesis. He criticized the previous view on the basis of six lines of evidence: \nThe first line is that movements can occur even when sensory feedback is interrupted. The second is that some movement sequences occur too quickly for elements of the sequences to be triggered by feedback from the preceding elements. Next is that the errors in behavior suggest internal plans for what will be done later. Also, the time to initiate a movement sequence can increase with the length or complexity of the sequence. The next line is the properties of movements occurring early in a sequence can anticipate later features. Then lastly the neural activity can indicate preparation of upcoming behavior events, including upcoming behavior events in the relatively long-term future.\n\nLashley argued that sequence learning, or behavioral sequencing or serial order in behavior, is not attributable to sensory feedback. Rather, he proposed that there are plans for behavior since the nervous system prepares for some behaviors but not others. He said that there was a hierarchical organization of plans. He came up with several lines of evidence. The first of these is that the context changes functional interpretations of the same behaviors, such as the way “wright, right, right, rite, and write” are interpreted based on the context of the sentence. “Right” can be interpreted as a direction or as something good depending on the context. A second line of evidence says that errors are involved in human behavior as hierarchical organization. In addition, “hierarchical organization of plans comes from the timing of behavioral sequences.” The larger the phrase, the longer the response time, which factors into “decoding” or “unpacking” hierarchical plans. Additional evidence is how easy or hard it is to learn a sequence. The mind can create a “memory for what is about to happen” as well as a “memory for what has happened.” The final evidence for the hierarchical organization of plans is characterized by \"chunking\". This skill combines multiple units into larger units.\n\nThere are two broad categories of sequence learning—explicit and implicit—with subcategories. Explicit sequence learning has been known and studied since the discovery of sequence learning. However, recently, implicit sequence learning has gained more attention and research. A form of implicit learning, implicit sequence learning refers to the underlying methods of learning that people are unaware of—in other words, learning without knowing. The exact properties and number of mechanisms of implicit learning are debated. Other forms of implicit sequence learning include motor sequence learning, temporal sequence learning, and associative sequence learning.\n\nSequence learning problems are used to better understand the different types of sequence learning. There are four basic sequence learning problems: sequence prediction, sequence generation, sequence recognition, and sequential decision making. These “problems” show how sequences are formulated. They show the patterns sequences follow and how these different sequence learning problems are related to each other.\n\nSequence prediction attempts to predict the next immediate element of a sequence based on all the preceding elements. Sequence generation is basically the same as sequence prediction: an attempt to piece together a sequence one by one the way it naturally occurs. Sequence recognition takes certain criteria and determines whether the sequence is legitimate. Sequential decision making or sequence generation through actions breaks down into three variations: goal-oriented, trajectory-oriented, and reinforcement-maximizing. These three variations all want to pick the action(s) or step(s) that will lead to the goal in the future.\n\nThese sequence learning problems reflect hierarchical organization of plans because each element in the sequences builds on the previous elements.\n\nIn a classic experiment published in 1967, Alfred L. Yarbus demonstrated that though subjects viewing portraits reported apprehending the portrait as a whole, their eye movements successively fixated on the most informative parts of the image. These observations suggest that underlying an apparently parallel process of face perception, a serial oculomotor process is concealed. It is a common observation that when a skill is being acquired, we are more attentive in the initial phase, but after repeated practice, the skill becomes nearly automatic; this is also known as unconscious competence. We can then concentrate on learning a new action while performing previously learned actions skillfully. Thus, it appears that a neural code or representation for the learned skill is created in our brain, which is usually called procedural memory. The procedural memory encodes procedures or algorithms rather than facts.\n\nThere are many other areas of application for sequence learning. How humans learn sequential procedures has been a long-standing research problem in cognitive science and currently is a major topic in neuroscience. Research work has been going on in several disciplines, including artificial intelligence, neural networks, and engineering.\nFor a philosophical perspective, see Inductive reasoning and Problem of induction.\nFor a theoretical computer-science perspective, see Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference and Inductive programming.\nFor a mathematical perspective, see Extrapolation.\n\n"}

They can be found in the states of Selangor, Pahang, Johor, Negeri Sembilan and Malacca. The Temuans are classified as part of Orang Asli group according to the Malaysian government. They are also one of the largest (numbering to almost 30,000 people) and the most widespread of the Orang Asli ethnic groups.\n\nThey speak Temuan, an Austronesian language closely related to Malay. Like other indigenous tribes in Malaysia, most Temuans live in poverty.\n\nThe changes in the population of the Temuan people in Malaysia:-\n\nThousands of years ago, many Temuan people died because they had committed \"Celau\" (the sins that angered god and their ancestors; as it is also called \"Talan\" in Semaq Beri language). Their god has sent a \"Celau\" punishment in a form of a great flood which had drowned all the Temuan sinners that day. Only two of the Temuans, named \"Mamak\" and \"Inak Bungsuk\" survived that day by climbing at Eaglewood tree at \"Gunung Raja\" (Royal Mountain) located at the border of Selangor and Pahang state. There was a Temuan village over there named Kampung Orang Asli Pertak. \"Mamak\" and \"Inak Bungsuk\" survived because they had an enchanting mantra or spell to ease down the \"Celau\" storm. \"Gunung Gajak\" (Gunung Rajah, Pahang, Malaysia) became the birth places and ancestral home of the Temuan tribe.\n\n\"Mamak Bungsuk\" (Adam) and \"Inak Bungsuk\" (Eve) are the Temuan analogues of Adam and Eve in the myth of the birth of humanity.\n\nThe Temuans have their own language called the Temuan language or \"Bahasak Temuan\". It is distinct but closely related to the Malay language spoken by their Malay neighbours. The Temuan language is a Malayan language spoken by the majority of the Temuan people. It is essentially a spoken language with several dialectal variation. Temuan is divided into two major dialects namely \"Belandas\" and \"Mantra\" which differs mostly in terms of phonology and also some of the vocabulary but still mutually intelligible to one another. Temuan is mostly written in the Latin alphabet although no standard orthography has been made.\n\nExample of Temuan Belandas dialect: \"diak\" (he/she), \"hajak\" (only), \"kitak\" (we), \"tai\" (the end of sentence particle).\n\nExample of Temuan Mantra dialect: \"dien\" (he/she), \"hajen\" (only), \"kiten\" (we), \"tea\" (the end of sentence particle).\n\nA basic traditional Temuan belief is that their God and ancestors are always present with them, guarding their safety.\n\nAt the end of every year, the Temuans celebrate \"Aik Gayak Muyang\" (Ancestor Day in English). This celebration is to thank their God and ancestors for the crops they grow and for the peaceful life they have had.\n\nThe Temuans believe they were placed on the earth (\"Tanah Tujuh\") by \"Muyang\" (God) to be guardians of the rain forest and that if they fail in their sacred duty, the whole world will turn upside down and humanity will perish. Each river, hill, stream, rock, tree and shrub is animated by a guardian spirit. Rivers are guarded by dragons (\"naga\") and snakes (\"ular\") which often cause mayhem if their homes are desecrated.\n\nThe Temuan’s culture reflects their belief in these nature spirits. Their animism takes the form of taboos, herbal remedies, ritual ceremonies and magic. They have \"dukun\" (healers) and a village \"bomoh\" (shaman) who, when in a trance state, communicates with the nature spirits. It is the shaman who leads the tribe in the annual \"sawai\" or \"sewang\" - an ancient earth healing ritual to honour their ancestors and appease the guardian spirits.\n\nAlthough today the Temuans mostly adhere to their animistic beliefs, the rest have now largely converted to either Christianity or Islam. This happens especially when Temuans married with people outside of their ethnic groups, whether it's with the Malays, Chinese or other ethnic groups in the country.\n\nThe Temuan celebrate \"Aik Muyang\" (Ancestor Day) at the end of the year and the beginning of new year. \"Aik Muyang\" honoring their ancestor for giving them good life and save from \"Celau\" (storm). The celebration take place in different day between 15 December to 15 January.\n\nList of places and its \"Aik Gayak Muyang\" celebration dates:-\n\n\"Gogo\" (\"Bogeng\") is village ceremonial dancing. When the Temuan get married their will organised \"Gogo\" at between 8 p.m until 7 a.m the next day. The live band will played the music and every people from other village join to dance.\n\nSome traditional superstitions still held by Temuans:\n\n\nTypical Temuan food are usually cooked in bamboo. Temuan dishes are such as:-\n\nThe Temuan people also possess knowledge in traditional medicine. There also those from the city folks who would seek consultation from the Orang Asli to cure their illness and problems. Among of the illness that the Temuan shaman could cure are such as fever, diarrhea, blood clot, kidney disease and many more by using herbs or animal based medicine. Examples of herbs used:-\n\nIt is also known that the Temuan people themselves have begun to cultivate some of the herbs as an indication of the common health problems faced by them. Examples of such species that have been cultivated by the Temuan people instead of gathering them from the wild are:-\n\nThe common method of administering the herbs by the Temuan people are by consuming the decoction of the roots orally, such as the Polyalthia bullata, Andrographis paniculata, Parkia speciosa, Zingiber officinale and many more. Other methods of administering the herbs includes eating, rubbing, chewing, bathing, shampooing and poultice. Some herbs have multiple methods of administering its medicinal properties to treat for different illness. For example, root decoction of Alpinia conchigera is used as a shampoo to clean fleas on the head, its leaves are used as poultice to treat boils and post-childbirth swelling on the stomach, while its rhizome can be pounded as rubbing for bone ache, and also powdered to be mixed with water as poultice for stomach ache.\n\nThere are also many of the city folks that uses \"Love potion\" (\"Minyak pengasih\", literally means \"Love oil\") from the Orang Asli shamans. \"Minyak pengasih\" are among the most popular item obtained from the services of the Orang Asli shamans. The function of the oil is to regain the feelings of lost love ones.\n\nSome of the settlements that the Temuan people are located includes:-\n\n\n"}

She studied under the direction of the Sisters of St. Joseph at a private French school in Thessaloniki, and later by the same Order in Athens. She learned French fluently. When she was a teenager, her father left the family and she continued to live with her mother. Her father died in a car accident in 1971.\n\nIn 1951 she was accepted at the Greek National Theater (\"Eθνικό Θέατρο\"), where she studied in the Drama School. The playwright Angelos Terzakis and the director Dimitris Rontiris were among her teachers. Upon graduation, in 1954, she was immediately thrust into starring roles in the theatre, playing alongside actors such as Alexis Minotis and Katina Paxinou. \n\nHer stage debut was in the Marika Kotopouli theatre in the French comedy, \"La belle Heléne\", with Melina Mercouri and Vasilis Diamantopoulos. In 1955, Karezi made her cinema debut in the Alekos Sakellarios' comedy, \"Laterna, ftoheia kai filotimo\" in 1955, a massive success just like its sequel, \"Laterna, ftoheia kai garyfallo\" in 1957. For the soundtrack of the 1959 film \"To nisi ton genneon\" she recorded a song by future Academy Award-winner Manos Hadjidakis, \"Min ton rotas ton ourano\" (\"Do not ask the sky\").\n\nHer career flourished in the 1960s, when she headed her own theater troupe in 1961 and starred in some of the most classic movies of the Greek cinema, like \"Lola\" (1964), \"Mia trelli ... trelli oikogeneia\" (1965), \"Tzeni-Tzeni\" (1966), and \"Kontserto gia polyvola\" (1967). Her greatest film success was \"Ta kokkina fanaria\" (\"The Red Lanterns\"; 1963), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. \n\nHer last film appearance was in Aristophanes' \"Lysistrata\" (1972). Over the following decade, she continued to produce and star in such stage classics as \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", \"Medea\" and \"Electra\". She appeared for the last time in theatre in 1990 in Loula Anagnostaki's play, \"Diamonds and the blues\"; suffering from terminal breast cancer, she was in great pain and had to leave the show.\n\nIn May 1962 Karezi wed a journalist, Zahos Hadjifotiou, but this marriage ended in divorce two years later. In 1967, during the filming of \"Kontserto gia polyvola\", she met Kostas Kazakos, with whom she had her only child, Konstantinos Kazakos. They formed a popular duo and Karezi's repertoire shifted to more sophisticated and intellectual plays. They were led to prison where they spent several nights due to the play \"To megalo mas tsirko\" (\"Our Big Circus\") in 1973, which insulted the Greek dictatorship (1967–74).\n\nTzeni Karezi died on 27 July 1992 from cancer at her home and buried at a public expense. She was believed to be 58 years old, although some sources gave her age as 56 or 60. Thousands were present to attend her funeral. \n\nAs a victim of metastatic cancer, she asked those close to her to make palliative care better known and to assist in its development so others suffering painful diseases or ailments could be able to live through their last days with dignity. After her death, her wish materialized and her family founded the Tzeni Karezi Foundation.\n\n"}
{"id": "41048019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41048019", "title": "Unconscious inference", "text": "Unconscious inference\n\nUnconscious inference (German: unbewusster Schluss), also referred to as unconscious conclusion, is a term of perceptual psychology coined in 1867 by the German physicist and polymath Hermann von Helmholtz to describe an involuntary, pre-rational and reflex-like mechanism which is part of the formation of visual impressions. While precursory notions have been identified in the writings of Thomas Hobbes, Robert Hooke, and Francis North (especially in connection with auditory perception) as well as in Francis Bacon's \"Novum Organum\", Helmholtz's theory was long ignored or even dismissed by philosophy and psychology. It has since received new attention from modern research, and the work of recent scholars has approached Helmholtz's view.\n\nIn the third and final volume of his \"Handbuch der physiologischen Optik\" (1856–67, translated as \"Treatise on Physiological Optics\" in 1920-25), Helmholtz discussed the psychological effects of visual perception. His first example is that of the illusion of the sun rotating around the earth:\n\nWe are unable to do away with such optical illusions by convincing ourselves rationally that our eyes have played tricks on us: obstinately and unswervingly, the mechanism follows its own rule and thus wields an imperious mastery over the human mind. While optical illusions are the most obvious instances of unconscious inference, people's perceptions of each other are similarly influenced by such unintended, unconscious conclusions. Helmholtz's second example refers to theatrical performance, arguing that the strong emotional effect of a play results mainly from the viewers' inability to doubt the visual impressions generated by unconscious inference:\n\nThe mere sight of another person is sufficient to produce an emotional attitude without any reasonable basis whatsoever, yet highly resilient against all rational criticism. Obviously, the impression is based on the spontaneous, spurious attribution of traits - a process we can hardly avoid, for the human eye, so to speak, is \"incapable of doubt\" and thus cannot ward off the impression.\n\nThe formation of visual impressions, Helmholtz realized, is achieved primarily by unconscious judgments, the results of which \"can never once be elevated to the plane of conscious judgments\" and thus \"lack the purifying and scrutinizing work of conscious thinking\". In spite of this, the results of unconscious judgments are so impervious to conscious control, so resistant to contradiction that they are \"impossible to get rid of\" and \"the effect of them cannot be overcome\". So whatever impressions this unconscious inference process leads to, they strike \"our consciousness as a foreign and overpowering force of nature\".\n\nThe reason, Helmholtz suggested, lies in the way visual sensory impressions are processed neurologically. The higher cortical centres responsible for conscious deliberation are not involved in the formation of visual impressions. However, as the process is spontaneous and automatic, we are unable to account for just how we arrived at our judgments. Through our eyes, we necessarily \"perceive things as real\", for the results of the unconscious conclusions are interpretations which \"are urged on our consciousness, so to speak, as if an external power had constrained us, over which our will has no control\".\n\nIn recognizing these attitude-formation mechanisms underlying the human processing of nonverbal cues, Helmholtz anticipated developments in science by more than a century. As Daniel Gilbert has pointed out, \"Helmholtz presaged many current thinkers not only by postulating the existence of such [unconscious inferential] operations, but also by describing their general features\". At the same time, he added, it is \"probably fair to say that Helmholtz's ideas about the social inference process have exerted no impact whatsoever on social psychology\". Indeed, psychologists have largely felt that Helmholtz had fallen prey to an error in reasoning. As Edwin G. Boring summed up the debate, \"Since an inference is ostensibly a conscious process and can therefore be neither unconscious nor immediate, [Helmholtz's] view was rejected as self-contradictory\". However, several recent authors have since approached Helmholtz's conception under a variety of headings, such as \"snap judgments\", \"nonconscious social information processing\", \"spontaneous trait inference\", \"people as flexible interpreters\", and \"unintended thought\". Siegfried Frey has pointed out the revolutionary quality of Helmholtz's proposition that it is from the perceiver, not the actor, whence springs the meaning-attribution process performed when we interpret a nonverbal stimulus:\n\nWork in computer science has made use of Helmholtz ideas of unconscious inference by suggesting the cortex contains a generative model of the world. They develop a statistical method for discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns:\n\nThe Free energy principle provides an explanation for embodied perception in neuroscience and\ntries to explain how biological systems maintain order by restricting themselves to a limited number of states or beliefs about hidden states in their environment. A biological system performs active inference in sampling action outcomes to maximise the evidence for its model of the world:\n\n"}

It is the native language of the Welayta people. The estimates of the population vary greatly because it is not agreed where the boundaries of the language are.\n\nThere are conflicting claims about how widely Wolaytta is spoken. The Ethnologue identifies one smaller dialect region: Zala. Some hold that Melo, Oyda, and Gamo-Gofa-Dawro are also dialects, but most authorities, including Ethnologue and ISO 639-3 now list these as separate languages. The different communities of speakers also recognize them as separate languages. A variety called \"Laha\" is said to be 'close' to Wolaytta in Hayward (1990) but listed as a distinct language by Blench; however, it is not included in \"Ethnologue\".\n\nWolaytta has existed in written form since the 1940s, when the Sudan Interior Mission first devised a system for writing it. The writing system was later revised by a team led by Dr. Bruce Adams. They finished the New Testament in 1981 and the entire Bible in 2002. It was one of the first languages the Derg selected for their literacy campaign (1979–1991), before any other southern languages. Welaytta pride in their written language led to a fiercely hostile response in 1998 when the Ethiopian government distributed textbooks written in Wegagoda – an artificial language based on amalgamating Wolaytta with several closely related languages. As a result the textbooks in Wegagoda were withdrawn and teachers returned to ones in Wolaytta.\n\nIn speaking their language, the Wolaytta people use many proverbs. A large collection of them, in Ethiopian script, was published in 1987 (Ethiopian calendar) by the Academy of Ethiopian Languages. Fikre Alemayehu's 2012 MA thesis from Addis Ababa University provides an analysis of Wolaytta proverbs and their functions.\n\n\nBalta, Borodda, Ganta, Otschollo, Uba.\n\nThe language is the official language in the Wolayita Zone of Ethiopia. The Ethnologue cites statistics that 5% to 25% of the population are literate in this language. Portions of the Bible were produced in 1934, the New Testament in 1981, and the entire Bible in 2002.\n\nWakasa (2008) gives the following consonant phonemes for Wolaytta. Items in show Wakasa's practical alphabet, where this differs from the IPA:\n\nTwo consonants require further discussion. The sound written is described by Wakasa (2008:44) as a 'nasalized glottal fricative'; it is said to be extremely rare, occurring in only one common noun, an interjection, and two proper names. The status of the sound written is apparently in dispute; Adams (1983:48) and Lamberti and Sottile (1997:23, 25-26) claim that it is implosive, thus presumably . Wakasa (2008:62) denies that this consonant is implosive, and calls it 'glottalized'. (See implosive for more on such discrepancies.)\n\nWolaytta has five vowels, which appear both long and short:\n\nLike other Omotic languages, the Wolaytta language has the basic word order SOV (subject–object–verb), as shown in the following example (Wakasa 2008:1041):\n\nIt has postpositional phrases, which precede the verb (Wakasa 2008:1042):\n\nNouns used adjectivally precede the nouns that they modify (Wakasa 2008:1044)\n\nNumerals precede the nouns that they quantify over (Wakasa 2008:1045)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16084275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16084275", "title": "Women in Bhutan", "text": "Women in Bhutan\n\nEconomic development has increased opportunities for women to participate in fields such as medicine, both as physicians and nurses; teaching; and administration. By 1989 nearly 10 percent of government employees were women, and the top civil service examination graduate in 1989 was a woman. During their government careers, women civil servants were allowed three months maternity leave with full pay for three deliveries and leave without pay for any additional deliveries.\n\nReflecting the dominance of males in society, girls were outnumbered three to two in primary and secondary-level schools. With many pro-women organizations on the rise including CSO, MBO etc. women have been seen to be contributing towards livelihoods of individual families. For instance SABAH-Bhutan tries to empower women in earning through weaving, tailoring food processing and other economic activities, thereby making women participate in earning for the family(s).\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011, recruitment and retention of Tshogpas, or local government council members, remained a serious issue. Obstacles range from lack of interest and lack of economic incentives to difficulty in compliance and obtaining accreditation under existing election laws. The functional literacy and skills test alone left many constituencies without the minimum of two candidates, leading to lengthy delay of the local government elections of 2011, originally slated for 2008.\n\nThe first round of the functional literacy and skills test left many Gewogs with no representatives, though second round results showed a pass rate over 90%. Although women elected to office remained relatively few (14% before local elections according to the UNHCR), more than half of voters in initial local government elections were women. In initial local-level voting in 2011, voter turnout was about 50%. This has raised the question of whether women would benefit from quotas in public service, highlighting the need to encourage further female electoral and political participation.\n\nWomen in the 1980s played a significant role in the agricultural work force, where they outnumbered men, who were leaving for the service sector and other urban industrial and commercial activities. In the mid-1980s, 95 percent of all Bhutanese women from the ages of fifteen to sixty-four years were involved in agricultural work, compared with only 78 percent of men in the same age range. Foreign observers have noted that women shared equally with men in farm labor. Overall, women were providing more labor than men in all sectors of the economy. Less than 4 percent of the total female work force was unemployed, compared with nearly 10 percent of men who had no occupation.\n\nThe government founded the National Women's Association of Bhutan in 1981 primarily to improve the socioeconomic status of women, particularly those in rural areas. The association, at its inaugural session, declared that it would not push for equal rights for women because the women of Bhutan had already come to \"enjoy equal status with men politically, economically, and socially.\" To give prominence to the association, the Druk Gyalpo's sister, Ashi Sonam Chhoden Wangchuck, was appointed its president. Starting in 1985, the association became a line item in the government budget and was funded at Nu2.4 million in fiscal year 1992. The association has organized annual beauty contests featuring traditional arts and culture, fostered training in health and hygiene, distributed yarn and vegetable seeds, and introduced smokeless stoves in villages.\n\nThe traditional practice, arranged marriages based on family and ethnic ties, had been replaced in the late twentieth century with marriages based on mutual affection. Marriages were usually arranged by the partners in contemporary Bhutan, and the minimum age was sixteen for women and twenty-one for men. The institution of child marriage, once relatively widespread, largely declined as Bhutan modernized, and there were only remnants of the practice in the late twentieth century.\n\nInterethnic marriages, once forbidden, were encouraged in the late 1980s by an incentive of a Nu10,000 government stipend to willing couples. The stipend was discontinued in 1991. Marriages of Bhutanese citizens to foreigners have been discouraged. Bhutanese with foreign spouses were not allowed to obtain civil service positions and could have their government scholarships cancelled and be required to repay portions already received. Foreign spouses were not entitled to citizenship by right but had to apply for naturalization.\n\nPolyandry is rare and can still be found for instance among the Brokpas of Merak-Sakten. A woman married by custom to several husbands will, however, be granted only one marriage certificate according to law. Polygamy in Bhutan was restricted in the mid-twentieth century. Through the 1990s the law still allowed a man as many as three wives, providing he had the first wife's permission. The first wife also had the power to sue for divorce and alimony if she did not agree. In the 1980s, divorce was common, and newer laws provided better benefits to women seeking alimony.\n\nFamily life, both traditionally and through the end of the 20th century, was likely to provide for a fair amount of self-sufficiency. Families, for example, often made their own clothing, bedding, floor and seat covers, tablecloths, and decorative items for daily and religious use. Wool was the primary material, but domestic silk and imported cotton were also used in weaving colorful cloth, often featuring elaborate geometric, floral, and animal designs. Although weaving was normally done by women of all ages using family-owned looms, monks sometimes did embroidery and appliqué work. In the twentieth century, weaving was possibly as predominant a feature of daily life as it was at the time of Bhutan's unification in the seventeenth century.\n\nLandholdings varied depending on the wealth and size of individual families, but most families had as much land as they could farm using traditional techniques. A key element of family life was the availability of labor. Thus, the choice of the home of newlyweds was determined by which parental unit had the greatest need of supplemental labor. If both families had a sufficient supply of labor, then a bride and groom might elect to set up their own home.<\n\n"}
