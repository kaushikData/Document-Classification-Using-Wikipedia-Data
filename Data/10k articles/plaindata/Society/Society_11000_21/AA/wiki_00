In total, 11 different locations were targeted. In Trollhättan a road was barricaded and rocks were thrown at police.The unidentified assailants were described as \"youth\". There were no injured persons and nobody was apprehended at the scenes. In Trollhättan, Police had \"concerned dialogues\" with youths that were at the scene without taking part and with their parents. The following day, two individuals were arrested on suspicion of aggravated arson. The following night, five cars were set on fire in Mölndal, Borås, Vänersborg and Frölunda. A third suspect, 18 years old, was arrested in Turkey when he tried to enter that country.He had planned to travel to Antalya, but was stopped at the border to Turkey as police in Sweden had issued an alert which prevented his entry ot that country and he was locked into a cell in the transit area. He was later transferred to Denmark.\n\nSwedish prime minister Stefan Löfven visited the affected Tynnered district.\n\nA 20-year-old suspect was detained for three months but was released.\n\nIn November 2018 a suspect described as young and male was arrested for participation in the extensive vandalism.\n"}

They live mostly in Turkey, Egypt, and in Karachay-Cherkessia and Stavropol Krai in the North Caucasus region of Russia.\n\nThe Abazin originally inhabited the Sadzen region in the western part of Abkhazia and migrated from Abkhazia to Abazinia in 14th and 15th centuries. They later migrated to various regions of the former Ottoman Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since the late 18th century, their dominant religion is Sunni Islam (Hanafi). \n\nAbaza people speak the Abaza language, a Northwest Caucasian language closely related to Abkhaz and Circassian. There are two dialects of Abaza spoken in Karachay-Cherkessia: \"Ashkharua\" and \"Tapanta\". The culture and traditions of the Abazin are similar to those of the Circassians. On many old maps Abazin territory is marked as part of Circassia (Adygea). \n\nAccording to the 2010 Russian census, there were 43,341 Abazins in Russia. An Abazin diaspora exists in Turkey Egypt, and in Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan and Syria, most of which are descendants of muhajirs from the Caucasian War with the Russian Empire.\n\nThere is a significant Abazin presence in Turkey.

{"id": "462469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462469", "title": "Arabic literature", "text": "Arabic literature\n\nArabic literature ( / ALA-LC: \"al-Adab al-‘Arabī\") is the writing, both prose and poetry, produced by writers in the Arabic language. The Arabic word used for literature is \"Adab\", which is derived from a meaning of etiquette, and which implies politeness, culture and enrichment.\n\nArabic literature emerged in the 5th century with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The Qur'an, widely regarded by people as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language, would have the greatest lasting effect on Arabic culture and its literature. Arabic literature flourished during the Islamic Golden Age, but has remained vibrant to the present day, with poets and prose-writers across the Arab world, as well as rest of the world, achieving increasing success.\n\nThe Qur'an had a significant influence on the Arab language. The language used in it is called classical Arabic, and while modern Arabic is very similar, the classical has social prestige. Not only is the Qur'an the first work of any significant length written in the language it also has a far more complicated structure than the earlier literary works with its 114 suras (chapters) which contain 6,236 ayat (verses). It contains injunctions, narratives, homilies, parables, direct addresses from God, instructions and even comments on itself on how it will be received and understood. It is also, paradoxically, admired for its layers of metaphor as well as its clarity, a feature it mentions itself in sura 16:103.\n\nThe word Qur'an means 'recite', and in early times the text was transmitted orally. The first attempt at an authentic written version was during the reign of the third 'Rightly Guided Caliph', Uthman (576-656).\n\nAlthough it contains elements of both prose and poetry, and therefore is closest to \"Saj\" or rhymed prose, the Qur'an is regarded as entirely apart from these classifications. The text is believed to be divine revelation and is seen by Muslims as being eternal or 'uncreated'. This leads to the doctrine of i'jaz or inimitability of the Qur'an which implies that nobody can copy the work's style.\n\nThis doctrine of i'jaz possibly had a slight limiting effect on Arabic literature; proscribing exactly what could be written. Whilst Islam allows Muslims to write, read and recite poetry, the Qur'an states in the 26th sura (Ash-Shu'ara or The Poets) that poetry which is blasphemous, obscene, praiseworthy of sinful acts or attempts to challenge the Qu'ran's content and form is forbidden for Muslims.\n\nThis may have exerted dominance over the pre-Islamic poets of the 6th century whose popularity may have vied with the Qur'an amongst the people. There were a marked lack of significant poets until the 8th century. One notable exception was Hassan ibn Thabit who wrote poems in praise of Muhammad and was known as the \"prophet's poet\". Just as the Bible has held an important place in the literature of other languages, The Qur'an is important to Arabic. It is the source of many ideas, allusions and quotes and its moral message informs many works.\n\nAside from the Qur'an the \"hadith\" or tradition of what Muhammed is supposed to have said and done are important literature. The entire body of these acts and words are called \"sunnah\" or way and the ones regarded as \"sahih\" or genuine of them are collected into hadith. Some of the most significant collections of hadith include those by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari.\n\nThe other important genre of work in Qur'anic study is the \"tafsir\" or commentaries Arab writings relating to religion also includes many sermons and devotional pieces as well as the sayings of Ali which were collected in the 10th century as \"Nahj al-Balaghah\" or \"The Peak of Eloquence\".\n\nThe research into the life and times of Muhammad, and determining the genuine parts of the sunnah, was an important early reason for scholarship in or about the Arabic language. It was also the reason for the collecting of pre-Islamic poetry; as some of these poets were close to the prophet—Labid actually meeting Muhammad and converting to Islam—and their writings illuminated the times when these events occurred. Muhammad also inspired the first Arabic biographies, known as \"al-sirah al-nabawiyyah\"; the earliest was by Wahb ibn Munabbih, but Muhammad ibn Ishaq wrote the best known. Whilst covering the life of the prophet they also told of the battles and events of early Islam and have numerous digressions on older biblical traditions.\n\nSome of the earliest work studying the Arabic language was started in the name of Islam. Tradition has it that the caliph Ali, after reading a copy of Qur'an with errors in it, asked Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali to write a work codifying Arabic grammar. Khalil ibn Ahmad would later write \"Kitab al-Ayn\", the first dictionary of Arabic, along with works on prosody and music, and his pupil Sibawayh would produce the most respected work of Arabic grammar known simply as \"al-Kitab\" or \"The Book\".\n\nOther caliphs exerted their influence on Arabic with 'Abd al-Malik making it the official language for administration of the new empire, and al-Ma'mun setting up the \"Bayt al-Hikma\" or House of Wisdom in Baghdad for research and translations. Basrah and Kufah were two other important seats of learning in the early Arab world, between which there was a strong rivalry.\n\nThe institutions set up mainly to investigate more fully the Islamic religion were invaluable in studying many other subjects. Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik was instrumental in enriching the literature by instructing scholars to translate works into Arabic. The first was probably Aristotle's correspondence with Alexander the Great translated by Salm Abu al-'Ala'. From the east, and in a very different literary genre, the scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa translated the animal fables of the \"Panchatantra\". These translations would keep alive scholarship and learning, particularly that of ancient Greece, during the Dark Ages in Europe and the works would often be first re-introduced to Europe from the Arabic versions.\n\nA large proportion of Arabic literature before the 20th century is in the form of poetry, and even prose from this period is either filled with snippets of poetry or is in the form of \"saj'\" or rhymed prose. The themes of the poetry range from high-flown hymns of praise to bitter personal attacks and from religious and mystical ideas to poems on women and wine. An important feature of the poetry which would be applied to all of the literature was the idea that it must be pleasing to the ear. The poetry and much of the prose was written with the design that it would be spoken aloud and great care was taken to make all writing as mellifluous as possible.\n\nIn the late 9th century Ibn al-Nadim, a Baghdadi bookseller, compiled a crucial work in the study of Arabic literature. \"Kitab al-Fihrist\" is a catalogue of all books available for sale in Baghdad and it gives an overview of the state of the literature at that time.\n\nOne of the most common forms of literature during the Abbasid period was the compilation. These were collections of facts, ideas, instructive stories and poems on a single topic and covers subjects as diverse as house and garden, women, gate-crashers, blind people, envy, animals and misers. These last three compilations were written by al-Jahiz the acknowledged master of the form. These collections were important for any \"nadim\", a companion to a ruler or noble whose role was often involved regaling the ruler with stories and information to entertain or advise.\n\nA type of work closely allied to the collection was the manual in which writers like ibn Qutaybah offered instruction in subjects like etiquette, how to rule, how to be a bureaucrat and even how to write. Ibn Qutaybah also wrote one of the earliest histories of the Arabs, drawing together biblical stories, Arabic folk tales and more historical events.\n\nThe subject of sex was frequently investigated in Arabic literature. The \"ghazal\" or love poem had a long history being at times tender and chaste and at other times rather explicit. In the Sufi tradition the love poem would take on a wider, mystical and religious importance. Sex manuals were also written such as \"The Perfumed Garden\", \"Ṭawq al-Ḥamāmah\" or \"The Dove's Neckring\" by ibn Hazm and \"Nuzhat al-albab fi-ma la yujad fi kitab\" or \"Delight of Hearts Concerning What will Never Be Found in a Book\" by Ahmad al-Tifashi. Countering such works are one like \"Rawdat al-muhibbin wa-nuzhat al-mushtaqin\" or \"Meadow of Lovers and Diversion of the Infatuated\" by ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah who advises on how to separate love and lust and avoid sin.\n\nAside from the early biographies of Muhammad, the first major biographer to weigh character rather than just producing a hymn of praise was al-Baladhuri with his \"Kitab ansab al-ashraf\" or \"Book of the Genealogies of the Noble\", a collection of biographies. Another important biographical dictionary was begun by ibn Khallikan and expanded by al-Safadi and one of the first significant autobiographies was \"Kitab al-I'tibar\" which told of Usamah ibn Munqidh and his experiences in fighting in the Crusades. This time period saw the emergence of the genre of \"tabaqat\" (biographical dictionaries or biographical compendia).\n\nIbn Khurdadhbih, an official in the postal service wrote one of the first travel books and the form remained a popular one in Arabic literature with books by ibn Hawqal, ibn Fadlan, al-Istakhri, al-Muqaddasi, al-Idrisi and most famously the travels of ibn Battutah. These give a view of the many cultures of the wider Islamic world and also offer Muslim perspectives on the non-Muslim peoples on the edges of the empire. They also indicated just how great a trading power the Muslim peoples had become. These were often sprawling accounts that included details of both geography and history.\n\nSome writers concentrated solely on history like al-Ya'qubi and al-Tabari, whilst others focused on a small portion of history such as ibn al-Azraq, with a history of Mecca, and ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur, writing a history of Baghdad. The historian regarded as the greatest of all Arabic historians though is ibn Khaldun whose history \"Muqaddimah\" focuses on society and is a founding text in sociology and economics.\n\nIn the medieval Near East, Arabic diaries were first being written from before the 10th century, though the medieval diary which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna in the 11th century. His diary was the earliest to be arranged in order of date (\"ta'rikh\" in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.\n\nLiterary criticism in Arabic literature often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of hermeneutics and textual exegesis have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of Islamic literature.\n\nLiterary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval Arabic poetry and literature from the 9th century, notably by Al-Jahiz in his \"al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin\" and \"al-Hayawan\", and by Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz in his \"Kitab al-Badi\".\n\nIn the Arab world, there was a great distinction between \"al-fus'ha\" (quality language) and \"al-ammiyyah\" (language of the common people). Not many writers would write works in this \"al-ammiyyah\" or common language and it was felt that literature had to be improving, educational and with purpose rather than just entertainment. This did not stop the common role of the \"hakawati\" or story-teller who would retell the entertaining parts of more educational works or one of the many Arabic fables or folk-tales, which were often not written down in many cases. Nevertheless, some of the earliest novels, including the first philosophical novels, were written by Arabic authors.\n\nThe most famous example of Arabic fiction is the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"). It is easily the best known of all Arabic literature, and still affects many of the ideas non-Arabs have about Arabic culture. A good example of the lack of popular Arabic prose fiction is that the stories of Aladdin and Ali Baba, usually regarded as part of the \"Tales from One Thousand and One Nights\", were not actually part of the \"Tales\". They were first included in French translation of the \"Tales\" by Antoine Galland who heard them being told by a traditional storyteller and only existed in incomplete Arabic manuscripts before that. The other great character from Arabic literature Sinbad is from the \"Tales\".\n\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" is usually placed in the genre of Arabic epic literature along with several other works. They are usually collections of short stories or episodes strung together into a long tale. The extant versions were mostly written down relatively late on, after the 14th century, although many were undoubtedly collected earlier and many of the original stories are probably pre-Islamic. Types of stories in these collections include animal fables, proverbs, stories of \"jihad\" or propagation of the faith, humorous tales, moral tales, tales about the wily con-man Ali Zaybaq and tales about the prankster Juha.\n\nMaqama not only straddles the divide between prose and poetry, being instead a form of rhymed prose, it is also part way between fiction and non-fiction. Over a series of short narratives, which are fictionalised versions of real life situations, different ideas are contemplated. A good example of this is a maqama on musk, which purports to compare the feature of different perfumes but is in fact a work of political satire comparing several competing rulers. Maqama also makes use of the doctrine of \"badi\" or deliberately adding complexity to display the writer's dexterity with language. Al-Hamadhani is regarded as the originator of the maqama and his work was taken up by Abu Muhammad al-Qasim al-Hariri with one of al-Hariri's maqama a study of al-Hamadhani own work. Maqama was an incredibly popular form of Arabic literature, being one of the few forms which continued to be written during the decline of Arabic in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nA famous example of romantic Arabic poetry is \"Layla and Majnun\", dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century. It is a tragic story of undying love. \"Layla and Majnun\" is considered part of the platonic Love (Arabic: حب عذري) genre, so-called because the couple never marry or consummate their relationship, that is prominent in Arabic literature, though the literary motif is found throughout the world. Other famous Virgin Love stories include \"Qays and Lubna\", \"Kuthair and Azza\", \"Marwa and al-Majnun al-Faransi\" and \"Antara and Abla\".\n\nThe 10th century \"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\" features a fictional anecdote of a \"prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast and, drunk, spends the night in a cemetery, confusing a corpse with his bride. The story is used as a gnostic parable of the soul's pre-existence and return from its terrestrial \".\n\nAnother medieval Arabic love story was \"Hadith Bayad wa Riyad\" (\"The Story of Bayad and Riyad\"), a 13th-century Arabic love story. The main characters of the tale are Bayad, a merchant's son and a foreigner from Damascus, and Riyad, a well-educated girl in the court of an unnamed Hajib (vizier or minister) of 'Iraq which is referred to as the lady. The \"Hadith Bayad wa Riyad\" manuscript is believed to be the only illustrated manuscript known to have survived from more than eight centuries of Muslim and Arab presence in Spain.\n\nMany of the tales in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" are also love stories or involve romantic love as a central theme. This includes the frame story of Scheherazade herself, and many of the stories she narrates, including \"Aladdin\", \"The Ebony Horse\", \"The Three Apples\", \"Tale of Tàj al-Mulúk and the Princess Dunyà: The Lover and the Loved\", \"Adi bin Zayd and the Princess Hind\", \"Di'ibil al-Khuza'i With the Lady and Muslim bin al-Walid\", \"The Three Unfortunate Lovers\", and others.\n\nThere were several elements of courtly love which were developed in Arabic literature, namely the notions of \"love for love's sake\" and \"exaltation of the beloved lady\" which have been traced back to Arabic literature of the 9th and 10th centuries. The notion of the \"ennobling power\" of love was developed in the early 11th century by the Persian psychologist and philosopher, Ibn Sina (known as \"Avicenna\" in Europe), in his Arabic treatise \"Risala fi'l-Ishq\" (\"Treatise on Love\"). The final element of courtly love, the concept of \"love as desire never to be fulfilled\", was also at times implicit in Arabic poetry.\n\nThe earliest known example of a whodunit murder mystery was \"The Three Apples\", one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"). In this tale, a fisherman discovers a heavy locked chest along the Tigris river and he sells it to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, who then has the chest broken open only to find inside it the dead body of a young woman who was cut into pieces. Harun orders his vizier, Ja'far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and find the murderererer within three days, or be executed if he fails his assignment. Suspense is generated through multiple plot twists that occur as the story progresses. This may thus be considered an archetype for detective fiction.\n\nIn Arabic poetry, the genre of satirical poetry was known as \"hija\". Satire was introduced into prose literature by the Afro-Arab author al-Jahiz in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as anthropology, sociology and psychology, he introduced a satirical approach, \"based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations.\" He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in \"hija\", satirical poetry. For example, in one of his zoological works, he satirized the preference for longer human penis size, writing: \"If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the (honorable tribe of) Quraysh\". Another satirical story based on this preference was an \"Arabian Nights\" tale called \"Ali with the Large Member\".\n\nIn the 10th century, the writer Tha'alibi recorded satirical poetry written by the poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's wide breadth of knowledge and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return. An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as \"a transgressor of the Sharia\" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term \"Farazdaq-like\" as a form of political satire.\n\nThe terms \"comedy\" and \"satire\" became synonymous after Aristotle's \"Poetics\" was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and Islamic philosophers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as \"hija\" (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troublous beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term \"comedy\" thus gained a new semantic meaning in Medieval literature.\n\nWhile puppet theatre and passion plays were popular in the medieval Islamic world, live theatre and drama has only been a visible part of Arabic literature in the modern era. There may have been a much longer theatrical tradition but it was probably not regarded as legitimate literature and mostly went unrecorded. There is an ancient tradition of public performance amongst Shi'i Muslims of a play depicting the life and death of al-Husayn at the battle of Karbala in 680 CE. There are also several plays composed by Shams al-din Muhammad ibn Daniyal in the 13th century when he mentions that older plays are getting stale and offers his new works as fresh material.\n\nThe most popular forms of theater in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as \"ta'ziya\", where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the \"shaheed\" (martyrdom) of Ali's sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Live secular plays were known as \"akhraja\", recorded in medieval \"adab\" literature, though they were less common than puppetry and \"ta'ziya\" theater.\n\nThe Moors had a noticeable influence on the works of George Peele and William Shakespeare. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\" and Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\", \"Titus Andronicus\" and \"Othello\", which featured a Moorish Othello as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from Morocco to Elizabethan England at the beginning of the 17th century, ignoring the fact that \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Titus Andronicus\" were both penned in the 16th century.\n\nThe Arab Islamic philosophers, Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis, were pioneers of the philosophical novel as they wrote the earliest novels dealing with philosophical fiction. Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" (\"Philosophus Autodidactus\") as a response to Al-Ghazali's \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\". This was followed by Ibn al-Nafis who wrote a fictional narrative \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a response to Ibn Tufail's \"Philosophus Autodidactus\". Both of these narratives had protagonists (Hayy in \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" and Kamil in \"Theologus Autodidactus\") who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" (until he meets a castaway named Absal), the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in \"Theologus Autodidactus\" (when castaways take him back to civilization with them), developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.\n\nIbn al-Nafis described his book \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a defense of \"the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world.\" He presents rational arguments for bodily resurrection and the immortality of the human soul, using both demonstrative reasoning and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysical claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali. Ibn al-Nafis' work was later translated into Latin and English as \"Theologus Autodidactus\" in the early 20th century.\n\nA Latin translation of Ibn Tufail's work, entitled \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger. The first English translation by Simon Ockley was published in 1708, and German and Dutch translations were also published at the time. These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write \"Robinson Crusoe\", which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the first novel in English. \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" also inspired Robert Boyle, an acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, \"The Aspiring Naturalist\", in the late 17th century. The story also anticipated Rousseau's \"Émile\" in some ways, and is also similar to the later story of Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" as well the character of Tarzan, in that a baby is abandoned in a deserted tropical island where he is taken care of and fed by a mother wolf. Other European writers influenced by \"Philosophus Autodidactus\" include John Locke, Gottfried Leibniz, Melchisédech Thévenot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, George Keith, Robert Barclay, the Quakers, and Samuel Hartlib.\n\n\"Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Sira al-Nabawiyyah\" (\"The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet's Biography\"), known in English as \"Theologus Autodidactus\" (which is a phonetic transliteration of the Greek name Θεολόγος Αὐτοδίδακτος, meaning self-taught theologian), written by the Arabian polymath Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), is the earliest known science fiction novel. While also being an early desert island story and coming of age story, the novel deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, apocalyptic themes, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection and the afterlife. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive scientific knowledge in anatomy, biology, physiology, astronomy, cosmology and geology. His main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain Islamic religious teachings in terms of science and philosophy. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al-Nafis introduces his scientific theory of metabolism, and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the pulmonary circulation in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as \"Theologus Autodidactus\" in the early 20th century.\n\nA number of stories within the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\") also feature science fiction elements. One example is \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In another \"Arabian Nights\" tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other \"Arabian Nights\" tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. \"The City of Brass\" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city. \"The Ebony Horse\" features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the \"Third Qalandar's Tale\" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman. \"The City of Brass\" and \"The Ebony Horse\" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.\n\nOther examples of early Arabic proto-science fiction include al-Farabi's \"Opinions of the residents of a splendid city\" about a utopian society, al-Qazwini's futuristic tale of \"Awaj bin Anfaq\" about a man who travelled to Earth from a distant planet, and elements such as the flying carpet.\n\nThe expansion of the Arab people in the 7th and 8th century brought them into contact with a variety of different peoples who would affect their culture. Most significant for literature was the Persia. Shu'ubiyya is the name of the conflict between the Arabs and Non-Arabs. Although producing heated debate amongst scholars and varying styles of literature, this was not a damaging conflict and had more to do with forging a single Islamic cultural identity. Bashshar ibn Burd, of Persian heritage, summed up his own stance in a few lines of poetry:\n\nThe cultural heritage of the desert dwelling Arabs continued to show its influence even though many scholars and writers were living in the large Arab cities. When Khalil ibn Ahmad enumerated the parts of poetry he called the line of verse a \"bayt\" or tent and \"sabah\" or tent-rope for a foot. Even during the 20th century this nostalgia for the simple desert life would appear or at least be consciously revived.\n\nA slow resurgence of the Persian language and a re-location of the government and main seat of learning to Baghdad, reduced the production of Arabic literature. Many Arabic themes and styles were taken up in Persian with Omar Khayyam, Attar and Rumi all clearly influenced by the earlier work. The Arabic language still initially retained its importance in politics and administration, although the rise of the Ottoman Empire confined it solely to religion. Alongside Persian, the many variants of the Turkic languages would dominate the literature of the Arab region until the 20th century. Nevertheless, some Arabic influences remained visible.\n\nDuring the 19th century, a revival took place in Arabic literature, along with much of Arabic culture, and is referred to in Arabic as \"al-Nahda\", which means \"the Renaissance\". This resurgence of writing in Arabic was confined mainly to Syria, Egypt and Lebanon until the 20th century when it spread to other countries in the region. This Renaissance was not only felt within the Arab world but also beyond, with a great interest in the translating of Arabic works into European languages. Although the use of the Arabic language was revived, particularly in poetry, many of the tropes of the previous literature which served to make it so ornate and complicated were dropped.\n\nJust as in the 8th century, when a movement to translate ancient Greek and other literature had helped vitalise Arabic literature, another translation movement would offer new ideas and material for Arabic. An early popular success was \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", which spurred a host of historical novels on Arabic subjects. Two important translators were Rifa'a al-Tahtawi and Jabra Ibrahim Jabra.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Arabic writers in both poetry and prose have reflected the changing political and social climate of the Arab world in their work. Anti-colonial themes were prominent early in the 20th century, with writers continuing to explore the region's relationship with the West until the present day. Internal political upheaval has also been a challenge, with some writers suffering censorship. There are many contemporary Arabic writers, such as Mahmoud saeed (Iraq) who wrote \"Bin Barka Ally\", and \"I Am The One Who Saw (Saddam City)\". Other contemporary writers include Sonallah Ibrahim and Abdul Rahman Munif, who were imprisoned by the state for their anti-government work. At the same time, others who had written works supporting or praising governments were promoted to positions of authority within cultural bodies. Non-fiction writers and academics have also produced political polemics and criticisms aiming to re-shape Arabic politics. Some of the best known are Taha Hussein's \"The Future of Culture in Egypt\", which was an important work of Egyptian nationalism, and the works of Nawal el-Saadawi who campaigns for women's rights.\n\nBeginning in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as part of what is now called \"the Arabic renaissance\" or \"al-Nahda\", poets like Francis Marrash, Ahmad Shawqi and Hafiz Ibrahim began to explore the possibility of developing the classical poetic forms. Some of these neoclassical poets were acquainted with Western literature but mostly continued to write in classical forms, while others, denouncing blind imitation of classical poetry and its recurring themes, sought inspiration from French or English romanticism.\n\nThe next generation of poets, the so-called romantic poets, had begun to a far greater extent to absorb the impact of developments in Western poetry, and felt constrained by neo-classical traditions which the previous generation had tried to uphold. The Mahjari poets were emigrants who mostly wrote in the Americas, but were similarly beginning to experiment further with the possibilities of Arabic poetry. This experimentation continued in the Middle East throughout the first half of the 20th century.\n\nAfter World War II, there was a largely unsuccessful movement by several poets to write poems in free verse (\"shi'r hurr\"). Iraqi poets Badr Shakir al-Sayyab and Nazik Al-Malaika (1923-2007), are considered to be the originators of free verse in Arabic poetry. Most of these experiments were abandoned in favour of prose poetry, of which the first examples in modern Arabic literature are to be found in the writings of Francis Marrash, and of which two of the most influential proponents were Nazik al-Malaika and Iman Mersal. The development of modernist poetry also influenced poetry in Arabic. More recently, poets such as Adunis have pushed the boundaries of stylistic experimentation even further.\n\nPoetry retains a very important status in the Arab world. Mahmoud Darwish was regarded as the Palestinian national poet, and his funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani addressed less political themes, but was regarded as a cultural icon, and his poems provide the lyrics for many popular songs.\n\nTwo distinct trends can be found in the \"nahda\" period of revival. The first was a neo-classical movement which sought to rediscover the literary traditions of the past, and was influenced by traditional literary genres—such as the \"maqama\"—and works like \"One Thousand and One Nights\". In contrast, a modernist movement began by translating Western modernist works—primarily novels—into Arabic.\n\nIn the 19th century, individual authors in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt created original works by imitating classical narrative genres: Ahmad Faris Shidyaq with \"Leg upon Leg\" (1855), Khalil Khoury with \"Yes... so I am not a Frank\" (1859), Francis Marrash with \"The Forest of Truth\" (1865), Salim al-Bustani with \"At a Loss in the Levantine Gardens\" (1870), and Muhammad al-Muwaylihi with \"Isa ibn Hisham's Tale\" (1907). This trend was furthered by Jurji Zaydan (author of many historical novels), Khalil Gibran, Mikha'il Na'ima and Muhammad Husayn Haykal (author of \"Zaynab\"). Meanwhile, female writer Zaynab Fawwaz's first novel \"Ḥusn al-'Awāqib aw Ghādah al-Zāhirah\" (\"The Happy Ending\", 1899) was also influential. According to the authors of the \"Encyclopedia of the Novel\":\nAlmost each of the above [works] have been claimed as the first Arabic novel, which goes to suggest that the Arabic novel emerged from several rehearsals and multiple beginnings rather than from one single origin. Given that the very Arabic word \"riwaya\", which is now used exclusively in reference to the \"novel\", has traditionally conjured up a tangle of narrative genres [...], it might not be unfair to contend that the Arabic novel owes its early formation not only to the appropriation of the novel genre from Europe [...] but also, and more importantly, to the revival and transformation of traditional narrative genres in the wake of Napoleon's 1798 expedition into Egypt and the Arab world's firsthand encounter with industrialized imperial Europe.\n\nA common theme in the modern Arabic novel is the study of family life with obvious resonances of the wider family of the Arabic world. Many of the novels have been unable to avoid the politics and conflicts of the region with war often acting as background to intimate family dramas. The works of Naguib Mahfuz depict life in Cairo, and his Cairo Trilogy, describing the struggles of a modern Cairene family across three generations, won him a Nobel prize for literature in 1988. He was the first Arabic writer to win the prize.\n\nThe musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of not only theatre in Lebanon, but also modern Arab theatre. Modern Arabic drama began to be written in the 19th century chiefly in Egypt and mainly influenced and in imitation of French works. It was not until the 20th century that it began to develop a distinctly Arab flavour and be seen elsewhere. The most important Arab playwright was Tawfiq al-Hakim whose first play was a re-telling of the Qur'anic story of the Seven sleepers and the second an epilogue for the \"Thousand and One Nights\". Other important dramatists of the region include Yusuf al-Ani from Iraq and Saadallah Wannous from Syria.\n\nIn the words of Clarissa Burt,\n\nWhilst not playing a major attested part in Arabic literature for much of its history, women have had a continuing role. Women's literature in Arabic has been relatively little researched, and features relatively little in most Arabic-language education systems, meaning that its prominence and importance is probably generally underrated.\n\nIn the estimation of Tahera Qutbuddin,\n\nPre-Islamic women's literature seems to have been limited to the genre of \"marathiya\" ('elegy'). The earliest poetesses were al-Khansa and Layla al-Akhyaliyyah of the 7th century. Their concentration on the \"ritha<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" or elegy suggests that this was a form deemed acceptable for women to work with. However, the love lyric was also an important genre of women's poetry. The Umayyad and 'Abbasid periods saw professional singing slave girls (\"qiyan\", sing. \"quayna\") who sang love songs and accompanied these with music; alongside panegyric and competitive verse-capping, \"qiyan\" also sang love-poetry (\"ghazal\"). In his \"Risalat al-Qiyan\" (\"Epistle of the Singing-Girls\"), al-Jahiz (d. 255/868×69) reckoned that an accomplished singer might have a repertoire of 4,000 songs. Pre-eminent 'Abbasid singing-girls included: 'Inan (paramour of Harun al-Rashid, r. 786-809); Arib al-Ma'muniyya (concubine of Al-Ma'mun, r. 813-17); and Fadl Ashsha'ira (d. 871; concubine of Al-Mutawakkil, r. 847-61). Meanwhile, Harun al-Rashid's half-sister ‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī (777-825) was also known for her poetic skills, as was the mystic and poet of Basra Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya (d. 801). Women also had an important role in pre-modern periods as patrons of the arts.\n\nWritings from medieval moorish Spain attest to several important female writers, pre-eminently Wallada bint al-Mustakfi (1001–1091), an Umawi princess of al-Andulus, who wrote Sufi poetry and was the lover of fellow poet ibn Zaydun; the Granadan poet Hafsa Bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya (d. 1190/91); and Nazhun al-Garnatiya bint al-Qulai’iya (d. 1100). These and other women writers suggest a hidden world of literature by women.\n\nDespite their lack of prominence among the literary elite, women still played an important part as characters in Arabic literature. \"Sirat al-amirah Dhat al-Himmah\", for example, is an Arabic epic with a female warrior, Fatima Dhat al-Himma, as protagonist, and Scheherazade is famous for cunningly telling stories in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" to save her life.\n\nThe Mamluk period saw the flourishing of the Sufi master and poet 'A'isha al-Ba'uniyya (d. 1517), who was probably the Arabic-speaking world's most prolific female author before the twentieth century. Living in what is now Egypt and Syria, she came from the al-Ba'uni family, noted for its judges and scholars, and belonged to the 'Urmawi branch of the Qadiriyya order. 'A'isha composed at least twelve books in prose and verse, which included over three hundred long mystical and religious poems.\n\nThe earliest prominent female Arabic writer of the modern period during which the Arab cultural renaissance (Al-Nahda) took place is Táhirih (1820–52), from what is now Iran. She wrote fine Arabic and Persian poetry.\n\nWomen's literary salons and societies in the Arab world were also pioneered during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, initially by Christian Arab women, who tended to have more freedom and access to education than their female Muslim counterparts in the Ottoman Empire at the time. Maryana Marrash (1848−1919) started what is now believed to have been the first salon including women, in Aleppo. In 1912, May Ziade (1886-1941) also started a literary salon in Cairo and in 1922, Mary 'Ajami (1888−1965) did the same in Damascus. These salons supported the emergence of women's writing (both literary and journalistic) and women's presses through increased interaction in the male-dominated world of Arab literature.\n\nA quote by Clarissa Burt on modern Arab poetry by Female Arab authors: Unlocked from the constraints of the traditional ode, several of these and other women have had long careers of poetry writing, entering into areas of expression of women's experience that had not been presented in print before. In many ways, this poetic work has gone hand in hand with the growth of critical discourse about women's role, status, and experience, and women's desires to be fully participating members of public society. [...] With few exceptions, critical reception in the Arab world of these and other women poets has been lukewarm at best, for the most part, often filled with criticism of their adherence or lack thereof to poetic principles that have been held as prescriptive in mahy schools of Arabic literary criticiam.Alongside Maryana Marrash, May Ziade, and Mary 'Ajami, pioneering figures in women's writing in Arabic during this time period are Zaynab Fawwaz (modern Lebanon/Egypt, 1846–1914), who arguably wrote the first novel in Arabic and was the first woman to write a play in that language as well; Aisha Taymur (modern Turkey/Egypt, 1840–1902); Malak Hifni Nasif (under the pseudonym Bahithat al-Badiyya, Egypt 1886-1918); Anbara Salam Khalidy (modern Palestine/Lebanon, 1897-1988) Anbara Salam Khalidy (modern Palestine/Lebanon, 1897–1986) and Salma al-Kadhimiyya (Iraq, 1908–1953, under the pseudonym Umm Nizar).\n\nSince the Second World War, Arabic women's poetry has become markedly more prominent. Nazik Al-Malaika (Iraq/Egypt, 1923-2007) was daughter of Salma al-Kadhimiyya, who in her own right was a poet and a vanguard of the early nationalist movement. Al-Malaika alongside Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, can be considered the initiator of the Free Verse Movement in Arabic poetry. Al-Malaika's poetry is characterised by thematic variations and the use of imagery. She also wrote \"The Case of Contemporary Poets\" which is considered a major contribution to Arab literary criticism.\n\nOther major post-war poetic voices include Fadwa Touqan (Palestine, 1917-2003), Rabāb al-Kāẓimī (Iraq, b. 1920), Jalīla Riḍa (Egypt, 1920-2001), Salma Jayyusi (Palestine, 1926-), Lami'a 'Abbas 'Amara (Iraq, b. 1927).\n\nSaniya Salih's (Syria 1935-85) poetry appeared in many well-known magazines of her time, particularly \"Shi’r\" and \"Mawaqif,\" but remained in the shadow of work by her husband, the poet Muhammad al-Maghout. Her later poems often address her relationship with her two daughters, and many were written during her illness as she died of cancer.\n\nMoreover, other Arab post-war poetesses include: Zubayda Bashīr (Tunis, 1938-); Ghada al-Samman (Syria, 1942-), known not only for poetry but also for short stories and novels, Su'ad al-Sabah (Kuwait, 1942-) and Hamda Khamis (Bahrain, 1946-) who is regarded as Bahrain's first female free-verse poet.\n\nMore recent Arabic literature has seen an even greater number of female writers' works published: Suhayr al-Qalamawi, Ulfat Idlibi, Layla Ba'albakki, Zuhrabi Mattummal, Hoda Barakat and Alifa Rifaat are just some of the novelists and prose writers. There has also been a number of significant female authors who also wrote non-fiction work mainly exploring the female condition in Muslim Societies, which includes authors such as Zaynab al-Ghazali, Nawal el-Saadawi and author/Sociologist Fatema Mernissi.\n\nWomen writers in the Arab world have unavoidably courted controversy. Layla Ba'albakki, for instance, was charged with obscenity and \"endangering public morality\" a few months after she published her collection of short stories titled \"Tenderness to the Moon\" (1963). The Lebanese vice squad actually traveled to every bookstore where the book was sold to confiscate all remaining copies because of its erotic content.\n\nSuffice to say although female Arab authors still risk controversy by discussing explicit themes or taboo topic in their works, it is a theme explored more explicitly and with more vigour due to greater outreach thanks to social media and more international awareness of Arab literature. More current Arab female writers include Hanan al-Sheikh, Salwa al-Neimi (writer, poet and journalist), Joumanna Haddad (journalist and poet), Assia Djebar. Ahdaf Soueif and Yasmine El-Rashidi amongst others who confront less-talked about topics such as sex, prostitution, homosexuality and political censorship and prosecution within the Arab diaspora and also internationally in relation to Arab emigration.\n\nContemporary female Arab writers/poets/journalists alongside producing literature and non-fiction works often take on an activist role in their careers in order to highlight and improve the female condition in Arab society. This concept is embodied in female figures such as Mona Eltahawy, who is an award-winning Egyptian columnist and international public speaker. She is best known for her unconventional comments on Arab and Muslim issues and her involvement in global feminism. In 2015, she released her book \"Headscarves and Hymens\" in which she argues the need for a sexual revolution in the Middle East.\n\nContemporary Arab women's literature has been strongly influenced by the diaspora of Arabic-speakers, who have produced writing not only in Arabic but also in other languages, prominently English, French, and German. The Internet is also important in furthering the reach of literature produced in Arabic or Arab regions:\n\nIt is among the younger generation of poets that the Internet has become a platform for mounting collections and sharing poetry. Some of these poets have their own websites, while others are included on ever growing web anthologies being posted by young Arab computer geeks dedicated to the construction of web archives for Arabic poetry and poetic history. Similarly, critical treatment of these women's poetry, while now well established in on-line resources and web-based sites for major paper publications throughout the arab world, has yet to produce clearly defined critical means of articulating emerging values for poetry, for measuring the critical worth of some of these new productions, and for encouraging the production of Arab women's poetry which will have weight, depth, and acclaim comparable to the work of some of the major Arab male poets of our day.\n\nEarly on in the Arabic literary world, there has been a culture of academic criticism. The poetry festivals of the pre-Islamic period often pitched two poets against each other in a war of verse in which one would be deemed winner by the audience. Literary criticism also grew into theology, and thus gained a more official status with Islamic study of the Qur'an. Although nothing which might be termed 'literary criticism', in the modern sense, was applied to a work held to be \"i'jaz\" or inimitable and divinely inspired, analysis was permitted. This study allowed for better understanding of the message and facilitated interpretation for practical use, all of which help the development of a critical method important for later work on other literature. A clear distinction regularly drawn between works in literary language and popular works has meant that only part of the literature in Arabic was usually considered worthy of study and criticism.\n\nSome of the first studies of the poetry are \"Qawa'id al-shi'r\" or \"The Rules of Poetry\" by Tha'lab and \"Naqd al-shi'r\" \"Poetic Criticism\" by Qudamah ibn Ja'far. Other works tended to continue the tradition of contrasting two poets in order to determine which one best follows the rule of classical poetic structure. Plagiarism also became a significant idea exercising the critics' concerns. The works of al-Mutanabbi were particularly studied with this concern. He was considered by many the greatest of all Arab poets but his own arrogant self-regard for his abilities did not endear him to other writers and they looked for a source for his verse. Just as there were collections of facts written about many different subjects, numerous collections detailing every possible rhetorical figure used in literature emerged as well as how to write guides.\n\nModern criticism at first compared the new works unfavourably with the classical ideals of the past but these standards were soon rejected as too artificial. The adoption of the forms of European romantic poetry dictated the introduction of corresponding critical standards. Taha Hussayn, himself keen on European thought, would even dare to challenge the Qur'an with modern critical analysis in which he pointed out the ideas and stories borrowed from pre-Islamic poetry.\n\nLiterature in Arabic has been influential outside the Islamic world. One of the first important translations of Arabic literature was Robert of Ketton's translation of the Qur'an in the twelfth century but it would not be until the early eighteenth century that much of Arabic's diverse literature would be recognised, largely due to Arabists such as Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot and his books such as \"Arabic Authors: A Manual of Arabian History and Literature\".\n\nAntoine Galland's translation of the \"Thousand and One Nights\" was the first major work in Arabic which found great success outside the Muslim world. Other significant translators were Friedrich Rückert and Richard Burton, along with many working at Fort William, India. The Arabic works and many more in other eastern languages fuelled a fascination in Orientalism within Europe. Works of dubious 'foreign' morals were particularly popular but even these were censored for content, such as homosexual references, which were not permitted in Victorian society. Most of the works chosen for translation helped confirm the stereotypes of the audiences with many more still untranslated. Few modern Arabic works have been translated into other languages.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the twentieth century, there was an increase of translations of Arabic books into other languages, and Arabic authors began to receive acclaim. Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz has most if not all of his works translated after he won the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature. Several other writers, including Abdul Rahman Munif and Tayeb Salih have been taken quite seriously by Western scholars, and both Alaa Al Aswany's \"The Yacoubian Building\" and Rajaa al-Sanea's \"Girls of Riyadh\" attracted significant Western media attention in the first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n"}

It was incorporated in 2016 and is at the same location as a previous dispensary, Amsterdam's Garden. The city has a history of litigation against its operators and seeks to end their operations, claiming it is an unpermitted marijuana dispensary.\n\nCoachella Valley Church describes itself as an Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church which is monotheistic, worships a single God referred to as Jah, and uses cannabis as a sacrament. The members, known as Coachellans, believe that the use of cannabis helps elevate people to a higher understanding of self and greater closeness to Jah—who members believe partially resides within each individual. They ritually use cannabis, which they call \"God's Holy Healing Sacrament\" to deepen love and livity. The church house on The Alameda has an altar, pews and sacred images \"like any other Christian house of worship\".\n\nThe City of San Jose filed a complaint against the owners and operators of Amsterdam's Garden marijuana dispensary in May 2015 for zoning violations and for not conforming to city regulations on marijuana dispensaries. Amsterdam's Garden was reportedly owned and operated by Sacha Nemcov, who was part of a failed campaign in 2016 to allow for dispensaries all around the city. After the dispensary was shut down, Coachella Church of Cannabis, later renamed Coachella Valley Church, began operations at the same location with reportedly the same operators, including Nemcov (who also calls himself Donny Lords and Alex Nemcov, according to The San Jose Mercury News). Around November 2017, the operators stated that they were not legally a marijuana dispensary under city regulations but rather a church, and should be exempt from taxation, zoning and other regulations as a legitimate religious group under the United States Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) of 2000.\n\nThe city attorney of San Jose has said: \"Whatever their followers want to smoke, that's not the issue. It's the distribution and sale coming from the dispensary.\" In 2017 the attorney said he would file an injunction to prevent cannabis sales on the church premises.

{"id": "8799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8799", "title": "D. B. Cooper", "text": "D. B. Cooper\n\nD. B. Cooper is a media epithet popularly used to refer to an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft in the northwest United States, in the airspace between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, on the afternoon of Wednesday, He extorted $200,000 in ransom () and parachuted to an uncertain fate. Despite an extensive manhunt and protracted FBI investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or identified. It remains the only unsolved case of air piracy in commercial aviation history.\n\nAvailable evidence and a preponderance of expert opinion suggested from the beginning that Cooper probably did not survive his high-risk jump, but his remains were never recovered. The FBI nevertheless maintained an active investigation for 45 years after the hijacking. Despite a case file that grew to over 60 volumes over that period, no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding Cooper's true identity or whereabouts if he survived the jump. The suspect purchased his airline ticket using the alias Dan Cooper, but because of a news media miscommunication he became known in popular lore as \"D. B. Cooper\".\n\nNumerous theories of widely varying plausibility have been proposed over the years by investigators, reporters, and amateur enthusiasts. A young boy discovered a small cache of ransom bills along the banks of the Columbia River in February 1980. The find triggered renewed interest but ultimately only deepened the mystery, and the great majority of the ransom remains unrecovered.\n\nThe FBI officially suspended active investigation of the case in July 2016, but the agency continues to request that any physical evidence that might emerge related to the parachutes or the ransom money be submitted for analysis.\n\nOn Thanksgiving eve, November 24, 1971, a middle-aged man carrying a black attaché case approached the flight counter of Northwest Orient Airlines at Portland International Airport. He identified himself as \"Dan Cooper\" and used cash to purchase a one-way ticket on Flight 305, a 30-minute trip north to Seattle.\n\nCooper boarded the aircraft, a Boeing 727-100 (FAA registration N467US), and took seat 18C (18E by one account, 15D by another) in the rear of the passenger cabin. He lit a cigarette and ordered a bourbon and soda. Fellow passengers described him as a man in his mid-forties, between and tall. He wore a black lightweight raincoat, loafers, a dark suit, a neatly pressed white collared shirt, a black clip-on tie, and a mother of pearl tie pin.\nFlight 305 was from Washington D.C. to Seattle, with stops in Minneapolis, Great Falls, Missoula, Spokane, and Portland. It was approximately one-third full when it left Portland on schedule at 2:50 p.m. PST. Shortly after takeoff, Cooper handed a note to Florence Schaffner, the flight attendant situated nearest to him in a jump seat attached to the aft stair door. Schaffner assumed that the note contained a lonely businessman's phone number and dropped it unopened into her purse. Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, \"Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb.\"\n\nThe note was printed in neat, all-capital letters with a felt-tip pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that the note said that Cooper had a bomb in his briefcase. After Schaffner read the note, Cooper told her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper opened his briefcase long enough for her to glimpse eight red cylinders (\"four on top of four\") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he stated his demands: $200,000 in \"negotiable American currency\"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit; when she returned, Cooper was wearing dark sunglasses.\n\nThe pilot, William Scott, contacted Seattle–Tacoma Airport air traffic control, which in turn informed local and federal authorities. The 36 other passengers were given false information that their arrival in Seattle would be delayed because of a \"minor mechanical difficulty\". Northwest Orient's president, Donald Nyrop, authorized payment of the ransom and ordered all employees to cooperate fully with the hijacker's demands. The aircraft circled Puget Sound for approximately two hours to allow Seattle police and the FBI sufficient time to assemble Cooper's parachutes and ransom money, and to mobilize emergency personnel.\n\nSchaffner recalled that Cooper appeared familiar with the local terrain; at one point he remarked, \"Looks like Tacoma down there,\" as the aircraft flew above it. He also correctly mentioned that McChord Air Force Base was only a 20-minute drive (at that time) from Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or \"take-me-to-Cuba\" political dissidents) popularly associated with air piracy at the time. Tina Mucklow, another flight attendant, agreed. \"He wasn't nervous,\" she told investigators. \"He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time.\" He ordered a second bourbon and water, paid his drink tab (and attempted to give Schaffner the change), and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.\n\nFBI agents assembled the ransom money from several Seattle-area banks – 10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, most with serial numbers beginning with the letter \"L\" indicating issuance by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and most from the 1963A or 1969 series – and made a microfilm photograph of each of them. Cooper rejected the military-issue parachutes offered by McChord AFB personnel, instead demanding civilian parachutes with manually operated ripcords. Seattle police obtained them from a local skydiving school.\n\nAt 5:24 p.m. PST, Cooper was informed that his demands had been met, and at 5:39 p.m. the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. It was more than an hour after sunset and Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the apron and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer. He delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper ordered all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.\n\nDuring refueling, Cooper outlined his flight plan to the cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraft – approximately  – at a maximum altitude. He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the wing flaps be lowered 15 degrees, and the cabin remain unpressurized. Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling With the plane's rear exit door open and its staircase extended, Cooper directed the pilot to take off. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would not argue the point; he would lower it once they were airborne.\n\nAn FAA official requested a face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied. The refueling process was delayed because of a vapor lock in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism, and Cooper became suspicious; but he allowed a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third after the second ran dry.\n\nAt approximately 7:40 p.m., the Boeing 727 took off with only five people onboard: Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson. Two F-106 fighter aircraft were scrambled from McChord Air Force Base and followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and turning back near the Oregon–California state line. Overall there were five planes in total trailing the hijacked plane. Not a single one of them reportedly saw him jump and none of them could pinpoint a location where he could have landed.\n\nAfter takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to join the rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow observed Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00 p.m., a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.\n\nAt approximately 8:13 p.m., the aircraft's tail section sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming to bring the plane back to level flight. At approximately 10:15 p.m., the aircraft's aft airstair was still deployed when Scott and Rataczak landed the 727 at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it had not yet been determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard, but an armed search quickly confirmed his absence.\n\nFBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints aboard the airliner. The agents also found Cooper's black clip-on tie, his tie clip and two of the four parachutes, one of which had been opened and two shroud (suspension) lines cut from its canopy. Authorities interviewed eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper. A series of composite sketches was developed.\n\nLocal police and FBI agents immediately began questioning possible suspects. An Oregon man named D. B. Cooper who had a minor police record was one of the first persons of interest in the case. He was contacted by Portland police on the off-chance that the hijacker had used his real name or the same alias in a previous crime. He was quickly ruled out as a suspect, but a local reporter named James Long, rushing to meet an imminent deadline, confused the eliminated suspect's name with the pseudonym used by the hijacker. A wire service reporter (Clyde Jabin of UPI by most accounts, Joe Frazier of the AP by others) republished the error, followed by numerous other media sources; the moniker \"D. B. Cooper\" became lodged in the public's collective memory.\nA precise search area was difficult to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his ripcord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.\n\nIn an experimental re-creation, Scott piloted the aircraft used in the hijacking in the same flight configuration. FBI agents, pushing a sled out of the open airstair, were able to reproduce the upward motion of the tail section described by the flight crew at 8:13 p.m. Based on this experiment, it was concluded that 8:13 p.m. was the most likely jump time. At that moment the aircraft was flying through a heavy rainstorm over the Lewis River in southwestern Washington.\n\nInitial extrapolations placed Cooper's landing zone within an area on the southernmost outreach of Mount St. Helens, a few miles southeast of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River. Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz counties, encompassing the terrain immediately south and north, respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. FBI agents and sheriff's deputies from those counties searched large areas of the mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.\n\nThe FBI also coordinated an aerial search, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the Oregon Army National Guard, along the entire flight path (known as Victor 23 in standard aviation terminology but \"Vector 23\" in most Cooper from Seattle to Reno. Although numerous broken treetops and several pieces of plastic and other objects resembling parachute canopies were sighted and investigated, nothing relevant to the hijacking was found.\n\nShortly after the spring thaw in early 1972, teams of FBI agents aided by some 200 Army soldiers from Fort Lewis, along with Air Force personnel, National Guardsmen, and civilian volunteers, conducted another thorough ground search of Clark and Cowlitz counties for eighteen days in March, and then an additional eighteen days in April. Electronic Explorations Company, a marine salvage firm, used a submarine to search the depths of Lake Merwin. Two local women stumbled upon a skeleton in an abandoned structure in Clark County; it was later identified as the remains of a female teenager who had been abducted and murdered several weeks before. Ultimately, the search operation—arguably the most extensive, and intensive, in U.S. history—uncovered no significant material evidence related to the hijacking.\n\nA month after the hijacking, the FBI distributed lists of the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. In early 1972, U.S. Attorney General John N. Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972, two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a \"Newsweek\" reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.\n\nIn early 1973, with the ransom money still missing, \"The Oregon Journal\" republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 to the first person to turn in a ransom bill to the newspaper or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the \"Post-Intelligencer\" made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.\n\nSubsequent analyses indicated that the original landing zone estimate was inaccurate: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional data from a variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.\n\nOn July 8, 2016, the FBI announced that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence—related specifically to the parachutes or the ransom money—that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. On the FBI website, there is currently a 28-part packet full of evidence gathered over the years. All the evidence is open to the public to read.\n\nThe official physical description of Cooper has remained unchanged and is considered reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed on the same night in separate cities, and gave nearly identical descriptions: to tall, , mid-40s, with close-set piercing brown eyes and swarthy skin.\n\nIn 1978, a placard printed with instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727 was found by a deer hunter near a logging road about east of Castle Rock, Washington, well north of Lake Merwin, but within Flight 305's basic flight path.\nIn February 1980, eight-year-old Brian Ingram was vacationing with his family on the Columbia River at a beachfront known as Tina (or Tena) Bar, about downstream from Vancouver, Washington and southwest of Ariel. The child uncovered three packets of the ransom cash as he raked the sandy riverbank to build a campfire. The bills were significantly disintegrated, but still bundled in rubber bands. FBI technicians confirmed that the money was indeed a portion of the ransom—two packets of 100 twenty-dollar bills each, and a third packet of 90, all arranged in the same order as when given to Cooper. In 1986, after protracted negotiations, the recovered bills were divided equally between Ingram and Northwest Orient's insurer; the FBI retained fourteen examples as evidence. Ingram sold fifteen of his bills at auction in 2008 for about $37,000. To date, none of the 9,710 remaining bills have turned up anywhere in the world. Their serial numbers remain available online for public search. The Columbia River ransom money and the airstair instruction placard remain the only confirmed physical evidence from the hijacking ever found outside the aircraft.\n\nIn 2017, a group of volunteer investigators uncovered what they believe to be “potential evidence, what appears to be a decades-old parachute strap\" in the Pacific Northwest. This was followed later in August 2017 with a piece of foam, suspected of being part of Cooper's backpack.\n\nIn late 2007, the FBI announced that a partial DNA profile had been obtained from three organic samples found on Cooper's clip-on tie in 2001, though they later acknowledged that there is no evidence that the hijacker was the source of the sample material. \"The tie had two small DNA samples, and one large sample,\" said Special Agent Fred Gutt. \"It's difficult to draw firm conclusions from these samples.\" The Bureau also made public a file of previously unreleased evidence, including Cooper's 1971 plane ticket (price: $20.00, paid in cash), and posted previously unreleased composite sketches and fact sheets, along with a request to the general public for information which might lead to Cooper's positive identification.\n\nThey also disclosed that Cooper chose the older of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, rather than the technically superior professional sport parachute; and that from the two reserve parachutes, he selected a \"dummy\"—an unusable unit with an inoperative ripcord intended for classroom demonstrations, although it had clear markings identifying it to any experienced skydiver as non-functional. (He cannibalized the other, functional reserve parachute, possibly using its shrouds to tie the money bag shut, and to secure the bag to his body as witnessed by Mucklow.) The FBI stressed that inclusion of the dummy reserve parachute, one of four obtained in haste from a Seattle skydiving school, was accidental.\n\nIn March 2009, the FBI disclosed that Tom Kaye, a paleontologist from the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle, had assembled a team of \"citizen sleuths\", including scientific illustrator Carol Abraczinskas and metallurgist Alan Stone. The group, eventually known as the Cooper Research Team, reinvestigated important components of the case using GPS, satellite imagery, and other technologies unavailable in 1971. Although little new information was gained regarding the buried ransom money or Cooper's landing zone, they were able to find and analyze hundreds of minute particles on Cooper's tie using electron microscopy. \"Lycopodium\" spores (likely from a pharmaceutical product) were identified, as well as fragments of bismuth and aluminum.\n\nIn November 2011, Kaye announced that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium had also been found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than in the 2010s, was at that time found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories.\n\nIn January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.\n\nOver the 45-year span of its active investigation, the FBI periodically made public some of its working hypotheses and tentative conclusions, drawn from witness testimony and the scarce physical evidence.\n\nCooper appeared to be familiar with the Seattle area and may have been an Air Force veteran, based on testimony that he recognized the city of Tacoma from the air as the jet circled Puget Sound, and his accurate comment to Mucklow that McChord AFB was approximately 20 minutes' driving time from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport—a detail most civilians would not know, or comment upon. His financial situation was very likely desperate. According to the FBI's retired chief investigator, Ralph Himmelsbach, extortionists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk. Alternatively, Cooper may have been \"a thrill seeker\" who made the jump \"just to prove it could be done.\"\n\nAgents theorized that Cooper took his alias from a popular Belgian comic book series of the 1970s featuring the fictional hero Dan Cooper, a Royal Canadian Air Force test pilot who took part in numerous heroic adventures, including parachuting. (One cover from the series, reproduced on the FBI web site, depicts test pilot Cooper skydiving in full paratrooper regalia.) Because the Dan Cooper comics were never translated into English, nor imported to the U.S., they speculated that he may have encountered them during a tour of duty in Europe. The Cooper Research Team suggested the alternative possibility that Cooper was Canadian, and found the comics in Canada, where they were also sold. They noted his specific demand for \"negotiable American currency\", a phrase seldom if ever used by American citizens; since witnesses stated that Cooper had no distinguishable accent, Canada would be his most likely country of origin if he were not a U.S. citizen.\n\nEvidence suggested that Cooper was knowledgeable about technique, aircraft, and the terrain. He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment. He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due not only to its aft airstair but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had \"single-point fueling\" capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots. In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit. Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to CIA paramilitary units.\n\nIn addition to planning his escape, Cooper retrieved the note and wore dark glasses, which indicated that he had a certain level of sophistication in avoiding the things that had aided the identification of the perpetrator of the best-known case of a ransom: the Lindbergh kidnapping. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, fence it at a discount or otherwise profit. Although Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of non-sequentially numbered small bills, mass publicity over the Lindbergh case had long made it public knowledge that even with 1930s technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence only brought in at the trial.\n\nAlthough unconscionably perilous by the high safety, training and equipment standards of skydivers, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal is a matter of dispute. The author of an overview and comparison of World War II aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains. The Tena Bar find anomalies led one local journalist to suggest Cooper, knowing that he could never spend it, dumped the ransom.\n\nAccording to Kaye's research team, Cooper's meticulous planning may also have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire. \"The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend,\" Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. \"If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need as much time as possible to get out of the woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.\" Furthermore, \"if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.\"\n\nThe Bureau were more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. \"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper,\" said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. \"We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve 'chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked.\" He also failed to bring or request a helmet, chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, and jumped into a wind chill without proper protection against the extreme cold.\n\nThe FBI speculated from the beginning that Cooper did not survive his jump. \"Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his 'chute open,\" said Carr. Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain at the onset of winter would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.\n\nThe 1980 cash discovery launched several new rounds of conjecture and ultimately raised more questions than it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An Army Corps of Engineers hydrologist noted that the bills had disintegrated in a \"rounded\" fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried. That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see Later developments above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.\n\nBut the \"free floating\" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank \"within a couple of years\" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Subsequent FBI disclosures above). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the riverbank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.\n\nHimmelsbach wrote, \"I have to confess, if I [were] going to look for Cooper, I would head for the Washougal.\" The Washougal Valley and its surroundings have been searched repeatedly by private individuals and groups in subsequent years; to date, no discoveries directly traceable to the hijacking have been reported. Some investigators have speculated that the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens may have obliterated any remaining physical clues.\n\nAlternative theories were advanced. Some surmised that the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the riverbank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tena Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.\n\nIn 1976, discussion arose over impending expiration of the statute of limitations on the hijacking. Most published legal analyses agreed that it would make little difference, as interpretation of the statute varies considerably from case to case and court to court, and a prosecutor could argue that Cooper had forfeited immunity on any of several valid technical grounds. The question was rendered irrelevant in November when a Portland grand jury returned an indictment \"in absentia\" against \"John Doe, \"aka\" Dan Cooper\" for air piracy and violation of the Hobbs Act. The indictment formally initiated prosecution that can be continued, should the hijacker be apprehended, at any time in the future.\n\nBetween 1971 and 2016, the FBI processed over a thousand \"serious suspects\", which included assorted publicity seekers and deathbed confessors, but nothing more than circumstantial evidence could be found to implicate any of them, all being linked by no more than conjecture or crackpot claims of responsibility:\n\nIn 2003, a Minnesota resident named Lyle Christiansen watched a television documentary about the Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. The following year, an episode of the History series \"Brad Meltzer's Decoded\" also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.\n\nChristiansen enlisted in the army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in Japan with occupation forces in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army, he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the South Pacific, and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a purser, based in Seattle. Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5 ft 8 in or 173 cm), thinner (150 pounds or 68 kg), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions. Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper's preferred beverage). He was also left-handed. (Evidence photos of Cooper's black tie show the tie clip applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer.) Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker's appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown, but could not conclusively identify him. (Mucklow, who had the most contact with Cooper, has never granted a press interview.)\n\nChristiansen reportedly had purchased a house with cash a few months after the hijacking. While dying of cancer in 1994, he told Lyle, \"There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you.\" Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain. After Christiansen's death, family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.\n\nResearch by internet web sleuths would later uncover proof that Christiansen did not pay cash for the house he bought after the hijacking, but instead had a mortgage on the house and took 17 years to pay it off. The same search would also uncover proof that Christiansen had sold off almost two dozen acres of land for $17,000 per acre in the mid 90's, thus accounting for the large sum of money in his account at the time of his death.\n\nDespite the publicity generated by Porteous's book and the 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime suspect. It cites a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.\n\nCoffelt was a con man, ex-convict, and purported government informant who claimed to have been the chauffeur and confidante of Abraham Lincoln's last undisputed descendant, great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith. In 1972 he began claiming he was Cooper, and attempted through an intermediary, a former cellmate named James Brown, to sell his story to a Hollywood production company. He said he landed near Mount Hood, about southeast of Ariel, injuring himself and losing the ransom money in the process. Photos of Coffelt bear a resemblance to the composite drawings, although he was in his mid-fifties in 1971. He was reportedly in Portland on the day of the hijacking, and sustained leg injuries around that time which were consistent with a skydiving mishap.\n\nCoffelt's account was reviewed by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information that had not been made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the CBS news program \"60 Minutes\", considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale, although it had been discredited thirty-six years before.\n\nL.D. Cooper, a leather worker and Korean War veteran, was proposed as a suspect in July 2011 by his niece, Marla Cooper. As an eight-year-old, she recalled Cooper and another uncle planning something \"very mischievous\", involving the use of \"expensive walkie-talkies\", at her grandmother's house in Sisters, Oregon, south of Portland. The next day flight 305 was hijacked; and though the uncles ostensibly were turkey hunting, L.D. Cooper came home wearing a bloody shirt—the result, he said, of an auto accident. Later, she said, her parents came to believe that L.D. Cooper was the hijacker. She also recalled that her uncle, who died in 1999, was obsessed with the Canadian comic book hero Dan Cooper (see Theories and conjectures), and \"had one of his comic books thumbtacked to his wall\"—although he was not a skydiver or paratrooper.\n\nIn August 2011, \"New York\" magazine published an alternative witness sketch, reportedly based on a description by Flight 305 eyewitness Robert Gregory, depicting horn-rimmed sunglasses, a \"russet\"-colored suit jacket with wide lapels, and marcelled hair. The article notes that L.D. Cooper had wavy hair that looked marcelled (as did Duane Weber). The FBI announced that no fingerprints had been found on a guitar strap made by L.D. Cooper. One week later, they added that his DNA did not match the partial DNA profile obtained from the hijacker's tie, but acknowledged, once again, that there is no certainty that the hijacker was the source of the organic material obtained from the tie. The Bureau has made no further public comment.\n\nBarbara Dayton, a recreational pilot and University of Washington librarian who was born Robert Dayton in 1926, served in the U.S. Merchant Marine and then the Army during World War II. After discharge, Dayton worked with explosives in the construction industry and aspired to a professional airline career, but could not obtain a commercial pilot's license.\n\nDayton underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1969 and changed her name to Barbara. She claimed to have staged the Cooper hijacking two years later, disguised as a man, in order to \"get back\" at the airline industry and the FAA, whose insurmountable rules and conditions had prevented her from becoming an airline pilot. She said she hid the ransom money in a cistern near her landing point in Woodburn, a suburban area south of Portland. Eventually she recanted her entire story, ostensibly after learning that she could still be charged with the hijacking. The FBI has never commented publicly on Dayton, who died in 2002.\n\nGossett was a Marine Corps, Army, and Army Air Forces veteran who saw action in Korea and Vietnam. His military experience included advanced jump training and wilderness survival. After retiring from military service in 1973, he worked as an ROTC instructor, taught military law at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, and hosted a radio talk show in Salt Lake City which featured discussions about the paranormal. He died in 2003.\n\nGossett was widely known to be obsessed with the Cooper hijacking. He amassed a voluminous collection of Cooper-related news articles, and told one of his wives that he knew enough about the case to \"write the epitaph for D.B. Cooper\". Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and a friend in the Salt Lake City public defender's office that he had committed the hijacking. Photos of Gossett taken circa 1971 bear a close resemblance to the most widely circulated Cooper composite drawing.\n\nAccording to Galen Cook, a lawyer who has collected information related to Gossett for years, Gossett once showed his sons a key to a Vancouver, British Columbia safe deposit box which, he claimed, contained the long-missing ransom money. Gossett's eldest son, Greg, said that his father, a compulsive gambler who was always \"strapped for cash\", showed him \"wads of cash\" just before Christmas 1971, weeks after the Cooper hijacking. He speculated that Gossett gambled the money away in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 1988, Gossett changed his name to \"Wolfgang\" and became a Roman Catholic priest, which Cook and others interpreted as an effort to disguise his identity. Other circumstantial evidence includes testimony that Cook claims to have obtained from William Mitchell, a passenger on the hijacked aircraft, regarding a mysterious \"physical detail\" (which he will not divulge) common to the hijacker and Gossett. Cook also claims to have found \"possible links\" to Gossett in each of four letters signed by \"D.B. Cooper\" and mailed to three newspapers within days after the hijacking, although there is no evidence that the actual hijacker created or mailed any of the letters.\n\nThe FBI has no direct evidence implicating Gossett, and cannot even reliably place him in the Pacific Northwest at the time of the hijacking. \"There is not one link to the D.B. Cooper case,\" said Special Agent Carr, \"other than the statements [Gossett] made to someone.\"\n\nRobert Richard Lepsy was a 33-year-old grocery store manager and married father of four from Grayling, Michigan who disappeared in October 1969. His vehicle was found three days later at a local airport, and a man matching Lepsy's description was reportedly seen boarding a flight to Mexico. Authorities concluded that Lepsy had left voluntarily and closed their investigation.\n\nTwo years after the Cooper hijacking, family members noted that Lepsy's physical features resembled those in the Cooper composite drawings, and asserted that Cooper's clothing was described as very similar to Lepsy's grocery store uniform. Lepsy was declared legally dead in 1976. One of Lepsy's daughters submitted a DNA sample to the FBI in 2011, with unknown results. Although Lepsy was proposed as a Cooper suspect in a 2014 book, there is no record of public comment on him from the FBI.\n\nList was an accountant, World War II and Korean War veteran who murdered his wife, three teenage children, and 85-year-old mother in Westfield, New Jersey, fifteen days before the Cooper hijacking, withdrew $200,000 from his mother's bank account, and disappeared. He came to the attention of the Cooper task force due to the timing of his disappearance, multiple matches to the hijacker's description, and the reasoning that \"a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose.\" After his capture in 1989, List admitted to murdering his family, but denied any involvement in the Cooper hijacking. Although his name continues to crop up in Cooper articles and documentaries, no substantial evidence implicates him, and the FBI no longer considers him a suspect. He died in prison in 2008.\n\nTheodore E. Mayfield was a Special Forces veteran, pilot, competitive skydiver, and skydiving instructor who served time in 1994 for negligent homicide after two of his students died when their parachutes failed to open. Later, he was found indirectly responsible for thirteen additional skydiving deaths due to faulty equipment and training. His criminal record also included armed robbery and transportation of stolen aircraft. In 2010, he was sentenced to three years' probation for piloting a plane 26 years after losing his pilot's license and rigging certificates. He was suggested repeatedly as a suspect early in the investigation, according to FBI Agent Ralph Himmelsbach, who knew Mayfield from a prior dispute at a local airport. He was ruled out, based partly on the fact that he called Himmelsbach less than two hours after Flight 305 landed in Reno to volunteer advice on standard skydiving practices and possible landing zones.\n\nIn 2006, two amateur researchers named Daniel Dvorak and Matthew Myers proposed Mayfield as a suspect once again, asserting that they had assembled a convincing circumstantial case. They theorized that Mayfield called Himmelsbach not to offer advice, but to establish an alibi; and they challenged Himmelsbach's conclusion that Mayfield could not possibly have found a phone in time to call the FBI less than four hours after jumping into the wilderness at night. Mayfield denied any involvement, and repeated a previous assertion that the FBI called \"him\" five times while the hijacking was still in progress to ask about parachutes, local skydivers, and skydiving techniques. (Himmelsbach said the FBI never called Mayfield.) Mayfield further charged that Dvorak and Myers asked him to play along with their theory, and \"we'll all make a lot of money\". Dvorak and Myers called any inference of collusion a \"blatant lie\". The FBI offered no comment beyond Himmelsbach's original statement that Mayfield, who died in 2015, was ruled out as a suspect early on.\n\nMcCoy was an Army veteran who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, first as a demolition expert, and later, with the Green Berets as a helicopter pilot. After his military service he became a warrant officer in the Utah National Guard and an avid recreational skydiver, with aspirations, he said, of becoming a Utah State Trooper.\n\nOn April 7, 1972, McCoy staged the best-known of the so-called \"copycat\" hijackings (see below). He boarded United Airlines' Flight 855 (a Boeing 727 with aft stairs) in Denver, Colorado, and brandishing what later proved to be a paperweight resembling a hand grenade and an unloaded handgun, he demanded four parachutes and $500,000. After delivery of the money and parachutes at San Francisco International Airport, McCoy ordered the aircraft back into the sky and bailed out over Provo, Utah, leaving behind his handwritten hijacking instructions and his fingerprints on a magazine he had been reading. He was arrested on April 9 with the ransom cash in his possession, and after trial and conviction, received a 45-year sentence. Two years later he escaped from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary with several accomplices by crashing a garbage truck through the main gate. Tracked down three months later in Virginia Beach, McCoy was killed in a shootout with FBI agents.\n\nIn their 1991 book, \"D.B. Cooper: The Real McCoy\", parole officer Bernie Rhodes and former FBI agent Russell Calame asserted that they had identified McCoy as Cooper. They cited obvious similarities in the two hijackings, claims by McCoy's family that the tie and mother-of-pearl tie clip left on the plane belonged to McCoy, and McCoy's own refusal to admit or deny that he was Cooper. A proponent of their theory was the FBI agent who killed McCoy. \"When I shot Richard McCoy,\" he said, \"I shot D. B. Cooper at the same time.\"\n\nAlthough there is no reasonable doubt that McCoy committed the Denver hijacking, the FBI does not consider him a suspect in the Cooper case because of significant mismatches in age and description; a level of skydiving skill well above that thought to be possessed by the hijacker; and credible evidence that McCoy was in Las Vegas on the day of the Portland hijacking, and at home in Utah the day after, having Thanksgiving dinner with his family.\n\nRobert Wesley Rackstraw is a retired pilot and ex-convict who served on an army helicopter crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He came to the attention of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosives possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot certificates; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.\n\nIn 2016, Rackstraw re-emerged as a suspect in a History Channel program and a book. On September 8, 2016, Thomas J. Colbert, an author of the book \"The Last Master Outlaw\", filed a lawsuit to compel the FBI to release its Cooper case file under the Freedom of Information Act. The suit alleges that the FBI suspended active investigation of the Cooper case \"in order to undermine the theory that Rackstraw is D.B. Cooper so as to prevent embarrassment for the bureau's failure to develop evidence sufficient to prosecute him for the crime.\" In January 2018, a small cold case documentary team reported that they had obtained a letter originally written in December 1971 and sent to \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Seattle Times\" and \"The Washington Post\", with numerous numbers and letters written on it. The team, led by Tom and Dawna Colbert, says that the codes were deciphered and matched to three units Rackstraw was a part of while in the Army, and the FBI refused to acknowledge the findings because \"it would have to admit that amateur sleuths had cracked a case the bureau couldn't.\"\n\nOne of the Flight 305 flight attendants reportedly \"did not find any similarities\" between photos of Rackstraw from the 1970s and her recollection of Cooper's appearance. Rackstraw's attorney called the renewed allegations \"the stupidest thing I've ever heard\", and Rackstraw himself told People.com, \"It's a lot of [expletive], and they know it is.\" The FBI declined further comment. Rackstraw stated in a 2017 phone interview that he lost his job over the 2016 investigations.\n\nA June 2018 article circulated claiming private investigators \"decoded\" a previously publicly unknown letter on file with the FBI, which purportedly includes a disguised confession.\n\nWalter R. Reca (born Walter R. Peca) was a Michigan-native, a military veteran and original member of the Michigan Parachute Team. He was proposed as a suspect by his friend Carl Laurin, a former commercial airline pilot and expert parachuter himself, at a press conference on May 17, 2018. In 2008, Reca confessed to being D.B. Cooper to Laurin via a recorded phone call. In July 2018, Principia Media released a four-part documentary detailing their investigation.\n\nReca gave Laurin permission in a notarized letter to share his story after he passed away in 2014, aged 80. He also allowed Laurin to tape their phone conversations about the crime over a six week period in late 2008. In the over three hours of recordings, Reca gave new details about the hijacking that the public had not heard before. He also confessed to his niece, Lisa Story. Using his years of training to determine the location of the jump, Laurin concluded that D.B. Cooper landed near Cle Elum, Washington.\n\nAccording to written testimony, Jeff Osiadacz, a Cle Elum, Washington native, was driving his dump truck near Cle Elum the night of November 24, 1971, when he saw a man walking down the side of the road in the inclement weather. He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. However he did not have room in his truck to pick him up. He continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Café just outside of Cle Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the café looking like a \"drowned rat\", according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the cafe. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.\n\nLaurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the café, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him \"Cowboy\".\n\nLaurin consulted a map to find these particular landmarks and began making phone calls about the \"Cowboy who had driven a dump truck.\" Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him. In addition to the taped confession, Laurin also has a confession written by Reca and long underwear allegedly worn by Reca under his black pants during the hijacking.\n\nIn 2016, Laurin took the information to publisher Principia Media, who consulted with Joe Koenig, a forensic linguist. He evaluated all documents, including passports, identification cards, photographs, and newspaper clippings. Koenig found no evidence of tampering or manipulation and deemed all documentation authentic and contemporaneous. After comparing Laurin's research to the available FBI records, he found no discrepancies that eliminated Reca as a suspect. He also thought it particularly significant that Osiadacz's statement of events on the night of November 24, 1971 was identical to the account that Reca made five years earlier. Koenig publicly stated at the Principia Media press conference on May 17, 2018 that he believes that Walter R. Reca was D.B. Cooper.\n\nDuane L. Weber was a World War II Army veteran who served time in at least six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for burglary and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, \"I am Dan Cooper.\" The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found Max Gunther's book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.\n\nShe then recalled, in retrospect, that Weber once had a nightmare during which he talked in his sleep about jumping from a plane, leaving his fingerprints on the \"aft stairs\". He also reportedly told her that an old knee injury had been incurred by \"jumping out of a plane\". Like the hijacker, Weber drank bourbon and chain smoked. Other circumstantial evidence included a 1979 trip to Seattle and the Columbia River, during which Weber took a walk alone along the river bank in the Tina Bar area; four months later Brian Ingram made his ransom cash discovery in the same area.\n\nThe FBI eliminated Weber as an active suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane, and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him. Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie, though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.\n\nIn November 2018, \"The Oregonian\" published an article that identified William J. Smith (1928-2018) as a possible suspect. The article was based on research from a U.S. Army data analyst who sent his findings to the FBI in the summer of 2018. Smith, a New Jersey native, was a World War II Navy veteran and would have been 43 at the time of the hijacking. After high school he enlisted in the Navy and volunteered for combat air crew training, citing his desire to fly. After the Navy, he worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and was impacted by the Penn Central bankruptcy in 1970, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history up until that time. The article theorized that the loss of his pension created a grudge against the corporate establishment and transportation industry. It also created a sudden need for money due to that loss of pension. In Smith’s high school yearbook, a list of alumni killed in World War II lists an Ira Daniel Cooper, possibly the source for the hijacker’s given name of “Dan Cooper.” The analyst stated that Smith’s Naval aviation experience would have given him knowledge of planes and parachutes, and that his railroad experience would have helped him find railroad tracks and hop on a train to escape the area after his jump. \n\nThe Oregonian article states that particles such as aluminum spiral chips found on the clip-on tie could have come from a locomotive maintenance facility. Furthermore, it states that Smith’s information about the Seattle area may have come from his close friend who was stationed at Fort Lewis during World War II. The article also noted that a website devoted to the Lehigh Valley Railroad contained a picture of Smith, and stated that “the resemblance to the wanted-poster sketches was remarkable.” The FBI responded to media requests on Smith by saying it would be “inappropriate” to comment about specific suspects.\n\nCooper was not the first to attempt air piracy for personal gain. In early November 1971, for example, a Canadian man named Paul Joseph Cini hijacked an Air Canada DC-8 over Montana, but was overpowered by the crew when he put down his shotgun to strap on the parachute he had brought with him. Cooper's apparent success inspired a flurry of imitators, mostly during 1972. Some notable examples:\n\nIn all, 15 hijackings similar to Cooper's—all unsuccessful—were attempted in 1972. With the advent of universal luggage searches in 1973 (see Airport security), the general incidence of hijackings dropped dramatically. There were no further notable Cooper imitators until July 11, 1980, when Glenn K. Tripp seized Northwest flight 608 at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, demanding $600,000 ($100,000 by an independent account), two parachutes, and the assassination of his boss. However, a quick-thinking flight attendant had secretly drugged Tripp's alcoholic beverage with Valium. After a 10-hour standoff, during which Tripp reduced his demands to three cheeseburgers and a head-start on getting away, he was apprehended. But on January 21, 1983—while still on probation—he hijacked the same Northwest flight, this time en route, and demanded to be flown to Afghanistan. When the plane landed in Portland, he was shot and killed by FBI agents.\n\nThe Cooper hijacking marked the beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized commercial airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal Sky Marshal Program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.\n\nIn the wake of multiple \"copycat\" hijackings in 1972, the FAA required that all Boeing 727 aircraft be fitted with a device, later dubbed the \"Cooper vane\", that prevents lowering of the aft airstair during flight. As a direct result of the hijacking, the installation of peepholes was mandated in all cockpit doors. This made it possible for the cockpit crew to observe people in the passenger cabin without having to open the cockpit door.\n\nIn 1978 the hijacked 727-100 aircraft was sold by Northwest to Piedmont Airlines where it was re-registered N838N and continued in domestic carrier service. In 1984 it was purchased by the now-defunct charter company Key Airlines, re-registered N29KA, and incorporated into the Air Force's civilian charter fleet that shuttled workers between Nellis Air Force Base and the Tonopah Test Range during the top-secret F-117 Nighthawk development program. In 1996 the aircraft was scrapped for parts in a Memphis boneyard.\n\nIn late April 2013, Earl Cossey – the owner of the skydiving school that furnished the four parachutes that were given to Cooper – was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they have no reason to believe that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that burglary was most likely the motive for the crime.\n\nHimmelsbach famously called Cooper a \"rotten sleazy crook\" but his bold and adventurous crime inspired a cult following that was expressed in song, film, and literature. Restaurants and bowling alleys in the Pacific Northwest hold regular Cooper-themed promotions and sell tourist souvenirs. A \"Cooper Day\" celebration has been held at the Ariel General Store and Tavern each November since 1974 with the exception of 2015, the year its owner, Dona Elliot, died.\n\nCooper has appeared in the storylines of the television series \"Prison Break\", \"The Blacklist\", \"NewsRadio\", and \"Numb3rs\", the 2004 film \"Without a Paddle\", and a book titled \"The Vesuvius Prophecy\", based on \"The 4400\" TV series.\n\n\n\n"}

Without Abkhazia and South Osetia, the population in the regions controlled by the central government of Georgia was 4,321,500 in 2005 and 4,382,100 in 2008 (compare the 2008 figure with the CIA estimate of 4,630,841 for all of Georgia, including Abkhazia and South Osetia).\n\nGeorgia was named among the highest-emigration countries in the world (with respect to population) in the 2007 World Bank report. The 2002 population census in Georgia revealed a net migration loss of 1.1 million persons, or 20% of the population, since the early 90s.

The EU adopted the Action Plan in 2003. The plan includes activities in the EU and in tropical countries that export timber and timber products to the EU. These measures include a regulation that prohibits EU businesses from importing or trading illegal timber, and bilateral trade agreements with timber-exporting countries. Much of the FLEGT Action Plan focuses on promoting trade in legal timber products and creating disincentives for trade in illegal products. However, the Action Plan's measures go further by addressing aspects of poor governance that enable illegal logging to persist.\n\nThe EU FLEGT Action Plan envisages action in seven areas:\n\nAs envisaged in the EU FLEGT Action Plan, in 2003, the EU adopted new legislation called the EU Timber Regulation. The regulation requires timber importers and traders in the EU to trade only in legal timber and adopt due diligence procedures to ensure their supply chains are legal. It requires EU member states to have legislation, procedures and penalties in place to enforce the regulation. By July 2015, 24 of the 28 EU member states had implemented the EU Timber Regulation. The EC has issued pre-infringement notices against the remaining four countries (Greece, Hungary, Romania and Spain). On 21 October 2015, WWF filed a complaint at the Federal Forest Office in Vienna against Austrian company Holzindustrie Schweighofer for alleged violations of the European Union Timber Regulation.\n\nUnder the FLEGT Action Plan, in 2005, the EU adopted the FLEGT Regulation. The FLEGT Regulation empowers the European Commission to negotiate bilateral trade deals called Voluntary Partnership Agreements with timber-exporting countries. Under a VPA, the partner country agrees to export only legal timber products to the EU, while the EU agrees to give verified legal ('FLEGT-licensed) timber products automatic access to the EU market. VPAs are also intended to strengthen forest governance in timber-exporting countries by improving transparency, accountability and stakeholder participation. The core of each VPA is the description of a timber legality assurance system the partner country will implement to verify the legality of timber products and issue verified legal products with a FLEGT licence.\n\nAs of June 2015, six countries were implementing VPAs they have ratified with the EU (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana, Liberia Indonesia, Republic of the Congo) and nine more countries were negotiating Voluntary Partnership Agreements with the EU (Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guyana, Honduras, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam). Together these 15 countries supply 80 percent of the EU's tropical timber. \n\nOn 21 April 2016, the presidents of Indonesia, the European Commission and the European Council confirmed that Indonesia had met the final major requirement of its VPA and was on course to become the world's first country to issue 'FLEGT' licences. As of 15 November 2016, Indonesia is issuing these licences, i.e. only timber that is FLEGT licensed can enter the EU. Among other VPA partner countries, Ghana is also in an advanced stage of implementing its timber legality assurance system ahead of FLEGT licensing.\n\nCritics of the FLEGT Action Plan point out that no FLEGT-licensed timber has yet arrived in the EU and that some EU member states have not yet fully implemented the EU Timber Regulation. Supporters of the FLEGT Action Plan say the time taken to deliver FLEGT licences indicates the rigour and credibility of the process. For instance, Saskia Ozinga of the campaigning organisation FERN described the FLEGT Action Plan as \"the EU's best-ever policy on tropical forests, since it's the first scheme of its kind to address the root causes of illegal logging\", and gave evidence of improved governance in Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam.\n\nAnand Punja of the UK Timber Trade Federation said the Action Plan \"has strongly help create a fairer and more partnership approach to sourcing than before. UK Importers are now much more likely to invest in their supply chains and work in partnership to help their suppliers, some of whom are smaller businesses, to put into place the right procedures and practices to ensure a better approach to forest and timber supply chain management.\"\n\nTimber trade analyst Rupert Oliver said: \"From what I've seen of FLEGT processes in Ghana, Liberia and Indonesia, they have succeeded in bringing groups together who for decades have been at loggerheads and including those who were excluded in the past. There is a strong sense of progress and direction which has often been lacking in other policy initiatives. More importantly they are succeeding in building consensus on key issues in the forest sector beyond what has actually been achieved in many industrialised nations.\"\n\nOn 22 October 2015, the European Court of Auditors issued a report that was critical of the European Commission's management of the FLEGT Action Plan. The report included a detailed response and rebuttal from the European Commission.\n\nIn July 2014, the European Commission initiated an independent evaluation of the implementation of the EU FLEGT Action Plan. The evaluation team was formed by independent experts from the TEREA – Terre Environnement Aménagement consultancy. The report of the independent evaluation, published on 4 May 2016, confirmed that the EU FLEGT Action Plan is a relevant and innovative response to the challenge of illegal logging and that the Action Plan had improved forest governance in all target countries.\n\nSince the EU adopted the FLEGT Action Plan, other markets have taken steps to prevent trade in illegal timber products. These include: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "368989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368989", "title": "Formosan languages", "text": "Formosan languages\n\nThe Formosan languages are the languages of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, all of which are Austronesian. The Taiwanese aborigines recognized by the government are about 2.3% of the island's population. However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language because of centuries of language shift. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are extinct, another four (perhaps five) are moribund, and several others are to some degree endangered.\n\nThe aboriginal languages of Taiwan have significance in historical linguistics since in all likelihood, Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family. According to linguist Robert Blust, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten principal branches of the Austronesian language family, while the one remaining principal branch contains nearly 1,200 Malayo-Polynesian languages found outside Taiwan. Although some other linguists disagree with some details of Blust's analysis, a broad consensus has coalesced around the conclusion that the Austronesian languages originated in Taiwan. The theory has been strengthened by recent studies in human population genetics, supporting also the matrilineal nature of the migration.\nBased on recent archaeological evidence as well as linguistic evidence, Roger Blench (2014) considers the Austronesians in Taiwan to have been a melting pot of immigrants from various parts of the coast of eastern China that had been migrating to Taiwan by 4,000 B.P. These immigrants included people from the foxtail millet-cultivating Longshan culture of Shandong (with Longshan-type cultures found in southern Taiwan), the fishing-based Dapenkeng culture of coastal Fujian, and the Yuanshan culture of northernmost Taiwan which Blench suggests may have originated from the coast of Guangdong. Based on geography and cultural vocabulary, Blench believes that the Yuanshan people may have spoken Northeast Formosan languages. Thus, Blench believes that there is in fact no \"apical\" ancestor of Austronesian in the sense that there was no true single Proto-Austronesian language that gave rise to present-day Austronesian languages. Instead, multiple migrations of various pre-Austronesian peoples and languages from the Chinese mainland that were related but distinct came together to form what we now know as Austronesian in Taiwan. Hence, Blench considers the single-migration model to be inconsistent with both the archaeological and linguistic (lexical) evidence.\n\nAll Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Taiwanese Mandarin. In recent decades the Taiwanese government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan first language in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing.\n\nIn 2005, in order to preserve the language of the indigenous people of Taiwan, the council established a Romanized writing system for all Taiwan's aboriginal languages. The council has also helped with classes and language certification programs for members of the indigenous community and the Han Chinese to help the conservation movement.\n\nFormosan languages form nine distinct branches of the Austronesian language family (with all other Malayo-Polynesian languages forming the tenth branch of the Austronesian).\n\nIt is often difficult to decide where to draw the boundary between a language and a dialect, causing some minor disagreement among scholars regarding the inventory of Formosan languages. There is even more uncertainty regarding possible extinct or assimilated Formosan peoples. Frequently cited examples of Formosan languages are given below, but the list should not be considered exhaustive.\n\n\nMost Formosan languages display verb-initial word order (VSO (verb-subject-object) or VOS (verb-object-subject)) with the exception of some Northern Formosan languages, such as Thao, Saisiyat, and Pazih, possibly from influence from Chinese.\n\nLi (1998) lists the word orders of several Formosan languages.\n\n\nTanan Rukai is the Formosan language with the largest number of phonemes with 23 consonants and 4 vowels containing length contrast, while Kanakanabu and Saaroa have the least number of phonemes with 13 consonants and 4 vowels (Blust 2009:165).\n\nThe tables below list the Proto-Austronesian reflexes of individual languages given in John Wolff's \"Proto-Austronesian phonology with glossary\" (2010).\n\nThe following table lists reflexes of Proto-Austronesian *j in various Formosan languages (Blust 2009:572).\nThe following table lists reflexes of Proto-Austronesian *ʀ in various Formosan languages (Blust 2009:582).\nLenition patterns include (Blust 2009:604-605):\n\n\nLi (2001) lists the geographical homelands for the following Formosan languages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Records show that there were around 20 doctors in 1860, 80 by 1900, and almost 200 by 1914. When the National Health Service was established in 1948, there were around 1,500. Today, there are more than 3,000 people employed in the Harley Street area, in clinics, medical and paramedical practices, and hospitals such as The Harley Street Clinic, Medical Express Clinic, Harley Street Fertility Clinic, Sonoworld Diagnostic Services, The London Women's Clinic and The London Clinic.\n\nIt has been speculated that doctors were originally attracted to the area by the development of commodious housing and central proximity to the important railway stations of Paddington, King's Cross, St Pancras, Euston and, later, Marylebone. The nearest Tube stations are Regent's Park and Oxford Circus.\n\nHarley Street is part of the Howard de Walden Estate.\n\nMany famous people have lived or practised in Harley Street, including the Victorian Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, the artist J.

He was one of the most popular fight announcers from the turn of the 20th century up until the 1930s. In his near 50-year career, Humphreys was estimated to have announced over 20,000 boxing matches and officiated many of the top prize fights of the era as the longtime official ring announcer at the old Madison Square Garden from 1925 up to his death in 1936.\n\nJoseph Edward Humphreys was born in New York City on October 17, 1872. He grew up at 54 Oliver Street in the Lower East Side, not far from the birthplace of future Governor of New York Alfred E. Smith, and who later was a childhood friend. His father died when he was 11 years old and became a newsboy to help support his family. During his years as a newsboy, he was known as a \"lusty-lunged youngster\" whose voice led him to obtain a position at the New York Produce Exchange as a broker's page. To make some extra money, Humphreys also began singing in clubs, smokers and benefits. At age 15, he was a bartender and later became a mascot of the old Nonpareil Athletic Club where he was originally introduced to boxing. It was while performing at Gus Maisch's \"Little Casino\" in 1888, a popular establishment near New Bowery, that he agreed to be a last minute replacement as the night's official ring announcer when the regular man was unable to appear. Humphreys became an instant success and became a full-time announcer. \n\nBy the early 20th century, Humphreys had become the single most popular boxing announcer in the New York-area. Harry Grayson, boxing writer for the \"New York World-Telegram\" once wrote, \"Joe Humphreys had voice, presence, personality, tact, and razorblade Irish wit\". He was particularly known for his distinctive and colorful announcing style, mannerisms and catchphrases, most notably, \"the win-ah and new champion!\" when announcing a title change. He was also able to silence noisy and unruly crowds by shouting \"Quiet please!\" following with a \"mollifying spread of his arms\".\n\nIn August 1910, he and actor Raymond Hitchcock purchased the original Chinese Theatre in Chinatown, Manhattan and turned it into the first movie theatre in the area. The movie house failed to catch on in the Chinese-American community, partly due to the ongoing Tong wars, and they eventually sold the property to the New York Rescue Society for use as a mission.\n\nHe also developed both close friendships and friendly rivalries with fellow announcers Tim Hurst and Charles J. Harvey, outlasting Harvey when he retired from announcing to become secretary of the New York Boxing Commission following the passage of the Frawley Law in 1911 and eventually became a manager. When Tex Rickard began promoting boxing at the old Madison Square Garden in 1925, Humphreys was hired as official ring announcer and was present at many of the top prize fights held at the venue including Jack Dempsey's bouts against Georges Carpentier, Luis Firpo and Gene Tunney. He was a major fan of Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey, regarding the latter as \"the most devastating fighter ever to step in the ring\". He often claimed that Dempsey's bout against Firpo was \"the most exciting he had ever witnessed\".\n\nHumphreys was also highly skilled at using current events during his performances. For example, during the Jack Sharkey vs. Jim Maloney on May 20, 1927, he asked the crowd of 40,000 at Yankee Stadium to stand and observe a moment of silence for Charles Lindbergh who had left earlier that day on his transatlantic flight from New York to Paris.\n\nHumphreys also became involved behind the scenes and was associated with Sam H. Harris in the management of then world bantamweight and featherweight champion Terry McGovern. Upon his request, his granddaughter Terry was named in McGovern's honor. In 1929, he publicly stated that he intended to remain an announcer for 50 years. He was never known to take any special care for his voice, save chewing on a cough drop or when his throat became dry, and was opposed to using microphones when they were first introduced at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHumphreys suffered a serious stroke in June, 1933 which sidelined him for only two months. He resumed his role August 17th of that year at Madison square garden. He made a few remarks to an enthusiastic crowd. At the third meeting between Barney Ross and Jimmy McLarnin in 1935, he was unable to enter the ring and had to do his introductory announcements from ringside. However, he was so ill that he was unable to attend the championship bout between Max Baer and James J. Braddock on June 13, 1935 and missed the first major fight in his career.\n\nHe spent a month in the hospital and made his in-ring return at Yankee Stadium, welcomed by the 95,000 fans in attendance, to announce Max Baer-Joe Louis fight on September 24, 1935. Humphreys continued working at Madison Square Garden during the 1935-36 season, but announced only the main events. Although he lived most of his life in New York City, where he exclusively performed during his career, Humphreys spent his later years in Red Bank, New Jersey and New Rochelle, New York.\n\nIn late-June 1936, Humphreys fell seriously ill and was confined to his home in Fair Haven, New Jersey for three weeks. On the morning of July 10, he apparently collapsed from heat and was unable to speak coherently. Falling into a coma at around 2:00 pm, he died an hour and a half later. His son and daughter-in-law, as well as his grand daughter Terry, were at his bedside at the time of his death.\n\nIn 1997, Humphreys was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as a \"non-participant\".\n\n\n"}

The clan's name comes from the small city of Kalmat, situated between Iran and Pakistan. They are part of the Hooth Tribe, claiming descent from Hooth, a son of Jalal Khan. When the Hooths were ruling Kech Makran, a few members of the tribe settled in Kalmat, near the port of Pasni, in the coastal area of Balochistan. In the 12th century, the Kalmati had spread from Tehs Bandar in the western part of Balochistan to Shah Bandar in Sindh. Today, the Kalmati tribes live throughout the districts and towns of Balochistan and Shindh.\n\nKalmatis mostly work in cultivation and business. The famous graveyard called Chaukhandi tombs in Karachi, is associated with this tribe.\n\nThe Soviet historic M. Pikulin in his book says: Kalmati (karmats) is a tribe of names in the oldest legends. The researchers note that this tribe is characterized by a large admixture of Indo-Iranian elements in all likelihood, the Baluchi-Qarmat is the descendants of the followers of the ancient religious and political sect of the early Middle Ages which in the 11th century portrayed its Qarmatian state in Multan and Northern India\n\nAccording to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, Professor at University of Karachi, the Balochis migrated from Balochistan during the Little Ice Age and settled in Sindh and Punjab. The Little Ice Age is conventionally defined as a period extending from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, or alternatively, from about 1300 to about 1850. According to Professor Baloch, the climate of Balochistan was very cold during this epoch and the region was inhabitable during the winter so the Baloch people migrated in waves and settled in Sindh and Punjab. \n\nIn the 15th century, the Portuguese captured few ports of modern Pakistan and Oman, and planned to proceed with annexation of the coastal area of Makran. The Portuguese attacked Makran under the leadership of Vasco de Gama, but were repulsed by forces under the command of Mir Ismail. The Portuguese looted and set coastal villages on fire, but failed to capture the area of Makran. Cannons of the Portuguese army were found abandoned, lying near the central jail of Gwadar. Ishaheel's grave is situated near the Mountain of Batal Gwadar, constructed by Ismaheel during his life. He died in 1468.\n\nAfter Ismail's regime, his nephew Hammal (kalmati hooth\n\n), son of Jihand Khan(Hooth), became the ruler of Makran. During his rule, the Portuguese initiated several attacks under the command of Lowess Dee Almia, but they were repelled each time, eventually agreeing to a truce wherein the Portuguese agreed not to attack the Makran coastal area. However, when Hammal was at sea with some companions, the Portuguese attacked his ship and too Hammal captive. A statue Hammal resides in a museum on the island of Goha in India, constructed by the Portuguese.\n\nDuring this time, the Portuguese also attacked Tehs Bandar, which was under the command of Kareem Dad, who died in the attack along with 44 of his soldiers.\n\nIn the Mughal Empire, the Kalmati tribe had a broad power base Hub to Keti Bandar in the Sindh province. After the Mughal defeat of the Portuguese from Ran Kach, the Mughals decided that the Kalmati had become a threat to their empire. Mughal emperor, Akbar, plotted with local Sardars (Chiefs) to overthrow the local Kalmati chiefs. However, both being Baloch peoples, as well as a Kalmati force consisting of approximately 20,000 troops, foiled Akbar's plan. His defeat led him to cede a large tract of agricultural land in Chachkan in Sindh province to the Kalmati, in 1654. When his successor, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb also failed in his attempt to break the power of the Kalmati, he ceded even more land to the Kalmati (this time in Sakro), in exchange for them not becoming rebels against the empire. During this period the Kalmati made alliances with other Baloch tribes, creating a Baloch confederacy. Mughal traders used the roads and sea routes in Sindh and Balochistan, and the Kalmati Sardar charged Rs. 9,600 per year as taxes from the Mughals.\n\nWhen Saleh Baig became Mirza, he began a policy of persecution towards the Kalmati. As part of that persecution, Baig had the family of a person named Mureed executed. Mureed vowed to not wear the traditional turban (Pagri) until he had avenged them by killing Baig. One day in Thatta, Mureed saw Baig patrolling in the city with his protocol staff. Mureed assassinated Baig, and was in turn killed by Baig's protocol staff. This was a difficult period for all the Baloch tribes.\n\nIn the regime of Mia Yar, the Kalmati were the only tribe to refuse to pay taxes to the government of Kalhora. The tax consisted of 50 camels or their equivalent value. In response, Muhammad Kalhoro attacked Malir, in modern Karachi, with 18,000 troops. The Kalmati became aware of the impending attack, and they relocated their cattle, women and children to a place called Lat Koh (Lat Mountain), situated between Gadap and Kon Kor. In the ensuing battle, the government troops defeated the Kalmati tribe, with the remnants fleeing to Lat Koh. These Kalmati were called the Lati or Lateeg.\n\nOn 2 February 1839, two British naval ships, the H.M.S. Hina and Wales, arrived at Manora island of Karachi. They called on the Kalmatis to evacuate the port and surrender their arms. The tribe's commander refused to surrender, and replied, according to legend, \"I am a Baloch and would prefer to be a martyr than to surrender.\"\n\nDue to the power of the British forces, the Baloch began a guerilla war. After capturing Karachi, the British had built a military strongholds in Manora and Aram Bagh areas of Karachi.\n\n"}

They primarily live in the district of Bobonaro, East Timor, while the rest live in the East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia.\n\nThey are close to the Tetum people. The Kemak people speak the Kemak language. Kemak people are one of the smallest of the 14 Austronesian subgroups in Timor. Most of them are adherents of traditional beliefs, while part of them profess to the Catholic faith. Territorial community is headed by a leader, divided into genera. There are three levels of conjunctions. The \"private\" type of group corresponds to the level of \"uma\" or house. It does not only mean housing, but its category includes the exogamous groups of older and younger brothers who share a common ancestor. The \"collective\" type refers to the Morobe community, which encompasses 7 villages containing mainly 3 houses, and united by a common ritual cycle.\n\nFor the most part the Kemak people live in Atabae, Cailaco, Maliana (Bobonaro District, 39,000 Kemaks) and Atsabe (Ermera District, 18,500 Kemaks), but also partly in the Cova Lima District (2,100 Kemaks) of East Timor and in Belu Regency, East Nusa Tenggara of Indonesia. According to the 2010 East Timor census, 61,969 people identify Kemak language as their mother tongue. In 1970, there were 45,084 people.\n\nBefore the colonial period, Atsabe was one of the centers of Timor under the \"koronel bote\" (meaning \"Kings\") of Atsabe Kemak, which dominated the entire Kemak inhabited areas in East Timor until the colonial period. The Kemak areas includes the north of present-day Bobonaro, in the northern Ainaro, and in the area of Suai that were tributary to Atsabe. The small Kemak empire of Marobo had a peripheral location, which is why the Kemak people there were mixed with the neighboring Bunak people for generations. Atsabe was part of a complex alliance system through rituals, marriage and trade, though which the Tetun Dili people of Wehali with its capital, Laran were established. Laran was at the same time the spiritual center of the entire island. In addition to Tetum Dili and Kemak people, the Bunak people and Mambai people of Aileu were also part of this alliance system. Together with the east of the island, the Portuguese called this area Belu (also Belos or Behale).\n\nAccording to the oral traditions of the Atsabe Kemaks people, they came relatively late under the colonial Portuguese rule. One reason could have been the far-reaching dispersal of the inhabitants and the impassibility of the mountainous landscape. Only in the 19th century did the Portuguese-Angolan troops had first invaded the area. The then Kings Dom Tomás Pinto opposed the invaders. But Dom Tomás was defeated and had to go to Atambua to flee to West Timor. Portuguese sources mentioned the region of Atsabe and Liurai only in the middle of the 19th century. The Atsabe rulers were particularly prone to rebel against the colonial leaders and their presence in the island. Two of Dom Tomás' grandchildren, Nai Resi and Nai Sama later fought for power. While Nai Resi turned against the Portuguese colonialists, Nai Sama supported the Portuguese. Nai Sama was finally executed by his own men, while Nai Resi was captured by the Portuguese in Hatulia and executed as well.\n\nThe Portuguese were first regarded as another people with their own ruler. After the resistance to them had failed, the Kemak people accepted the leaders of the Portuguese as part of their higher hierarchy that provided them with a larger army, holy men, the Catholic priests and with a larger Lulic (ritual practitioner). The flag of the Portuguese and even its flagpole were viewed as sacred objects. The colonial rulers, confirmed as administrators of Portugal, were again legitimized by handing over of the flag.\n\nThe acceptance of Kemak people for the established Catholicism was closely related to their understanding of the personified holiness. This imported concept of holiness is seen as a stronger expansion of the local's existing traditional Luli. The Catholic priests were given land to build chapels and were allowed to do mission work. But the success of conversion was not much because of the friendless but rather so that one's own spiritual powers can be increased.\n\nNai Resi's son, Dom Cipriano Gonçalves (Dom Siprianu) became the ruler of Atsabe in 1912 until 1943. During the Japanese occupation of Timor, he and the population of Atsabe made passive resistance. Therefore, Siprianu along with six of his relatives were taken hostage by the Japanese and later executed.\n\nSince the Portuguese education system was reserved for the ruling class, they was also able to secure the leading positions in the colonial administration. The same was true later during the Indonesian occupation, the boundaries of collaboration and apparent cooperation for the protection of its own people were obvious. The East Timorese resistance also found partial support here.\n\nThe son of Siprianu and the last ruler of Atsabe, Dom Guilherme Maria Gonçalves became a co-founder of the pro-Indonesian party, Timorese Popular Democratic Association (APODETI) in 1974, which called for the support of East Timor to Indonesia. During the Indonesian occupation, Dom Guilherme was the Governor of Indonesian Timor Timur from 1978 to 1982. Later, he distanced himself from Indonesia and went into Portuguese exile. After the East Timorese people had spoken in a 1999 referendum for an independence from Indonesia, pro-Indonesian militias attacked family members and allies of the former \"koronel bote\" (meaning \"rulers\"). The reason was due to the suspect that the former ruler supported the independence movement.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, the Kemak people from Lermean (today the municipality of Ermera District) under the supremacy of Maubara rose up against the Portuguese colonial masters. Governor Francisco Teixeira da Silva defeated the opposition in an unequal fight. In the decisive battle, which lasted for 48 hours, the rebels had to defend themselves against a superior fire power. 15 villages were taken and burnt down. The number of victims among the Timorese is not known, while the Portuguese counted their own losses with two dead and eight wounded. The territory of Lermeans was divided into the neighboring kingdoms.\n\nIn 1868, the Portuguese sent a military force to Suco Sanirin (Sanir / Saniry) whose \"liurai\" (ruler) refused to pay taxes, and a fort in Suco Batugade was made to serve as a center for military operations. The Kemak people of Suco Sanirin were officially Balibo Subdistrict tributary under Batugade military command.\n\nLike the other ethnic groups of East Timor, the Kemak people today are largely adherents of the Catholic faith. Thus, in the Atsabe Administrative Post almost all inhabitants are Catholics. It spread particularly during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor (1975-1999) as a demarcation to the majority Muslim invaders. The church offered protection, criticized the brutal behavior of the occupiers, and was a means of peaceful protest. The veneration of the Virgin Mary, especially in small towns, is particularly marked by numerous religious ceremonies in churches and grottoes.\n\nNevertheless, the Christian rites still bear traces of the animistic, traditional religion. Components of the ancient religion are ancestral cult, reliquary worship and the concept of sacred (Kemak language: \"luli\", Tetum language: \"lulik\") places. One of them is Mount Dar Lau, which is the mythical place of origin of the Atsabe Kemak people. According to legend, heaven and earth were once connected at this point. Christian priests that kept animistic practices, are revered as holy men with spiritual powers (\"Luli\"). Such spiritual powers are passed on through a blessing. In doing so, these spiritual forces are not only derived from the office, but rather men who are credited with spiritual forces to join the priesthood.\n\nThere are slight variations in the ceremonies between the different groups of Kemak communities, such as the Atsabe Kemak and the Marobo Kemak people.\n\nSociety is characterized by a hierarchical division according to the families, the \"houses\". The house of the \"Koronel\" (Tetum language: \"Liurai\"), the traditional kingship, had their authority derived from their origins in their founding fathers and their \"luli\". The latter could either be both in a person himself as well as in sacred objects. The same applies to the traditional priests (\"gases ubu\"), who claimed their position on the basis of their origin and ritual knowledge. They were the guardians of sacred history and traditions. Only the king surpasses them in holiness. He also retains the largest share of holy objects, which were handed down from their founding fathers. But the authority of the priests is limited to the rituals. However, it was possible that a person have both secular power, for example, as a village chief, and at the same time a priest. The king of Atsabe had both authorities. In addition, the king's house secured his position of power though strategical marriage policy, the exchange of women and material goods, and the formation of an army to fight in regional feuds and head hunting.\n\nThe sacred houses are built together by all men who belong to a tribe line. They meet on a weekend, once a month, for eleven months. At the end of the monthly work is always a small ritual feast celebrated. The sacred houses consist of seven levels, each with four steps. Restriction to the access depends on the degree of kinship. Simple guests are allowed only in the lowest level of the house, friends at least in the second level, married relatives in the third, relatives from neighbouring villages in the fourth and partly in the fifth, those married in the village in the sixth and only the \"Lulik Nain\" (meaning \"Lord of the Holy\") up to the seventh level. He is the guardian of the house and the sacred objects, which are kept here. At the inauguration of the house, a buffalo is sacrificed and a great feast is celebrated.\n\nThe burial ceremonies of the Kemak people (\"Tau tana mate\") are divided into three phases, namely \"Huku bou\", \"Leko-cicir lia\" and \"Koli nughu\". The burial ceremonies are referred to as black rituals (\"Metama no\"). It is one of the occasions when the living ones come into contact with their ancestors, which also leads to the renewal and restructuring of the social connections between the living and the dead as well as between the alliance partners, whom are connected by marriage. The house of the \"bride-donors\" (\"ai mea\") and those of the \"bride-receptors\" play central roles in the burial ceremonies, as in other major events. Before all members of the family have arrived, the ritual cannot be started. The blood of the sacrificial animals that the \"Ai mea\" have donated is used to brush ritual objects and the grave. In times of polygamy, the attendance of second wives and their participation (\"Bei-bei\") is an absolute requirement. In addition, there are also the attendance of the entire sides of the family, such as those of the older and younger houses (\"ka'ara-aliri\"), which are connected by marriage and the friendly and allied ones.\n\nFor the Atsabe Kemak people the first phase of burial, the \"Huku bou\", consists of sacrifice of at least five water buffaloes and several goats and pigs. The dead person is then buried in a Christian grave. The second phase, \"Leko-cicir lia\", is the most cost-intensive ritual of the Kemak culture. This is usually performed jointly for several deceased. Only a high status dead person, such as a \"Koronel\", receive an independent ritual. The ritual is usually performed before the beginning of the planting season (August to September), since it is combined with the request to the ancestors for a rich harvest. According to traditional belief, the second rite have not been performed yet for the soul of the deceased and it is said to remain near his house and village (\"Asi naba coa pu\"). The later the \"leko-cicir lia\" takes place, the more shall the lonely soul long for his society, and therefore will call for the souls of the living to him. An accumulation of deaths within a house is regarded as a sign of such a case. Nevertheless, the ritual is usually carried out only years after the first phase, since the house of the dead must first afford the economic means for such expensive ritual. It is particularly complicated by the concept of the Second Burial. The bones of the deceased are excavated, cleaned and re-buried, while the soul of the dead are guided through ritual songs (\"Nele\") of the priest to the village of the ancestors on the Tatamailau, East Timor's highest mountain. The songs can take up to 14 hours. During the ritual, water buffaloes are once again presented as animal sacrifices. The severed sexual organs of all sacrificial animals are brought deep into the sacred jungle (\"Ai lara hui\") at the end of the ceremony and placed there before \"Bia Mata Ai Pun\" (the origin of spring and trees). The ancestors are conjured up by a song, through the sacrifices of animals, to transfer the souls of the dead to the ancestors. At the end the bones of the dead are again buried. The conclusion is now a Christian Mass, the only reference to the new faith.\n\n"}

Born in 1909, he studied in Vienna, Bern, and Fribourg in the late 1930s and early 1940s before coming to Prague in 1942/3. He stayed there for a few years, translating Korean literature into German and Czech and writing a book and various articles in those languages about the history of Korea. A supporter of communism, he chose Pyongyang as his destination when he returned to the Korean peninsula in the late 1940s, but was purged near the end of the Korean War.\n\nMost North Korean international students in the 1950s studied in either Czechoslovakia or Hungary. In 1955, there were student demonstrations at Charles University in response to the financial assistance and preferential treatment shown to North Korean students. There were about 150 North Korean students in Czechoslovakia in 1989, according to the personal testimony of two among them—both students at a dental college in Prague—who defected to South Korea in February that year. Other sources reported 200. North Korea recalled them all back home after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990.\n\nThere was formerly a contingent of nearly four hundred North Koreans working in the Czech Republic, including about ninety women working as seamstresses in Snezka, a company in Náchod that manufactures sheets for cars and travel bags, and others in Skuteč. M-Plus, a Czech labour broker company with contacts in the North Korean Ministry of Light Industry, arranged most of their visas and employment contracts. The workers were typically women between 18 and 22 years of age, and came from politically reliable families; they saw their assignment to the Czech Republic as a reward and a good opportunity to earn money.\n\nAccording to media reports, about half eventually learned to speak Czech and sometimes socialised with the other workers at their factories, primarily Ukrainian migrants and local people, discussing work-related topics. European media coverage described the workers as \"21st-century slaves\", a characterisation which their employers strongly disputed, pointing out that their wages, work hours, and overtime payments were the same as their colleagues of other nationalities. However, they always moved around in groups, never alone, and were accompanied by a North Korean government minder at all times. In 2004, a television crew came to Skutec in an attempt to film and investigate North Korean workers there. However, shortly after their arrival, they were attacked by 30 North Korean women throwing stones, and lost their footage. Media figures later speculated that the widespread coverage of the North Korean workers' plight had made them feel threatened, and that the publicity may have actually damaged their standing and put their families in danger. A 2006 Czech police investigation revealed that the women deposited nearly 80% of their wages into a collective bank account; this was further corroborated by testimony from defector Kim Tae-san, formerly an official at the North Korean embassy in Prague.\n\nEventually, due to the negative publicity, and pressure from U.S.-based customers due to the 2006 North Korean nuclear test and the resulting sanctions, many companies stopped employing North Korean guest workers, and the Czech Republic stopped issuing employment visas to them. However, even after the existing visas expired, 144 North Koreans continued to work in the Czech Republic. Media reports speculated that the remaining North Koreans may have been granted individual exemptions by immigration officials, or had been able to obtain other types of visas.\n\nThe population of South Koreans in the Czech Republic more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2009, according to the statistics of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. South Korea's National Institute for International Education Development recognises one Korean weekend school in the Czech Republic, the Prague Hangul School (프라하한글학교), founded in January 1997; , it employed seven teachers and enrolled 35 students at the kindergarten through middle school levels. Portrayals in popular culture include the show \"Lovers in Prague\".\n\nThe South Korean embassy in Prague lists one Roman Catholic church with a Korean priest and five Protestant churches with Korean pastors in the city. Additionally, the Evangelical church \"U Jákobova žebříku\" (\"At Jacob's Ladder\"), near the Kobylisy station of the Prague Metro, also hosts services in Korean. There are also six Korean Buddhist temples in the Czech Republic.\n\n"}
{"id": "15879788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15879788", "title": "Kot, Fatehpur", "text": "Kot, Fatehpur\n\nKot (2001 pop. 3,920) is a village in the southeast corner of Fatehpur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The village was founded by Malik Bahbal (Izzuddin Malik Babar), a general in the army of ShahabUddin Ghori (also Ghauri, Ghouri) in the 12th century. Kot has 12 smaller satellite villages. They are Kot, Minatara, Maksudanpur,Ghazipur, Manmai, Kulli, Rahmatpur, Shivpuri, Parvezpur(Parbetpur), Adhaiya, oraha, Shahnagar and Ratanpur. The people from the area refer to themselves as Kahkar or kakhar (kayani) also as Khokhars. Another community from this area is the Kshatriyas, who call themselves Chandrauls, Chandelas or Chandravashi Kshatriya (descendants of King Parikshit).\n\nThe Khokhar Khanzada tribe, originally numbering almost 100,000, has lived in Kot, Fatehpur district, for nearly 800 years. As of 2011, the population of Khokkhars living in the Kot area is estimated at about 5,000; other Khokkars are scattered around many parts of India. Most of the original population emigrated to Pakistan. Many others moved to Jabalpur, Bhopal, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Visakhapatnam, Bhubneshwar, Bilaspur, Itarsi, Banda, Charkhari (Bundelkhand) and other parts of India. Some emigrated to the Middle East, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, and other countries for economic gain. The worldwide Khokkhar population may be as high as 300,000.\n\nResearch indicates that the Kokkhars are the descendants of Uzbek Persians who, after their defeat by the Arabs in Persia, took refuge in Punjab; the army of King Babar (which was passing through the area) recruited them because of their ferocity in warfare.\n\nAnother reference indicates that the Kokkhars are a tribe of the Rajput clan (inferred due to their ruling status in the Kuh-i-Jud regions of Punjab), and have allied with other clans (such as the Janjua) in pushing back the Ghorid armies from the region.\n\n\"Ghakkar\" and \"Kakar\" are other variations of Kokkhar. Although they are not of Chandra, Surya or Agnikula Vansh lineage, they were given the status of Rajput Pathan by the priests of their time; it was not a self-proclaimed title. This demonstrates that the Kokkhars are not Jatts, Thakurs or any other military tribe of India, and may not be an indigenous ethnic group. Many defeated royal figures with Uzbek, Persian and Pashtun origins became Lashkari (allies of passing warlords), the Kokkhars among them. They are mistakenly thought to have been in frequent conflict with the Indian Jatts, Thakurs and Rajputs; rather, they sided with the Jatts, Rajputs and Moguls against the Ghorides.\n\nThe term \"Kokkhar\" is equivalent to \"barbarian\" in Europe, since they originated in Central Asia. They were Huns, who rapidly attacked and influenced northern India. The Kokkhars played a similar role with respect to northern India's empires as the barbarians (or the Huns) did for the Roman Empire. More research is needed, since much Kokkhar history is currently unknown.\n\nMany Khokkhar elders living in Kot refer to their ancestors as \"Ajbuk\", an Uzbek word meaning \"wild warriors\". Rivalries (sometimes escalating to armed hostility) have traditionally been frequent between – and within – various Khokkhar groups. Historical and geographic factors have spawned diversity within the Khokkhars. The relationship between tribe and ethnic group is complex, and all Khokkhars (including those in rural areas) consider themselves linked to the Pashtun people and the armies of the Moguls and Alauddin Khalji.\n\nDespite a degree of social uniformity, many different phenotypes may be found in the Khokkhar population including blond-haired, blue-eyed Khokkhars. Those with darker features and epicanthic folds are considered to be descendants of Kokkhars. Tall, olive-skinned, mustachioed tribesmen and those who combine these features are said to be descendants of the Rajput and Khokkhar dynasties. Although it may be tempting to associate certain physical features with a particular ethnic group, scholars recognize that (since all human populations are capable of intermingling, and do so) there are more physical differences found within ethnic groups than between them. In general, Khokkhars living in Kot have light skin (nearly Caucasian); they are tall, and resemble the Uzbeks.\n\nThe Afghan and North Western Frontier's rugged environment isolated residential communities and created micro-environments with rigorous survival skills. Kot possesses a similar topography; it is located near the Yamuna River at high altitude, providing a spectacular scenery of ancient fortified fortresses. Members of the different Kokkhar groups and Khandans residing in different locations must adapt to their own micro-environments. Many Khokkhars use \"Khan\" as a surname, while others have adopted the surname \"Khokkhar\". Many Khokkhars (in Kot, elsewhere in India and abroad) are involved in business; some are bureaucrats, or otherwise in public service (including members of the military and police forces). India's leading motivational speaker Naseer Khan belongs to Khokkhars from Kot, Fatehpur.More information about exact origin is awaited, Historian Late Mehmudul Hassan Khan from Barkheda Railway Station a place located in Madhya Pradesh state of India wrote detailed literature which is going to publish in coming days\n"}
{"id": "712215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=712215", "title": "LGBT themes in speculative fiction", "text": "LGBT themes in speculative fiction\n\nLGBT themes in speculative fiction refer to the incorporation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres. Such elements may include an LGBT character as the protagonist or a major character, or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from the hetero-normative.\n\nScience fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.\n\nBefore the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to the LGBT community. This development was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.\n\nAs genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.\n\nIn speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called \"cognitive estrangement\": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.\n\nIn spite of the freedom offered by the genres, gay characters often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters in such a way as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.\n\nSpeculative fiction has traditionally been \"straight\"; Samuel R. Delany has written that the science fiction community is predominantly made up of white male heterosexuals, but that the proportion of minorities, including gay people, is generally higher than found in a \"literary\" group. The inclusion of homosexuality in SF has been described in \"Science Fiction Culture\" as \"sometimes lagging behind the general population, sometimes surging ahead\". Nicola Griffith has written that LGBT readers tend to identify strongly with the outsider status of mutants, aliens, and characters who lead hidden or double lives in science fiction. In comparison, Geoff Ryman has claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible, with his books being marketed as one or the other, but never both, and David Seed said that SF purists have denied that SF that focuses on soft science fiction themes and marginalised groups (including \"gay SF\") is \"real\" science fiction. Gay and lesbian science fiction have at times been grouped as distinct subgenres of SF, and have some tradition of separate publishers and awards.\n\n\"True History\" by the Greek writer Lucian (A.D. 120–185) has been called the earliest surviving example of science fiction and the first ever \"gay science fiction story\". The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a typhoon and swept up to the moon, which is inhabited by a society of men that are at war with the sun. After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son the prince in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the moon's soil.\n\nIn other proto-SF works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or \"beastliness\", as in \"Gulliver's Travels\", which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms. The frank treatment of sexual topics of pre-nineteenth century literature was abandoned in most speculative fiction, although Wendy Pearson has written that issues of gender and sexuality have been central to SF since its inception but were ignored by readers and critics until the late twentieth century. Early works that contained LGBT themes and showed the gay characters to be morally impure include the first lesbian vampire story \"Carmilla\" (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1890) by Oscar Wilde, which shocked contemporary readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters.\n\n\"An Anglo-American Alliance\", a 1906 novel by Gregory Casparian, was the first SF-themed novel to openly portray a lesbian romantic relationship.\n\nDuring the pulp era, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.\n\nAs the demographics of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel \"Odd John\" (1935), by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.\n\nIn the Golden Age of Science Fiction, the genre \"resolutely ignored the whole subject\" of homosexuality, according to Joanna Russ. As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however, writers like Philip Jose Farmer and Theodore Sturgeon were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work. Until the late 1960s, however, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions. The majority of LGBT characters were depicted as caricatures, such as \"man-hating amazons\", and attempts at portraying homosexuals sympathetically or non-stereotypically were met with hostility.\n\nSturgeon wrote many stories during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that emphasised the importance of love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story \"The World Well Lost\" (1953), first published in \"Universe\" magazine, homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the \"Universe\" cover was \"[His] most daring story\"; its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time, and it is now regarded as a milestone in science fiction's portrayal of homosexuality. According to an anecdote related by Samuel R. Delany, when Sturgeon first submitted the story, the editor (Haywood Braun) not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well. Sturgeon would later write \"Affair with a Green Monkey\", which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published \"Venus Plus X\", in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist's homophobia portrayed unfavourably.\n\nImages of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in Charles Beaumont's short story \"The Crooked Man\" (1955), first published in \"Playboy\", inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress the heterosexual minority. In Anthony Burgess's \"The Wanting Seed\" (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment; Burgess treats this as one aspect of an unnatural state of affairs which includes violent warfare and the failing of the natural world.\n\nAlthough not usually identified as a genre writer, William S. Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published \"Naked Lunch\", the first of many works such as \"The Nova Trilogy\" and \"The Wild Boys\" in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.\n\nBy the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called \"the New Wave,\" a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in \"inner space\" instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential \"New Worlds\"), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace. The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s. In the 1970s, lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch and Samuel R. Delany.\n\nFeminist SF authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm. Joanna Russ's \"The Female Man\" (1975) and the award-winning story \"When It Changed\", showing a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, were enormously influential. Russ is largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction; she has stated that being openly lesbian was bad for her career and sales. Similar themes are explored in James Tiptree Jr.'s award-winning \"Houston, Houston, Do You Read?\", which presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically \"male\" problems such as war, but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning and consider men to be comical. Tiptree was a closeted bisexual woman writing secretly under a male pseudonym, and explored the sexual impulse as her main theme.\n\nOther feminist utopias do not include lesbianism: Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" (1969) depicts trans-species sexuality, in which individuals are neither \"male\" nor \"female\" but can have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities, making them in some senses bisexual. In \"The Language of the Night\", a collection of Le Guin's criticism, she admits to having \"quite unnecessarily locked the Gethenians into heterosexuality ... the omission [of the homosexual option] implies that sexuality is heterosexuality. I regret this very much.\" Le Guin often explores alternative sexuality in her works, and has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities SF allows for non-traditional homosexuality, such as the bisexual bonding between clones in \"Nine Lives\". Sexual themes and fluid genders also figure in the works of John Varley, who came to prominence in the 1970s. Many of his stories contain mentions of same-sex love and gay and lesbian characters. In his \"Eight Worlds\" suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex on a whim. Homophobia is shown to initially inhibit uptake of this technology, as in his story \"Options\", as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality eventually becoming the norm for society. His \"Gaea trilogy\" features lesbian protagonists, and almost all the characters are to some degree bisexual.\n\nSamuel R. Delany was one of the first openly gay science fiction authors; in his earliest stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a \"sensibility\", rather than in overt sexual references. In some stories, such as \"Babel-17\" (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist is a woman who is involved in a three-person marriage with two men. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In \"Dhalgren\" (1975), his most famous science fiction novel, Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities. Once again, sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours.\n\nDelany's Nebula-winning short story \"Aye, and Gomorrah\" posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award-winning stories featuring gay characters, such as \"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\", were to follow, all collected in Delany's short story retrospective \"Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories\". Delany faced censorship from book distribution companies for treatment of these topics. In later works, gay themes become increasingly central to Delany's works, attracting controversy, and some blur the line between science fiction and gay pornography.\nDelany's SF series Return to Neveryon was the first novel from a major US publisher to deal with the impact of AIDS, and he later won the William Whitehead Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in gay and lesbian writing. His most recent gay-themed novel is Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders.\n\nOther big name SF authors approached LGBT themes in individual works: In \"Time Enough for Love\" (1973) by Robert A. Heinlein, the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex for the purpose of procreation remains held as the ideal. The female bisexuality in \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a \"wrongness\" deserving pity. Heinlein's use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled \"The Embarrassments of Science Fiction\" by SF writer Thomas Disch. Disch was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel \"On Wings of Song\" (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his mosaic novel \"334\", gay people are referred to as \"republicans\" in contrast to the straight \"democrats\". However, he did not try to write to a particular community: \"I'm gay myself, but I don't write 'gay' literature.\"\n\nMichael Moorcock was one of the first scifi authors to depict positive portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.\n\nElizabeth Lynn is an openly lesbian science fiction and fantasy writer who has written numerous works featuring positive gay protagonists. Her \"Chronicles of Tornor\" novels (1979–80), the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first fantasy novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background, and included explicit and sympathetic depictions of same-sex love; the third novel is of particular lesbian interest. Her SF novel \"A Different Light\" (1978) featured a same-sex relationship between two men, and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore and chain \"A Different Light\". The \"magical lesbian tale\" \"The Woman Who Loved the Moon\" also won a World Fantasy Award and is the title story in the Lynn's \"The Woman Who Loved the Moon\", a collection also containing other gay speculative fiction stories.\n\nAfter the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s, homosexuality gained much wider tolerance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors, such as David Gerrold, Geoff Ryman, Nicola Griffith and Melissa Scott, and transgender writers such as Jessica Amanda Salmonson, an author who chronicled the progress of her gender change in the pages of \"The Literary Magazine of Fantasy and Terror.\" In the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers. However, depictions of unrealistic lesbians continue to propagate for the titillation of straight men in genre works. In the 1990s, stories depicting alternative sexualities experienced a resurgence.\n\n\"Uranian Worlds\", by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was compiled in 1983 and is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.\n\nIn Lois McMaster Bujold's \"Ethan of Athos\" (1986), the titular \"unlikely hero\" is gay obstetrician Dr. Ethan Urquhart of the single-gender world Athos, whose dangerous adventure alongside the first woman he has ever met presents both a future society where homosexuality is the norm and the lingering sexism and homophobia of our own world.\n\nCyberpunk, a genre arising in the mid-1980s, has been seen as heteronormative and masculine to a large extent, although feminist and \"queer\" interpretations are mooted by some critics. Melissa Scott, a lesbian writer, has written several cyberpunk works that prominently feature LGBT characters, including Lambda-award-winning \"Trouble and Her Friends\" (1994) and \"Shadow Man\" (1995), the latter having also been inducted into the Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame. Scott has reported that reviewers called some of these works \"too gay\" for mixing cyberpunk clichés with political themes. Many of Scott's other SF works also contain LGBT themes; she said that she chooses to write about gay themes using SF because these genres allow her to explore situations in which LGBT people are treated better or worse than in reality, and that it also gives an estranging distance for readers averse to such themes, who might otherwise feel accused of similar discriminatory practices as those in the books.\n\nA number of LGBT-themed anthologies of speculative short fiction have been published since the 1980s, the first being the science fiction-themed \"Kindred Spirits\" (1984), edited by Jeffrey M. Elliot. These anthologies often focus on particular sexual identities, such as the \"New Exploits of Lesbians\" series with titles in the fantasy (\"Magical lesbians\", \"Fairy-tale lesbians\") and horror (\"Twilight lesbians\") areas. Others are grouped around particular genres, such as the award-winning \"Bending the Landscape\" series edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel, in which each of the three volumes focus upon , or ; or the horror-oriented \"Queer Fear\" anthologies, edited by Michael Rowe.\n\nGay characters became common enough that Diana Wynne Jones' \"The Tough Guide To Fantasyland\" contains an entry on \"gay mages\" as a fantasy cliché. Such characters are found in Mercedes Lackey's works, such as the Lambda award-winning \"The Last Herald Mage\" trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. Their relationships are an integral part of the story, which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar. Much of the extended series provides non-heterosexual role-models for younger readers.\n\nDavid Gerrold is an openly gay science fiction writer with a number of LGBT themed works. \"The Man Who Folded Himself\" (1973) examines the narcissistic love of a time-traveler who has gay orgies with alternate versions of himself, including female and lesbian versions. Gerrold's multi-award-winning \"Jumping Off the Planet\" (2000) is the first book in a young adult series, in which a father kidnaps his three sons and goes to the moon; one son is gay, and rejected from college as he is ineligible for a scholarship available to straight people who agree to have their sexual orientation changed to prevent overpopulation. Gerrold received a Nebula award for a semi-autobiographical short story \"The Martian Child\" (1994), in which a gay man adopts a child. The story was later expanded to book length, and a feature film was produced in which the protagonist was straight, causing criticism.\n\nGeoff Ryman wrote several award-winning novels and short stories that prominently feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of \"The Child Garden\" (1989), an outsider because of her resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into a relationship with a similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. \"Lust\" (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. \"Was\" (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally challenged abused child, linked by their connection to \"The Wizard of Oz\" books and film. In a \"Locus\" magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: “In 1990, if you had asked me which was the worst thing to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then \"Was\" came out... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay.\"\n\nLarissa Lai's novel \"Salt Fish Girl\" (2002) depicts lesbian relationships in the context of a dystopian corporate future. The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. \"Salt Fish Girl\" engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.\n\nElizabeth Bear's \"Carnival\" (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel \"The Carhullan Army\" (2007), published in the US under the title \"Daughters of the North\", matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.\n\nRafael Grugman dystopian novel \"Nontraditional Love\" (2008) describes the twenty-third century. USA. The world is homosexual. The author describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. Conception occurs in test tubes. In lesbian families, one of the women carries the child. Gay male couples turn to surrogate mothers to bring their children to term. The Netherlands is the only country where mixed-sex marriages are permitted. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world. The author paints a grotesque situation, but underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves.\n\nReviewing the field of lesbian romance speculative fiction in 2012, Liz Bourke concluded that it remained a niche subgenre of uneven quality, but mentioned Jane Fletcher, Chris Anne Wolfe, Barbara Ann Wright, Sandra Barret and Ruth Diaz as contributors of note. More recently in Rick Riordan's 2013 teen-fantasy novel \"The House of Hades\", character Nico di Angelo professes romantic feelings for protagonist Percy Jackson. In terms of gender identity, Kim Stanley Robinson's 2012 novel \"2312\" depicts a world of fluid gender, where \"self-images for gender\" include feminine, masculine, androgynous, gyandromorphous, hermaphrodite, ambisexual, bisexual, intersex, neuter, eunuch, nonsexual, undifferentiated, gay, lesbian, queer, invert, homosexual, polymorphous, poly, labile, berdache, hijra, and two-spirit. In 2013, Natasja Hellenthal's lesbian fantasy debut novel The Queen's Curse became an Amazon best-seller, and in her The Comyenti Series the main female character is bisexual and falls in love with a lesbian character. The comyentis are a supernatural/paranormal bisexual species.\n\nEllen Kushner's mannerpunk \"Swordspoint\" series of novels feature homosexual and bisexual protagonists in the 18th century fantasy world of Riverside. It spawned \"Swordspoint: Tremontaine\", a thirteen part \"Fantasy of Manners\" written by a variety of authors. The audiobooks of \"Swordspoint\" won the 2013 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, the Earphones Award from AudioFile Magazine, and the 2013 Communicator Award: Gold Award of Excellence (Audio). The \"Swordspoint\" sequel \"The Fall of the Kings\", written with Kushner's wife Delia Sherman, won the 2014 Wilbur Award.\n\nWithin the realm of tie-in speculative fiction, there was also an increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was a concerted effort to explore this in licensed \"Star Trek\" literature. In the , the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two 'male' and two 'female' species. Andrew J. Robinson's Garak novel, \"A Stitch in Time\", suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack's 2014 novel, \"The Crimson Shadow\". In the original series , created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.\n\nSarah Waters is a Welsh author popular for lesbian romances in historical times, most often the Victorian Era. Popular works of hers include \"Tipping the Velvet\" (1998) and \"Fingersmith\" (2002).\n\nFor much of the 20th century, gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed \"de facto\" censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.\n\nThe CCA came into being in response to Fredric Wertham's \"Seduction of the Innocent\", in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality, including subliminal homosexuality. Wertham claimed Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian, and stated that \"The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies.\"\n\nIn recent years the number of LGBT characters has increased greatly in mainstream superhero comics; however, LGBT characters continue to be relegated to supporting roles, and generate criticism for the treatment gay characters receive.\n\nAlpha Flight's Northstar was the first major gay character in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 as a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of \"Alpha Flight\", but not openly stated; his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's \"Alpha Flight\" issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.\n\nIn 2002, Marvel Comics revived \"The Rawhide Kid\" in their Marvel MAX imprint, introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine. The first edition of the Rawhide Kid's gay saga was called \"Slap Leather\". According to a CNN. com article, the character's sexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic's style is campy. Conservative groups quickly protested the gay take on the character and claimed that children would be corrupted by it, and the covers carried an \"Adults only\" label.\n\nMarvel's policy had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an \"Adults Only\" label, in response to conservative protests. But in 2006, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada claimed that this policy was no longer in force, and Marvel received GLAAD's 2005 Best Comic Book Award for its superhero comic book \"Young Avengers\", which included gay characters but was published as a mainstream book with no warning label. In 2012, despite protests, Marvel published an issue of Astonishing X-Men in which Northstar married his partner, Kyle.\n\nDC often still draws criticism for its use of stereotypes for LGBT characters. Firebrand, a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought by some to be an early example, with his pink or transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter – Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise.\nIn addition to true LGBT characters, there has been controversy over various homosexual interpretations of the most famous superhero comic book characters. Batman's relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny, in spite of the majority of creators associated with the creator denying that the character is gay. Psychologist Fredric Wertham, who in \"Seduction of the Innocent\" asserted that \"Batman stories are psychologically homosexual\", claimed to find a \"subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature 'Batman' and his young friend 'Robin'\". It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because \"he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality,\" and \"the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp.\" Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a \"homophobic nightmare\", he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting.\n\nSome continue to play off the homosexual interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from \"Batman\" #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper \"All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s\". Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.\n\nMany of DC's gay characters, such as Obsidian and Renee Montoya, were changed or essentially erased in The New 52 reboot of 2011. Meanwhile, others, such as Kate Kane, were given far less attention than before the reboot. In 2012 DC announced that an \"iconic\" character would now be gay in the new DC universe. It was then revealed that Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern was that character. This led to fan outcry because his status as \"iconic\" is debatable, and he does not actually exist in the mainstream DC universe. This also effectively meant that the already gay character, Obsidian, could not exist as he was Alan Scott's child.\n\nYaoi and Yuri (also known as \"Boys' Love\" and \"Girls' Love,\" respectively, as well as \"Shōnen-ai\" and \"Shōjo-ai\" in the West, although these are not used in Japan due to pedophilic undertones) are Japanese genres which have homosexual romance themes, across a variety of media. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri is now available in many countries and languages. The characters of yaoi and yuri do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. As with much manga and anime, SF and fantasy tropes and environments are common: For example, \"Ai no Kusabi\", a 1980s yaoi light novel series described as a \"magnum opus\" of the Boys Love genre, involves a science fictional caste system. \"Simoun\" has been described as being \"a wonderful sci fi series\" which does not have to rely on its yuri content to appeal to the audience.\n\nYaoi has been criticised for stereotypical and homophobic portrayals of its characters, and failing to address gay issues. Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all, is used as a plot device to \"heighten the drama\", or to show the purity of the leads' love. Matt Thorn has suggested that as BL is a romance narrative, having strong political themes may be a \"turn off\" to the readers. Critics state that the genre challenges heteronormativity via the \"queer\" \"bishōnen\".\n\nThere is also a style of manga called Bara, which is typically written by gay men for a gay male adult audience. Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and is more likely to acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.\n\nIn general, speculative fiction on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.\n\nLGBT characters in films began to appear more regularly only in the 1980s. Films in the late 1920s and early 1930s reflected the liberal attitudes of the day and could include sexual innuendos and references to homosexuality, but from the 1930s until 1968 the film industry in the US followed the Production Code. The code spelled out what was morally acceptable for a public audience; references to sexual \"perversions\" such as homosexuality were forbidden. Virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code, and similar censorship was common in other countries, for example an early version of the first lesbian vampire film \"Dracula's Daughter\", a film described in \"The Celluloid Closet\" as presenting \"homosexuality as a predatory weakness\", was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1935, who said in part \"...\"Dracula's Daughter\" would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\". Horror author Anne Rice has named \"Dracula's Daughter\" as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction, naming a bar in her novel \"Queen of the Damned\" \"Dracula's Daughter\" in honor of the film.\nFilms produced under such censorship could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, such as in the cult horror film \"White Zombie\".\n\nThe less stringent rules of the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex as one of their major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story \"Carmilla\". The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film \"Does Dracula Suck?\" in 1969.\n\nGay genre films remain rare, and science fiction films' inclusion of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, such as the \"stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual\" minor character played by Harvey Fierstein in the 1996 blockbuster \"Independence Day\", a film whose main theme has been described as being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic. It is also interesting to note that the film's director, Roland Emmerich, is openly gay. Still there are some curious cases like Cthulhu (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which the main character is gay but it isn't the main thing, although it is important in the development of the character's psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in \"V for Vendetta\" there are two secondary characters – one gay, one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia. 2012 saw the light of the epic Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster, \"Cloud Atlas\", featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters.\n\nLGBT characters began appearing on television with increasing frequency only in the 1990s. The 1994 television science fiction show, Babylon 5 introduced a bisexual character, Susan Ivanova whose relationship with a fellow female telepath was revealed in season 2 (1995). Advocate magazine called this relationship out as the closest that the Star Trek franchise or any \"Star Trek clone,\" as he called the show, had come to a \"gay creature—much less a gay human being.\" Babylon 5 continued to explore the state of same-sex relationships in the future with the introduction of a male-male marriage and subsequent honeymoon as cover for two of the main characters who were on a covert mission to a Mars colony in season 4.\n\nThe \"\" fantasy television series introduced its main characters, Xena and Gabrielle, as close companions; fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons, although the lesbian content remained at the subtext level. The series has been cited as \"trail-blazing\" and breaking down barriers, allowing the production of subsequent programming such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", which introduced a number of LGBT characters. The most famous is the major character, Willow and her partners Tara and Kennedy. Although praised for their \"healthy relationship\" and being the first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime-time television, others criticised the use of witchcraft as a metaphor for lesbian sex. Tara's death directly after reconciliatory sex with Willow caused an outcry among the LGBT community, who saw it as a \"homophobic cliché\". Andrew Wells, a recurring villain and eventual ally, was strongly implied to be gay, although closeted. The series was influential on subsequent television speculative fiction, including \"Torchwood\". The series won a number of LGBT themed awards, and was regarded as groundbreaking in its portrayal of gay youth.\n\n\"Torchwood\" is a British science fiction drama television programme, part of the long-running \"Doctor Who\" franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBT themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and bisexual relationships. Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, with \"The Sun\" describing all of the characters on \"Torchwood\" as bisexual.\nSeries creator Russell T Davies has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters: \"Without making it political or dull, this is going to be a very bisexual programme. I want to knock down the barriers so we can't define which of the characters is gay. We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.'\"\nDavies has also described Jack Harkness as omnisexual: \"He'll shag anything with a hole. Jack doesn't categorise people: if he fancies you, he'll do it with you.\"\n\nThe inclusion of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series has not been universal. For example, the \"Star Trek\" franchise's lack of same-sex relationships has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in \"Star Trek\", but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.\n\nWithin the \"Star Trek\" canon, there have been no officially recognized LGBT characters in the television spin-offs. \"The International Review of Science Fiction\" ran a feature entitled \"Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9\" However, gender identity has occasionally been treated as an \"issue\" within the new \"Star Trek\" series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 \"\" episode \"Rejoined\", which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the \"Star Trek\" franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil \"mirror universe\" (\"The Emperor's New Cloak\") or body possession (\"Warlord\" and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters. In a 2000 \"Fandom \"interview, \"Star Trek\" screenwriter Ronald D. Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference. In recent years, a few of the \"Star Trek\" novels and comics, which are officially licensed but not considered canon, have featured serious direct same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character as gay.\n\nIn 2005 the television series \"Dante's Cove\" premiered on the here! cable station. The series included both gay and lesbian couples dealing with supernatural situations in the coastal town of the same name. The following year, Syfy premiered the series \"Eureka\". The series spotlighted a fictional town in Oregon that consisted almost entirely of geniuses. This included the town's café owner Vincent, who also happened to be gay.\n\nHBO brought then new series \"True Blood\" to the forefront of gay genre television, introducing a variety of omnisexual characters to the small screen in 2008 including: Lafayette Reynolds (played by Nelsan Ellis), Jesus Velasquez (played by Kevin Alejandro), Tara Thornton (played by Rutina Wesley), Pam Swynford De Beaufort (played by Kristin Bauer van Straten), Eddie Gauthier (played by Stephen Root), Russell Edgington (played by Denis O'Hare), and Rev. Steve Newlin (played by Michael McMillian).\n\nStargate Universe in 2009 became the first space-based science fiction show to feature an openly gay character in its primary cast, which was \"Camille Wray\" played by Ming-Na. \"Wray\" was also the first gay character in the franchise and the first primary lesbian Asian-American character on primetime television. Wray's storyline featured a committed long-term relationship with her Earth-bound partner Sharon (played by Reiko Aylesworth), the lifelike portrayal of which was very positively received by the lesbian community and press. Stargate Universe was cancelled after a two-season run.\n\nIn 2009 the series \"Warehouse 13\" premiered on the Syfy cable network. The series later introduced a character named Steve Jinks, played by actor Aaron Ashmore, a gay government agent assigned to assist in the containment of bizarre artifacts.\n\nIn 2010 a cable series prequel to \"Battlestar Galactica\" was introduced titled \"Caprica\". The series highlighted a world in which same-sex marriage was common. One of the central characters named Sam Adama, played by Sasha Roiz, had a husband named Larry, played by Julius Chapple.\n\nIn 2011 the cable station Syfy premiered the series \"Being Human\", an Americanized version of the previously released British series of the same name. A lesbian character named Emily Levison, played by actress Alison Louder, was introduced as the sister to one of the main characters. That same year the FX cable series \"American Horror Story\" highlighted gay ghost couple Chad Warwick and Patrick, played by Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears. The HBO cable station premiered \"Game of Thrones\", based on the book series of the same name. The series included gay couple Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell, played by actors Gethin Anthony and Finn Jones. MTV also premiered the cable series \"Teen Wolf\" that same year. One of the characters depicted is an out gay high school lacrosse player named Danny Mahealani, played by Keahu Kahuanui.\n\nThe platonic close male relationships in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as slash fiction – Kirk/Spock being the earliest example. Slash cannot be commercially distributed due to copyright, and until the 1990s was either undistributed or published in zines. With the advent of the internet, the slash fiction community of fans and writers began to cluster at sites such as fanfiction.net, and websites and fanzines dedicated to popular speculative fiction franchises such as \"X-files\" and \"Star Trek\" have become common. The use of characters from major SF franchises in \"gay readings\" has caused legal action: LucasFilm has sent cease and desist orders to prevent gay reinterpretations of \"Star Wars\" characters, and Anne Rice is notorious for attempts to stop production of slash fiction based on her \"Vampire Chronicles\" characters, although many of the characters are bisexual in canon. Slash fiction has been described as important to the LGBT community and the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality, but has also been noted as being unrepresentative of the gay community, being more a medium to express feminist dissatisfactions with SF. According to polls, most of slash fandom is made up of heterosexual women with a college degree. These demographics are older than the yaoi fans and they tend to be more easily disturbed about slash depicting underage sexuality, but this is becoming less true due to the popularity of Harry Potter-inspired slash fiction.\n\nFemslash is a subgenre of slash fiction which focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female fictional characters, Typically, characters featured in femslash are heterosexual in the canon universe; however, similar fan fiction about lesbian characters are commonly labeled as femslash for convenience. There is less femslash than there is slash based on male couples – it has been suggested that heterosexual female slash authors generally do not write femslash, and that it is rare to find a fandom with two sufficiently engaging female characters. Janeway/Seven is the main Star Trek femslash pairing, as only they have \"an on-screen relationship fraught with deep emotional connection and conflict\". There is debate about whether fanfiction about canon lesbians such as Willow and Tara of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" counts as \"slash\", their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones, which entices Willow/Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline. It is \"relatively recently\" that male writers have begun writing femslash.\n\nThere has been a long history of tolerance of LGBT people in SF fandom. The presence of gay members was noted by attendees of early conventions, but generally not discussed — the idea that gay or lesbian members would seek recognition within the SF community was \"unthinkable,\" and an accusation in the 1940s by a fanzine editor that the Los Angeles Science Fiction Association was \"full of gay members\" caused a scandal in fan circles. Prominent SF fan Forrest Ackerman is regarded as one of the first members of fandom to openly support the gay and lesbian movements. He was known for writing early lesbian fiction and aided in the publication of \"The Ladder\", the journal of the recently formed lesbian group the Daughters of Bilitis. He claims the group named him an honorary lesbian for his support, and to have pseudonymously written the earliest work of \"lesbian SF\" in 1947 in \"Vice Versa\", the lesbian fanzine edited by Lisa Ben.\n\nAs the number of works featuring LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least as early as the 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.\n\nNetworking between gay fans continued, finally coalescing at the 1986 Worldcon into a plan of action. This led to the first Gaylaxicon science fiction convention being held in 1988 and subsequently to the creation of the Gaylactic Network and the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards by the science fiction community. Gay-themed discussions are now a staple at conventions such as WisCon; for example, WisCon 30 featured a panel discussing \"Why Women Write About Gay Men\", and the 38th World Science Fiction Convention in Boston had a discussion panel entitled \"The Closed Open Mind – Homophobia in Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories\".\n\nOther SF authors, such as Orson Scott Card, have been criticised by the LGBT community for their works or opinions, which have been described as homophobic.\n\nSome lesbian science fiction is targeted specifically to a lesbian audience, rather than science fiction fans, and published by small feminist or lesbian fiction presses such as Bella Books, Bold Strokes Books, Ylva Publishing, Regal Crest Enterprises, Bedazzled Ink, Intaglio Publications, and Spinsters Ink. A notable author writing science fiction published by lesbian presses is Katherine V. Forrest.\n\nA number of awards exist that recognise works at the intersection of LGBT and speculative fiction:\n\n SF is used throughout as an abbreviation for speculative fiction, for convenience. Science fiction and slash fiction are written in full when referred to specifically.\n\n\n"}

The society is divided into four subtribes, who traditionally were animist but now follow Islam. They are mostly subsistence farmers. The Nara speak the Nara language, which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan family.\n\nAccording to the Eritrean government, the Nara are descendants of the first Nilo-Saharan settlers in Eritrea, who had migrated from the Upper Nile area and intermarried with local Pygmy populations.\n\nToday, the Nara number around 108,000 individuals. They constitute around 1.5% of the population of Eritrea. They are typically agrarian and have settled primarily along the border with Sudan.\n\nThe Nara population is divided into four subtribes: the Higir, Mogareb, Koyta and Santora. They traditionally adhered to animist beliefs. After the Egyptian occupation in the 19th century, most Nara adopted Islam. A minority also follow Christianity.\n\nThe Nara ethnonym means \"Sky Heaven\". They also used to call themselves the \"Barya\".\n\nThe Nara people speak the Nara language. It belongs to the Nilo-Saharan family, and is closely related to Kunama.\n\nThrough contact with neighboring Afroasiatic-speaking populations, many Nara are also bilingual in Tigre and/or Arabic. They traditionally had no writing system, with the few existing pieces of literature in Nara transcribed using either Tigre or Arabic.\n\nThe language is also known as \"Nara-Bana\", meaning \"Nara-Talk\".\n\nSocial organisation of the Nara people is based on the clan and subclan, with people living in villages and hamlets. The lineage system is patrilineal, unlike that of the Kunama people. Land belongs to the clan and shared out among the families in the clan.\n\nAccording to Trombetta et al. (2015), 60% of Nara are carriers of the E1b1b paternal haplogroup. Of these, around 13% bear the V32 subclade, to which belong 60% of the Tigre Semitic speakers in Eritrea. This points to substantial gene flow from neighbouring Afro-Asiatic-speaking males into the Nara's ancestral Nilotic community. Cruciani et al. (2010) likewise observed that the remaining Nara individuals are primarily carriers of the Afro-Asiatic-associated haplogroup J (20%), as well as the A lineage (20%), which is instead common among Nilotes.\n"}

Most countries only legalized prostitution, with the act of exchanging money for sexual services legal. The level of enforcement varies by country. One country, the United States, is unique as legality of prostitution is not the responsibility of the federal government, but rather state, territorial, and federal district's responsibility.\n\nProstitution is legal in Bermuda but related activities such as running a brothel are illegal under the Criminal Code. Women coming to the island to work as prostitutes, or is a known prostitute, may be refused entry under the immigration laws. Many of the prostitutes in the country are from Philippines, Dominican Republic and Panama. In 2010 the visa requirements for people from these countries was changed to attempt to curb prostitution. Street prostitution occurs in the capital, Hamilton, on Front Street.\nProstitution was traditionally legal as there were no laws prohibiting the exchange of sex for money or other consideration. On 20 December 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada found the laws prohibiting brothels, public communication for the purpose of prostitution, and living on the profits of prostitution to be unconstitutional. The ruling gave the Canadian parliament 12 months to rewrite the prostitution laws with a stay of effect so that the current laws remain in force. Amending legislation came into effect on 6 December 2014, which made the purchase of sexual services illegal, using the Swedish approach.\n\nProstitution in Greenland is illegal. Although the country is subject to the law of Denmark in most areas of legislation, Denmark's decriminalization of prostitution in 1999 has not been applied in Greenland. In addition, Greenland is exempt from the obligations of the Palermo Protocol on human trafficking to which Denmark is a signatory, but there is little evidence of human trafficking in Greenland. A report published in 2008 indicated that Greenland had no signs of visible or organised prostitution, no services directed specifically at prostitutes and no instances of prostitution-related court cases. It did, however, refer to claims that transactional sex had sometimes been used, for example, in return for temporary housing. In a tradition associated with Greenland's Inuit people, hosts have been reported to have offered their wives to guests in a form of \"hospitable prostitution\". The colonists who founded the country's capital Nuuk in 1728 included prostitutes among their number.\n\nProstitution in Mexico is legal under Federal law. Each of the 31 states enacts its own prostitution laws and policies. 13 of the states of Mexico allow and regulate prostitution.

In most parts of the country, pimping is illegal, although pimp-worker relationships still occur, sometimes under female pimps called \"madrotas\". The government provides shelter for former prostitutes.\nProstitution laws in the United States are determined at the state level. The practice is illegal in all but one of its 50 states and is illegal in all U.S. territories.\n\nNevada is the only U.S. jurisdiction which allows some legal prostitution in some of its counties. Currently 7 out of Nevada's 16 counties have active brothels.

Brothel ownership, however, is legal. There are no specific laws against human trafficking, but any criminal offence that includes ‘commerce in women or children’ requires sentencing to be increased by 30%.\n\nThose municipalities that do not prohibit sex work often set up zones for sex workers away from schools and churches. In the San Esteban area of San Salvador, 17 brothels were forcibly closed in August 1998 for being too close to schools and churches.\nProstitution itself is legal but procuring is prohibited. There is an offence of “aggravated procuring” where a minor is involved.

Because there is no law prohibiting prostitution, it is a prevalent form of occupation, especially amongst women and teenagers in cities. Although similar institutions such as brothel ownership and pimping are illegal, prostitution has remained largely unchecked by the government.\n\nLack of enforcement of current laws has created a profitable business out of prostitution - one in which both adults and children are a part. There are many causes to the high rates of involvement amongst the women and teens in cities, but the main reason is the high poverty levels. Participants see sex work as a viable option to escape poverty.\n\nProstitution is legal, but promoting prostitution and procuring are prohibited. The minimum age for prostitutes is 14 years old.

In 2007 it was estimated that 70% of the prostitutes in the country were from Colombia. The country attracts Colombian prostitutes as the currency is the US$ rather than the unstable Colombian peso.\n\nQuito was the first city in Ecuador to regulate prostitution in 1921, requiring prostitutes to be tested weekly for STIs and the results recorded in the \"Register of Venereal Disease\". Testing and any necessary treatment was free to the prostitutes. Guayaquil and Riobamba introduced a similar system of regulation in 1925.

The new laws targeted prostitution in the bars and restaurants of Fort-de-France, which the colonial authorities believed were a major factor of STIs. As a result, all waitresses and hostesses had to have a valid \"certificat de non contagiosité\", whether they were prostitutes or not.

Some places where public computers may be available are libraries, schools, or facilities run by government.\n\nPublic computers share similar hardware and software components to personal computers, however, the role and function of a public access computer is entirely different. A public access computer is used by many different untrusted individuals throughout the course of the day. The computer must be locked down and secure against both intentional and unintentional abuse. Users typically don't have authority to install software or change settings. A personal computer, in contrast, is typically used by a single responsible user, who can customize the machine's behavior to their preferences.\n\nPublic access computers are often provided with tools such as a PC reservation system to regulate access.\n\nThe world's first public access computer center was the Marin Computer Center in California, co-founded by David and Annie Fox in 1977.\n\n\"See also: Computer Kiosk\"\n\nA kiosk is a special type of public computer using software and hardware modifications to provide services only about the place the kiosk is in.

There is usually Internet access on these machines, but some schools will put up a blocking service to limit the websites that students are able to access to only include educational resources, such as Google. In addition to controlling the content students are viewing, putting up these blocks can also help to keep the computers safe by preventing students from downloading malware and other threats. However, the effectiveness of such content filtering systems is questionable since it can easily be circumvented by using proxy websites, Virtual Private Networks and for some weak security systems merely knowing the IP address of the intended website is enough to go through.\n\nSchool computers often have advanced operating system security to prevent tech-savvy students from inflicting damage (i.e. the Windows Registry Editor and Task Manager, etc.) are disabled on Microsoft Windows machines.

It would be led by Romanov pretender Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen as Emperor Nicholas III, with Bakov serving as Archchancellor.\n\nBy 2017, talks with heads of several countries were held to purchase a territory to establish a \"non-micro\" state: these included Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, The Gambia, Antigua and Barbuda and Kiribati. In early 2017, it was reported that the Romanov Empire's founder Bakov was interested in acquiring three islands belonging to Kiribati in order to establish a \"revived Romanov Empire\". On 24 February 2017, the Kiribati government rejected Bakov's proposal for the islands. Bakov later claimed it wasn't the final decision and that it was related to an inner Kiribati political struggle. \n\nOn 1 December 2017, the Memorandum of Friendship and Cooperation between The Republic of The Gambia and Romanov Empire was signed in Banjul by the Secretary General of The Gambia, Dawda Fadera, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romanov Empire, Modou Lamin Saidykhan, and on 6 December Bakov stated that the Romanov Empire was in talks with five other undisclosed countries. However, on 12 December the Gambia denied that such a memorandum was signed.\n\nBakov declared the new Russian Empire to be the successor to the historical Russian Empire that ceased to exist in 1917. The Imperial Throne also claimed the right to maritime territories that were either claimed by the Russian Empire or discovered by the Imperial Russian Navy but never absorbed into the Soviet Union. The 17 claimed territories include the entire continent of Antarctica and land under the jurisdiction of Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other nations.\n\nBakov declared himself prime minister and announced a constitution and state symbols. The empire began to issue its own passports online for 1,000 rubles (US$31), and by 2014 it claimed it had granted about 4,000 passports to citizens.\n\nProponents of the new Russian Empire purport it to be the successor of the historical Russian Empire founded by Peter the Great in 1721. As such, the nation stakes its claim to unpopulated territory that belonged to the historical Russian Empire through \"right of discovery\", but which was not claimed by the Soviet Union after the 1917 Russian Revolution. It does not claim land that was part of the historical Russian Empire that is now part of Finland, Poland, or the former Soviet republics.\n\nIn June 2012, Bakov registered the Monarchist Party with the Russian Ministry of Justice, with a stated goal of restoring the monarchy to Russia in accordance with law. It is the only legalised monarchist party in Russia. In the fall of 2013, Bakov's daughter Anastasia Bakova (Анастасия Бакова) was the Monarchist Party's candidate in the mayoral elections in Yekaterinburg.\n\nIn July 2013, Bakov claimed his nation granted citizenship to the stateless Edward Snowden, who at the time was in Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport seeking amnesty in Russia.\n\nOn 31 March 2014, under the new name of the Imperial Throne, the micronation issued a manifesto announcing itself a sovereign nation and declaring that Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (born 1952) had become its head with the title of \"Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia\", as a successor to Nicholas II. The title claim emerged upon the Prince's conversion from Lutheranism to Eastern Orthodox Christianity on 1 June 2013.\nKarl Emich descends from the House of Romanov through his grandmother, Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna (1907-1951), eldest child of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, who in 1924 claimed the Russian crown from exile following the execution of his cousin Nicholas II in 1918.\n\nThe Imperial Throne claimed that by his conversion, Prince Karl Emich had fulfilled the accession requirements of Articles 35 and 53 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire last established in 1906. Prince Karl Emich accepted the Orthodox name \"Nikolai Kirillovich\" (Николай Кириллович) to become \"Nicholas III\", and his (third) wife, \"née\" Countess Isabelle von und zu Egloffstein, who also converted, accepted the name \"Yekaterina Fyodorovna\" (Екатерина Фёдоровна).\n\nThe manifesto and new constitution, signed by Nicholas III, proclaimed the goal of the Imperial Throne as consolidating people all over the world devoted to Christian monarchism. In this document, the Imperial Throne renounced all territorial claims of the Russian Empire (micronation).\n\nRomanov Empire aims to use modern technologies and plans to use cryptocurrencies, declaring bitcoin the national currency and seeking investments via Initial coin offering.\n\nAccording to its constitution, \"the Imperial Throne is a sovereign state, a constitutional monarchy, the successor of the All-Russian Imperial Throne, and its claimed \"predecessor\", the Roman and Byzantine thrones. Romanov Empire is the only state in the world in which the principle of sortition is used to form the upper House of Parliament of the State Duma.\"\n\nThe nation's website proclaims a council of ministers (similar to the council of ministers set up by the actual Russian Empire), composed of the following:\n\n\nAfter he was named Emperor, Nicholas III wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin requesting land in Yekaterinburg to establish a capital with its own imperial senate. The request was denied.\n\nIn 2014, Bakov announced that he had purchased a plot of land in Nikšić, Montenegro to build an imperial palace along with a Russian cultural center and Orthodox monastery. \nAlso in early 2015 Imperial Throne representatives claimed to be in talks with the authorities of the neighboring Republic of Macedonia and Albania on possible collaboration and future state recognition. Bakov held a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski. Later there were talks with President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh at the 70th UN General Assembly session. Also, talks were held with Macedonian and Montenegro Eastern Orthodox clergy — Bakov discussed creation of churches associated with Imperial Throne and proposed canonization of Russian ruler Ivan III and his wife Sophia Palaiologina, who played significant roles in bringing Christian monarchy to Russia. Talks with Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, also took place.\n\nIn May 2016 talks were held with the government of Kiribati. Later in 2016 talks were continued and in early 2017 it was announced by Radio New Zealand that the Kiribati government had agreed to assign three uninhabited islands in its Line Islands: Malden Island (for the Capital), Caroline Island and Starbuck Island. This may indicate future state recognition, and transformation from micronation to sovereign nation. Later updates clarified that there are plans for an immediate injection of US$120 million into the Kiribati economy that will be followed by US$230 million of investments in construction of infrastructure at Malden island: hotels, fish factories and more. According to Bakov, \"a great number of Russian patriots who are not happy with Putin’s regime\" are expected to arrive when the initial constructions are completed. From these times, the project has been branded under the new main name of the Romanov Empire.\n\nBakov has been in similar talks with Gambia since 2012. In December 2017 he announced that the proposed declaration of partnership was finally signed and new Gambia authorities, headed by Adama Barrow, had recognised the Romanov Empire. Bakov's land development companies now plan to create artificial islands in the vicinity of Gambia's capital, Banjul, to establish territory for the Empire. The 6-year design works and talks took $6 million, and follow by talks on recognition with five other undisclosed countries. Furthermore, Bakov has proposed that Russian Olympic athletes, who were recently denied attendance to the 2018 Winter Olympics, compete under Romanov Empire flag.\n\nThe coat of arms of the \"Russian Empire\" consisted of a double-headed eagle. The flag of the empire is the St. Andrew's Cross, which was the Russian Navy Ensign.\n\nWith the transformation into the Imperial Throne, the coat of arms was changed to a black Russian Imperial Eagle with the Chi Rho symbol in the escutcheon. Bakov emphasized the Chi Rho symbolizes the formation of the Christian Monarchy in the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great who saw the symbol in the skies before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. The eagle holds in its talons the sceptre and globus cruciger, two of the most prominent symbols of Christian monarchy.\n"}

They are usually multilingual, also speaking German (both the standard variety and the local Swiss German) and sometimes Italian, which are the other official languages of Graubünden, the canton where they are concentrated.\n\nThey make up about 1% of Switzerland's population and 15% of Graubünden's.\n\nThe Romansh people began advocating for an end to German dominion over them starting with World War I. In 1937 the Swiss government recognized the Romansh language for the first time as one of Switzerland's four national languages, though only for use within the canton, not at the federal level.\n\nThe Romansh people appeared to be mostly satisfied with this status until the 1980s when debate arose over Switzerland's relationship with the greater European continent and the concept of the European Union began to form. The Romansh people advocated heavily for Switzerland's membership in the Union, but the referendum to join it was narrowly defeated in 1992 by the German majority and Switzerland remained a nation apart with the Romansh people a nation apart within it though with ever-increasing sovereignty and recognition at the federal level to the point that Romansh is now considered one of the official federal languages of the Swiss Confederation.\n\nThe Romansh national leadership in Switzerland expressly stated its interest in Switzerland joining the European Union in terms of a pro-European stance and not an anti-Swiss-Confederation one, openly recognizing that the Confederation, though dominated by the German Swiss and with large Swiss French and Swiss Italian contingents, had sheltered the tiny Romansh minority population for nearly 200 years, never engaging in programs to erase their identity or language nor forcing them to relocate to accommodate any other ethnic group as had been the norm with a variety of other ethnic minorities throughout Europe. Though there have been some stumbling blocks, the history of the relationship between the Romansh people and the other ethnic peoples of Switzerland appears to have been and continues to be an unusually polite and respectful one.\n\n"}

So, the Sri Sivasubramaniar Temple in Adliswil was founded in 1994 as a non-profit foundation. While some 5,000 Indian Hindus in Switzerland founded their own cultural associations, but not a temple, the Tamil Hindus opened 19 houses of worship since the 1990s. Because the premises in Adliwil have become too small, the community decided also to move to Dürnten.\n\nThe opening ceremony was set on 27 January 2010, although the granting of the canton of Zurich for the opening was not given yet. The temple's priest Kurukkal told in an interview, \"according to the Hindu horoscope, the temple had to been opened in January\". Because the building is located at a cantonal road, there is even needed the granting of the canton, thus to the municipal permission was given, but therefore the municipality could not formerly grant the approval for the construction. The municipal council of Dürnten supported the plans for the temple. To express his goodwill to the Tamil community, in November 2009 the municipal president participated of the ritual worship, which took place in the context of the laying of the foundation stone. Initiated was the construction by the \"Sri Vishnuthurkkai Amman\" community by Swiss Tamil citizens. In addition to several local craftsmen, eight men from South India have collaborated to build the temple.\n\nThe temple is located in a pre-existing warehouse, with floor heating, new sewer lines and a new kitchen subsequently installed. The main altar is located in the middle of the biggest room. Several lions, the mounts of the Hindu Goddess \"Durga\", enthrone on the dome above the decorated portal, as well as the deities and the other colorful altars with their small turrets, which were built on the walls of the room – they all were shipped from India. The Temple is located at Ediker Strasse 24, 8635 Dürnten.\n\nTo move from the Sihl Valley to Dürnten was \"perfect\" – among other things, the building is furthermore located in a valley and on a stream, as for the temple festival the flowing water is of particular importance. \n\nEvery Friday evening between 100 and 150 people attend the \"Pooja\", and on other weekdays 10 to 20 attend. Six services per day are held. Usually in July a ten-day temple festival, dedicated to the Hindu Goddess \"Durga\", is celebrated, having about 4,000 visitors.\n\n"}
{"id": "7193068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7193068", "title": "Stage theory", "text": "Stage theory\n\nStage theories are based on the idea that elements in systems move through a pattern of distinct stages over time and that these stages can be described based on their distinguishing characteristics. Specifically, stages in cognitive development have a constant order of succession, later stages integrate the achievements of earlier stages, and each is characterized by a particular type of structure of mental processes which is specific to it. The time of appearance may vary to a certain extent depending upon environmental conditions.\n\n\"Stage theory\" can also be applied beyond psychology to describe phenomena more generally where multiple phases lead to an outcome. The term \"stage theory\" can thus be applied to various scientific, sociological and business disciplines. In these contexts, stages may not be as rigidly defined, and it is possible for individuals within the multi-stage process to revert to earlier stages or skip some stages entirely.\n\nJean Piaget's theory consists of four stages: Sensorimotor: (birth to 2 years), Preoperations: (2 to 7 years), Concrete operations: (7 to 11 years), and Formal Operations: (11 to 16 years). Each stage has at least two substages, usually called early and fully.\n\n\nThis stage is represented when infants obtain some control over their surroundings by sensory and motor schemes. Infants start to identify their actions and the consequences of their actions. \n\nA child comes into the world knowing almost nothing, but they have the potential that comes in the form of: \n\nInfants use these potentials to explore and gain an understanding about themselves and the environment. They have a lack of object permanence, which means they have little or no ability to conceive things as existing outside their immediate vicinity. For example: when you place a barrier, such as a piece of wood, in front of an object an infant will believe that the object is nonexistent.\n\nStudy \n\n\nThis play does not provide a purpose other than sensation:\n\nPreoperational intelligence means the young child is capable of mental representations, but does not have a system for organizing this thinking (intuitive rather than logical thought).\nThe child is egocentric – which is they have problems distinguishing from their own perceptions and perceptions of others.\nA classic example is, a preoperational child will cover their eyes so they can not see someone and think that that person can not see them either.\n\nThe child also has rigid thinking, which involves the following:\n\nThe concrete operational child will overcome the aspects of rigidity apparent in a preoperational child. These are:\nThe tasks of concrete operations are:\n\nIt is important to realise that operations and conservations do not develop at the same time. They develop gradually and are not an ‘all or nothing’ phenomenon. For example, the first to develop is number conservation followed by mass conservation, area conservation, liquid conservation and finally solid volume conservation.\nThinking is not abstract. It is limited to concrete phenomena and the child’s own past experiences.\n\n\nA popular criticism is that Piaget underestimated the abilities of an infant. Studies have shown that they have more of a capacity in memory and understanding of objects than he believed. \n\nJuan Pascaual-Leone was the first to propose a neo-Piagetian stage theory. Since that time there have been several neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development. Only the ones that cover at least infancy through adulthood are mentioned here. These include the theories of Robbie Case, Grame Halford, Andreas Demetriou and Kurt W. Fischer. The theory of Michael Commons' model of hierarchical complexity is also relevant. The description of stages in these theories is more elaborate and focuses on underlying mechanisms of information processing rather than on reasoning as such. In fact, development in information processing capacity is invoked to explain the development of reasoning. More stages are described (as many as 15 stages), with 4 being added beyond the stage of Formal operations. Most stage sequences map onto one another. PostPiagetian stages are free of content and context and are therefore very powerful and general.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to her death, Todd had posted a video on YouTube in which she used a series of flash cards to tell her experience of being blackmailed into exposing her breasts via webcam, and of being bullied and physically assaulted. The video went viral after her death, resulting in international media attention. The video has had more than 12 million views as of August 2018. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and British Columbia Coroners Service launched investigations into the suicide.\n\nIn response to her death, Christy Clark, the Premier of British Columbia, made an online statement of condolence and suggested a national discussion on criminalizing cyberbullying. Also, a motion was introduced in the Canadian House of Commons to propose a study of the scope of bullying in Canada, and for more funding and support for anti-bullying organizations. Todd's mother Carol established the Amanda Todd Trust, receiving donations to support anti-bullying awareness education and programs for young people with mental health problems.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Todd posted a 9-minute YouTube video entitled \"My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm\", which showed her using a series of flashcards to tell of her experiences being bullied. The video post went viral after her death on October 10, 2012, receiving over 1,600,000 views by October 13, 2012, with news websites from around the world linking to it.\nDuring the video, Todd writes that when she was in grade 7 (2009/2010), around the same time she moved in with her father, she used video chat to meet new people over the Internet and she received compliments on her looks. A stranger convinced Todd to bare her breasts on camera (an exploitive phenomenon known as \"capping\", short for screen capturing), following one year of attempts at having her do so. The individual later blackmailed her with threats of providing the topless photo to her friends unless she gave him a \"show\"; she also featured briefly, albeit circumstantially, on the faux animated news show \"Daily Capper\" on BlogTV in an incident which attracted the vigilante attentions of the group Anonymous after her suicide. An episode of \"Daily Capper\" which attempted to take the moral high ground, very different in tone from their usual exploitative material, was released a month after her death.\n\nTodd wrote that during the Christmas 2010 break, police informed her at 4:00 a.m. that the photo was circulating on the Internet. She wrote that she experienced anxiety, depression, and panic disorder due to her experiences of being sexually exploited online and being cyberbullied. Her family moved to a new home, where Todd later stated that she began using drugs and alcohol.\n\nA year later, the individual reappeared, creating a Facebook profile which used the topless photograph as the profile image, and contacting classmates at her new school. Again Todd was teased, eventually changing schools for a second time. She wrote that she began chatting to \"an old guy friend\" who contacted her. The friend invited Todd to his house, where they had sex while his girlfriend was on holiday. The following week, the boy's girlfriend and a group of about 15 others confronted Todd at school, shouting insults, with the boy's girlfriend punching her; Todd fell to the ground, then lay in a ditch where her father found her. Following the attack, Todd attempted suicide by drinking bleach, but she survived after being rushed to hospital to have her stomach pumped. \"It killed me inside and I thought I was gonna actully die\", Todd commented in her video about drinking bleach.\n\nAfter returning home, Todd discovered abusive messages about her suicide attempt posted to Facebook. In March 2012, her family moved to another city to start afresh, but Todd was unable to escape the past. According to her mother, \"Every time she moved schools he would go undercover and become a Facebook friend. What the guy did was he went online to the kids who went to (the new school) and said that he was going to be a new student – that he was starting school the following week and that he wanted some friends and could they friend him on Facebook. He eventually gathered people's names and sent Todd's video to her new school\", including students, teachers and parents. Six months later, further messages and abuse were still being posted to social networking sites. With Todd's mental state worsening, she began to engage in self-mutilation and cutting. Despite taking her prescribed anti-depressants and receiving counseling, she overdosed and was hospitalized for two days.\n\nTodd was taunted by other students at her school for her low grades, a consequence of a language-based learning disability, and for the time she spent in hospital to treat her severe depression. \"It didn't really help that after she got out of the hospital recently some kids started calling her 'psycho' and saying she had been in the crazy hospital,\" her mother said. \"She went to the hospital, she had therapy, she had counselling, she was on a good track. On the day she gets out, that happens. I shake my head and I think, 'Are kids really that nasty, do they really not think, what if it was them?'\"\n\nOn October 10, 2012, at about 6:00 PM (PDT), Todd was found hanging at her home. At the time of her death, Todd was a grade 10 student at CABE Secondary in Coquitlam, a school that caters to students who have experienced social and behaviour issues in previous educational settings.\n\nA preliminary investigation by British Columbia Coroners Service showed that Todd's death was a suicide. The cause of death was reported in some media as hanging, however the exact cause of death has not been released.\n\nBoth the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and British Columbia Coroners Service launched an investigation with twenty full-time investigators working on the case. The Coquitlam and Ridge Meadows serious crime teams cooperated in a full investigation, conducting interviews and examining potential factors that may have contributed to Todd's death. Investigators are reviewing content at social media sites and are actively monitoring pages.\n\nThe Canadian national organization Cybertip.ca reported having received a tip about Todd nearly one year before her suicide. The anti-child-exploitation group stated that, in November 2011, a concerned citizen reported that images of Todd were in circulation on the Internet. That information was provided to law enforcement as well as child welfare agencies. According to the CBC news program, \"The Fifth Estate\", the RCMP were contacted repeatedly that the juvenile was being sexually extorted by an adult male, and in response the RCMP told the family there was \"nothing that could be done\" about it. According to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), however, the crime of \"sextortion\" is investigated quite successfully.\n\nFollowing an investigation by Facebook's security unit, whose report was forwarded by U.S. authorities to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre attached to the British National Crime Agency, and then to Dutch authorities, in January 2014 Dutch police arrested a man in a case involving multiple victims in the Netherlands, U.K., and Canada, having installed spyware on his computers; \"chilling\" chat logs of extortion, numerous images of child pornography, and 5,800 bookmarked names which served as a database of potential victims and their social networks were found. In April 2014, it was reported that Dutch authorities charged a 35-year-old man with dual Dutch and Turkish citizenship (identified only as \"Aydin C.\" within the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch privacy laws) with indecent assault and child pornography. That same month, the RCMP announced that the man had been charged with extortion, internet luring, criminal harassment and the possession and distribution of child pornography for his alleged activities against Todd and other child victims, both male and female. Todd's mother thanked police, but also said that she believed more than one person was involved. On 28 January 2015, CBC News said that Aydin Coban had written an open letter proclaiming his innocence.\n\nSome child pornography charges were dropped by Dutch authorities in October 2015; Aydin Coban's case went to trial in February 2017, and concluded on March 16, 2017. He faced 72 charges of sexual assault and extortion in the Netherlands involving 39 alleged victims (34 young women and five men in countries as various as Britain, Canada, Norway and the United States, and some of whom had been harassed for years); eventually convicted and sentenced on the Dutch charges of internet fraud and blackmail, he faces five separate Canadian charges related to Todd (herself not one of the 39), and it is anticipated that he would be extradited to Canada no sooner than the middle of 2018 whilst serving his Dutch sentence of 10 years and 8 months. Carol Todd expressed relief at the sentence.\n\nTodd's suicide received widespread international media coverage, much of which included a link to Todd's YouTube video and an e-mail address provided by the RCMP appealing for information from the public. Within twenty-four hours of the appeal, over 400 tips were received. The RCMP has stated that its investigation was hindered by the amount of false information in online postings after Todd's death, and scams claiming to raise money for her family.\n\nOn October 19, 2012, a series of vigils was held across Canada and internationally to remember Todd and other victims of bullying. A minute of silence was observed by a quarter of a million students in the Toronto District School Board district. On that same date, Todd's mother was a guest of the 2012 We Day event in Vancouver, a week after Todd's death. Bullying had been scheduled as a topic prior to Todd's death and was addressed by speakers Magic Johnson, musician and anti-bullying advocate Demi Lovato and British Columbia Premier Christy Clark.\n\nInitially, Todd's mother was denied entry to an anti-bullying conference for fear that her presence would upset other attendees. The family was invited to attend later events.\n\nOn November 18, 2012, 600 people gathered at a final farewell ceremony for Todd at Red Robinson Show Theatre in Coquitlam, near her home. Todd's mother Carol told the gathering that her daughter has left behind \"a larger-than-life message that has sparked the world and has made it open its eyes, its ears and its hearts\".\n\nInternet hacking and activist group Anonymous alleged that a 32-year-old man was Todd's blackmailer and main tormentor. The group published the Vancouver-area man's name and address on the Internet, resulting in the man's receipt of online threats of vigilante justice. After investigating the tip, police determined that the allegations were unfounded, and said that \"false information that is being spread by people who appear to be trying to use Amanda's story to do harm or make a profit\" was one of the challenges they faced.\n\nAccording to an interview with the \"Vancouver Sun\", the publication of his identity on social media sites resulted in over fifty e-mails and \"thousands\" of Facebook death threats. A member of Anonymous had attempted to dissuade the group from publishing the information, saying that they had the right person, but that the address being published belonged to someone else, not the target. \"Slate\" reported that the person who was actually responsible turned out to be 19 rather than 32.\n\nMichelle Dean of \"The New Yorker\" compared Todd's death to the suicide of Tyler Clementi, an LGBT student at Rutgers University who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge after his roommate encouraged friends to watch a live stream of Clementi kissing another man. In an early piece questioning the assumptions of perpetrators of nonconsensual pornography, she quotes Mary Anne Franks:\nand concludes:\n\n\"Vancouver Magazine\" entitled a piece on Todd \"The Girl Who Woke Up the World\"; in 2012 she was the third-most Googled person, and by 2013 vigils had been held in 38 countries. Her mother herself continues to be the subject of cyber-stalking.\n\nFollowing Todd's suicide, more than one million Facebook users \"liked\" her Facebook memorial page. Mingled among the positive support and comments are continuing attack posts and images from strangers and those claiming to be her former classmates. After one man's derogatory Facebook comments about Todd's death were reported to his employer, the Grafton-Fraser Mr. Big & Tall clothing chain confirmed that he was no longer an employee.\n\nOn October 19, 2012, police in New Zealand said they were questioning a 17-year-old boy from Raglan who allegedly posted \"inappropriate and disturbing images\" on a memorial page for Todd. Police removed the images and shut down the boy's Facebook page.\n\nTodd's suicide engendered the \"Drink Bleach\" Internet meme almost immediately thereafter, and four years after her death she was associated with the 2016 movie \"Suicide Squad\" (along with Adolf Hitler, Robin Williams and Kurt Cobain in one depiction), a meme which her mother regarded as being unhelpful to those at risk.\n\nTodd's mother Carol established the Amanda Todd Trust at the Royal Bank of Canada, receiving donations to support anti-bullying awareness education and programs for young people with mental health problems. (A week after Todd's death, ABC News reported that fraudulent websites had been set up claiming to solicit donations, quoting a statement by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Peter Thiessen: \"Taking advantage of a family's grief is despicable... We want to get the word out that there is one real account and anyone who is interested can make a donation at any RBC branch to the Amanda Todd Trust Account.\") It has since been incorporated as a non-profit colloquially known as Amanda Todd Legacy, with a particular outreach on the mental health issues of adolescents on occasions such as World Mental Health Day on October 10. The Amanda Todd Legacy Award was established in conjunction with the Douglas College Foundation in 2016; three students are awarded $1,000 annually towards their studies. Furthermore Amanda Todd Legacy and Carol Todd have also participated in LGBT advocacy under the aegis of Kids Help Phone, Canada's 24-hour hotline for youth in crisis.\n\nCarol Todd is close friends with Leah Parsons, the mother of Rehtaeh Parsons, and they frequently network on cyberbullying issues. The two women often have speaking engagements about their respective daughters with an emphasis on respect, acceptance, forgiveness and dignity.\n\nOn March 24, 2018 composer Jocelyn Morlock won the Juno Award for Classical Composition of the Year for her piece which was inspired by Amanda Todd; she was joined on-stage by Carol Todd.\n\nIn 2012 a motion was introduced in the House of Commons of Canada by parliamentarian Dany Morin of the New Democratic Party in response to the death of Todd. The motion proposed a study of the scope of bullying in Canada, and for more funding and support for anti-bullying organizations. It was also intended to lay the groundwork for a national strategy to prevent bullying. Morin himself had experienced bullying in school.\n\nIn November 2013 Bill C-13 was introduced by Justice Minister Peter MacKay of the Conservative Party; the cyberbullying and revenge porn legislation's warrantless access provisions were criticized by Carol Todd, who remarked that \"I don't want to see our children victimized again by losing privacy rights\". The definition of cyberbullying itself has been a matter of considerable debate, as have the privacy provisions of the bill (particularly in regards to encryption technologies). It went into effect, however, on March 9, 2015. While it had largely been promoted as protecting minors, it applies to all ages.\n\n"}
{"id": "711640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=711640", "title": "Suspended sentence", "text": "Suspended sentence\n\nA suspended sentence is a legal term for a judge's delaying of a defendant's serving of a sentence after they have been found guilty, in order to allow the defendant to perform a period of probation. If the defendant does not break the law during that period, and fulfills the particular conditions of the probation, the judge usually dismisses the sentence.\n\nIn Australia, suspended sentences are commonly imposed in order to alleviate the strain on overcrowded prisons. For example, an individual may be sentenced to a six-month jail term, wholly suspended for six months; if they commit any other offence during that year, the original jail term is immediately applied in addition to any other sentence.\n\nAs of 1 September, 2014, suspended sentences no longer exist in Victoria.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), both suspended sentences and suspended \"sentencing\" (, also translated as a sentence \"with reprieve\") are featured in the criminal law. In the first situation, a fixed term sentence of three years or below can be suspended. In the second situation, sentencing does not immediately follow the guilty verdict, but instead is determined after a period of probation.\n\nDeath sentences can also be suspended (called a \"death sentence with reprieve\"), so that an offender who does not intentionally re-offend during the two-year suspension period would have the sentence commuted to a life sentence.\n\nA suspended sentence is called \"ehdollinen vankeusrangaistus\" in Finnish, which translates to \"conditional imprisonment\". When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed conditionally, the enforcement of the sentence is postponed for a probation period. The length of the probation period is at least one and at most three years. The probation period begins at the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment. When conditional imprisonment is imposed, the convicted person shall be notified, in connection with the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment, of the date when the probation period ends and of the grounds on which the sentence may be ordered to be enforced. \n\nThe court may order the enforcement of conditional imprisonment if the convicted person commits an offence during the probation period and the charge has been brought within one year of the end of the probation period. In this event, the conditional sentence to be enforced, the sentence for the offence committed during the probation period and the sentences of imprisonment for the other offences considered in the same trial shall be joined as one unconditional sentence of imprisonment. The court may also order that conditional imprisonment be enforced only in part, in which case the remainder of the sentence shall continue to be conditional, subject to the same probation period.\n\nIn the law of the Republic of Ireland, the 2006 law by which a suspended sentence is activated was ruled unconstitutional in 2016. The 2006 law required that a court decision on whether to activate the suspended sentence be made as soon as a later conviction was handed down, even if there was an appeal pending for the later conviction.\n\n are common practice in Japan and can be applied in cases where a sentence is for up to 3 years in prison and/or 500,000 yen in fines. Any criminal activity during the period of the suspended sentence will result in the cancellation of the sentence and imprisonment for the prescribed term.\n\nA suspended sentence can be applied if the term of imprisonment is under two years and the offender agrees to comply with court requirements including a curfew, performing unpaid work and rehabilitation. In 2017, 5% of convictions resulted in a suspended sentence, compared to 7% immediate custodial sentences.\n\nIn the United States, it is common practice for judges to hand down suspended sentences to first-time offenders who have committed a minor crime, and for prosecutors to recommend suspended sentences as part of a plea bargain. They are often given to mitigate the effect of penalties.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the criminal record of the guilty party will still carry the offense, even after probation is adequately served. In other cases, the process of deferred adjudication prevents the conviction from appearing on a person's criminal record, once probation had been completed.\n\nIn the federal system, judges' authority to suspend sentences has been abolished, by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, through the United States Sentencing Commission, and upheld by \"Mistretta v. United States\".\n\n"}

A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- \"together\" and χρόνος \"time\") considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a diachronic approach (from δια- \"through\" and χρόνος \"time\") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. Historical linguistics is typically a diachronic study.\n\nThe concepts were theorized by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, professor of general linguistics in Geneva from 1896 to 1911, and appeared in writing in his posthumous \"Course in General Linguistics\" published in 1916. In contrast with most of his predecessors, who focused on historical evolution of languages, Saussure emphasized the primacy of synchronic analysis of languages to understand their inner functioning, though never forgetting the importance of complementary diachrony. This dualistic opposition has been carried over into philosophy and sociology, for instance by Roland Barthes and Jean-Paul Sartre. Jacques Lacan also used it for psychoanalysis. Prior to de Saussure, many similar concepts were also developed independently by Polish linguists Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and Mikołaj Kruszewski of the Kazan school, who used the terms statics and dynamics of language.\n"}

Eventually, the Nahuatl speakers became the dominant ethnic group.\n\nDespite early attempts by the Mexica, the Tlaxcalteca were never conquered by the Aztec Triple Alliance. The Aztecs allowed them to maintain their independence so that they could participate in the xochiyaoyatl (flower wars) with them to facilitate human sacrifice.\n\nThe Tlaxcaltecs served as allies to Hernán Cortés and his fellow Spanish conquistadors, and were instrumental in the invasion of Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec empire, helping the Spanish reach the Valley of Anahuac and providing a key contingent of the invasion force.\n\nDue to their alliance with the Spanish Crown in the conquest of Mexico, the Tlaxcaltecs enjoyed some privileges among the indigenous peoples of Mexico, including the right to carry guns, ride horses, hold noble title, and to rule their settlements autonomously.\n\nThe Tlaxcaltecs were also instrumental in the establishment of a number of settlements in Northern Mexico (including parts of present-day southeastern Texas), where conquest of local tribes by the Spaniards had proved unfruitful. They were taken to areas inhabited by nomadic bellicose tribes (known as the Chichimeca) to serve as examples for the local indigenous groups of sedentary model subjects of the Spanish Crown and to work in mines and haciendas.\n\nThe Tlaxcaltec colonies in the Chichimeca included settlements in the modern states of San Luis Potosí, Zacatecas, Durango, Coahuila, Nuevo León—Nueva Tlaxcala de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Horcasistas, today known as Guadalupe, and Santiago de las Sabinas, today known as Sabinas Hidalgo—and Jalisco (Villa de Nueva Tlaxcala de Quiahuistlán, today known as Colotlán).\n\nAs of the 2000 Mexican census, there were more than 23,000 speakers of Nahuatl in Tlaxcala.\n"}
{"id": "1710203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1710203", "title": "Toucouleur people", "text": "Toucouleur people\n\nThe Toucouleur people, also called Tukulor or Haalpulaar are a West African ethnic group native to Futa Tooro region of Senegal. There are smaller communities in Mali and Mauritania. The Toucouleur were islamized in the 11th century; their early and strong Islamic heritage, which is seen as a defining feature, is a \"matter of great pride for them\". They have been influential in the spread of Islam to West Africa in the medieval era, later founded the vast Toucouleur Empire in the 19th century under El Hadj Umar Tall that led a religious war against their neighboring ethnic groups and the French colonial forces.\n\nThey speak the Pulaar language, and are distinct from but related to the Fula, Wolof and Serer people. The Toucouleur are traditionally sedentary, settled primarily in the Senegal River valley, with farming, fishing and raising cattle as their main activities. The Toucouleur society has been patrilineal, polygynous and with high social stratification that included slavery and caste system. There are an estimated 1 million Toucouleur people in West Africa.\n\nThey are found primarily in the northern regions of Senegal where they constitute 15% of the population. This region is irrigated by the Senegal River valley, overlaps southern Mauritania. During the colonial era, and in the modern times, some of the Toucouleurs resettled in western Mali. They are about a million Toucouleur people in Senegal River valley area, and about 100,000 in Mali.\n\nThe Pulaar language, also called the Fula or Fulani language, is their first language. It is an Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family of languages. Locally, they are variously referred to as \"\", \"Futanke\", or \"Haalpulaar\" (French literature).\n\nThe name \"Toucouleur\" is of unclear origin, with some sources stating it as a French derivation meaning \"of color\", which may be a folk etymology. Other sources citing it as a deformation of \"tekruri\" a pre-colonial term meaning \"people from Tekrur\", considering them the descendants of the West African kingdom of Takrur that thrived between the 5th and 13th centuries.\n\nAccording to the oral traditions of the Toucouleurs and Serer people, the Toucouleurs are descendants of Serer and Fula ancestors. This tradition is supported by many scholars including Foltz and Phillips. A mutually acceptable bantering-style interaction, called the joking relationship by anthropologists, exists between the Serers and Toucouleurs.\n\nThe Toucouleur people have long inhabited the Senegal River area, with roots of an organized Tekrur kingdom tracing back to the 5th century. They were part of the 10th to the 18th century kingdom, but led by non-Toucouleur rulers from other ethnic groups. In the 18th century, a Toucouleur empire emerged which reached its peak influence in the 19th century under the Islamic leader El Hadj Umar Tall. Umar was born in a Toucouleur clerical family in 1797. During his visit to Mecca in 1827, he was designated as the Caliph of Black Africa. He returned to West Africa in 1833, and learnt political and state building strategies from his father-in-law in Sokoto Caliphate.\nUmar Tall returned to Senegal in 1845, where he began preaching Islam among the Toucouleur people. Umar Tall obtained weapons from Europe, then mobilized the Toucouleur to pursue an Islamic holy war in 1854 against the pagan ethnic groups and those Muslims who have strayed. The Toucouleur armies succeeded. The Toucouleur Empire grew and extended from Senegal to much of Mali over the next ten years. His son Mustafa reigned this empire and Teucouleur people between 1864 and 1870, followed by Umar Tall's second son named Ahmadu Seku. The rule of Ahmadu Seku, state Gallieni and Joffre was a \"Toucouleur-Muslim despot\" over the Mandinka people and Bambara people. The empire collapsed in the 1880s as the Fulani, Tuaregs and the Moors attacked the Toucouleurs, and a civil war between local Toucouleur leaders engulfed the region. The empire ended in 1891, after the French colonial forces invaded the region.\n\nThe Toucouleurs speak the Futa Tooro dialect of Pulaar. They call themselves \"Haalpulaar’en\", which means \"those who speak Pulaar\". They are Muslims. Culturally, the Toucouleur differ from other Fula people by the sedentary nature of their society.\n\nToucouleur society is patriarchal and divided into strict and rigid caste hierarchies.\n\nThe highest status among the five Toucouleur castes is of the aristocratic leaders and Islamic scholars called \"Torobe\". Below them are the \"Rimbe\", or the administrators, traders and farmers. The \"Nyenbe\" are the artisan castes of the Toucouleur society. The fourth caste strata is called the \"Gallunkobe\" or the slaves or descendants of slaves \"who have been freed\". The bottom strata among the Toucouleurs are the \"Matyube\" or slaves. The slaves were acquired by raiding pagan ethnic groups or purchased in slave markets, or the status was inherited.\n\nThe hierarchical social stratification has been an economically closed system, which historically has meant a marked inequality. Property and land has been exclusively owned by the upper caste members. Occupations and caste memberships are inherited. The Toucouleur castes have been endogamous, segregated and intermarriage has been rare. The clerics among Toucouleur like the Wolof people formed a separate group. The religious leaders were not necessarily endogamous nor an inherited post in Toucouleur people's long history, but it has been rare for lower caste people to become religious specialist, states Rüdiger Seesemann, as they were viewed as not sufficiently adhering to the \"clerical standards of piety\".\n\nMarriage among the Toucouleurs requires a bride price payable to the bride's family. A girl from high social status family such as of noble lineage expects substantially higher payment than one of lower status such as artisan castes or with slave lineage.\n\nThe marriage is validated by a mosque. The bride comes to live with her husband's joint family. Traditionally, before the marriage is consummated, the bride's aunt checks if the girl is a virgin, then bathes and massages her. The bride and groom then join in a wedding feast where the village members join in, marking the start of a new couple.\n\nOne week after \"pémbougale\" (childbirth), the baby is named and a \"gorgol\" (sister of the father) cuts its hair. The father tells the marabout the name he has chosen, after which the marabout whispers the name in the infant's ear and prays. Following this, the marabout informs a \"gawlo\" \"griot\", of the name that has been chosen, and the griot announces the name to the village.\n\n"}
