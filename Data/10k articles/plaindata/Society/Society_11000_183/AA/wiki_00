Officially called the Party for the Restoration of Monarchy and Dialogue in Burundi, Abahuza literally means “The Reconciliators” in the Kirundi language. The party was registered with Burundi’s Interior Ministry on September 20, 2004. Since then, the party has achieved wide national and international attention.\n\nThe party was led by Prince Godefroid Kamatari, one of the heirs to the Burundian throne until his death on the 20 August 2005. The main goal of the Abahuza party is the restoration of Burundi’s monarchy, which was abolished in 1966, which it asserts resulted in violent ethno-national conflict between the Tutsis and the Hutus. The ethno-national cleavage in Burundi mirrors that in neighboring Rwanda to the north. During that time, many members of the Tutsi royal family were assassinated by Hutu nationalists, and civil wars have ravaged the small country ever since. According to Abahuza party leaders, a return to monarchy will put an end to the unrest. Prince Godefroid was able to communicate the central ideology of the Abahuza party in his statement that \"the monarchy lasted 500 years in Burundi in a political environment of stability and cohabitation because the King was the symbol of national unity.\"\n\nPrince Godefroid had stated that the Abahuza party sought a constitutional monarchy, like those seen in Europe, as opposed to a totalitarian monarchy. The party chose Princess Esther Kamatari, Godefroid’s sister and a former fashion model in Paris, to run as their presidential candidate in the elections coming up in April. Their hope is to end the ethnic divisions in the country and restore peace and harmony. In addition, the party hopes to reestablish the monarchy through a referendum that would be voted on. According to Princess Kamatari, her first step as president would be to implement a social plan “because the country is in ruins.” This ideology targets the poor and non-intellectual populations in Burundi. The party’s decision to choose Princess Esther Kamatari as their presidential candidate has drawn a greater degree of attention, both nationally and internationally.\n\n"}

Music television announcers were also called video jockeys (VJ).\n\nAnnouncers are often voice actors who read prepared scripts, but in some cases, they have to ad-lib commentary on the air when presenting news, sports, weather, time, and television commercials. Occasionally, announcers are also involved in writing the screenplay or scripts when one is required. Sometimes announcers also interview guests and moderate panels or discussions. Some provide commentary for the audience during sporting events known as sports announcers, parades, and other events.\n\nAnnouncers perform a variety of tasks including presenting news, sports, weather, traffic, and music. Other duties include interviewing guests, making public appearances at promotional events, announcing station programming information. Announcers are also sometimes responsible for operating studio equipment and producing/selling advertisements. It is becoming more common to use social media networking sites to keep listeners up to date. In 2010, the median salary of an announcer in the United States was $27,010. Television and radio announcers generally have a bachelor’s degree in communications, broadcasting, or journalism.\n\nRadio announcers are often known as disc jockeys (DJs). While some read from scripts, others completely ad-lib. These DJs’ tasks consist of on-air interviewing, taking/responding to listener requests, running contests, and making remarks about various subjects like the weather, traffic, sports, and other news. Most radio announcers announce the artists and titles of songs, but don’t necessarily choose what song airs on the radio. Many stations have a management teams who select the songs ahead of time. Today radio stations have DJs update the station’s website with music, guest interviews, show schedules, and photos.\n\nPublic address (PA) announcers work in physical locations, including sporting venues. They will give the attendees information about performing acts, speakers, players, score (such as a goal or touchdown), infractions, or the results of the event.\n\nAnnouncers may be specialized according to sport; for instance, a horse race announcer provides a rapid-fire second-by-second account of the race (as well as introducing the entries before the race), while a horse show announcer is the \"voice of management\" and helps keep the show moving, plays select music and makes announcements during the show. A baseball announcer may simply introduce the next batter or recap the previous half-inning. Public address announcers may be notable due to their longevity, or tenure with a popular team or venue. Some announcers, particularly in horse racing, may also be known for television or radio work.\n"}

Anaya is an independent, non-political, non-profit organization. It is an active organization within Cambodia and in countries with a Cambodian population that has been scattered.\n\nAnvaya has over 300 registered members, collectively called “Anvayiste” or \"Diaspora\", across the world.\n\nThe name Anvaya (in Khmer script: អន្វយៈ) comes from the Sanskrit language and means family or lineage. The Anvaya’s emblem is a set of three lotus flowers, each symbolizing one of the continents of the Diaspora (Europe, America, or Oceania) which together represent Cambodia.\n\nAnvaya was created in 2010 by Soreasmey Ke Bin, a French-Cambodian, and David Yim, a Cambodian-American. Upon returning to Cambodia in the early 2000s, they observed that Cambodians that wished to return to their roots had no kind of support system to help them. They then launched Anvaya as a free social network to gather people looking to return to their roots at regular events.\n\nIn 2013, Anvaya became a fully legal registered association established by Soreasmey Ke Bin, its founding president.\n\nIn 2013, Anvaya was legally registered as an association by its president, Soreasmey Ke Bin.\n\nAnvaya is managed by a steering committee of 6 directors, each of which are elected by 30 members of the permanent council of the association with a two-year mandate. As of August 2016, the president of the association is one of the original co-founders, Soreasmey Ke Bin.\n\nThe main goal of Anvaya is to \"ease the return of the Cambodian diaspora\". Anvaya's 4 key objectives are to:\nAnvaya aspires to catalyze and facilitate the rebirth of Cambodia through the collaboration and support of partners in the private sector, international institutions and government.\n\nAll the members of Anvaya originate from Cambodia and have lived among the Cambodian diaspora communities. They may be in Cambodia or overseas.\n\nIn March 2015, Anvaya had 300 members. Since the beginning of its official registration, Anvaya has counted on the support and the membership of leading characters of the Diaspora, such as the Cambodian society. Current prominent members include: \n\nThe association is financed by donations and membership fees. In 2015 the French Member of Parliament, Thierry Mariani subsidized Anvaya on his diplomatic reserve.\n\nAnvaya has several types of activities to support their members in Cambodia and overseas, including:\n\nAnvaya also holds regular cultural and sporting outings. Some examples include:\n\nAnvaya furthermore has a football team in Phnom Penh, called Anvaya Keila, which may be replicated in Lyon (France). Besides this, some Anvaya members are distinguishing themselves in different sport competitions (tennis, half-marathon etc.…)\n\nAlthough Anvaya is non-political, it keeps a strong open dialogue with Cambodian authorities within the government. For example, in October 2012, Anvaya went to the Royal Palace to pay tribute to the King Father Norodom Sihanouk. Anvaya was invited to this time of remembrance by Prince Norodom Ranariddh to be present in the capacity of an element of the civil society.\nA MOU was signed in March 2014 with the Cambodian Olympic Committee in which Anvaya was to recruit athletes from Diaspora for future sporting events such as the SEA Games and the Olympic games.\n\nIn November 2013, Anvaya signed an agreement with the French Embassy to build a memorial for the victims of the Khmer Rouge. The monument was designed by Ing Séra, a French-Cambodian artist. The project was recognized by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia as a meaningful reparation for Khmer Rouge victims. The construction started in summer 2015, a first piece has been installed in June 2017, and the official inauguration is planned for October 2017. \n\nIn March 2015, Anvaya organized its first Gala known as Anvaya Reatrei. This event gathered more than 150 people and awarded the \"Members of the Year\". Rithy Panh was awarded \"Best Director\", and Thierry Chantha Bin was awarded \"Best Athlete\". The French-Cambodian Borany Mam was awarded the best activist for her association ASPK and their efforts to restore and protect the painting at the National Museum of Phnom Penh. Tony Keo, a Canadian singer, won an award for musical performance. American-Cambodian Chanda Hun won \"Best Entrepreneur\", and Peap Tarr won \"Best Designer\".\n"}

They number around 6,000 and mainly live in Vienna. There is also the very important presence of the Mekhitarist Order in Vienna that plays a major role in the country as well as worldwide.\n\nThe history of Armenians in Austria dates back to the time of Vienna's liberation from the Turkish siege at the end of the 17th century, when several Armenian merchants found a new market in the Habsburg empire.\n\nIn fact, the city's characteristic coffee culture was established and run for a long time in its early decades by Armenian merchants. The very first documented coffee house in Vienna was opened on 17 January 1685, by Johannes Deodat (or Diodato, known in Armenian as Owanes Astouatzatur - Յովհաննէս Աստուածատուր - some sources claiming him to be Greek).\n\nIn 1772-1774, the Austrian Empire annexed Galicia (see Austrian Partition, as part of the late-18th century Partitions of Poland) and especially the formerly Moldavian Voivodeship of Bukovina (see Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca; today a part of the Ukraine), which at the time held the largest area contiguously settled by Armenians in Europe, and the Bukovian and Galician Armenians automatically became subjects to the Empire. In 1775, Maria Theresa gave official permission to the Mechitarist Congregation of the Armenian Catholic Church to settle in the Habsburg Empire. The Mekhitarian congregation in Vienna contributed to the spread of Armenian culture in central Europe through its printing, its library and its college for Armenian boys.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the Austrian Armenians enjoyed officially recognized status as an autonomous religious community. The Armenian community in Vienna grew constantly, so that already in 1896 the first efforts were made to found an Armenian-Apostolic community. In 1912, a small chapel was established in Vienna.\n\nWorld War I and its aftermath transformed the Austrian Armenian community: The area of the Bukovina Armenians was lost during the war, but a wave of immigrants came to Austria as a result of the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks in 1915. After 1918, Galicia became part of a re-established Poland again, while the Bukovina region and much of its Armenian population became part of Romania (and in 1947 was turned over to the USSR and today the Ukraine, which prompted most of its Armenian population to leave to Poland and Czechoslovakia after 1947).\n\nAfter the appointment of the first Armenian pastor in Vienna in the 1920s, the number of Armenians in Austria continued to grow, also boosted by refugees from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, as well as migrant Armenian workers from Turkey and more recently from the Republic of Armenia.\n\nIn 1968, the Surp Hripsime Armenian Apostolic Church of Vienna was consecrated, giving a new impetus to the ever growing Armenian community in Austria. There is also a Saturday Armenian School named Hovhannes Shiraz.\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations in 1996. Armenia has an embassy in Vienna and Austria is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia).\n\nAlthough the monastic headquarters of the Mekhitarist Order founded by Mekhitar da Pietro(1676-1749), an Armenian Catholic monk is on the island of St. Lazarus in Venice (San Lazzaro Monastero Armeno in Italian), the Mechitarists have kept an important presence in Vienna since 1810.\n\nEven much before, actually in 1775, Maria Theresa had already given the official permission to the Mechitarists congregation of the Armenian Catholic Church to settle in the Habsburg Empire and they had established in Trieste.\n\nBy 1810, they established a new monastic center in Vienna using a Franciscan church. When in 1835, the church the Order was using burnt down completely, the Mechitarists hired the services of one of the most famous architects of Vienna of the time Josef Kornhäusel for constructing a new church.\n\nDue to financial issues, the construction of the designed church failed to materialize for a few decades. When the church was finally built, a new architect called Fritz Sitte had already altered the designs considerably. He, and later his son Camillo Sitte finished building the church in 1874.\n\nVienna Congregation is not just a religious center, but a veritable cultural center for Armenians as well. The monks especially cultivated the Armenian language, Armenian history and Armenian literature and published all of the old Armenian writers' works with commentaries under the title of \"National Library\". Aydinian of Vienna wrote the fundamental textbook of modern Armenian grammar in 1866; Tschamtschian (1738-1823) published a 3-volume history in Venice (which then belonged to Austria), and in Vienna Garagaschian (1818-1903) wrote a 4-volume history of Armenia.\n\nThe Vienna branch has been publishing \"Handes Amsorya\", a scholarly publication on Armenian linguistics and philology, since 1887.\n\nThe library of the Mechitarist Congregation, founded in 1773, owns a special collection of Armenian and Oriental manuscripts (approx. 153,000 vols., 2,000 manuscripts, numismatic collection). The Library has recently announced the formation of the digital list of the Library's books and manuscripts available online.\n\nAn association was formed for the propagation of good books worldwide to all Armenian communities, and a high-quality printing press that published average of six new works each year.\n\nA herb liquor called “Mechitharine” and produced by the monks is said to contain 43 herbs and 12 fruits – the precise ingredients and recipe remains is a secret and known by only two monks at a time. The Mechitharine is still produced today and sold commercially by the monks.\n\n\n\n"}

Led by Benjamin Ball and Gaston Nogues, the studio’s work falls between the categories of art, architecture and industrial design. The practice is known for creating site-specific architectural installations out of unorthodox materials such as stainless steel ball-chain and spheres, paper pulp, garments, and coffee tables. The studio focuses on the process of creation, with an emphasis on the research and exploration of materials and fabrication methods. Much of the studio’s work involves expanding the potential of materials and manufacturing techniques.\n\nBall was born in Waterloo, Iowa, where he was influenced by his mother's role as a theater director, while Nogues, from Buenos Aires, was inspired by his father's work in aerospace engineering. The two met as undergraduate students at the Southern California Institute of Architecture in the early 1990s. Upon graduation, Ball worked as a set and production designer for films (including work on the Matrix series), music videos, and commercials with influential directors such as Mark Romanek and Tony Scott. He also contributed to more traditional architectural projects including working on medical facilities, residential projects, and commercial projects such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall. \n\nAfter graduating from SCI-Arc, Nogues moved directly into a position at Gehry Partners, where he worked in product design and production, becoming a specialist in creative fabrication. He remained at Gehry Partners until 2005, except for a one-year stint in 1996 as an assistant curator at a fine arts publishing house, Gemini GEL.\n\nBall and Nogues collaborated on their first joint project, entitled \"Maximilian's Schell\", in 2005. The installation was located in the courtyard of Materials & Applications, an architecture gallery space in Los Angeles, California. The piece was a multi-story structure made of semi-translucent, semi-reflective Mylar petals that resembled a colorful vortex. The work received substantial recognition, including a Los Angeles American Institute of Architects Design Award in 2006, I.D. Magazine’s Annual Design Review for Best of Category for Environments in 2006; and as an Emerging Architecture Finalist for the Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize in 2014.\n\nThe studio has also completed three installations for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival: \"Copper Droopscape\" in 2008, \"Elastic Plastic Sponge\" in 2009, and \"Pulp Pavilion\" in 2015. In 2015, Architect Magazine bestowed the First Award for its 2015 R+D Awards to the studio for \"Pulp Pavilion\", noting that the “project’s innovative design, ambitious scale, and novel use of a recycled material wowed the jury.” The pavilion was made of recycled paper pulp, a material that the studio had been experimenting with and developing for several years. It comprised seven 20-foot-tall woven tree forms and spanned 1,300 square feet.\n\nOther notable works include \"Skin and Bones: Parallel Practices in Fashion and Architecture\", a temporary installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), a temporary event environment for Tiffany & Company’s formal introduction of the Frank Gehry jewelry and accessories line, made of 4,000 layers of corrugated cardboard sandwiched together, and \"Liquid Sky\", a kaleidoscopic Mylar shade structure created by the studio as the winner of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) P.S.1 Young Architects Program competition.\n\n\n\nBall-Nogues Studio has received three American Institute of Architects Design Awards, United States Artists Target Fellowship and a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. In 2007, the Studio was the winner of the Museum of Modern Art PS1 Young Architects Program Competition. Their work is part of the permanent collections of both MoMA and LACMA. In 2011, they were one of the Architectural League of New York’s Emerging Voices and, in 2014, they were finalists for the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture's Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize.\n\nBenjamin and Gaston have taught in the graduate architecture programs at SCI-Arc, UCLA, and USC.

There are also 8,600 Bulgarians in the city of Izmayil (85,100 total population).\n\nOutside Budjak, Odessa has many Bulgarians that have moved there in recent years. The city of Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky is about 4% Bulgarian, making them the third-largest ethnicity there.\n\nThe results of the census held in October 2004, there are 65,072 Bessarabian Bulgarians (1.95% of the population) in Moldova (excluding the region of Transnistria), concentrated mostly in the southern parts — chiefly in Taraclia district. In the census held in November 2004 in Transnistria, 3,164 (3.16%) Bulgarians have been counted in Tighina and surroundings and further 10,515 (2.39%) on the Eastern bank of the river Dnestr.\n\n29,447 Bulgarians live in the cities (and represent 2.26% of the urban dwellers), and 36,215 live in the countryside (1.74% of the rural inhabitants). 90.60% of ethnic Bulgarians were born in Moldova (the national average is 94.6%), 5,968 (9.09%) in other countries that were once in the Soviet Union (the national average is 5.16%), and 199 (0.30%) were born elsewhere.\n\nIn Moldova (and likely Ukraine too, although statistics are not available here), the Bulgarians tend to use their native Bulgarian in rural areas, and Russian (instead of the majority language Romanian) in cities and towns. 53,178 or 80.99% of ethnic Bulgarians declared Bulgarian language as native (69.23% in urban areas, and 90.55% in rural ones), 2,766 or 4.21% of them declared Romanian language as native (4.91% in urban areas, and 3.64% in rural ones), 9,134 or 13.91% of them declared Russian language as native (25.08% in urban areas, and 4.83% in rural ones), and 584 or 0.89% of them declared another language as native (0.78% in urban areas, and 0.98% in rural ones).\n\n35,808 or 54.53% of ethnic Bulgarians declared Bulgarian language as first language in daily use (36.81% in urban areas, and 68.95% in rural ones), 5,698 or 8.68% of them declared Moldovan language/Romanian language as first (7.93% in urban areas, and 9.29% in rural ones), 23,259 or 35.42% of them declared Russian language as first (54.45% in urban areas, and 19.95% in rural ones), and 897 or 1.37% of them declared another first language (0.81% in urban areas, and 1.81% in rural ones).\n\nBessarabian Bulgarians represent 28,293, or 65.56% of the population of the Taraclia district. There are also Bulgarians in Chişinău (8,868, or 1.2%), Găgăuzia (8,013, or 5.1%), Cahul district (5,816, or 4.9%), Leova district (3,804, or 7.4%), and Cantemir district (3,736, or 6.2%). The share of ethnic Bulgarians in Transnistria is 10,515 (2.39%), of which 2,450 (1.55%) in Tiraspol, and 7,323 (8.44%) in Slobozia sub-district (which contains the village of Parcani). There are also 3,001 (3.09%) Bulgarians in the city of Tighina, and 342 in 3 suburbs. In total, there are 79,520 (2.02%) Bulgarians in Moldova, including Transnistria.\n\nBessarabian Bulgarians represent a majority in one city of Moldova, Taraclia (10,732 Bulgarians, or 78%) and in 8 communes in the country:\n\nThe modern population of Bessarabian Bulgarians settled in the region of southern Bessarabia at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, at the time of feudal sedition in the Ottoman Empire, and after the Russo-Turkish Wars of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812 and 1828-1829. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern Bulgaria, but many were also descendants from the western areas of the Bulgarian homelands (as far west as modern-day Albania) but had moved east in and before the 18th century. Alongside the Bulgarians who immigrated to Bessarabia were also a handful of Albanians who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time before.\n\nWhen Russian Armies were reaching and crossing Danube during the Russian-Ottoman Wars, some local Bulgarians supported them. These people were compromised in the eyes of the Ottomans and therefore had a better chance moving to the Russian Empire. The Russian Propaganda also worked to convince Bulgarians to settle in areas recently conquered by them, from which Tatars were removed. Bulgarians settled not only in Bessarabia, but also in the Kherson region.\n\nFor the first time, Bulgarian and Gagauzian refugees in Bessarabia are mentioned in 1769. The 1817 census found Bulgarians in 12 Bessarabian villages in the valleys of the and Lunga Rivers (Creeks): 482 Bulgarian and Gagauzian families and 38 Romanian families in these 12 villages. The leader of the Bulgarians and Gagauzians was a man referred to as Copceac. Seven of the 12 villages were Gagauzian (Baurci, Beşalma, Ceadîr-Lunga, Chessău, Dezghingea, Gaidar, and Tomai), and 5 were Bulgarian.\n\nAfter arriving in Bessarabia, Bulgarians and Gagauzians founded their own towns, such as Bolhrad (1819) and Comrat, and around 64 (according to some sources) or 43 (according to other sources) villages. In 1856, after the Treaty of Paris, two counties of southern Bessarabia, Cahul County and Ismail County, reverted to the Principality of Moldavia (since 1861 – Kingdom of Romania). These included the cities of Bolgrad, Ismail and Chilia. Gaguzian settlements centred on Comrat, however, remained in the Russian Empire. A Bulgarian high school (gymnasium), the Bolhrad High School, was founded in Bolgrad (Bolhrad) on June 28, 1858 by the Moldavian authorities of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, which had a positive effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.\n\nIn 1861, 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to Russia, where they were given land in Taurida Governorate to replace the Nogais who had left what was formerly territory of the Crimean Khanate. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community—the Tauridan Bulgarians.\n\nAfter the whole region of Bessarabia was re-incorporated again by the Russia Empire in 1878, the process of Russification grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established Principality of Bulgaria to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during the Romanian control.\n\nThe whole of Bessarabia united with Romania in April 1918, after the Russian Revolution and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were not returned, as many Bulgarians underwent Romanianization policies.\n\nDuring the Tatarbunar Uprising of 1924, when Soviets unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Romanian administration in southern Bessarabia, many Bulgarians (alongside local Moldovans (Romanians), and Bessarabian Germans) sided with Romanian authorities, as pointed out by Gheorghe Tătărescu in the report given on behalf of the Ministry of the Interior to the Romanian Parliament in 1925.\n\nThe Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 led to a Soviet ultimatum in June 1940, the invasion of Soviet forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion into the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the Bessarabian Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.\n\nA movement of national revival originated in the 1980s, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established, and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the dissolution of the Soviet Union: first only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine was founded in 1993, and Taraclia State University, co-funded by the Bulgarian state, was established in the largely Bulgarian-populated Moldovan town of Taraclia in 2004. The languages of education at the university are Bulgarian and Romanian.\n\n\n"}

A new Chamber of Peers was created which was similar to the British House of Lords, and it met at the Palais du Luxembourg. Like the House of Lords, the Chamber of Peers had a judicial function, being authorized to judge peers and other prominent people. As such, it judged Marshall Ney to death. \n\nThis new Chamber of Peers acted as the Upper House of the French parliament. To begin with it had 154 members, including the holders of all surviving pre-Revolutionary ecclesiastical (Reims, Langres, and Châlons) and lay peerages, except for the Duchy of Aubigny, which was held by a foreigner, the Duke of Richmond. Thirteen peers were also prelates. \n\nNew members were appointed by the king, without limit on their numbers. Such a peerage was either granted for life or was heritable, at the king's will. All men of the royal family and all descendants in the male line of previous kings (\"princes du sang\") were members of the chamber by birth (\"pairs-nés\"), but nevertheless they needed explicit permission from the king to sit at each session of the chamber.\n\nAt the outset comprising only hereditary peers and certain prelates of the church, the Chamber became a body to which men were appointed for life following the July Revolution of 1830. In the Revolution of 1848, the Chamber of Peers was disbanded and the peerage of France was abolished.\n\n"}

After Namibian independence the first Population and Housing Census was carried out in 1991, further rounds followed in 2001 and 2011. The data collection method is to count every person resident in Namibia on the census' reference night, wherever they happen to be. This is called the \"de facto\" method. For enumeration purposes the country is demarcated into 4,042 \"enumeration areas\". These areas do not overlap with constituency boundaries in order to get reliable data for election purposes as well.\n\nThe 2011 Population and Housing Census counted 2,113,077 inhabitants of Namibia. Between 2001 and 2011 the annual population growth was 1.4%, down from 2.6% in the previous ten–year period.\n\nIn 2011 the total fertility rate was 3.6 children per woman, down from 4.1 in 2001.\n\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to only 485 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.4%, 59.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.7% was 65 years or older\n\nRegistration of vital events in Namibia is not complete.

The principal groups are the Ovambo, Kavango, Herero/Himba, Damara, mixed race (Coloured and Rehoboth Baster), White Namibians (Afrikaner, German, British and Portuguese), Nama, Caprivian (Lozi), San, and Tswana. The Coloureds and Basters share similar genealogical origins and cultural attributes (such as home language) but nonetheless maintain distinctly separate communal identities, as do most white Namibians and black Namibians, respectively.\n\nThe Ovambo make up about half of Namibia's people. The Ovambo, Kavango, and East Caprivian peoples, who occupy the relatively well-watered and wooded northern part of the country, are settled farmers and herders. Historically, they have shown little interest in the central and southern parts of Namibia, where conditions do not suit their traditional way of life.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, these tribes had little contact with the Nama, Damara, and Herero, who settled around the central part of the country vying for control of sparse pastureland. German colonial rule destroyed the warmaking ability of the tribes but did not erase their identities or traditional organization. People from the more populous north have settled throughout the country in recent decades as a result of urbanization, industrialization, and the demand for labor.\n\nThe minority white population is primarily of South African, British, and German descent, with a few Portuguese. About 60% of the whites speak Afrikaans (a language derived from the 17th century Dutch), 32% speak German, and 7% speak English.\n\n\nMissionary work during the 19th century drew many Namibians to Christianity, especially Lutheranism. While most Namibian Christians are Lutheran, there also are Roman Catholic, Methodist, Anglican, African Methodist Episcopal, and Dutch Reformed Christians represented.\n\n\nModern education and medical care have been extended in varying degrees to most rural areas in recent years. The literacy rate of Africans is generally low except in sections where missionary and government education efforts have been concentrated, such as Ovamboland.

The Dimasa language is known to Dimasas as \"Grao-Dima\" and it is similar to Bodo, Kokborok and Garo language of India.\n\nThe Dimasa language is one of the oldest languages spoken in North East India, particularly in Assam. The word Dimasa etymologically translates to \"Son of the big river\" (Dima-river, sa-sons), the river being the mighty Brahmaputra. The Dimasa word \"Di\" meaning water, forms the root of the names of many of the major rivers of Assam and of North East India in general, such as Doigrung which means narrow river, Doyang which means huge river, Dikrang, which means green river, Dikhow, which means fetched water, and many others. The mighty river Brahmaputra is known as Dilao (long river) among the Dimasas even now. Many of the important towns and cities in Assam and Nagaland received their names from Dimasa words such as Diphu, Dimapur (a capital of the Dimasa Kingdom), Hojai, Khaspur, etc. In fact, the Dimasa language is one of the last languages of North East India to retain its original vocabulary without being compromised by foreign languages.\n\nDimasa is spoken in:\n\n\nDimasa language is a very mildly inflected language.

For example: \nAng (S) makham (O) jidu(V). That means\nI am having food. Another one, Bo(S) makham jidu.That means - He/she is having food. Thus, we can see that the verb is rarely inflected for person and gender.\n\nIt can also be of the type O+ V+ S.\nFor example:\nMakham(O) jidu(V) ang(S). That also means - I am having food.\n\nDimasa is written using the Latin script, which has been introduced in the lower primary education system in Dima Hasao District. The main guiding force behind it is the Dimasa Lairidim Hosom, a literary apex body of the Dimasa community.\n\nThe Bengali script is used in Cachar, where the Bengali people live alongside Dimasas.\n\n"}

{"id": "23411682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23411682", "title": "Gambling on papal elections", "text": "Gambling on papal elections\n\nGambling on papal elections has at least a 500-year history. Betting on 16th-century papal conclaves are among the first documented examples of gambling on election outcomes. During the same period, gambling was also common on the outcomes of secular Italian elections, such as that of the Doge of Venice.\n\nThe Republic of Venice forbade betting on the pope's life in 1419, and canceled bets already made. Life insurance policies were often taken out on the current pope, sometimes as genuine insurance by businessmen owed money by the papacy who feared a change of Pontiff, but also a purely speculative venture. Such policies on the lives of popes and other notable figures were forbidden in Barcelona (1435) and Genoa (1467 and 1494).\n\nThe first recorded example of gambling on the candidate to be selected by a papal election occurs with the papal conclave, September 1503, although Frederic Baumgartner, a historian of papal elections, considers it then already \"an old practice\".\n\nDiscussing the election of Leo X in 1513, it has been stated: \n\nBefore and during the papal conclave 1549-1550, many Roman bankers offered betting spreads on the \"papabili\" (cardinals likely to be elected). According to the Venetian Enrico Dandolo, a witness to the conclave, \"it is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll, and that the cardinals' attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands\". Dandolo describes an early example of insider trading. Cardinal del Monte (who was eventually elected Julius III) had eventually started out as the favorite at -1, trailed by Salviati, Ridolfi, and Pole, but Pole was the favorite three days later at 4-1. By December 5, Pole's odds had shortened to 100-95. With the arrival of four additional French cardinals on December 11, Pole's odds drifted to 5-2. On January 22, the odds quoted against the conclave finishing during January were 10-9, against February: 2-1, against March: 5-1, and never: 10-1.\n\nIn March 1591, Pope Gregory XIV imposed a penalty of excommunication against any who wagered on the outcome or length of papal elections (as well as the creation of cardinals), and banned the practice in the Papal States. The canon was abrogated (along with the rest of existing canon law) by Pope Benedict XV's reforms \n\nAccording to a \"New York Times\" article following the papal conclave, 1878: \"The Italians are all superstitious, and all fond of the lottery. Every great event leads to speculation in numbers. The deaths and advents of the Popes has always given rise to an excessive amount of gambling in the lottery, and today the people of Italy are in a state of excitement that is indescribable. Figures are picked out which have some relation with the life or death of Pius IX. Every day large sums are paid for tickets in the lottery about to be drawn.\"\n\nGambling over the outcomes of the papal conclave, 1903 and papal conclave, 1922 was covered in several newspapers. With the 1903 conclave, the Italian government-run lottery offered odds on the pope's death and, had Pope Leo XIII died a week earlier, the government would have lost over $1,000,000.\n\nThere was extensive betting in Britain over the elections of Pope John Paul I and Pope John Paul II, and the English Catholic primate, the Archbishop of Westminster felt it necessary to forbid participation by Catholics.\n\nPaddy Power, Ireland's largest bookmaker, started taking bets on the successor of Pope John Paul II five years before the pontiff's death. British bookmakers such as Pinnacle Sports and William Hill plc also offered such bets, with significantly different odds. Cardinal Ratzinger, the eventual choice of the papal conclave, 2005 as Pope Benedict XVI started out with 12-1 odds, but was a 3-1 favorite at the time of the conclave. Mr. Power, the proprietor of Paddy Power, was evicted from St. Peter's Square by security staff before the start of the 2005 conclave for displaying his betting prices, by what he claims were undercover police officers. Paddy Power alone took over $382,000 in bets on the conclave, making it—according to Mr. Power—\"the biggest non-sports betting market of all time\". \nWith Pope Benedict XVI's resignation on February 28, 2013, Paddy Power's website for Papal conclave, 2013 lists the current successors to Pope Benedict XVI. On March 13, 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected Pope Francis. Prior to Pope Francis' election, the odds were 25-to-1 of Bergoglio becoming pope, according to betting company William Hill Plc. Paddy Power's website also posted 25-to-1 odds shortly before Pope Francis' election.\n\nGambling on Papal conclaves is largely internet based, as most conventional sport books, such as those in Las Vegas, do not accept bets on election outcomes. A handicapper for Bally's and Paris Las Vegas said the casinos refused to accept bets on the election because of \"taste\" concerns. The practice is illegal in the United States under the Federal Wire Act of 1961.\n\nWagering on the Papal conclaves may no longer be considered illegal in the United States. On September 20, 2011, the United States Justice Department reversed its opinion that all forms of internet gambling are in violation of the Federal Wire Act. The ruling states that the prohibition in the Wire Act of using interstate communications for gambling applies only to betting on a “sporting event or contest.” Intrastate betting on the papal conclave may now be legal. However, interstate policy has yet to be determined.\n\nGregory XIV's bull of excommunication as a penalty for such wagers was never specifically rescinded, but was abrogated along with all canon law provisions associated with the Ius Decretalium in 1918.\n\n"}

Membership was initially voluntary, with a minimum age of 15 but no upper limit. From 1942, membership was compulsory for those in the 35 to 50 age bracket.\n\nOne of the key responsibilities of the Home Guard was the mission of destroying any infrastructure, particularly bridges, that could be used by invading Japanese forces. In East Auckland, the Home Guard was predominantly made up of horse-mounted farmers who had been excused from war service. They carried out exercises in 1942 including one in which they tested the time taken to travel from Manukau Harbour to the Waitematā Harbour at Eastern Beach. Farmers with experience from World War I were used to construct beach obstacles such as barbed wire entanglements and to build concrete pillboxes. Eastern Beach had such pillboxes at each end. The long wave radio station at Musick Point was provided with bomb shelters from which emergency radios could be operated. A blackout was imposed and enforced by the Home Guard. The wooden wharf at Bucklands Beach, which was believed capable of aiding a Japanese landing, was demolished in 1942.\n\nMembers of the Home Guard who served for 28 days full-time or 6 months part-time were eligible for the New Zealand War Service Medal. At the peak of its membership, the Home Guard had approximately 119,000-123,000 men.\n\n"}

{"id": "30166730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30166730", "title": "Human trafficking in Namibia", "text": "Human trafficking in Namibia\n\nNamibia is a country of origin, transit, and destination for foreign and Namibian women and children, and possibly for men subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. Traffickers exploit Namibian children, as well as children from Angola and Zambia, through forced labor in agriculture, cattle herding, involuntary domestic servitude, charcoal production, and commercial sexual exploitation. In some cases, Namibian parents unwittingly sell their children to traffickers. Reports indicate that vulnerable Namibian children are recruited for forced prostitution in Angola and South Africa, typically by truck drivers. There is also some evidence that traffickers move Namibian women to South Africa and South African women to Namibia to be exploited in forced prostitution. Namibian women and children, including orphans, from rural areas are the most vulnerable to trafficking. Victims are lured by traffickers to urban centers and commercial farms with promises of legitimate work for good wages they may never receive. Some adults subject children to whom they are distantly related to forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. Small business owners and farmers may also participate in trafficking crimes against women or children. Victims are forced to work long hours to carry out hazardous tasks, and may be beaten or raped by traffickers or third parties.\n\nThe Government of Namibia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the year, the government created a national database on gender-based violence which will include statistics of trafficking and child labor victims, cooperated in a baseline study to assess the scope and scale of its trafficking in persons problem, investigated child labor cases, rescued child victims of labor trafficking, and began renovating buildings to use as shelters for trafficking victims. No suspected trafficking offenders, however, were prosecuted, and traffickers involved in cases of forced child labor received insufficient civil punishments. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2\" in 2017.\n\nThe Government of Namibia modestly increased its anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the year. National police and the Ministry of Justice handled no trafficking cases during the reporting period. In May 2009, the government enacted the Prevention of Organized Crime Act (POCA) of 2004, which explicitly criminalizes all forms of trafficking. Under the POCA, persons who participate in trafficking offenses or aid and abet trafficking offenders may be fined up to $133,000 and imprisoned for up to 50 years. The Act does not differentiate between trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking for non-sexual purposes. In addition, Section 4 of the Labor Act of 2007 prohibits forced labor, and prescribes penalties of up to four years' imprisonment or a fine of up to $2,700, or both. Section 3 of the Labor Act prohibits various forms of exploitative child labor, prescribing penalties equal to those for other forced labor offenses. Penalties for these crimes are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The draft Child Care and Protection Bill is expected to address child trafficking offenses, among other crimes. Government officials are working with the Southern African Development Community to develop model comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation which could be effectively adopted in countries throughout the region. The government neither opened a criminal investigation into any suspected trafficking offenses nor prosecuted any trafficking cases during the reporting period. Officials investigated several cases of child labor; in all instances, offenders were issued compliance orders in accordance with the 2007 Labor Act, but were not arrested or otherwise penalized. The Ministry of Labor removed 17 children found working on farms in Kavango in hazardous conditions and returned them to their parents. Police operated a toll-free hotline for the public to call in with tips on trafficking cases.\n\nDuring 2009, the government increased its efforts to protect victims and ensure their access to appropriate services offered by non-governmental entities, as it continued to lack the financial resources and capacity to directly care for victims. During the reporting period, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare identified 17 cases of children illegally working in the charcoal industry, 88 cases of children performing hazardous labor in other work places, and 57 cases of children in forced labor. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare (MGECW) handled three trafficking cases; the victims were Zambian boys brought into the country by a Zambian trafficker, a girl from Walvis Bay forced into prostitution by her mother, and Namibian girls from Kavango and possibly the Caprivi region trafficked to wine farms in the south for forced labor as babysitters and domestic workers. In 2009, the MGECW created a national database on gender based violence that will include statistics on trafficking and child labor victims.\n\nThe government has no specific formal procedures in place for referring trafficking victims for care, although the police are responsible for finding temporary shelter for all victims as well as medical assistance. The MGECW provided social workers to work in partnership with the police, who counsel or otherwise assist victims of violent crimes, including human trafficking. Law enforcement and other officials referred victims to NGOs and other entities that provided short-term shelter facilities. Officials were aware that the shelters are often full and cannot accommodate all victims who need assistance. Neither long-term shelter facilities nor services designed to meet the specific needs of victims of trafficking existed in Namibia. The Woman and Child Protection Unit (WACPU) of the Namibian Police Force designated examination rooms in major hospitals for treatment of victims of violent crimes that are staffed by physicians trained to deal with trauma victims, including victims of trafficking. WACPU also had referral agreements with two NGOs to provide victims of trauma with counseling and legal services that were available to trafficking victims. The government subsidized some shelter facilities for victims of gender-based violence and the worst forms of child labor which may have unknowingly aided trafficked women and children. Officials began renovating 13 government-owned buildings, one in each region, to be used as shelters for women and child victims of gender-based violence and human trafficking, but these facilities would most likely not provide services for men. The Namibian legal system provided protection to victims who wish to testify against their abusers, as well as a legal alternative to foreign victims' removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution through provisions in other laws. Official understanding of what constitutes human trafficking remained limited, and it is possible that trafficking victims were jailed or prosecuted for violating laws related to immigration and prostitution before they were identified as victims.\n\nThe Namibian government made efforts during the year to raise awareness of trafficking throughout the country. The government conducted a media campaign against gender-based violence and trafficking, in which it encouraged victims and members of the public to report suspected trafficking offenders and assist in investigations and prosecutions. Fewer WACPU and MGECW officials received training to identify victims of trafficking in the reporting period than in previous years. The government did not provide specific training on identifying and assisting Namibian trafficking victims overseas to diplomats, but continued to encourage them to maintain relations with NGOs that follow trafficking issues. During the year, the Ministry of Home Affairs forged a partnership with UNICEF to open offices at hospitals and deploy mobile units throughout the country to provide birth certificates for newborns and identity documents for orphans and vulnerable children. The government made no discernible efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period.\n"}
{"id": "51161956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51161956", "title": "Immigration and crime in Germany", "text": "Immigration and crime in Germany\n\nCrimes are committed against and by immigrants in Germany. Crimes by foreigners (German: \"Ausländerkriminalität\") has been a longstanding theme in public debates in Germany.\n\nThe (Foreigners Act) of 1965 attempted to control immigration to West Germany.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, a group known as Gastarbeiter participated in an organised immigration programme to the former West Germany because of labour shortages in the country. The former East Germany also had labour shortages but their \"guest worker\" programme tended to encourage immigration from other socialist and communist countries. Many former \"guest workers\" became German citizens. The first generation of \"guest workers\" did not have an elevated crime rate, second- and third-generation immigrants studied in the 1970s and 1980s had higher crime rates than their German contemporaries who were not from an immigrant background.\n\nA 1991 Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich study covering the preceding two decades found that crime rates were higher among immigrants with a strongly different cultural background from Germans. Under the guest worker programme, Turks and Yugoslavs had far higher crime rates than Spaniards and Portuguese, while the highest crime rates were recorded among individuals from third world countries. For third world countries, the immigrants were first generation.\n\nStudies in the 1990s showed a correlation between immigrant populations in Germany and crime. \n\nThe 1999 bill making naturalisation of immigrants contingent upon a written declaration that the applicant was loyal to the Constitution, competent in German language, not dependent on welfare and had no criminal record was the first piece of legislation to mention crime in relation to immigration.\n\nStudies in the early 2000s tended to show little correlation between migrants and crime in Germany. \n\nFrom the start of 2015 to the end of 2017, asylum seekers were registered in total. According to a 2018 study by German criminologists, the crime rate of non-Germans between the ages of 16 and 30 is within the same range as that of Germans.\n\nIn May 2016, U.S. fact-checker Politifact noted that 2016 data suggest that the crime rate of the average refugee is lower than that of the average German. In 2018 the interior ministry's report \"Criminality in context with immigration\" (German: \"Kriminalität im Kontext von Zuwanderung\") for the first time summarized and singled out all people who entered Germany via the asylum system. The group called \"immigrants\" includes all asylum seekers, tolerated people, \"unauthorized residents\" and all those entitled to protection (subsidiary protected, contingent refugees and refugees under the Geneva Convention and asylum). The group represented roughly 2 percent of the German population by end of 2017, but was suspected of committing 8.5 percent of crimes (violations off the German alien law are not included). The numbers suggest that the differences could at least to some extent have to do with the fact that the refugees are younger and more often male than the average German. The statistics show that the asylum-group is highly overrepresented for some types of crime. They account for 14.3 percent of all suspects in crimes against life (which include murder, manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter), 12.2 percent of sexual offences, 11.4 percent of thefts and 9.7 percent of body injuries The report also shows differences between the origin of migrants. Syrians are underrepresented as suspects, whereas citizens from most African countries, especially northern Africans are strongly overerrepresented. Afghans and Pakistani are particularly overerrepresented at sexual offenses.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2016, the number of suspected crimes by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants increased by 50 percent. The figures showed that most of the suspected crimes were by repeat offenders, and that 1 percent of migrants accounted for 40 percent of total migrant crimes. From 2016 to 2017, the number of crimes committed by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants in Germany decreased by 40 percent, which was mostly caused by significantly less violations off the alien law, because far fewer asylum seekers entered the county in this year.\n\nThe first comprehensive study of the social effects of the one million refugees going to Germany found that it caused \"very small increases in crime in particular with respect to drug offenses and fare-dodging.\" A report released by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation in November 2015 found that over the period January–September 2015, the crime rate of refugees was the same as that of native Germans. According to Deutsche Welle, the report \"concluded that the majority of crimes committed by refugees (67 percent) consisted of theft, robbery and fraud. Sex crimes made for less than 1 percent of all crimes committed by refugees, while homicide registered the smallest fraction at 0,1 percent.\" According to the conservative newspaper Die Welt's description of the report, the most common crime committed by refugees was not paying fares on public transportation. According to Deutsche Welle's reporting in February 2016 of a report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, the number of crimes committed by refugees did not rise in proportion to the number of refugees between 2014-2015. According to Deutsche Welle, \"between 2014 and 2015, the number of crimes committed by refugees increased by 79 percent. Over the same period, the number of refugees in Germany increased by 440 percent.\"\n\nDW reported in 2006 that in Berlin, young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their German peers. \n\nWhereas the Gastarbeiter in the 50s and 60s did not have an elevated crime rate, second- and third-generation of immigrants had significantly higher crime rates.\n\nA study in the \"European Economic Review\" found that the immigration of more than 3 million people of German descent to Germany after the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a significant increase in crime. The effects were strongest in regions with high unemployment, high preexisting crime levels or large shares of foreigners.\n\n\"The Independent\" reported that in 2017 crime in Germany was at its lowest for 30 years, and that crimes by non-Germans had fallen by 23% to just over 700,000.\n\nIn 2018, the \"Wall Street Journal\" analysed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart. \n\nBy the 2010s most organized crime in Germany was committed by citizens of other countries. In 2017 proportion of non-German citizen suspects increased from 67.5% to 70.7% while the proportion of German citizens decreased correspondingly. For the German citizens, 14.9% had a different citizenship at birth. \n\nFor several types of crime and drug crime in particular, organised crime gangs were dominated by people from countries with high rates of immigration to Germany. In 2017, the most common nationality of foreign organized crime gangs was Albanian with 21 gangs, the great majority of which were active in drug trafficking. In 2017 there were 13 identified Serbian organized crime gangs, active in drug crime, property crime and violent crime. In 2017 there were 12 Kosovar gangs, active in property crime, drug trade and forgeries. Syrian gangs were active in drug trade and drug smuggling. \n\nArab and Kurdish organized crime gangs have their roots in asylum seekers who arrived beginning in the 1980s. In the 1980s thousands of Arabs and Kurds from districts of Lebanon and Turkey, significant portions of whome were stateless, sought asylum in Germany. Unlike the earlier guest workers, were allowed to work but instead received social benefits and often did not integrate into German society. Some of the arrived families instead relied on tribal and Islamic codes of justice. Groups of extended Arab and Kurdish families centered in Berlin are active in selling illegal drugs and running illegal prostitution, but have invested in legal businesses including real estate, fitness studios, gambling and restaurants. They exploit asylum seekers who arrived in the European migrant crisis of 2015-2016, employing them as streetcorner durg dealers.\n\nIn 2017, 16 Nigerian crime gangs were active in illegal immigration (German: \"Schleuserkriminalität\") drug crime and other offenses in the night life scene.\n\nIn an opinion piece in the \"Sueddeutsche Zeitung\" in September 2018, the political scientist argued that federal authorities had refused to recognise the specific problem of organized crime gangs based on family ties and ethnicity (), subsuming it under \"organised crime\" and that, encouraged by the success of the Arab clans, families from other ethnic groups, including Chechens, Albanians, and Kosovars were developing similar structures. According to Ghadban, these structures present a threat to liberal, individualised societies because they hinder integration. A modern society, he says, only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, but clan members consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country, and do not submit to the rule of law, regarding individuals who do so as weak and unprotected.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the ethnic crime clans represent both a security threat as well as an example of what can happen when integration of immigrants fail.\n\nInvestigating criminal records for partner homicides from the years 1996-2005 period, the BKA concluded that there were about 12 cases of honour killings in Germany per year, including cases involving collective family honor and individual male honor, out of an average about 700 annual homicides. An accompanied study of all homicides in Baden-Württemberg show that men from Turkey, Yugoslavia and Albania have a between three and fime times overrepresentation for partner homicides, both honor and non-honor releated. The causes for the higher rate was given as low education and social status of these groups along with cultural traditions of violence against women.\n\nAfter the gang rapes where immigrants were suspect in Freiburg, Munich and Velbert, an overview of police gang rape statistics in the 2010s was published by Tagesschau in 2018. The profile of the suspects and convicted fit that of sex crime in general as they were almost all male. Additionally foreign perpetrators were overrepresented compared to their share of the overall population in Germany. The absolute number of gang rapes were not increasing, but the proportion of foreign suspects rose and the proportion of Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi suspects rose. One reason cited for the increase was that these demographics have larger proportions of young males, which are inherently overrepresented for crime.\n\nThe number of assault gang rapes were significantly higher in periods prior to 2015 and the European migrant crisis, with the exception of 2016 where the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany nearly doubled the number of cases. In 2017 there were 122 cases, the fewest since the German reunification in 1990.\nKnife attacks strongly rose in the state Baden-Württemberg from 3,858 in 2013 to 4,874 in 2017. The number of suspects of knife attacks who were asylum seekers rose from 220 in 2013 to 898 in 2017. As a reaction to these figures, Interior Minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) asked other German federal states to record knife attacks in their crime statistics.\n\nThe state Bavaria has registered the number of crimes with at least one foreign suspect since 2009. In 2009 there were 5506 such cases, there was an increased to 13 203 crimes in 2014 and in 2016 there were 36 027 such cases. The official Bavarian indirectly attributes the increase to the migration policy of the federal government.\n\nDW reported in 2006 that in Berlin, young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their German peers, although it noted that violent crime was a rare problem in the western German city of Duisburg, where the immigrant population is just as large as it is Berlin.\n\nIn the 90s, police in the Berlin district Neukölln raised concerns about a dozen Lebanese-kurdish families, but their concerns were rebutted with the families being war refugees and they would some day return to their home countries. In 2011, of the 25 Arab extended families (German: \"Großfamilien\") in Berlin, six were heavily involved in crime. According to a migration official in Neukölln, of the 204 young repeat offenders, half had an Arab name. This later turned out not to be the case. In Berlin, clans of Arab descent have organised parallel societies in Berlin and Bremen where they sustain themselves by crime. In Berlin, 20 extended families with each having up to 500 members are established according to estimates of the police, but not all family members are involved in crime. According to the Landeskriminalamt, a third of a all court proceedings against organized crime concerns members of the clans. About half of the clan suspects had a German passport. In July 2018, 77 real estate properties to a value of 10 millon euro were confiscated from Arab clan \"R\" by the authorities as they had been purchased with funds earned by crime.\n\nIn a sample of the 3930 prison population of Berlin 31 March 2018, 51% had no German citizenship. Of the individuals in pre-trial detention facilities, 75% had foreign nationality. Individuals from 90 different countries serve sentences in Berlin prisons.\n\nAccording to the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", of the 2600 \"Mhallami-Kurds\" (German: \"Mhallamiye-Kurden\") 1100 have been indicted for crime in court. This term makes it clear that the controversial Arab families originated in the Kurdish areas of Turkey. The families are noted for their readiness to use violence and attendands threats thereof, which according to police goes beyond mere crime, but serves as a display of power to the surroundings.\n\nBy 2018, crime by ethnically diverse groups (German: \"Clankriminalität\") had taken on proportions which necessitated a response from authorities so two prosecutors were tasked with counter-acting such crime. According to Horst Bien, chief of the public prosecutor's office there are about 70 extended families (German: \"Großfamilien\") of Turkish, Kurdish and Arab descent with about 2800 members. All members of the 70 clans are not involved, predominantly male members are prevalent in judicial proceedings. Commonly the charges involve grievous bodily harm, robbery, extortion and narcotics trade.\n\nHamburg police reported criminal proceedings being opened against 38,000 people in the first six months of 2016, of which 16,600 persons or 43% of the defendants had no German papers. This represents a rise from 41% of defendants without German papers in 2015. The number of foreign criminals increased by 16.7% over 2015; 9.5% of the suspects were refugees. The figures did not include crimes against the German alien law. Foreign crime gangs were named as one reason for the rising figures. Refugees committed mostly pickpocketing, representing 30.6% of all suspects. 27.5% of suspects in drug dealing also arrived as refugees. Another common crime committed by refugees was bodily injury, with 1,014 cases reported, mostly in the asylum centers.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, the Interior Minister of Saxony, Markus Ulbig, released figures about foreign criminals in the state from January to September. A large proportion of them came from North Africa; 664 North Africans were responsible for 36% of all 14,043 crimes committed by immigrants. By the end of October 2016, 31,000 asylum seekers resided in Saxony. In total, in Saxony 7,579 immigrants were perpetrators, counting only solved cases. 5,288 of the crimes were theft and robbery; 2,214 were bodily injury; and 169 were sexual assaults, representing a rise from 25 recorded cases in 2013. \nA 2018 study showed that in Lower Saxony, chosen by the researches because of its typicality, reported violent crime increased by 10.4% in 2015 and 2016, with 92.1% of the increase was attributable to migrants.\n\nAccording to the police union, the German government does not keep a record of knife and blade related crimes as a distinct type of crime. The German Police Trade Union (DPoIG) has highlighted the issue and has sought that carrying a knife—which its members highlights involve \"noticeably\" young migrants — be prosecuted under attempted murder provisions in Germany, and urged government to compile statistics nationwide on knife incidents.\n\nA series of prominent incidents involving knives led to the issue becoming a political issue. These include incidents where an attacker murdered their partner such as the 2017 Kandel stabbing attack, the Reutlingen knife attack, the 2018 Hamburg stabbing attack where a 33 year old from Niger (who arrived to Germany in 2013) stabbed and killed his ex-wife and daughter, as well as incidents like the 2018 Burgwedel stabbing where a 17 year old Syrian who had arrived to Germany in 2003 stabbed and injured a woman following a brawl between two youths in a supermarket, the 2018 Flensburg stabbing incident where a 24 year old Eritrean refugee who arrived in Germany in September 2015 was shot and killed after stabbing a police woman with a kitchen knife, and the 2017 Siegaue rape case where a 31 year old Ghanaian used a Machete in an attack where a victim was raped.\n\nFGM is banned in Germany. According to women's right organisation Terre des Femmes in 2014, there were 25,000 victims in Germany and a further 2,500 are under threat of becoming mutilated. Perpetrators are migrant parents who bring their children abroad, mostly during holidays, for the mutilation or bring foreign doctors - who also become perpetrators - to Germany who mutilate several girls at once. FGM is not only bodily injury, it is explicitely forbidden under German law since June 2013. In 2017, Terre des Femmes estimated that were victims of FGM with a further being at risk of having the procedure done to them. The latter figure was due to an increased influx of migrants from Somalia, Eritrea and Iraq. In 2018, the estimate had increased to . A further were at risk of having the mutilation done to them which represented an increase of 17% on the previous year.\n\nThe long history of Turkish immigration to Germany resulted in Turkish immigrant families becoming one of the largest ethnic minorities in Germany, estimated at between 2.5 and 4 million. Around a third of these still hold Turkish citizenship.\nOn 27 October 1991, Mete Ekşi (), a 19-year-old student from Kreuzberg, was attacked by three neo-Nazi German brothers. Ekşi's funeral in November 1991 was attended by 5,000 people. Aslı Bayram's father was murdered in 1994 by a neo-Nazi and Bayram herself was wounded in the attack.\n\nIn 1993, an arson attack against a Turkish household in the town of Solingen in North Rhine-Westphalia caused the deaths of five people. Ahead of a commemorative event in 2018, 25 years after the event, Turkey's Foreign Office noted that \"racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia are on the rise\" in Germany and a representative of the family who were attacked called for reconciliation. A spokesman for anti-right demonstrators at the commemoration said, \"When you look at how the mood was back then and how it is turning again now, I believe it's important to rally in the streets and to speak out against it.\"\n\nAccording to a 2016 study, there were 1,645 instances of anti-refugee violence and social unrest in Germany during the years 2014 and 2015.\n\nAccording to the German Federal Criminal Office, there were 797 attacks against residences of refugees or migrants from January to October 2016. 740 attacks had a right-wing background, which also couldn't be ruled out in 57 further cases. Of these, 320 cases of property damage were recorded, in 180 cases propaganda material was dispersed and in 137 cases violence was used. In addition, 61 incidents of arson as well as 10 violations of the Explosives Law, 4 of them in front of a residence of refugees, were registered. According to \"Der Tagesspiegel\", there were also 11 cases of attempted murder or homicide. In 2015, there had been 1,029 attacks against refugee residences, following 199 in 2014. Germany's interior ministry stated that 560 people, including 43 children, had been injured in such attacks during 2016.\n\nA 2017 study found that \"the strength of right-wing parties in a district considerably boosts the probability of attacks on refugees in that area.\"\n\nA 2018 paper by the \"Institute of Labor Economics\" found that xenophobic violence during the 1990s in Germany reduced the integration and well-being of immigrants.\n\nVigilantism against immigrants is considered to have become more widespread after the sexual assaults by migrants in Cologne and other German cities on New Year's Eve 2015. In January 2016 a mob attacked a group of Pakistanis in Cologne, and at Bautzen in February, an arson attack on a hostel for asylum seekers took place In February 2018, in Heilbronn, a 70-year-old man knifed three immigrants while drunk, in a protest \"about the current refugee policy\". A perceived increase in attacks on immigrants led to Chancellor Angela Merkel condemning anti-immigrant \"vigilante\" groups following the Chemnitz incident.\nAccording to criminologist Simon Cottee, sociologist Stanley Cohen analyzed fear of immigrant crime among Germans and other contemporary Europeans in the 1960s as a form of moral panic.\n\nFour violent crimes committed during the week of 18 July 2016–three of them, the Reutlingen knife attack, 2016 Ansbach bombing, Würzburg train attack, were committed by asylum seekers–created significant political pressure for changes in the Angela Merkel administration policy of welcoming refugees. The Wall Street Journal reported that two notorious crimes committed by asylum seekers in consecutive weeks in December 2016 had added fuel to debates on immigration and surveillance in Germany. The Siegaue rape case as well as the 2017 Kandel stabbing attack, in which a migrant who had been denied refugee status but who had not been deported killed his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend, intensified the discussion about admitting migrants.\n\nThe 2018 murder of 14-year-old Susanna in Wiesbaden sparked a debate on how the Iraqi migrant and his family were able to leave the country using fake identities along with how the 20-year-old suspect Ali Bashar had been able to stay in Germany after his asylum application was rejected.\n\n"}

In 1945 a conference for members of workers' educational organisations from a number of countries was held in London, where it was resolved to create an international coalition to support collaboration between organisations.\n\nIn October 1947 the International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations (IFWEA) was officially launched at a conference in London where a formal constitution was adopted. Worker representatives from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden attended, while observers from Germany, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the United States of America were present.\n\nA President and Secretary General were elected, and an Executive Committee was appointed with regional representation. Representation is now regularly modified to reflect the federation's membership.\n\nOver the past 71 years membership of IFWEA has increased. , IFWEA has affiliates in more than 30 countries including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nepal, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Philippines, India, Cambodia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Belgium, Bolivia, Peru and the United States of America.\n\nIFWEA helps new organisations, particularly in developing countries, and provides a global space for worker educators to share resources and advance the role of trade unions and community struggles in the transformation of society. An important role is to facilitate information exchanges between members.\n\nThe purpose of IFWEA is to “advance the education of the public with respect to the democratic labour movement; and to promote the carrying out of free and voluntary educational work, according to the principles of solidarity and cooperation, justice and equality, and democracy and freedom”.\n\nThe highest decision making assembly in IFWEA is the quadrennial International General Conference. The General Secretary, President and Executive Committee are elected at this conference. The 22 IFWEA General Conference was held in Lima, Peru in 2015.\n\nThe role of the IFWEA Secretariat is to stimulate the development of a democratic workers’ education movement, by providing contact between member organisations, assisting with the development of partnerships, and promoting best practice in educational design and delivery through the provision of education resources, web communication and learning events such as workshops, seminars and conferences. The IFWEA Secretariat was registered in Cape Town, South Africa in 2009, after the election of IFWEA General Secretary Sahra Ryklief in December 2007. Previously it had been registered in the UK with the Secretariat in Manchester, and prior to that, it was hosted by the AOF Norway, with the Secretariat in Oslo.\n\nArchival records of IFWEA 1945 to 1986 are held at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Library Collections and University Archives at London Metropolitan University, reference code GB 1924 IFWEA. Current records are held at the Institute of The Hague.\n\nThe Foundation Skills for Social Change Certificate Programme (FSSC) provides courses aimed at grassroots leaders in community organisations and trade unions. Past programmes have included courses on youth civic and political mobilisation; participatory learning and research methods; women’s leadership; and organising for the social protection of vulnerable workers. The courses are designed by IFWEA affiliates who have expertise in these fields.\n\nThe Study Circles for Social Change Programme (SCSC) promotes study circles by training potential study circle facilitators. The study circles promote collective learning. The programme also brings study circle facilitators from different countries together online to share information on a global basis. Programmes have also included film clubs, dance clubs and theatre groups for social change.\n\nThe annual Youth Globalisation Awareness Programme (YGAP) run by IFWEA brings together young educators, trade union and youth leaders from around the globe. The programme, run in Cape Town, South Africa, raises awareness around global worker education issues. It is designed to mentor and develop young leaders in the field of worker education.\n\nThe Online Labour Academy is an internet-based resource offering a range of education courses to the labour movement. Online educators can share materials, curricular and information on local, regional and international platforms.\n\n"}

Perhaps the foremost exponent of Islamisation among Pakistan's rulers -- General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq -- advanced a programme in 1978 to bring (according to Zia and his supporters) Pakistan law in line with the principles of Sharia law. \n\nConceived in late 1977 and carried out during his reign, the programme came in response to an upsurge in Islamic activism, and the problems and controversies associated with the policies of Zia's predecessor, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Zia's stated intention was to \"eradicate the scourge of interest\" on loans and securities, and create an \"interest-free economy\". On January 1, 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks, making Pakistan the first country in the Muslim world with Islamic banking.\n\nHowever, in spite of the public support allegedly demonstrated for it (and other Islamisation policies) by the 1984 Islamisation referendum and the programme's initial gains and success, it failed to achieve international targets and to meet commercial interactions with other major international banks. Islamic activists were also displeased that Zia's ordinances and proclamations did not ban interest paying accounts.\n\nZia's successors were not as active in their pursuit of Islamisation. While conservative Prime minister Nawaz Sharif publicly supported Islamisation, his economic policies focused on privatization and economic liberalization. Many Pakistani economists and business people worry that attempting to impose an Islamic economy on Pakistan would have \"devastating economic, political, and social consequences for the country\", though others (such as governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Ishrat Husain), have termed fears of Islamlisation \"absurd\" and based on Western stereotypes. Islamisation has continued through the efforts of the Islamic courts Zia created, including activists on the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court, although it was given a setback when the government of Pervez Musharraf came to power and pressured a number of activist judges to retire.\n\nAs a state created specifically for Muslims, Pakistan has long had Islamic activists advocating for more thorough Islamisation of that country, and specifically for the elimination of \"riba\" (defined as interest on loans). But the country has also had Islamic modernists and secularists in positions of influence and \"generations of Muslim usage and custom supported by the fatwa of respected ulema that held low rates of interest to be acceptable, non-usurious, and not \"riba\"\", according to economist Feisal Khan. Even Allama Iqbal \"the Thinker of Pakistan\" (\"Mufakkir-e-Pakistan\") \"cited approvingly\" the fact that Muslim princely states in India did not restrict modern banking or \"attempt to impose some sort of `Islamic` concept of interest-free financial transactions.\" Consequently enthusiasm for Islamisation has waxed and waned throughout Pakistan's history. It has been strong when \"religious elements are in ascendancy\", such as during partition, the 1977 Nizam-e-Mustafa movement, and during the rise in fundamentalist after 2000. At other times \"only lip service\" is paid to the issue. Maududi and other Islamist hoped to make Pakistan \"a new Medina\" which would become \"the leader of the Islamic world in the twentieth century, a laboratory where experiments in Islamic modernity would be successfully conducted en route' to ushering a new Islamic renaissance\"\n\nAshraf Qureishi and Abul A'la Maududi, two of the pioneer theoreticians of Islamic banking, who preached that interest was riba, forbidden to Muslim, and \"laid the foundations of current\" Islamic Banking and Finance in the 1940, were from South Asia. (Maududi moved to Pakistan where he became an influential Islamist leader.) According to Feisal Khan, \"South Asians in general and Pakistanis in particular are `over-represented`\" among Islamic Banking \"theorist and practitioners,\" and Pakistanis are \"found in Islamic banks and financial firms throughout the [Persian] Gulf at all levels, from tellers to the boardroom.\"\n\nArticle 28 of Pakistan's 1956 Constitution called for the elimination of \"riba\" \"as early as possible\". The 1962 Constitution provided in the principles of policy that \"usury\" should be abolished. Similar provisions were found in the 1973 Constitution. In 1969 the state-sponsored advisory body known as the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), declared that Pakistan's banking system was \"fundamentally based upon \"riba\"\", and unanimously called for its elimination.\n\nThe mid and late 1970s were a time of Islamic revivalism throughout parts of the Muslim world, including Pakistan. Zia's predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto faced economic problems of stagflation and opposition to his programme of nationalization and land reform. In 1976 and 1977, vigorous opposition to Bhutto's policies united under the revivalist banner of \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (\"Rule of the prophet\") and preached that establishing an Islamic state based on sharia law would bring a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet Muhammad ruled Muslims. \nIn an effort to stem the tide of street Islamization, Bhutto also called for Islamisation and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing. Confrontation between Bhutto's PPP and the opposition Pakistan National Alliance, street protests, loss of life and property, all preceded the military overthrow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by Zia in 1977. On coming to power, Zia committing himself to enforcing \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\", a significant turn from Pakistan's predominantly secular law, inherited from the British.\n\nLess than two years after the coup, Pakistan's Shia neighbor, Iran, saw a very unexpected Islamic revolution overthrow its well-financed pro-Western, secular monarchy. The new self-proclaimed revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran believed in the necessity of Islamic sharia law for Islam to survive and prosper, and in the need to spread this doctrine to other Muslim states. While part of the Islamic revival, the revolution created a new conflict in the Islamic world by pitting revolutionary Shia Iran against its doctrinal and geopolitical rival the conservative Wahhabi Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for leadership of the Islamic world. As poor, predominantly Sunni country, Pakistan has been closely tied to the petroleum-exporting Saudi Arabia which has employed many Pakistani guest workers. This competition for influence affected many things in Muslim countries, including economic policies.\n\n\nDespite its success in initial first five years, the programme was fractured in many obvious reasons, and the stagflation again began to bite the country's resources, as well as many technical and scientific problems arise in the new economic system that the military government and Zia-ul-Haq himself was unable to solve. The newly elected, but technocratic government of Prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo refused to pass the new and more stricter version of Sharia bill. Zia abruptly dismissed the government on May 29, 1988, and the dissolved parliament the next day, alleging a slow pace of Islamization, corruption, deterioration of law and order, and mismanagement of the economy.\n\nGeneral Zia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit and loss sharing finance (PLS).\nOn January 1, 1980, he appeared on national television and announced the introduction of a \"Profit and Loss Sharing System\", according to which account holders were to share the losses and profits of the bank.\n\nIn 1980 the Council of Islamic Ideology issued a report with \"detailed and far reaching reforms\" to eliminate interest. The military government employed Islamic scholars and economists led by professor Khurshid Ahmad to compile laws about Islamic financing. \nZia's government responded to the council's report by replacing interest-bearing savings accounts with PLS instruments in Pakistan's five state banks. The government also introduced and encouraged such banks to adopt financing schemes based upon the principles of \"mudaraba\" and or \"musharaka.\"\n\n\nHowever these Islamisation policies did not include a ban on interest-paying accounts and \"in most instances\" Pakistani banks continued to offer accounts with fixed interest rates. For example, for term deposits, the banks substituted the phrases 'rate of interest' with 'expected rate of profit' and \"kept the entire regime of interest-based deposits intact.\"\n\nWhile the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) — established by General Zia to, among other things, examine existing laws and strike down those that did not complied with Shari'a law —would have been the way to put a stop to such interest-paying accounts, Zia had created an article in the constitution (203B) which specifically removed from the FSC's jurisdiction \"fiscal law or any law relating to the levy and collection of taxes and fees or banking or insurance practice and procedure\", until government deemed it appropriate to withdraw the ban.\n\nFurthermore, after the death of general Zia-ul-Haq, this programme was neglected by his long-time opponent Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, while Zia ally Nawaz Sharif launched a twin intensified programme, Privatization programme and the economic liberalisation to promote the GDP growth rate as well as reverting the economy back to Westernized economic system.\n\nTo surmount this obstacle, Islamic activists worked to \n\nMuslims agree that the Quran condemns \"Riba\", but do not all agree over what \"riba\" is.\n\nWhile Muslim activists (and most Pakistanis) agree that \"riba\" is interest on debt, others believe that \"riba\" is usury (unethical loans that unfairly enrich the lender) and not interest charged under state-regulated banking practices. Such people were to be found disproportionately among \"the economists, bankers, politicians, and bureaucrats\" who \"would be responsible to administer an interest free system\".\n\nTo convince these people and others, Jamat-e-Islami and like-minded groups have sponsored, and Saudi Arabia has financed, numerous symposia \"dedicated to the task of defining the modalities of an interest-free economy.\" A \"vibrant\" and abundant literature has emanated from these conferences, but many mainstream economists have remained unpersuaded. Activists also had no luck getting a law enacted to make the constitution subordinate to shariat, but had more luck in the courts.\n\nWhile Zia had blocked the shariah courts ability to ban interest with Article 203B, he had also added Article 2A (also known as the Objectives Resolution) to the constitution, which included the statement that Muslims' lives should be ordered \"in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.\" One superior court judge known as a particularly \"skillful\" Islamic activist and judicial activist -- Tanzil-ur-Rahman—argued that Article 2A required shariat law be enforced and was a \"supra-Constitutional\" \"grund norm\" of law in Pakistan, which meant that it gave superior courts jurisdiction to overrule parts of laws otherwise protected by the constitution if they are in violation of article 2-A, unless that court was specifically excluded. (Article 203B specifically excluded the FSC from examining fiscal laws for repugnancy to Islam, but not the high courts.)\nSeveral decisions handed down in the late 1980s and early 1990s supported Tanzil-ur-Rahman's interpretation, but most high court justices did not subscribe to his application of the Objectives Resolution, nor to a ban on interest, and Tanzil-ur-Rehman retired from the bench in 1990.\n\n\nHowever, in 1990, the Benazir Bhutto government was dismissed by the president and Tanzil-ur-Rehman was brought out of retirement and appointed chief justice of the FSC. In November 1991 in a \"monumental decision\" he overturned 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam.\n\nThe decision forbade \"riba\" absolutely without exceptions, defined it as \"any addition, however slight, over and above the principal\", including any system of markup, any indexing for inflation, payment by value rather than kind. It forbid \"riba\" in \"production loans\" as well as \"consumptive\" loans. It specifically declared invalid two Islamic Modernist interpretations that avoided strict prohibition: considering anti-\"riba\" Quranic verses (2:275-8) allegorical, and use of \"ijtihad\" (independent reasoning) of the issue based on finding the public good (\"maslaha\").\n\nThe government was publicly committed to Islamisation, but also pursuing a liberalization of Pakistan's economy and had a semi-autonomous state bank file an appeal. After much stalling by the government and bureaucracy, the Faisal case was upheld in 1999 by the Shariah Appellate Bench in the Aslam Khaki decision, with detailed orders to start the interest free economy. Pleading that implementation of the judgment would \"create enormous problems\" for the domestic, western-style banking and the economy, as well as Pakistan's \"official and private business and financial dealings with the outside world\", the government was given an additional year to Islamise by the Bench.\n\nBy this time, however, Pervez Musharraf had staged a coup and come to power and limited the power of the courts. He required judges to take a \"fresh oath of office\" in which they would undertake to uphold the \"Provisional Constitution Order\" established by the coup, which required judges to not \"make any order against the Chief Executive or any other person exercising powers or jurisdiction under his authority.\" Two justices of the Shariah Appellate Bench resigned rather than take the oath, a new appeal with new judges found many \"errors\" in the Aslam Khaki case and overturned the ruling of a couple months earlier.\n\nIn Pakistan's financial sector, as of 2006, a system of Islamic banking has been adopted that operates in parallel with the conventional banking system. Pakistanis can choose between the two modes of financing. Most informed Pakistanis, however, insist that there is \"no concerted move\" to do away altogether with the conventional banking system, or to replace existing linkages and relationships with international financial markets.\n\nAs of March 2014, the new \"rebooted\" Islamic banking sector made up 9.4% of Pakistan's banking assets, but like the old Islamic banking sector is still overwhelmingly based on markup, not profit and loss sharing. As of 2015 the Faisal case decision that banned all interest on bank loans but was sent back to Federal Shariat Court (FSC) for \"definitive finding on all the issues ...\" in 2002 remains unheard in the Federal Shariat Court.\n\nIslamic activists (such as M. Akram Khan), maintained that Islamic banking and economics had \"effectively failed\" because of lack of \"political will\", ignorance of Islamic banking's \"potential\", the \"inexperience\" of the banking sector, failure to interest the public, etc.\n\n\nCritic and economist Feisal Khan has noted that the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan has been supply driven rather than demand driven (mandated by General Zia-ul-Haq, court rulings, and the State Bank of Pakistan, rather than by customer interest or popular movements). In series of interviews conducted in 2008 and 2010 with Pakistani banking professionals (banker in conventional and Islamic, Shariah banking advisors, finance-using businessmen, and management consultants), Khan noted many Islamic bankers expressed \"cynicism\" over the different or lack thereof between conventional and Islamic bank products, the lack of requirements for external Shariah-compliance audits of Islamic banks in Pakistan, shariah boards lack of knowledge of un-shariah compliant practices in their banks or power to stop these practices. However this did not deter patronage by the pious (one of whom explained that if his Islamic bank was not truly shariah compliant, 'The sin is on their head now, not on mine! What I could do, I've done.') \n\nOne estimate of banking customer preference (given by a Pakistani banker) was that out of the entire Pakistani banking sector, was that about 10% of customers were \"strictly conventional banking clients\", 20% were strictly Shariah-compliant banking clients, and 70% would prefer Shariah-compliant banking but would use conventional banking if \"there was a significant pricing difference\". A survey of Islamic and conventional banking customers found (unsurprisingly) Islamic banking customers were more observant (having attended hajj, observing salat, growing a beard, etc.), but also had higher savings account balances than conventional bank customers, were older, better educated, had traveled more overseas, and tended to have a second account at a conventional bank. Another study, using \"official data\" reported to State Bank of Pakistan, found that for lenders who had taken out both Islamic (Murabaha) financing and conventional loans, the default rate was more than twice as high on the conventional loans. Borrowers were \"less likely to default during Ramadan and in big cities if the share of votes to religious-political parties increases, suggesting that religion – either through individual piousness or network effects – may play a role in determining loan default.\"\nOther economists had different and more critical explanations and observations. In 2000, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Ishrat Hussain contended that \"Pakistan is far removed from the day when it will be ready to adopt a full-fledged Islamic economic system. ... Most of the assumptions and premises on which the (scientific) hypotheses about the Islamic economic system have been constructed are serious flawed... \" A report by the IMF noted that the government has been unable to formulate non-interest based instruments for financing budget deficits, \"thus the government, which is the major exponent of the implementation of the Islamic system, is forced to raise funds through borrowing on the basis of a fixed rate of return\".\n\nAnother critic of \"Islamization\" of the economy, Feisal Khan, argues that one reason for the failure of the equity investment proposed by Islamic finance proponents to catch on is the \"long established consensus\" that debt finance is superior to equity investment because accurately determining the credit-worthiness of the borrower/investee is both time consuming and expensive, and much more crucial for equity investors than debt lenders. The quality and quantity of such information is particularly problematic when tax evasion is high and the underground economy large. This is very much the case in Pakistan where the 2005 incidence of tax evasion was between 5.7 and 6.5% of GDP, and the size of the unofficial/underground economy as between 54.6 and 62.8 percent of GDP, \"among the world's highest\". (The average size of the informal economy is about 30% in Asia.) \n\nEconomist Izzud-Din Pal argues that \"Islamising\" the economy in Pakistan cannot be seen apart from the wider attempt of regimes and political elites with low levels of legitimacy and popularity to use religion to win public support. Unfortunately, according to another author Yoginder Sikand, \"rather than focusing on the Islamic imperatives of equality and social justice, which are so central to the Qur’anic text, successive regimes in Pakistan have sought to focus on particular economic injunctions of the Qur’an abstracted from wider issues of justice and equality\". Because the debate on \"Islamising\" Pakistan's national economy has been reduced to issues related to interest-free banking, the abolition of \"riba\" (interest), the laws of inheritance and the levy of the \"zakāt\", Sikand believes all that is being offered are \"magical solutions\" to the complex modern problems of Pakistan's economy.\n\nFeisal Khan also argues that instituting a strictly Islamic banking system of \"mudaraba\" and \"musharaka,\" as called for by the 1999 Aslam Khaki decision of the Shariah Appellate Bench could lead to financial catastrophe. If \"murabaha\" and other fixed income instruments were banned and replaced by the more \"authentic\" profit and loss sharing, banks could only finance enterprise by taking \"a direct equity state\" as called for in \"mudaraba\" and \"musharaka.\" Credit would contract and central banks would be unable to prevent a liquidity crisis by buying bonds, commercial paper, etc. to expand credit.\n\nLand ownership is concentrated in Pakistan — as of 2015 a reported one-half of rural households in Pakistan are landless, while 5% of the country's population owns almost two-thirds of its farmland. Some reformers believe concentrated land ownership plays a part in \"maintaining poverty and food insecurity\" in Pakistan, and several attempts have been made to redistribute land to peasants and landless (laws created in 1959, 1972 and 1977). However, most provisions of these laws have been overruled as un-Islamic by Pakistan courts.\n\nThe first attempts at land reform in Pakistan occurred under Ayub Khan's government in 1959, were successfully opposed by the landed elite who mobilized the Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami to defend the \"sanctity of private property in Islam\".\n\nIn 1971 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan People's Party came to power, land reforms were \"at the center\" of that government's plans to transform Pakistan in to a \"democratic Islamic socialist\" state. The regime issued two land reform laws. A 1972 law (Martial Law Regulation - MLR 115, \"promlogated\" by the prime minister rather than passed by the National Assembly) was designed to place ceilings on the agricultural holding of Pakistan's large landlords (usually 150 acres but 300 acres if the land was unirrigated; exceptions were granted for tractors or installed tubewells). Land was to be seized by the state without compensation and distributed to the landless. Another provision of the law gave \"first right of pre-emption\" (right of first refusal to buy the land) to the existing tenants. In 1977, a bill was passed by the National Assembly, reducing the ceiling still further to 100 acres—although this act provided for compensation to landlords.\n\nThe implementation of land reforms was criticized for the modest amount of land seized and redistributed to the peasants, less-than-equitable administration—implementation was much more robust in the NWFP and Balochistan, where opposition to Bhutto was centered—and for being inherently \"un-Islamic\". Many of Pakistan's large landlords mobilized against the reforms which they saw as \"a direct challenged to their long-standing interest in maintaining political control in Pakistan's rural areas\".\n\nAfter Ali Bhutto was overthrown, landlords who had lost as a result of land reform appealed to \"Islamic Courts\" (i.e. the Shariah Appellate Bench and Federal Shariat Court), established by Bhutto's successor General Zia-ul-Haq, and these, rather than the executive or legislature of Pakistan, undid much of Ali Bhutto's reform program. According to scholar Charles H. Kennedy, the courts effectively \"suspended implementation\" of the land reforms, \"repealed the reforms, drafted new legislation, and then interpreted the new laws' meanings\".\n\n\"In early 1979, the \"Shariat Bench\" of the Peshawar High Court\" found the section of the 1972 law granting tenants the right to buy land they worked before other offers (\"right to preemption\") was \"repugnant to Islam\" and thus void. The petitioners against the law had successfully argued that \"nowhere in the Holy Quran or Sunnah\" was there mention of a tenant's right to preemption. The right to preemption according to the \"a hadith\" (the recorded reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that make up much of the \"Sunnah\") according to the petitioners and judges of the Shariat Bench went instead to the\n\nThis decision was reaffirmed by the Federal Shariat Court in 1981 (although the court acknowledged that \"Islam recognized the validity of state imposed limits on wealth for the purpose of alleviating poverty or providing for the public good\", which was a goal of the land reform laws), and upheld by the Shariah Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court in 1986 in a 3 to 2 decision. This decision was \"clarified and reclarified\" in subsequent decisions, (but confusion over what land transfers were valid or not under the \"old law\" remained since legal proceedings with \"final decree\" prior to the August 1986 ruling remained valid).\n\nIn August 1989 the Shariat Appellate Bench struck down several more measures of the 1972 land reform law. It ruled unanimously that provisions that allowed the confiscation of land without compensation were un-Islamic. On other measures it divided 3 to 2. It ruled that Waqf (an Islamic religious endowment, typically a donated plot of land or building) land was exempt from any provision of land reform laws; that the ceilings on amount of land owned were an undue restriction on property rights, on the grounds that \"Islam does not countenance compulsory redistribution of wealth or land for the purpose of alleviating poverty, however laudable the goal of poverty relief may be.\" \nDissenting justices argued that under Islam the rights of property holder must be balanced against the needs of the community. (The repudiation of a major feature of Ali Bhutto's domestic policies during the regime of his daughter underscoring judicial independence (i.e. power), and the weakness of the elected government.)\n\nAccording to barrister writing in dawn.com, \"The net result of the Qazalbash Waqf v Chief Land Commissioner (the 1989 Shariat Appellate Bench decision) is that land reforms in Pakistan are now at the same level as they were in 1947, as the 1972 regulations and the 1977 act have seen their main provisions being struck down and the 1959 regulations have been repealed.\"\n\nOther ordinances dealing with Islamic finance included the \"Zakāt\" and \"Ushr\" Ordinances issued on 20 June 1980, to Islamize taxation. The new system expelled the secular and international financial institutions and consisted only Islamic organizations, associations and institutions. The \"Zakāt\" was to be deducted from bank accounts of Muslims at the rate of 2.5% annually above the balance of Rs. 3,000. The \"Ushr\" was levied on the yield of agricultural land in cash or kind at the rate of 10% of the agricultural yield, annually.\n\nAuthorized by General Zia-ul-Haq, the government appointed Central, Provincial, District and Tehsil Zakat Councils to distribute Zakat funds to the needy, poor, orphans and widows. The Shia Muslims were exempted from Zakat deduction from their accounts due to their own religious beliefs. According to critics (Arskal Salim) the program has not been a great success:\n\"Since it was introduced through the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance No. 17 of 1980 ... the real lives and economic conditions of millions of Pakistani citizens have been completely unchanged, but a great number of socioreligious and political problems have arisen from state involvement in zakat administration.\"\n\nAnother economist (Parvez Hasan) writing in 2004 states \"zakat\" collections were insufficient to help the poor as it makes up only \"0.17 percent of GDP ... Rs. 5-6 billion\". The present level of grants \"would add only 5-6 percent\" to the income of the 1.2 million of the poorest Pakistani households even if every rupee of \"zakat\" collected went directly to these poor.\n\n\n"}

Holsinger also developed health care policy for twenty-six million veterans.\n\nWhen Holsinger assumed the post of Chief Medical Director, the VA was criticized for the quality of the care it provided. In 1991, Holsinger acknowledged that inadequate care had caused the deaths of six patients at its North Chicago hospital. He commissioned a team to review the quality of care, and based on its findings suspended surgical care at the facility. Later, testimony before a Congressional subcommittee reported problems at more than thirty other veterans' hospitals. Holsinger responded, \"Our patients are older, sicker and more complex than the average patient.\"\n\nIn 1993, he moved to Kentucky to become the Director of the VA Medical Center. He remained a consultant in cardiology for the hospital until 2003. Holsinger was awarded the Surgeon General's Medal by Surgeon General Antonia Novello.\n\nHolsinger served for over thirty-one years in the United States Army Reserve. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Meritorious Service Medal three times. He was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and promoted to major general in medical logistics working at the Pentagon under General Colin Powell. Holsinger retired from the United States Army Reserve in 1993.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2003, Holsinger served as Chancellor of the University of Kentucky Medical Center with responsibility for five health colleges, four graduate centers, two hospitals, and numerous clinics in Kentucky. Under Holsinger's leadership, the university built the Gill Heart Institute and two research buildings, and Holsinger laid the groundwork for the expansion the hospital has undergone since he left. Holsinger helped establish the Women's Health Center and the College of Public Health. In 2004, he was named a Master in the American College of Physicians.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Holsinger led an international team to address the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Working with Africa University in Zimbabwe, the team created a School of Health Sciences with nursing and public health programs to educate young people to deal with the AIDS crisis. Holsinger helped the university obtain a USAID grant to build the facility, which houses one of the few AIDS laboratories in southern Africa. In 2007, the program is preparing to field-test an HIV vaccine.\n\nAfter spending two years in Kentucky state government, he returned to the University of Kentucky as a professor for the graduate program in Public Health. In 2011, Holsinger was inducted into University of Kentucky College of Public Health Hall of Fame for his service and dedication.\nHolsinger is currently the Wethington Endowed Chair in the Health Sciences, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Health Management & Policy.\n\nHolsinger served as Secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services for Kentucky under Governor Ernie Fletcher. He was responsible for the management of the state's health and social services programs, including the five billion dollar Kentucky Medicaid program. Holsinger also led the social services response to the 6,000 evacuees of Hurricane Katrina who relocated to Kentucky.\n\nWhile serving as Secretary, Holsinger published a paper on physician professionalism stating that the autonomous practice of medicine contributes to physician dissatisfaction because of the prevalence of third-party payers and liability concerns. He recommended a new professional structure based on teamwork between physicians and \"fair access to health care for all Americans.\"\n\nThe \"Associated Press\" said Holsinger was a financial supporter of the Republican Party. According to \"The Courier-Journal\", he contributed $23,000 over ten years to the party and its candidates, including President George W. Bush.\n\nWhile Holsinger served as chair of the board of the Good Samaritan Foundation, a philanthropic health care organization, the United Methodist Church of Kentucky sued the foundation over control of $20 million in assets. Holsinger said the church was \"only interested in the foundation's money, not its cause.\" In October, 2007, the case was decided in the church's favor.\n\nIn November, 2007, the Asbury Theological Seminary board of trustees attempted to remove Holsinger from its board for a possible conflict of interest because he was also a board member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, a division of which was investigating the accreditation status of the seminary. According to Holsinger, he subsequently resigned because he believed the board was asking him to be less than truthful with regulatory agencies.\n\nOn May 24, 2007, Holsinger was nominated by George W. Bush to become the 18th Surgeon General of the United States. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) held the confirmation hearing on July 12, 2007.\n\nHolsinger was supported by the American College of Physicians and former Surgeons General C. Everett Koop and Joycelyn Elders. He was opposed by several gay and lesbian organizations and the American Public Health Association.\n\nIn October 2007, Scripps Howard News Service reported that the nomination was in trouble though he retained the support of several Republicans and the White House. The Senate committee was waiting for Holsinger to answer follow-up questions from the July confirmation hearing. On November 16, 2007, \"The Politico\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that due to rumors that Holsinger would be recess appointed, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would convene the chamber several times during the two-week Thanksgiving break, effectively avoiding adjourning the Senate and preventing any recess appointment. The same tactic was used for the 2007 holiday break.\n\nGiven the Democratic resistance coupled with Holsinger's lack of response to the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning, a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied. The political scientist Norman Ornstein said, \"It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's a big fat 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate. Even if you know or believe you are not likely to be confirmed, the idea that you wouldn't sort of do what the committee has asked is still kind of mind-boggling.\" The committee's Republican ranking member said Holsinger's lack of response was \"not helpful\" while the editorial board of Kentucky's Courier-Journal characterized it as \"disrespectful\" and \"baffling\".\n\nThe nomination was never voted on by the Senate and afterwards, in January 2009, Bush appointed him to fill a vacant unpaid position on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to expire May 2010.\n\nFollowing the nomination, Holsinger's views on homosexuality came under scrutiny, and several Democratic senators expressed concern or opposition to the nomination. In addition, individuals released statements supporting or opposing the nomination. Kevin Naff, editor of the LGBT newspaper, the \"Washington Blade\", charged that Holsinger has a \"long record of anti-gay bias.\" Paul Weyrich, the conservative commentator, said opposition to Holsinger's nomination amounted to an assault on religious freedom. Still others asserted that Holsinger is not hostile to homosexuals citing his support for a session on lesbian health issues at a health conference and the support of a former colleague who is a lesbian.\n\nThe critics were largely concerned with a 1991 white paper he wrote titled \"Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality\" for a committee in the United Methodist Church reviewing its position that homosexuality violates Christian teaching. According to Jake Tapper of ABC News, the paper \"purported\" to discuss homosexuality from a medical standpoint. But the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, the main writer for the committee, said Holsinger imposed his views of homosexuality in the report. According to Wogaman, Holsinger resigned after he anticipated that the committee was preparing to support the moral dignity of non-promiscuous homosexuality. The church never adopted the committee's recommendations but continues to struggle with the issue.\n\nSupporters of Holsinger's nomination defended the paper as a review of the relevant medical literature at that time. Critics said the paper reflected a pre-1970s view of human sexuality, and that it had a political agenda and was not a scientific paper. At his confirmation hearing, Holsinger said the paper did not represent his current views and was not \"an example of my scientific work.\"\n\nCritics have also expressed concerns about Holsinger's leadership of The United Methodist Church's Judicial Council, the highest court of the Church. In 2005, the court defrocked Irene Elizabeth Stroud, an openly lesbian minister, and in a separate case reinstated a pastor who had been suspended for refusing to allow a gay man to join his congregation. However, a Judicial Council member said that the decisions should not be read as Holsinger's personal views because the council does not have the power to establish church law and lacked the discretion to rule otherwise. But, as the \"New York Times\" noted, \"some council members opposed his views, and the bishops later rejected one decision.\" On October 24, 2007, Holsinger announced he would not participate in the fall Judicial Council meeting set to decide on a case involving the appointment of a transgender clergy member, which upheld the appointment. Holsinger completed his 8-year term as a Judicial Council member and his 4-year term as its president in May 2008.\n\nFinally, gay rights groups have expressed concerns that the church to which Holsinger belongs, Hope Springs United Methodist Church, had a program that tries to \"cure\" gays. However, the church's pastor denied this.\n\nSupporters have pointed out that Holsinger faced down state legislators who, objecting to a session on lesbian health issues at a 2002 women's health conference, threatened to withhold funds. A former co-worker who is lesbian wrote that although a \"liberal Democrat\", she strongly supported Holsinger as a leader with integrity.\n\nHolsinger has been a strong advocate for tobacco restrictions, implementing smoking bans in the entire VA hospital system and pushing to increase the excise tax on cigarettes from 3 cents to 75 cents (ultimately raised to 30 cents) in a tobacco-growing state. At his confirmation hearing, Holsinger said one of his top three priorities is \"making America a tobacco-free nation\".\n\nHolsinger has consistently aired concerns about childhood obesity, pushing for a limit on junk food in schools, lobbying and educating for the promotion of exercise and improvements of school nutrition. He included this as one of his highest priorities at his confirmation hearing. He said he supported banning mass media advertising of junk food geared to children.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Holsinger said that if confirmed he would focus on improving the ability of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to respond rapidly to emergencies.\n\nIn 2002, Holsinger testified at a Kentucky legislative hearing discussing stem cell research. \nThe Christian right characterized his testimony as supporting a \"loosening [of] regulations\". However, the White House said that Holsinger's concerns only involved the severity of the penalties. In 2005, he argued against a Kentucky anti-cloning bill, warning it could restrict future research. Holsinger testified that his father died of Parkinson's disease which is under investigation for gene therapy. During the HELP hearing, Holsinger said he supported President Bush's stem cell policy, which restricts federal funding to already existing embryonic cell lines while providing funds for adult and animal stem cell research.\n\nHolsinger said that abstinence education is one way to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted teen pregnancy but also supported educating teenagers about condom use.\n\nHolsinger said he did not support restricting the availability of an emergency contraceptive known as the morning-after pill, or Plan B.\n\nDuring the HELP hearing, Holsinger stated that he would seek ways to help the uninsured. \"I think we need to have every American covered for health care.\" He offered no opinion on how to achieve this goal. He said that he supported banning drug companies from advertising on television.\n\nTwo days before the HELP confirmation hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public with claims that the Bush Administration censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports. When asked about this at the hearing, Holsinger said, \"If I were faced with a situation that I felt I could not in good conscience do, I think I have a clear response to that. I would resign.\"\n\n\n"}

In Sanskrit, Kansakar means bronze worker, and their traditional occupation has been metal working and trading. Today, they are merchants, industrialists and professionals.\n\nThey are part of the Urāy (उराय्) group which includes Tuladhar, Tamrakar, Sthapit, Bania, Sindurakar, Selalik and other castes. The Urāy are a community of high-caste Buddhist merchants, and their family names indicate artisan and mercantile specialists. Their religion is Newar Buddhism and mother tongue Nepal Bhasa.\n\nKansakars have been traditionally based in Kel Tol in the historical section of Kathmandu where they play a major cultural role. The neighborhood is famed for the sacred courtyard of Jana Baha (Machhendra Bahal) where the central temple houses an image of Aryavalokitesvara (Sacred Avalokiteśvara), a Buddhist deity popularly known as Jana Baha Dyah or White Machhendranath (alternative name: White Karunamaya).\n\nAccording to the division of labour laid down from ancient times, Kansakars practiced the hereditary occupation of making utensils of bronze. Kitchen and ritual vessels, various types of dinner plates and cymbals are their main products. A dinner plate with a grooved border known as \"siphala dema\" (सिफाला देमा) is their specialty. Bronze is made in their workshops by melting copper and tin and mixing them in a charcoal-fired furnace.\n\nThey were also major players in the traditional Tibet trade, and maintained business houses in Lhasa in Tibet and in Kalimpong and Kolkata in India.\n\nKansakars participate in the annual chariot procession of Aryavalokitesvara which is known as Jana Baha Dyah Jatra by playing long horns. The Kansakar Gunla Bajan musical band organizes performances of religious music during the hold month of Gunla and other festivals.\n\nThe 12-yearly Samyak is the most spectacular Newar Buddhist festival held in Kathmandu where statues of Dipankara Buddha are displayed. Each Urāy caste has been assigned a duty in the festival from ancient times, and Kansakars have the task of preparing and serving five types of foods.\n\nKansakars participate in the Kumha Pyakhan dance (also known as Kumar Pyakhan) which is held annually during the Mohani festival in October on the open-air dance platform at Asan and at Kathmandu Durbar Square.

{"id": "20203640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20203640", "title": "Khazen", "text": "Khazen\n\nKhazen (also \"El-Khazen\", and in some cases Al Khazen or De Khazen, Arabic: الخازن) is the name of a prominent noble Levantine family and clan based in Keserwan District, Lebanon, Damascus, Syria, Nablus, Palestine, as well as other districts around the Levant, predominantly in the Galilee. The Khazen family originally Druze Arabs later converted to Maronite Christians, have traced their lineage through DNA testing to Jericho, Palestine (also known as Tell el-Sultan) 8500 B.C. Several members have played leading roles in politics for many generations. King Louis XIV elevated the family to the French nobility and referred to them as \"princes of the Maronites\" in many letters. Pope Clement X made them Counts Palatine. Most of the Lebanese Khazen branch is Maronite, while other branches are Greek Orthodox and Muslim but are not related to the Mount-Lebanese, which were endowed with these honors.\n\nThe Khazen Cheikhs can trace back their lineage to the 9th century, when they were mainly located between Houran, Damascus, Baalbeck, and Nablus. They started buying and acquiring lands in Mount Lebanon during the 15th century and, more specifically, first in Jaj (currently in Jbeil District). They continued their exodus to the Keserwan district, where they bought lands from the Shi'a tribes. This caused the Shi'a to move towards what is known today as the South of Lebanon and the Maronites to the Keserwan district.\n\nIn 1584, the Khazen were able to hide the princes Fakhreddine and Younès in Ballouneh. At that time, their father, cornered by the Ottoman's army and losing the fight against them, informed his wife Sitt Nossab to send his sons to the Khazen, a powerful and influential family at that time. The great Fakhreddine, when he took power, was greatly influenced by the Khazen family politically and religiously. In return, he granted them the title of \"Cheikh\" and complete political influence and control of Mount Lebanon. Similarly, the Khazen also gave shelter to Prince Haidar Shehab's sons, in Keserwan in the early 18th century.\n\nThe Khazen families, who were now controlling the Kerserwan district, were very influential within the Maronite Church. This is due to their financial support of the Church and their assistance in its expansion by the construction of many monasteries, several of which they still own today, as well as their connections to the French. They also offered lands and, most importantly, supplied security to the Church and the Maronite community overall. In 1656, Cheikh Abou Nawfal received a Papal decoration for his help in the expansion of the Maronite faith in Mount Lebanon. The family was consulted on each patriarchal election and controlled episcopal nominations for three Maronite archbishoprics—representing the districts of Aleppo, Baalbeck, and Damascus—until the 19th century. There were three important and influential patriarchs from the Khazen family: Youssef Dargham (1733–1742), Toubia (1756–1766) and Youssef Ragi (1845–1854). Several bishops have also shared the name, including Michel (Caesarea, 1767-1786), Ignace (Nablus, 1787-1819), Germanos (Damascus, 1794-1806), Estefan (Damascus, 1806-1830), Anton (Baalbeck, 1807-1858), Estefan (Damascus, 1848-1868), Louis Joseph (Ptolemais, 1919-1933), and Georges Abou (Rusadus, 2014-current).\n\nIn 1858, Tanios Chahine started a rebellion against the Khazen family, which caused a great loss to their dominance over Kerserwan. The rebellion was a result of a power struggle between the Abi Lamaa family, the English, the French, the Ottomans, and particular Khazen who wanted to increase their influence. After these events, the Khazen stayed involved in politics, yet their work as one family holding ultimate Maronite power has diminished greatly.\n\nThe Khazen crest, which includes snowy mountains and a cedar tree, reflects the family's special closeness to the country, and especially to Mount Lebanon.\n\nThere are multiple branches of the family. The 2 main branches are based in Ajaltoun, which mainly traces its origins from Nawfal Abou Nassif el-Khazen (son of Nader Abou Nawfal el-Khazen), and Ghosta, which mainly traces its origins from Fayad Abou Kanso el-Khazen (son of Nader Abou Nawfal; also, consul of France). Kfardebian, which is nearby, also has a sizable branch.\n\nIn modern times, Khazen have always represented Keserwan with at least one MP in the Lebanese Parliament. They have also been represented in many recent governments. Prominent politicians include Cheikh Philippe El Khazen, a prominent doctor and medical professor born in 1921 in Ghosta. Cheikh Philippe El Khazen was a member of the Parliament in 1968-1972 and a Co-Founder and Vice President of the Maronite League. He was also a member of the European Christian Democratic Party.\nCheikh Elias Choukrallah El Khazen, minister and deputy born in 1927 from Ajaltoun, was a member of Parliament in 1964, 1972, 1992, 1996 and Minister of Interior from 1989 - 1990. Cheikh Elias Choukrallah El Khazen as a deputy signed the Taef agreement to end the Lebanese civil war and to return to political normalcy in Lebanon. \nCheikh Wadih El Khazen, minister of Tourism, Feb 2005, and president of The Central Maronite Council since January 2006.Walid el-Khazen, former ambassador from the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to Jordan, Amine el-Khazen, former Lebanese ambassador to the United Nations, Farid Haykal el-Khazen, former Tourism Minister, and Farid Elias el-Khazen, professor and past Chairman of Political Studies at the American University of Beirut and current MP. Noteworthy businessmen include Fady el-Khazen, former director for the Ministry of Agriculture and owner of French restaurant \"La Creperie\", Chafic el-Khazen, the CEO of Sky Management, and Fouad el-Khazen, honorary chairman of the BIT bank.\n\n\n\n"}

The Russian word itself is an obsolete term for \"bight\" or \"bay\". In the word \"luk-o-mor-ye\", \"-o-\" is an infix to connect two roots, \"-ye\" is an affix (in this case, of relative location), \"luk-\" is the root for \"bend\", \"mor-\" is the root for \"sea\". It can also be translated as \"curved sea-shore\" or \"inlet of the sea\".\n\nThe toponym \"Sea Bend\" (лука моря, \"luka morya\") and the derivations: \"lukomorye\", \"lukomorians\", etc., has been applied to various geographical locations. It is mentioned in The Tale of Igor's Campaign and the Russian chronicles. According to the chronicles Lukomorye was inhabited by the nomadic Polovtsy people, and the researchers locate it in the region north of the Sea of Azov, where Polovtsy lived in the 11th—12th centuries. These accounts are seen as a source of inspiration for Alexander Pushkin. In modern Russian culture the word Lukomorye is most commonly associated with Pushkin's fairy tale poem \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\", starting with the line: \"There is a green oak-tree by the lukomorye, …\" (У лукоморья дуб зелёный, … ; \"U lukomorya dub zelyony, …\").\nThe land of \"Lucomoria\" was also depicted in a number of antique maps of Siberia/Muscovy. It is suggested that the cartographers followed the descriptions of Sigismund von Herberstein in his 1549 \"Notes on Muscovite Affairs:\n...which they barter with the and Serponovtzi : these latter people derive their name from the fortress of Serponov Lucomoryae, situated in the mountains beyond the river Oby. <br>\nIt is said that a certain marvellous and incredible occurrence, and very like a fable, happens every year to the people of Lucomoryae, namely, that they die on the 27th of November, which among the Russians is dedicated to St. George, and come to life again like the frosts in the following spring, generally on the 24th of April.<br>\n...<br>\nThe Cossin is a river which flows down from the mountains of Lucomorya ; at its mouth is the fortress of Cossin, which was formerly possessed by the Knes Ventza, but now by his sons. <br>\nFrom the sources of the great river Cossin to this point is a journey of two months. Moreover, from the sources of the same river, rises another river Cassima, which, after passing through the district of Lucomorya, flows into the great river Tachnin ; beyond which are said to dwell men of prodigious stature, some of whom are covered all over with hair, like wild beasts, while others have heads like dogs, and others have no necks, their breast occupying the place of a head, while they have long hands, but no feet. \n\nGiles Fletcher in his \"Of the Russe Common Wealth\" repeats the fantastic tale of dying/reviving Lukomorians.\n\n"}

Located in Tel Aviv District, it had a population of in .\n\nEstablished in 1870, it was the first Jewish agricultural school in what is now Israel.\n\nMikveh Israel was founded in April 1870 by Charles Netter, an emissary of the French organization Alliance Israélite Universelle, aiming to be an educational institution where young Jews could learn agriculture and leave to establish villages and settlements all over the country and to make the desert blossom. It was established on a tract of land southeast of Jaffa leased from the Ottoman Sultan, who allocated to the project. The name is taken from two passages in the Book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 14:8 and 17:13, and was proposed by Wolf Grinstein, one of the school's first students, who later taught there. \n\nNetter, the first headmaster, introduced new methods of agricultural training, with Baron Edmond James de Rothschild contributing to the upkeep of the school. Netter pioneered progressive educational methods and a new way of life and agricultural training to the future farmers of this land. There were only about 20,000 Jews in the country at that time, mostly established in the traditional cities of Judaism: Jerusalem, Tiberias, Safed and Hebron. \n\nIn 1898, Theodor Herzl met the German Emperor Wilhelm II at the main entrance of Mikveh Israel during Herzl's only visit to Eretz Yisrael. The meeting, a PR event engineered by Herzl to publicly meet the Kaiser, was misinterpreted by the world media as a legitimization of Herzl and Zionism by Germany.\n\nFor many decades (until the establishment of the Volcani Center and the Faculty of Agriculture in Rechovot) the school served as the research center for the country. Their teachers wrote the first study books about agriculture and served as field advisors. Most of the agricultural know-how of the first 50 years was collected and published by Mikve Israel. After finishing their studies, the thousands of graduates left Mikve Israel to start agricultural settlements of all kinds, villages and kibbutzim, moshavim, farms and agricultural schools; or serving in management positions; or continued their agricultural studies in institutions of higher learning and filling positions in research and development, the export branches, marketing and agricultural management.\n\nIn 1938–1939, at the request of the Youth Aliyah, a section for religious youth was built to house the religious and traditional youngsters who fled western Europe just before the start of the Holocaust.\nMikve Israel is located on a strategic crosspoint on the road connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Part of the only green space in Tel Aviv District, it has been used as an organizing point for the convoys and up to the Gulf War.\n\nThe village has about 1,800 pupils from the age of 12 to the age of 18; 800 in the General section, 320 in the religious school, 380 in the French-Israeli college and high school. Around 280 students are boarders and the site also hosts four Montessori and holistic pedagogy kindergartens, and a Montessori elementary school.\n\nIn 2007 Mikve Israel and the Alliance Israélite Universelle inaugurated an experimental bilateral Israel-France high school, with half of its pupils studying for the French Baccalauréat and half for Israeli Bagrut.\n\nThe agricultural grounds of Mikve Israel cover over 2,200 dunams (out of a general area of 3,300 dunams). Most of the fields are irrigated using wells and include field crops, industrial crops, vegetables, fruit trees, orange groves and greenhouses. The school also raises animals including milk cows, chickens and honey bees, as well as having auxiliary branches including computerized agriculture.\n\nOne dunam (0.1 hectares) is covered by greenhouses. The aim of the greenhouse production branch is to teach students and allow them to research greenhouse issues and technologies. A rainwater harvesting system allows efficient re-use of water collected from the roof for growing of vegetables in greenhouses.\n\nGardening and landscaping activity over 100 dunams (10 hectares) includes woods, lawns and beauty & leisure gardens and spots throughout the village. The gardening and landscaping is maintained by the students supervised and coached by the manager of this production branch.\n\nThe botanical garden was established in 1930 in order to adapt and acclimate trees and species to the Israeli climate. Plants were imported from all over the world. It now covers now 70 dunams (7 hectares).\n\nThe dairy farm covers as genetics, computers, milking parlor and cooling, product quality control, feeding, herd health, udder health, artificial insemination and embryo transfer and implants.\n\nThe stable has the following breeds of riding horses: Hanoverian, Holland and quarter-horse breeds suited to all types of horseback riding: western, sports, and therapeutic riding.\n\n\n\n"}

This phrase came about as a result of exposure to cowpox, which causes no serious symptoms, but does convey a partial immunity to the disfiguring (and often fatal) disease smallpox.

{"id": "4080953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4080953", "title": "Nazism and race", "text": "Nazism and race\n\nNazism and race concerns the Nazi Party's adoption and further development of several hypotheses concerning their concept of race. Classifications of human races were made and various measurements of population samples were carried out during the 1930s.\n\nThe Nazis claimed to observe scientifically a strict hierarchy of the human race. Hitler's view towards race and people can be found throughout \"Mein Kampf\" but more specifically in chapter 11 \"Nation and Race\". The standard-issue propaganda text issued to members of the Hitler Youth contained a chapter on \"the race of the German people\" that heavily cited the works of Hans F. K. Günther. The text seems to address the European races in descending orders on the Nazi hierarchy, with the Nordic race (plus the subrace of Phalic) first, the Western (Mediterranean) race second, Dinarics third, Eastern (Alpine) people fourth, and finally East Baltics last.\n\nHitler made references to an \"Aryan Race\" founding a superior type of humanity. The purest stock of Aryans according to Nazi ideology was the Nordic people of Germany, England, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway. The Nazis defined Nordics as being identified by tall stature (average 175 cm), long faces, prominent chins, narrow and straight noses with a low bridge, lean builds, doliocephalic skulls, straight light hair, light eyes, and fair skin. The Nazis claimed that Germanic people specifically represented a southern branch of the Aryan-Nordic population. The Nazis did not consider all Germans to be of the Nordic type (which predominated the north), and stated that Germany also had a large \"Alpine\" population (identified by, among other features, lower stature, stocky builds, flatter noses, and higher incidences of darker hair and eyes). Hitler and Nazi racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther framed this as an issue to be corrected through selective breeding for \"Nordic\" traits. Hitler Youth propaganda emphasized the \"Nordic\" nature of Germans, with the text issued to all Hitler Youth members stating: \"the principal ingredient of our people is the Nordic race (55%). That is not to say that half our people are pure Nordics. All of the aforementioned races appear in mixtures in all parts of our fatherland. The circumstance, however, that the great part of our people is of Nordic descent justifies us taking a Nordic standpoint when evaluating our character and spirit, bodily structure, and physical beauty.\"\n\nAs Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Finland participated in the invasion primarily to recover the territories it was forced to cede to the USSR after the Moscow Peace Treaty which ended the Winter War between the Finns and the Soviets. Military success quickly resulted in the Finnish occupation of Eastern Karelia. Because of their Finno-Ugric heritage, the Finns were initially classified by Nazi racial experts as a people unrelated to the other Nordic countries, in spite of a long history of political unity with Sweden. As a result, the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland was favoured at first over Finnish speakers for recruitment into the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS because they were categorically considered part of the \"Nordic race\".\n\nOwing to Finland's substantial military contribution on the northern flank of the Eastern Front of World War II, Hitler decreed in November 1942 that \"from now on Finland and the Finnish people be treated and designated as a Nordic state and a Nordic people\", which he considered one of the highest compliments that the Nazi government could bestow upon another country.\n\nAccording to Gunther, the purest Nordic regions were Scandinavia and northern Germany, particularly Norway and Sweden, specifying: \"We may, perhaps, take the Swedish blood to be over 80 per cent Nordic, the Norwegian blood about 80 per cent.\" Britain and southern Germany by contrast were not considered entirely Nordic. Germany was said to be 55% Nordic, and the rest Alpine (particularly southern Germany), Dinaric, or East Baltic (particularly eastern Germany). On the British Isles, Gunther stated: \"we may adopt the following racial proportions for these islands: Nordic blood, 60 percent; Mediterranean, 30 percent; Alpine, 10 percent.\" He added that \"The Nordic strain in Germany seems to be rather more distributed over the whole people than in England, where it seems to belong far more to the upper classes.\" Hitler echoed this sentiment, referring to the English lower classes as \"racially inferior.\"\n\nHitler viewed the French as close to the Germans racially, but not quite their peers. He said of their racial character: \"France remains hostile to us. She contains, in addition to her Nordic blood, a blood that will always be foreign to us.\" Gunther echoed this sentiment, saying that the French were predominantly Alpine and Mediterranean rather than Nordic, but that a heavy Nordic strain was still present. He characterized the French as possessing the following racial proportions: Nordic, 25%; Alpine or Dinaric, 50%; Mediterranean, 25%. These types were said to be most prevalent in north, central, and southern France respectively.\n\nHitler planned to remove a large portion of the French population to make way for German settlement. The Zone interdite of eastern France was set aside and planned to be made part of the German Reich after the rest of France was fully subdued. The French residents of the zone, some 7 million people accounting for nearly 20% of the French population at the time, were to be deported, and the land then occupied by at least a million German settlers. The plan was either postponed or abandoned after Operation Barbarossa in favor of expediting the settlement of the east instead, and was never put into place owing to the German defeat in the Second World War.\n\nThe Nazis regarded central/southern Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, southern French, and Greeks as sharing a similar origin with Germans from ancient Indo-Aryan migration, but being almost purely of a distinct so-called Mediterranean race. Despite classifying these populations as Aryans, and regarding them as superior in the arts compared to Nordics and Germans, the Nazis considered them less industrious than predominantly Nordic peoples like the Germans and English, and thus marginally inferior to the Nordic race. The \"Mediterranean\" race was described in Nazi propaganda as brown-haired, brown-eyed, brownish-skinned, and short (average 162 cm), with dolichocephalic or mesocephalic skulls, and lean builds. People of this category were described as \"lively, even loquacious\" and \"excitable, even passionate\", but \"prone to act more on feeling than on reason\", and as a result, \"this race has produced only a few outstanding men.\"\n\nThe question of South Tyrol was largely dealt by Hitler and Mussolini pragmatically: this region of Austria's Tyrol, annexed by Italy after 1919, would not become a constituent district of Ostmark (present-day Austria). Ethnic Germans in South Tyrol were given the option of either migrating back to the German Reich or remaining in South Tyrol to undergo forced Italianization.\n\nBeginning in 1933, the Nazi leadership in Germany made efforts to increase their influence in Iran, and they financed and managed a racist journal, \"Iran-e Bastan\", co-edited by a pro-Nazi Iranian, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman Seif. This and other chauvinistic publications in the 1930s were popular among Iranian elites; they \"highlighted the past and the pre-Islamic glories of the Persian nation and blamed the supposedly 'savage Arabs and Turks' for the backwardness of Iran.\" In Iran:\n\nNazi ideology was most common among Persian officials, elites, and intellectuals, but \"even some members of non-Persian groups were eager to identify themselves with the Nazis\" and a supposed Aryan race. Hitler declared Iran to be an \"Aryan state\"; the changing of Persia's name to Iran in 1935 was done by the Shah at the suggestion of the German ambassador to Iran as an act of \"Aryan solidarity.\"\n\nIn 1936, the Nazi Office of Racial Politics, in response to a question from the German Foreign Ministry, classified non-Jewish Turks as Europeans, but \"left unanswered the question of how to think about the obviously non-European Arabs, Persians, and Muslims.\" Later the year, ahead of the Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, the Nazis responded to questions from the Egyptians by saying that the Nuremberg racial laws did not apply to them, and after the Iranian ambassador to Berlin \"assured German officials that 'there was no doubt that the Iranian, as an Aryan,' was 'racially kindred (\"artverwandt\") with the Germans,\" the German Foreign Ministry \"assured the Iranian Embassy in Berlin that the correct distinction between was not between \"Aryans and non-Aryans\" but rather between \"persons of German and related blood on one hand and Jews as well as racially alien on the other.\"\n\nHistorian Jeffrey Herf writes:\n\nIn Adolf Hitler's own words:\n\nPride in one's own race – and that does not imply contempt for other races – is also a normal and healthy sentiment. I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilizations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them.\n\nHitler had supported the Empire of Japan as early as 1904, when during the Russo-Japanese War it had defeated the Russian Empire, which he considered a defeat for Austrian Slavism. He made a number of other statements expressing his respect and admiration for the Japanese in his book \"Mein Kampf\".\n\nAlthough of a different race, the Japanese were considered by Nazi ideologists such as Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, as having sufficiently superior qualities to warrant an alliance. Himmler, who had a great interest in, and was influenced by, the anthropology, philosophies and pantheistic religions of East Asia, mentioned how his friend Hiroshi Ōshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, believed that the noble castes in Japan, the Daimyō and the Samurai, were descended from gods of celestial origin, which was similar to Himmler's own belief that \"the Nordic race did not evolve, but came directly down from heaven to settle on the Atlantic continent.\"\n\nKarl Haushofer, a German general, geographer, and geopolitician, whose ideas influenced the development of Hitler's expansionist views, saw Japan as the brother nation to Germany. In 1908, he was sent by the German Army \"to Tokyo to study the Japanese Army and to advise it as an artillery instructor. The assignment changed the course of his life and marked the beginning of his love affair with the orient. During the next four years he traveled extensively in East Asia, adding Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin to his repertoire of Russian, French, and English languages. Karl Haushofer had been a devout student of Arthur Schopenhauer, and during his stay in the Far East he was introduced to Oriental esoteric teachings.\"\n\nDespite these views, the Japanese were still subject to Germany's racial laws, however, which – with the exception of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, which specifically mentioned Jews – generally applied to all \"non-Aryans\". Hitler's government began enacting the laws after taking power in 1933, and the Japanese government protested several racial incidents involving Japanese or Japanese-Germans that year. Influential Nazi anti-Semite Johann von Leers favored excluding Japanese from the laws due both to the alleged Japanese-Aryan racial link and to improve diplomatic relations with Japan. The Foreign Ministry agreed with von Leers and sought several times between 1934 and 1937 to change the laws, but other government agencies, including the Racial Policy Office, opposed the change.\n\nAn October 1933 statement by Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath which falsely claimed in response to the Japanese protests that Japanese were exempt, however, was widely publicized and caused many in Germany, Japan, and elsewhere to believe that such an exemption existed. Instead of a broad exemption, an April 1935 decree stated that racial discrimination cases involving non-Aryans that might jeopardize German diplomatic relations—i.e., Japanese—would be dealt with individually. Decisions on such cases often took years, with those affected unable to obtain jobs or interracially marry, primarily because the German government preferred as much as possible to avoid giving exemptions. The German government often exempted more German-Japanese than it preferred in order to avoid a repeat of the 1933 controversies, and in 1934 it prohibited the German press from discussing the race laws when Japanese were involved.\n\nThe Nazis thought Eastern Europe, namely the areas speaking Slavic languages, to be racially the lowest part of Europe, and very distinct from the rest of Europe . Hans Günther stated: \"The east of Europe shows a gradual transition of the racial mixtures of Central Europe into predominantly East Baltic and Inner Asiatic regions... Owing to the likeness between East Baltic and Inner Asiatic bodily characters it will often be hard to fix a sharp boundary between these two races.\" Russia was thought to be 25% Nordic, other regions less.\n\nJews, Roma and Slavs (including Poles, Serbs and Russians) were not considered Aryans by Nazi Germany but as subhuman, inferior races. A definition of Aryan that included all non-Jewish Europeans was deemed unacceptable by Nazis, and Expert Advisor for Population and Racial Policy included a definition defining Aryan as someone who is \"tribally\" related to \"German blood\".\n\nHitler shifted the blame of Germany's loss in the First World War upon \"enemies from within\". In the face of economic hardship as triggered by the Treaty of Versailles (1919), Jews who resided in Germany were blamed for sabotaging the country. The Nazis therefore classified them as the most inferior race and used derogatory terms \"Untermensch\" (sub-human) and \"Schwein\" (pig).\n\nTo expand the \"Lebensraum\" (living space) for Germans, the Nazis later applied this classification to Slavs, mainly the Poles, Serbs and Russians, along with Romani (Gypsies) east of Germany. Within the subhuman hierarchy, Slavs were generally classified slightly above the Romani and finally the Jews.\n\nAn \"Untermensch\" would be stripped of all his/her rights, treated as an animal, deemed to have a \"Lebensunwertes Leben\" (life unworthy of living) and fit only for enslavement and extermination.\n\nNazi ideology taught the German youth during school to understand the differences between the Nordic German \"Übermenschen\" and \"ignoble\" Jewish and Slavic \"subhumans\".\n\nPseudoscientist and Nazi geneticist Hans Günther, on whom Hitler based much of his ideology, wrote extensively about the supposed racial origins of the Poles and other West Slavs. Originally, the West Slavs were supposed to be Nordic, but were diluted by mixture with inferior races starting in the 12th century. The dominant type among Poles in the modern day then became the East Baltic race. However, some Poles were considered to have enough Nordic admixture to be assimilated, supposedly being descended from the Nordic ruling class of the old West Slavs. Others, especially in the southern regions of the country, had a strong amount of \"Inner Asiatic\" racial ancestry, and as East Baltic/Inner Asiatic mixes were the most inferior. Of the Poles and predominantly East Baltic people in general, Günther said that they were mentally slow and incapable of long term planning, which influenced Nazi perception of the Poles: \"after weeks of dreary toil the East Baltic man will often heedlessly squander all that he has earned... 'Nihilism' lies deep in the East Baltic soul. He seldom knows how to keep the wealth he has earned; riches make him extravagant and fond of show. His mind is not capable of quick decision, but with all its slowness it is penetrating... He has little cleanliness, whether personal or in the home.\" He also characterized Poles as predisposed to violence, and blamed crime in the German border regions on racemixing, saying: \"The East Baltic man inclines to brutality in his sexual relations, and, indeed, to brutality in general. The German districts with most East Baltic blood have a heavy proportion of crime.\"\n\nDifferent Nazis offered a range of arguments—some pseudo-religious, others pseudoscientific—as to why the Aryan or European people were racially superior to people of other races. But the central dogma of Aryan superiority was espoused by officials throughout the party.\n\nRichard Walther Darré, Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1933 to 1942, popularized the expression \"Blut und Boden\" (\"Blood and Soil\"), one of the many terms of the Nazi glossary ideologically used to enforce popular racism in the German population. There were many academic and administrative scholars of race who all had somewhat divergent views about the social misconception of racism, including Alfred Rosenberg and Hans F. K. Günther \n\nFischer and Lenz were appointed to senior positions overseeing the policy of racial hygiene. The Nazi state used such ideas about the differences between European races as part of their various discriminatory and coercive policies which culminated in the Holocaust. Ironically, in Grant's first edition of his popular book \"The Passing of the Great Race\" he classified Germans as being primarily Nordic, but in his second edition, published after the USA had entered WWI, he had re-classified the now enemy power as being dominated by \"inferior\" Alpines, a tradition evident in the work of Harvard Professor of Anthropology Carlton Coon's work, \"The Races of Europe\".\n\nGünther's work stated that the Germans are definitely not a fully Nordic people, and divided them into Western (Mediterranean), Nordic, Eastern (Alpine), East Baltic and Dinaric races. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The simplistic tripartite model of Grant which divided Europeans into only Alpine, Mediterranean, and Nordic, Günther did not use, and erroneously placed most of the population of Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the Anschluss. This has been used to downplay the Nordic presence in Germany. Gunther considered Jews an \"Asiatic race inferior to all European races\".\n\nJ. Kaup led a movement opposed to Günther. Kaup took the view that a German nation, all of whose citizens belonged to a \"German race\" in a populationist sense, offered a more convenient sociotechnical tool than Günther's concept of an ideal Nordic type to which only a very few Germans could belong. Nazi legislation identifying the ethnic and \"racial\" affinities of the Jews reflects the populationist concept of race. Discrimination was not restricted to Jews who belonged to the \"Semitic-Oriental-Armenoid\" and/or \"Nubian-African/Negroid\" races, but was directed against all members of the Jewish ethnic population.\n\nThe German Jewish journalist Kurt Caro (1905–1979) who emigrated to Paris in 1933 and served in the British army from 1943, published a book under the pseudonym Manuel Humbert unmasking Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" in which he stated the following racial composition of the Jewish population of Central Europe: 23.8% Lapponoid race, 21.5% Nordic race,\n20.3% Armenoid race, 18.4% Mediterranean race, 16.0% Oriental race.\n\nBy 1939 Hitler had abandoned Nordicist rhetoric in favour of the idea that the German people as a whole were united by distinct \"spiritual\" qualities. Nevertheless, Nazi eugenics policies continued to favor Nordics over Alpines and other racial groups, particularly during the war when decisions were being made about the incorporation of conquered peoples into the Reich. The Lebensborn program sought to extend the Nordic race. In 1942 Hitler stated in private, I shall have no peace of mind until I have planted a seed of Nordic blood wherever the population stand in need of regeneration. If at the time of the migrations, while the great racial currents were exercising their influence, our people received so varied a share of attributes, these latter blossomed to their full value only because of the presence of the Nordic racial nucleus.\n\nHitler and Himmler planned to use the SS as the basis for the racial \"regeneration\" of Europe following the final victory of Nazism. The SS was to be a racial elite chosen on the basis of \"pure\" Nordic qualities.\n\nAddressing officers of the SS-Leibstandarte \"Adolf Hitler\" Himmler stated:\n\nThe ultimate aim for those 11 years during which I have been the Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: to create an order of good blood which is able to serve Germany; which unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made use of because the greatest losses can do no harm to the vitality of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always be replaced; to create an order which will spread the idea of Nordic blood so far that we will attract all Nordic blood in the world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb it so that never again, looking at it from the viewpoint of grand policy, Nordic blood, in great quantities and to an extent worth mentioning, will fight against us.\n\nAn influential figure among German racist theorists was Otto Reche who became director of the Institute for Racial and Ethnic Sciences in Lipsk and advocated the genocide of the Polish nation. In this position he wrote that ethnic Poles were \"an unfortunate mixture\" consisting among others of Slavs, Balts and Mongolians, and that they should be \"eliminated\" to avoid possible mixing with the \"German race\" When Germany invaded Poland he wrote \"We need Raum (space), but no Polish lice on our fur\".\n\nPhilosophers and other theoreticians participated in the elaboration of Nazi ideology. The relationship between Heidegger and Nazism has remained a controversial subject in the history of philosophy, even today. According to the philosopher Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger said of Spinoza that he was \"ein Fremdkörper in der Philosophie\", a \"foreign body in philosophy\"Faye notes that \"Fremdkörper\" was a term which belonged to the Nazi glossary, and not to classical German. However Heidegger did to a certain extent criticise racial science, particularly in his Nietzsche lectures, which reject biologism in general. While generally speaking even in Heidegger's most German nationalist and pro-Nazi works of the early 30s, such as his infamous Rectorial address there is a lack of any overtly racialised language. Thus it is problematic to connect Heidegger with any racial theory. Carl Schmitt elaborated a philosophy of law praising the \"Führerprinzip\" and the German people, while Alfred Baeumler instrumentalized Nietzsche's thought, in particular his concept of the \"Will to Power\", in an attempt to justify Nazism.\n\nNazis developed an elaborate system of propaganda to diffuse these theories. Nazi architecture, for example, was used to create the \"new order\" and improve the \"Aryan race.\" Sports were also seen by the Nazis as a way to \"regenerate the race\" by exposing supposedly inferior peoples, namely the Jews, as slovenly, sedentary and out-of-shape. The Hitler Youth, founded in 1922, had among its basic motivations the training of future \"Aryan supermen\" and future soldiers who would faithfully fight for the Third Reich.\n\nCinema was also used to promote racist theories, under the direction of Joseph Goebbels' Propagandaministerium. The German Hygiene Museum in Dresden diffused racial theories. A 1934 poster of the museum shows a man with distinctly African features and reads, \"If this man had been sterilized there would not have been born ... 12 hereditarily diseased.\"\"(sic)\" According to the current director Klaus Voegel, \"The Hygiene Museum was not a criminal institute in the sense that people were killed here,\" but \"it helped to shape the idea of which lives were worthy and which were worthless.\"\n\nNazi racial theories soon translated into legislation, most notably with the 1935 Nuremberg Laws and the July 1933 Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring. The Aktion T4 euthanasia programme, in which the \"Kraft durch Freude\" (KdF, literally \"Strength Through Joy\") youth organisation participated, targeted people accused of representing a danger of \"degeneration\" towards the \"Deutsche Volk.\" Under the race laws, sexual relations between Aryans (cf. Aryan certificate) and non-Aryans known as \"Rassenschande\" (\"race defilement\") became punishable by law. To preserve the \"racial purity\" of the German blood, after the beginning of the war the Nazis extended the race defilement law to include all foreigners (non-Germans).\n\nDespite the laws against \"Rassenschande\", allegations of rape against Jewish women during the Holocaust by Nazi soldiers have surfaced.\n\nThe Nazi regime called for all German people wanting to be citizens of the Reich to produce proof of Aryan ancestry, certain exceptions were made when Hitler issued the \"German Blood Certificate\" for those people classified by the race laws to be of partial Aryan and Jewish ancestry.\n\nDuring World War II, Germanization efforts were carried out in central and eastern Europe to cull those of \"German blood\" there. This started with the classification of people into the Volksliste. Those selected were either sent for Germanization, or killed to prevent \"German blood\" being used against the Nazis. In regions of Poland, many Poles were either murdered or deported to make room for Baltic Germans induced to emigrate after the pact with the USSR. Efforts were made to identify people of German descent with Nordic traits from pre-war citizens of Poland, once chosen if the individual passed the screening process test of being considered \"racially valuable\" they were then abducted from their parents to be Germanized and then sent to Germany to be raised as Germans, those children who failed racist tests were used as test subjects in medical experiments or used as slaves in German industry.\n\nWestern countries, such as France, were treated less roughly because they were viewed as racially superior to the \"subhuman\" Poles that were to be enslaved and exterminated, though not as good as full Germans; a complex of racial categories was boiled down by the average German to mean \"East is bad and West is acceptable.\" Still, extensive racial classification was practiced in France, for future uses.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "286819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286819", "title": "New class", "text": "New class\n\nThe new class is used as a polemic term by critics of countries that followed the Soviet type of Communism to describe the privileged ruling class of bureaucrats and Communist Party functionaries which arose in these states. Generally, the group known in the Soviet Union as the nomenklatura conforms to the theory of the new class. The term was earlier applied to other emerging strata of the society.\n\nMilovan Đilas' \"New Class\" theory was also used extensively by anti-Communist commentators in the West in their criticism of the Communist states during the Cold War.\n\nThe term \"red bourgeoisie\" is a pejorative synonym for the term new class, crafted by leftist critics and movements (like the 1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade).\n\nNew class is also used as a term in late 1960s post-industrial sociology.\n\nA theory of the new class was developed by Milovan Đilas the Vice President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito, who participated with Tito in the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, but was later purged by him as Đilas began to advocate democratic and egalitarian ideals (which he believed were more in line with the way socialism and communism should look like). However, there were also personal antagonisms between the two men, and Tito felt Đilas undermined his leadership. The theory of the new class can be considered to oppose the theories of certain ruling Communists, such as Joseph Stalin, who argued that their revolutions and/or social reforms would result in the extinction of any ruling class as such. It was Đilas' observation as a member of a Communist government that Party members stepped into the role of ruling class – a problem which he believed should be corrected through revolution. Đilas' completed his primary work on his new class theory in the mid-1950s. While Đilas was in prison, it was published in 1957 in the West under the title \"\".\n\nĐilas claimed that the new class' specific relationship to the means of production was one of collective political control, and that the new class' property form was political control. Thus for Đilas the new class not only seeks expanded material reproduction to politically justify its existence to the working class, but it also seeks expanded reproduction of political control as a form of property in itself. This can be compared to the capitalist who seeks expanded value through increased sharemarket values, even though the sharemarket itself does not necessarily reflect an increase in the value of commodities produced. Đilas uses this argument about property forms to indicate why the new class sought parades, marches and spectacles despite this activity lowering the levels of material productivity.\n\nĐilas proposed that the new class only slowly came to self-consciousness of itself as a class. On arriving at a full self-consciousness the initial project undertaken would be massive industrialisation in order to cement the external security of the new class' rule against foreign or alternative ruling classes. In Đilas' schema this approximated the 1930s and 1940s in the Soviet Union. As the new class suborns all other interests to its own security during this period, it freely executes and purges its own members in order to achieve its major goal of security as a ruling class.\n\nAfter security has been achieved, the new class pursues a policy of moderation towards its own members, effectively granting material rewards and freedom of thought and action within the new classso long as this freedom is not used to undermine the rule of the new class. Đilas identified this period as the period of Khrushchev's government in the Soviet Union. Due to the emergence of conflicts of policy within the new class, the potential for palace coups, or populist revolutions is possible (as experienced in Poland and Hungary respectively).\n\nFinally Đilas predicted a period of economic decline, as the political future of the new class was consolidated around a staid programme of corruption and self-interest at the expense of other social classes. This can be interpreted as a prediction of the Leonid Brezhnev so-called Era of Stagnation by Đilas.\n\nWhile Đilas claimed that the new class was a social class with a distinct relationship to the means of production, he did not claim that this new class was associated with a self-sustaining mode of production. This claim, within Marxist theory, argues that the Soviet-style societies must eventually either collapse backwards towards capitalism, or experience a social revolution towards real socialism. This can be seen as a prediction of the downfall of the Soviet Union.\n\nRobert Kaplan's 1993 book \"Balkan Ghosts: A Journey through history\" also contains a discussion with Đilas, who used his model to anticipate many of the events that subsequently came to pass in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nMarxists, like Ernest Mandel, have criticised Djilas for ignoring the existence of a new socio-economic system, which cannot be reconciled with the old class system. \n\nOf course, the specific notions of Đilas are his own development, however the idea that bureaucrats in a typical Marxist–Leninist style state become a new class is not his original idea. Mikhail Bakunin had made this point in his International Workingmen's Association debates with Marx in the mid-to-late 19th century. This idea was repeated after the Russian revolution by anarchists like Kropotkin and Makhno, as well as some Marxists. In 1911 Robert Michels first proposed the Iron law of oligarchy, which described the development of bureaucratic hierarchies in supposedly egalitarian and democratic socialist parties. It was later repeated by a leader of the Russian Revolution, Leon Trotsky through his theory of degenerated workers state. Further on, Mao Zedong also had his own version of this idea developed during the Socialist Education Movement to criticize the Communist Party of China under Liu Shaoqi. Of course, this wide range of people over the decades had different perspectives on the matter, but there was also a degree of core agreement on this idea.\n\nFrom the other side of the fence, the work of Friedrich Hayek also anticipated many of Đilas' New Class criticisms, without placing them in a Marxist context (see esp. \"The Road to Serfdom\"). American neoconservatives adapted New Class analysis in their theory of the managerial state. Karl Popper's criticisms of utopian social pursuits in \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" are markedly similar to Đilas' views, which were nonetheless developed independently (see note 6 to Chapter 18 of \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" and related text).\n\nCanadian-American liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith also wrote about a similar phenomenon under Capitalism, the emergence of a technocratic layer in \"The New Industrial State\" and \"The Affluent Society\".\n\nThe \"New Class\" model as a theory of new social groups in post-industrial societies gained ascendency during the 1970s as social and political scientists noted how \"New Class\" groups were shaped by post-material orientations in their pursuit of political and social goals (Bruce-Briggs, B. The New Class? New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction. 1979). New Class themes \"no longer have a direct relationship to the imperatives of economic security\" (Inglehart, Ronald. 'The Silent Revolution in Europe: the intergenerational change in post-industrial society'. American Political Science Review. 65. 1971:991-1017).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5126081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5126081", "title": "Pashto media", "text": "Pashto media\n\nPashto media includes Pashto literature, Pashto-language newspapers, magazines, television and radio stations, as well as Pashto films and Pashto internet. Pashto media involves the Pashtuns of Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Pashtun diaspora around the world.\n\nPashto is not only the name of a language, but it comprises all traditions, norms and values of the Pashtun people. The history of Pashto language comprises thousands of years. It is widely believed among the Pashtuns that the earliest written Pashto poems were written in the 8th century CE by Amir Kror Suri of Ghor, Afghanistan. Amir Kror was the son of Amir Polad and they belonged to the Suri Pashtun tribe. Since paper was not much in use in the Pashtun territory, Poets usually performed poetry verbally and its fans memorized the work. Another reason may be that most Pashtuns were nomads and warriors, thus lack writing skills. Due to these and other reasons, Pashto remained as a verbal language only. The poems by Amir Kror Suri were discovered and saved in Pata Khazana, a work compiled by Shah Hussain Hotaki and last edited by professor Abdul Hai Habibi from Kandahar. Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani was another poet of that period. He was born around the Helmand Province in the 9th century. He was the student of Ullema of Basat. It is also said that he was the student of popular Arabic writer, Ibn-e-Khalid. Hashim Sarwani translated some Arabic poems in Pashto, and his work also came under light through the book, Pata Khazana. He also wrote a book, SaloVagma, meaning ‘deserted breeze’ on the eloquence of Arabic verses. After Abu Muhammad Hashim Sarwani, Sheikh Razi is another poet whose work is saved in the book, Pata Khazana. He belonged to the Lodi tribe of Pashtuns. Similarly, there are many other poets in the first phase of Pashto poetry (i.e. Amir Nasir Lodhi, Beat Neeka, Ismail Ster Bani (son of Beat Neeka), Kharshaboon (cousin of Ismail Ster Bani), Sheikh Asad Soori and others).\nغازی ارسلاخان اتمانخيل دلورالای دباچاخان لاروی وواودلارډسفورډانګليس سره يی شکر په شکر کښي ورکړيوو\n\nIntellectual, scholars and critics divide Pashto literature into two parts, i.e. poetry and prose. Poetic literature like Amir Crore Nazam and Sheikh Mati Munajat were all in poetic form. Prose found its place in Pashto literature very late. The reason is that poetry is a far common and effective genre for translating and expressing one’s feeling into it and conveying the same to others. However prose vis-à-vis poetry appeals to a very selective mind and heart. Now the question arises as to when prose writing came into vogue in Pashto literature. There are various profound claims and arguments regarding the origin of prose in Pashto literature like it having been originated as back as 223 Hijri in the form of translation of Arabic verses in book titled ‘SaloVagma’ (Deserted Breeze). Since the book is not vogue and the idea is based on mere assumption, it cannot be taken as authentic. Similarly, another book Tazkiratul Aulia, written by Suleman Makoo in 612 Hijri, is said to be the first recognized book in Pashto. The book contains descriptions of major Aulia, like Shiekh Malkair, Shiekh Ismial and Sheikh Bakhtiar. The complete book is not in existence but a part of it is available. However, the oldest complete prose book in Pashto that is still in existence today is Khairul Bayan. After that we come across Akhund Darvez’s book title Makhzanul Islam and various other books written in the 9th and 10th centuries by Babu Jan, Mlamast Zamand, Allah Yar, and Akhun Qasim. But all these books were in prose-verse as they contained difficult words and rhetorical expressions and poetic rhythms as well. After that comes the era of the great Pashto poet Khushal Khan Khattak, who along with his family has made a remarkable contribution to Pashto prose writing. His sons, one of his daughters, Haleema Khatak and his grandchildren (Khushaal Khan Khatak’s) contributed to Pashto prose in an especially unique way. It was this period when prose was written in clear, short and easy to follow and comprehensible form. Then comes the period of some of the greatest prose writers Saleh Mohammad, Ghulam Mohyuddin Afghan, Zamarley, Maulvi Mir Ahmed Shah, and Abdul Rauf Qaney further contributed to the cause of Pashto prose in Afghanistan. To conclude, Pashto expressions far more exceeds prose collections in Pashto literature as prose needs special attention on the part of intellectuals and critics and as this very form of expression is less developed in prose vis-à-vis poetry.\n\nThe Pashto Academy was established during the mid-1950s in Peshawar, the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The founder of the academy was Maulana Abdul Qadir who since his student-life was very concerned about the future of Pashto language. He was a scholar in Arabic, Persian, English, Urdu and Pashto. The establishment of the Academy helped give writers and intellectuals a platform, as well as helping the Pashto written word adopt a certain discipline. The academy publishes a quarterly magazine, \"Pashto\", providing an establishment of appreciation for the Pashto prose form.\n\nPositive impact of the Pashto Academy on Pashto literature: The Pashto academy has played an important role in the development of Pashto language as the total number of books published after the establishment of the Pashto Academy are many-fold more than the number of books published in the past 1200 years of literary history of Pashto language. To conclude, we can say Pashto literature, especially, Pashto poetry is on its peak as the Pashto poets are not afraid to write Ghazal, couplet or to do any kind of poetry, containing four, six or eight stanzas. The late historian, Khan Roshan khan from Swabi District along with Pashto Academy wrote the book,\"Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmat khani\".\n\nSyed Rahat Zakheili was not only a novelist and fiction writer of Pashto language, but Pashto first journalist who through journalism served the Pashto literature. To develop the Pashto literature, he started a weekly newspaper. \"Afghan\" and appreciated the Pashto poets and writers through the weekly. Unlike other language newspapers, Pashto journalism started to develop the Pashto literature, so we can easily say that there was a strong link between Pashto literature and Pashto journalism and the journalism started as to help develop the Pashto literature. The editor of the weekly, \"Afgahn\" was Syed Abdullah Shah Kaka Khiel. Before Afghann Pashto journalism existed, but not in a regular and disciplined way. For instance, \"Al Jihad\", one page newspaper owned by Abdul Ghaffar Peshawari used to be published under the editorship of Ghazi Abdul Ghafoor of Swat. Haji Sab Torakzai established a Litho press (printing press) in Tribal areas in 1915 during the ‘Jihad’ against Britain. Through this press special kind of pamphlets against the Britain used to publish and distributed among the people of the tribal areas. Similarly, \"Al Mujahid\" was another Pashto newspaper which started publishing in 1923 under the editorship of Maulvi Muhammad Bashir. This newspaper also used to publish in the tribal areas and printed material against the Britain. \"Zalmi Pashtoon\" was another daily newspaper which used to publish in 1933 and \"Hamdard Afghan\" published in 1929 under the editor ship of Khan Mir Hilali. During these days, Mohammad Nawaz Khatak started \"Watan\" that was a weekly newspaper.\n\n\"Wahdat\" and \"Khabroona\" are the two main dailies from Peshawar, Pakistan. \"Wahdat\" started its publication in the 1980s during the Afghan war for the purpose to create a link between Pashtoons living on the Pakistan-Afghan border. \"Daily Qudrat\" is the only Pashto daily published in Quetta, Pakistan. Weekly Newspaper \"BADLOON\" published from Mardan Editor Muhammad Zaman Adil.in Association of Writer Hands Media Group.\nThe editorial policy of the newspaper is free in a way that the paper is not under any kind of pressure from the government. Most of the material published in the editorial is Islamic. The newspaper mostly contains Islamic material. One page is a literature page comprising, editions related to religion (Islam). No such place has been given to sports or show biz news. \"Wahdat\" has no such magazine, etc., as supplement. \"Wahdat\" is mostly read in cities of Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, Karachi and Kandahar. \"Khabroona\" is another daily newspaper of Pashto language that started between 2001 and 2002. Khabroona is read in Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, suburbs of Peshawar and in Kabul, Afghanistan. Editorial policy of the newspaper is quite free and liberal as well vis-à-vis Wahdat. The newspaper is not under any governmental pressure. The content of the newspaper is quite different from Wahdat, as it gives enough space to sports and show-biz news. As for its ad policy, the newspaper publishes government and private sector ads. The head offices of both Wahdat and Khabroona are in Peshawar.\n\nThe regular publication of magazines in Pashto language started when the owner of the weekly Afghan, Rahat Zakheili, started the magazine, Stari Mashi in 1931. During those days \"Pashtoon magazine\" started under the editorship of Abdul Khaliq. And then some other people found the environment conducive for magazines reading and started the magazines like Selab and Angar on regular bases. During the world war-II, a magazine, Nan Paroon was published from Delhi under the editorship of Maulana Abdul Qadir and barrister Nasrullah Khan. Khyber Magazine, a magazine published from Government Islamia College, Peshawar in the 1950s played a great role to project the views and problems of students on one hand and to promote Pashto literature on the other hand. Some other magazines which have their own fundamental and historical place in Pashto journalism are Qand, Adal, Qandeel and Tamas. These magazines have ceased publication. Monthly magazine \"KARAHMAR\" published from Peshawar editor Muhammad Zaman Adil in Association of Writer Hands Media Group.\n\nNoor-ul-bashaf Naveed publishes the magazine \"Likwal\". \"Pashtun\" is claimed by Awami National Party. One of the most popular Pashto magazines is \"Pasoon\", headed by Dr Israr. Watan and Mashal are the other two Pashto magazines\n\nRadio Kabul is the official radio station of Afghanistan. The first radio transmitters were installed in Kabul in the 1920s. King Amanullah Khan installed a 200 watt Russian transmitter operating at AM 833 kHz at his Kabul Palace in 1925. The transmitter was replaced in 1931 by King Nadir Khan, and was upgraded during Zahir Shah's reign in 1940 when a new 20 kilowatt transmitter was installed in its place, operating at 600 kHz.\n\nIn the meantime, \"Radio Pakistan, Peshawar\" started its programs in 1935. The first word broadcast from the station was \"Kalma-e-Tauheed\". Radio had great importance at the time because there were limited newspapers and no televisions, people listened to radio not only for news but for entertainment purposes as well. Radio has an important role in the lives of the Pashtun people. Since the literacy rate is low among them, every family has a radio set in their house. Even the women in rural areas are informed and entertained by radio.\n\nStations like FM Boraq and FM 101 are heard in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The private radio stations usually discuss the problems of youths, and as a result of which they listen to it and owing to this, these private stations get more funds as compared to the stations supervised by the government. Radio Pakistan in Peshawar played a huge role in the development of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Not only does it broadcast entertainment programs but also programs related to the development and welfare of the province. For instance, it broadcasts programs for women development, for health, education, for children, agriculture and so on. Pakistani FM radios which promots Pashto partially or fully:\nRadio stations from international religious organizations are also broadcast into the region. These stations tend to focus on community issues with programs about education, children, health and reconciliation.\n\nPashto though mainly a language in Afghanistan and Pakistan; is spoken in many parts of the world due to the large diaspora of these two countries. There are also a large number of Pashtuns living overseas particularly in the Middle East. Nabi Misdaq founded the Pashto Section of BBC World Service in the 1980s and in the same period Ali Ahmad Jalali was involved with Voice of America's Pashto in the United States. Some Pashto-language programs are included in the following international stations:\n\n\nThe above radio stations broadcast different programs like \"Khabarnama\" (news), dramas, musical, women and agricultural related programs. Similarly, most of the programs comprise literary short-dramas, discussions and mushairas.\n\nAssociation of Radio Journlaists (ARJ) is first Radio Journalists forum of Khyber pakhtunkhwa nad FATA. Muhammad Zaman Adil first elected president of ARJ.\n\nThe first TV channels broadcasting Pashto programs were during the 1970s. Pakistan Television Peshawar (PTV Peshawar) was inaugurated in 1974, at 2-Fort Road in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan. All programs were transmitted in black and white until February 1982 when color was transmission began. Besides Pashto. PTV Quetta was inaugurated in November 1974. In the meantime, Afghanistan had its own TV stations in the 1970s and 1980s, in which programs in Pashto and Dari were being broadcast throughout the country. During the Taliban era from 1994 to 2001, TV was banned in Afghanistan. It restarted under the 2001–present NATO-backed Karzai administration, and a number of stations are available which broadcast in Pashto. Voice of America in the United States also has a Pashto section called \"Ashna TV\", which mainly broadcasts current news. One of its usual anchor is Ibrahim Nasar, a Pashtun from the Balochistan-Kandahar region.\n\nAVT Khyber started its transmission in 2004 from Asia set 3. Earlier the period of time for programmes was 12 hours, but on completion of one year it extended the time period to 24 hours. AVT Khyber is mainly Pashto channel . The channel shows all kind of program, from talk shows and dramas to videos and movies. Like PTV Peshawar, the programs of AVT Khyber also consist of entertainment, news and current affairs. The policy for its news is the same as that of other private channels in the country.\nShamshad TV is a satellite television station based in Afghanistan, which was launched in early 2006. The channel broadcasts 18 hours a day, providing educational, news, shows, dramas, and entertaining programs to the Afghanistan region as well as other countries via satellite. Its name is taken from a mountain named \"Shamshad\", which is one of the highest mountains in Afghanistan. It transmits hourly news, current affairs programs, entertainment programs, politics programs, sports programs and criminal incidents programs. It has many live shows such as Dini Larkhowani (Religious Guidance) and Nizaam Ao Meezaan (Government and Balance). Lemar TV (meaning \"Sun TV\" in Pashto) is another TV station based in Afghanistan, which was also launched in 2006. The channel broadcasts news, shows, and entertainment programs to certain parts of the country.\n\nIn the 2000s, Pashto joined the internet world. There are many websites which provide news and other information in the Pashto language. All Afghanistan related government or private websites provide access in Pashto language. Wikipedia and other international organizations also have Pashto versions available.\n\nIn August 2014, Sabaoon TV channel launched in Mardan, Pakistan which the first pashto's HD Tv channel.\n\nsome other new Pashto channels includes Aruj TV, Pashto 1, Attanr Tv and many others.\n\nPashto films are widely shown in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The first Pashto film was \"Laila Majnoon\", released in 1942. It was shown in Peshawar, Quetta, Calcutta (now India). The director of the film was Mir Hamza Shinwari, while its composer was Abdul Karim. The heroine of Laila Majnoon was Harry Jay and the hero was Rafiqe Ghaznawi. The second Pashto film was made in 1960 and its story was a translation of an Urdu film, \"Nai Kiran\" (new ray). The dialogues of the film were written by Mir Hamza Shinwari. It was displayed at Novelty cinema, Peshawar. Pashto's 3rd film was the 1963 \"Tiga\", also made by Mir Hamza Shinwari. The hero of the film was Umer Daraz, while Ludeel was the cameraman of the film. Then in 1968 another film \"Yakka Yousaf Khan\" was released. The heroine of the film was Ghazali while the hero was Rab Nawaz. This film was inaugurated by Urdu film star, Rangila.\n\n\nSimilarly \"Darrae Khyber\", \"Adam Khan Durkhanai\" (produced by Shakil Ayub and directed by Aziz Tabassum), \"Musa Khan Gul Makai\" (hero was Asif Khan and heroine was Yasmin Khan), \"Bahadur Khan\" (hero was Humayun Qureshi), \"Ajab Khan Afridi\", \"Zama Badan\"', \"Maghrur\", \"Oarbal\", \"Topak Zama Qanoon\" (produced by Aziz Tabassum), \"Dahqan\" (produced by Badar Munir), \"Baghi\", \"Arman\", \"Miranae Roar\" (step brother), \"Tarbooz\", \"Iqrar\", \"Angar\", \"Zakhmoona\", \"Navae au Nakriza\" (Bridal and Henna), \"Ujrati Qatil\", \"Da Aoochea Khan\", \"Prdang\", \"Toofani Shappa\", \"Bangri au Hathqardae\", \"Ab-e-Hyat\", \"Khulea Nave\", \"Kufar au Islam\", \"Da Karye Gorilla\" and many more are the Pashto hits from 1970-71 to 1985.\n\nRole of film in the development of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: From 1960 to 1980s Pashto film enjoyed its great times. Its standard was on no grounds less than that of Urdu films till mid-1970s and even 1980s. If there were waheed Murad, Nadim and Mohammad Ali in Lollywood (Urdu films), so Badar Munir, Asif Khan and many others were the chocolate heroes of\n\nDuring these days cinema was the most effective way to communicate with the people as the standard of the movies were very good. Until the mid-1980s films were made on almost every subject and the people really loved to watch Pashto movies in cinema. So Pashto films played a great role in development of Pakhtoon khuwa as though cinema used to situate only in the urban areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but people from far flung areas came to cities such as Peshawar, Mardan, and Mingora to watch films. Now though the standard of the Pashto film has fallen very much, but the youths, especially the rural people still love to go to cinema.\n\nPashto films in the 1990s: until 1990 there were some great names in the Pashto film industry. For instance, Mir Hamza Shinwari who was a producer, director and a great name in the Pashto poetry. Murad Shinwari is the one whose name comes in the list of the producers and directors who really served the Pashto industry in its real sense. Amir Ghulam Sadiq is the only name in the Pashto film industry, who did poetry for Pashto films for almost more than 30 years. But after 1990 owing to the absence of institutionalization in the Pashto film industry, there were no such dedicated people, which in intern created environment conducive to vulgarity and obscenity and the standard of the Pashto films fell.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38653919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38653919", "title": "Prostitution in Benin", "text": "Prostitution in Benin\n\nProstitution in Benin is legal but related activities such as brothel keeping and benefiting from the prostitution of others are illegal. UNAIDS estimates there to be about 15,000 prostitutes in the country. Most of these are migrants from neighbouring countries, mainly Nigeria, Togo and Ghana. Only 15% of the prostitutes are Beninese. Prostitution occurs on the streets, in bars, restaurants, hotels and brothels. With advent of the smartphone, many prostitutes use apps to make arrangements with clients.\n\nMany women enter prostitution for economic reasons. Some young Beninese women learn English so they can go to Nigeria to work as prostitutes as Nigeria has a thriving sex industry.\n\nIn rural areas widows will discretely turn to prostitution to support her family. This is a cultural and social tradition that is not regarded as prostitution by the community, but is regarded as a method of preserving the family name. Any children born from these liaisons take the dead husband's name. It's not uncommon for a widow to have five children after her husband has died.\n\nHIV, sex trafficking and child sex tourism are problems in the country.\n\nAs with other sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem. Sex workers are amongst the high risk groups. Clients are often soldiers and truck drivers. Because of their travelling, if they become infected, potentially they spread the infection over a wide area.\n\nIn 1992, a prevention project, supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was implemented among sex workers in the largest city, Cotonou. This saw condom use increase and HIV amongst sex workers fall from 53.3% in 1993 to 30.4% in 2008. The prevalence of other STIs also fell significantly in the same period: gonorrhoea 43.2 to 6.4% and chlamydia 9.4 to 2.8%.\n\nThe NGO, Centre d'Etudes, de Recherches et d'Interventions pour le Développement (CERID), provides sex workers with free medical treatment and counselling. UNAIDS reported in 2016 that the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers in the country was 15.7%.\n\nBenin is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children subjected to sex trafficking. Most identified victims are Beninese girls subjected to sex trafficking in Cotonou and across Benin’s southern corridor. Togolese girls are exploited in commercial sex in Benin. Cases of child sex tourism involving both boys and girls along the coast and within the department of Mono have been reported in previous years. A 2016 survey conducted in the cities of Cotonou in southern Benin and Malanville in northern Benin indicated that girls are subjected to sexual exploitation, including potential sex trafficking, in these two cities. The department of Oueme in southeast Benin was reportedly a primary area of recruitment for child trafficking victims subsequently exploited in the Republic of the Congo. Most child victims intercepted in Benin, either from Benin or other West African countries, are exploited or en route to exploitation within the country. Benin is the largest source country for trafficking victims in the Republic of the Congo; Beninese victims are also subjected to trafficking in Nigeria, Gabon, and Lebanon. West African women are exploited in commercial sex in Benin. Young Beninese women are recruited from Benin by unlicensed Beninese and Lebanese recruiters for domestic work in Lebanon and Kuwait; reportedly, some are forced into commercial sex. OCPM reports that traffickers no longer travel with child victims being moved internally or to nearby countries. Victims now travel alone and are met by traffickers or their accomplices once they reach their destination. This tactic makes investigations more difficult.\n\nExisting laws do not prohibit all forms of trafficking. The 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking (act 2006-04) criminalizes child trafficking but focuses on movement of children rather than their ultimate exploitation and prescribes penalties of six months to two years imprisonment or fines if children are moved for the purpose of labor exploitation; these penalties are not sufficiently stringent. The penal code outlaws procuring or offering a person for prostitution and the facilitation of prostitution with punishments of six months to two years imprisonment. None of these punishments are sufficiently stringent or commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes. Comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation that would criminalize all forms of trafficking, including the trafficking of adults, has been pending MOJ review since September 2012.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Benin as a 'Tier 2' country.\n"}
{"id": "24935007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24935007", "title": "Rasul Amin", "text": "Rasul Amin\n\nProfessor Rasul Amin () was a renowned Afghan politician, Lexicographer social figure, writer and former education minister.\n\nProfessor Rasul Amin was born on May 10, 1939 in a cultural diversity area, Wata Pur District of eastern Kunar Province through which Alexandar The Great, Hindus, and all of other conquers passed through this beautiful valley of Afghanistan. Rasul Amin was son of a prominent khan of the Amin tribe. His mother, Hera Amin cultural background was Greece (Nooristan). He was a great nephew of Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan. He was raised as an orphan, because his mother died when he was 5 years old. His personality was self made, and that made him positive throughout his life. His father, Amin Khan participated in the uprising with the leading attorney general, Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan in 1947. Due to the bad government he was forced to depart with Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan to Herat and Mazar-e Sharif. Rasul completed his primary education in Kunar. In 1955, he went to Peshawar, Pakistan where he wanted to desire further more studies and gather his English and Urdu languages. Overall he knew how to speak 4 languages, including Pushto and Dari. After learning the two languages, he got an admission at Forward College, and graduated in 1960. In 1960, he was admitted to Islamia College Peshawar, Pakistan. He was elected as a General-Secretary of the Khyber Union, (students’ union), in 1962, a unique, unprecedented honour for an Afghan student. In 1963, he was voted the best debater at college. He received a BA in 1964 and a double master's degree in Sociology, English and Political Science in 1966.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 he worked with the National Islamic Front of Pir Sayed Ahmad Gillani in Peshawar. 1990s, he worked with the Rome Group that was established by the former King, Muhammad Zaher Shah. He initially worked with the renowned Afghan intellectual Professor Seyyed Bahauddin Majrooh at the Afghanistan Information Centre (AIC). The AIC became a respected mouthpiece of liberal Afghan intellectuals linked to the resistance but drew the wrath of the fundamentalist factions. Prof. Majrooh was assassinated in Peshawar in 1988 after the AIC had published the results of a poll among Afghan refugees that showed that the former King was the most popular Afghan politician, way ahead of the mujahedin leaders. On 21 March 1985, Rasul established the Organization Writers Union of Free Afghanistan, which, as the AIC, was supported by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (Germany), USIS, the Asia Foundation (USA), and the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Denmark). Like the AIC, it became a renowned institution that – amongst other activities – collected documents on the Afghan resistance, one of the few to do so. He was one of the great politicians and a well known scholar of Afghanistan. He dedicated his entire life for helping his Afghanistan milat and had dream of seeing a united afghan people. Professor had written tens of books and magazines about literature, culture and sociology. He was the first author of English, Pashto and Dari language, in Asia, Africa around the world.\n\nIn 1990 Rasul Amin warned that 'If the United States cuts or reduces its aid to the Afghan cause, it will be replaced by the Arabs. Afghanistan would not be at peace for a long time.' Amin's prediction came true when in the 90s the US and the Soviet left a power vacuum and a civil war broke out where the warring factions were all supported by one of Afghans neighbour countries. Rasul Amin, one of the most notable Afghan Scholars, at that time always kept an automatic rifle behind his chair and a pistol on his desk. In 1996 he said about that Afghan Civil War \"This is not truly an Afghan fight. Only a few people who want power sell themselves to foreigners.\"\n\nRasul also played an important role in Rome Conference held in 2001 under the supervision of former king Mohammad Zahir Shah. After the fall of the Taliban regime, Prof. Amin returned to Afghanistan. At the Bonn conference, he was appointed Minister of Education in the Interim Administration of Afghanistan, representing the Rome Group. When the new school year was opened in March 2002, he said: We have decided to project a new image of ourselves. We have to forget the past if we want to rebuild this country.’During his ministry he visited Japan and met with Emperor of Japan.\n\nProfessor Rasul Amin organized peace conference, seminars and workshops for Afghanistan. The most famous seminar was in Pearl Continental, Peshawar, Pakistan during 1991, whose chief guest and chair person was Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. A lot of other scholars and prominent figures was invited on this Peace conference . Professor was very popular and famous in a group of friends. Louis Dupree and his wife, Nancy Hatch Dupree and Christina Eckerly was very close friends of him.\n\nIn 2001, Rasul Amin became the first Education Minister of Afghanistan. He stated that Afghan girls be given priority in their education and said, \"there was a big task to rebuild his homeland (Afghanistan) education system after 24 years of unrest\". That was his \"to do\" list in his early days as Afghanistan education minister. He was so committed to fulfill his duties. He was posted in 2002 and he resigned. He decided to devote himself fully to the intellectual regeneration of Afghanistan and to Afghan-Pak friendship. The 2004 article ‘Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question’ is only one in a long list of his writings.\n\nProf. Amin established the Afghanistan Study Centre (ASC) in Kabul as the successor of WUFA. The founder also became its director and the editor of the Journal of Afghanistan Studies quarterly. He served as the Minister of Education in the interim Transitional Administration under President Hamid Karzai. While being a Minister of Education, he looked after oprhan homes, schools etc. He really wanted that woman of Afghanistan should be educated. While he was in Afghanistan, he established the Afghanistan Study Centre (ASC).\n\nRasul Amin travelled all around the world. He travelled too many countries such as, America, Denmark, Switzerland, Iran, Poland, Egypt, India, Germany, France, Rome, United Kingdom, Africa, Japan, Tajikistan and Australia. While he was in Egypt, he met with Anwar Sadat. Out of all of the countries he travelled to, his particular favourite was Melbourne, Australia. He believed it was a good living place. He was in America, before his final destination to Australia.\n\nHe settled with all of his family members to Australia. He has 7 children, 3 sons and 4 daughters. The eldest is Shamim Amin Akbar, followed by Yasmin Amin Safi, Eimal Amin, the middle child, Tatara Amin Zamani, Pukhtana Amin Habib Atal Amin and the youngest, Kochie Amin. Professor Rasul Amin treated his all children equally but his middle child Pushtana Amin habib was his favourite from them all because she was a angel and wasn't afraid of anything. She was also his favourite child because she is brave and courages girl like her father.\nProfessor Abdul Rasul Amin died on October 31, 2009 at 6.15 am, Saturday morning in Melbourne, Australia due to Cancer. He wanted to be buried next to Sayed Jamaluddin Afghani's grave in Kabul University. But with no permission from the Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, he was buried in Kerala where his parents are buried too. People like Professor Amin are born once in century, he dedicated all of his life for Afghanistan Freedom, He left behind his courageous wife, Benazir Amin, 3 sons and 4 daughters. All of them are settled peacefully in Australia.\n"}

Members of the enclave are known as the Samaná Americans.\n\nThe language is a relative of the African-American Vernacular English, with variations unique to the enclave's history in the area. In the 1950 Dominican Republic census, 0.57% of the population (about 12,200 people) said that their mother tongue was English.\n\nMost speakers trace their lineage to immigrants that arrived to the Peninsula in 1824 and 1825. All of Hispaniola was all administered by Haiti, and its president was Jean-Pierre Boyer. The immigrants responded to an invitation for settlement that Jonathas Granville had delivered in person to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City. Abolitionists like Richard Allen, Samuel Cornish, Benjamin Lundy, and Loring D. Dewey joined the campaign, which was coined the Haitian emigration.\n\nThe response was unprecedented, as thousands of African Americans boarded ships in eastern cities and migrated to Haiti. Most of the immigrants arrived during the fall of 1824 and the spring of 1825. More continued moving back and forth in later years but at a slower rate.\n\nBetween 1859 and 1863, another immigration campaign brought new settlers to the island but at a fraction of the number in 1824 and 1825. Those who originally settled in Samana were fewer than 600 but formed the only surviving immigration enclave.\n\nWhile more than 6000 immigrants came in 1824 and 1835, by the end of the 19th century, only a handful of enclaves on the island spoke any variety of the antebellum Black Vernacular. They were communities in Puerto Plata, Samaná and Santo Domingo. The largest was the one in Samaná that maintained church schools, where it was preserved. During the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship (1930–1961), however, the government began a systematic policy of Hispanizing the entire Dominican population. The church schools in which English was taught were eliminated, and the language was discouraged.\n\nEnclaves across the island soon lost an important element of their identity, which led to their disintegration. Samaná English withstood the assaults in pa because the location of Samaná was favorable to a more independent cultural life. However, government policies have still influenced the language's gradual decline, which may well now be an endangered language.\n\nThe language is variously described as either a creole language or a dialect of English. It is similar to that of Caribbean English Creoles spoken by the English-speaking Caribbean, especially Turks and Caicos and Bahamian Creole.\n\nThe 15th edition (2005) of Ethnologue dropped it from its list of languages, but linguists still consider it a separate language variation.\n\n"}

{"id": "15863822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15863822", "title": "Social organization in Cambodia", "text": "Social organization in Cambodia\n\nSocial organization in Cambodia is very hierarchical. The greater a person's age, the greater the level of respect that must be granted to them. Everyone in Khmer culture is given a hierarchical title before the name - in some cases names are shortened with the title added before the name is given - which varies in relation to the person. In some cases elders are referred to by a family title even though there is no relation, out of respect to their seniority in life. Referring to someone by the improper title is a sign of disrespect and would be assumed as improper parenting or a lack of respect for elders.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the nuclear family, consisting of a husband and a wife and their unmarried children, probably continued to be the most important kin group within Khmer society. The family is the major unit of both production and consumption. Within this unit are the strongest emotional ties, the assurance of aid in the event of trouble, economic cooperation in labor, sharing of produce and income, and contribution as a unit to ceremonial obligations. A larger grouping, the personal kindred that includes a nuclear family with the children, grandchildren, grandparents, uncles, aunts, first cousins, nephews, and nieces, may be included in the household. Family organization is weak, and ties between related families beyond the kindred are loosely defined at best. There is no tradition of family names, although the French tried to legislate their use in the early twentieth century. Most Khmer genealogies extend back only two or three generations, which contrasts with the veneration of ancestors by the Vietnamese and by the Chinese. Noble families and royal families, some of which can trace their descent for several generations, are exceptions.\n\nThe individual Khmer is surrounded by a small inner circle of family and friends who constitute his or her closest associates, those he would approach first for help. In rural communities, neighbors—who are often also kin—may be important, too, and much of housebuilding and other heavy labor-intensive tasks are performed by groups of neighbors. Beyond this close circle are more distant relatives and casual friends. In rural Cambodia, the strongest ties a Khmer may develop—besides those to the nuclear family and to close friends—are those to other members of the local community. A strong feeling of pride—for the village, for the district, and province—usually characterizes Cambodian community life. There is much sharing of religious life through the local Buddhist temple, and there are many cross-cutting kin relations within the community. Formerly, the Buddhist priesthood, the national armed forces, and, to a lesser extent, the civil service all served to connect the Khmer to the wider national community. The priesthood served only males, however, while membership in some components of the armed forces and in the civil service was open to women as well.\n\nTwo fictive relationships in Cambodia transcend kinship boundaries and serve to strengthen interpersonal and interfamily ties. A Khmer may establish a fictive child-parent or sibling relationship called thoa (roughly translating as adoptive parent or sibling). The person desiring to establish the thoa relationship will ask the other person for permission to enter into the relationship. The thoa relationship may become as close as the participants desire. The second fictive relationship is that of kloeu (close male friend). This is similar, in many ways, to becoming a blood brother. A person from one place may ask a go-between in another place to help him establish a kloeu relationship with someone in that place. Once the participants agree, a ceremony is held that includes ritual drinking of water into which small amounts of the participants' blood have been mixed and bullets and knives have been dipped; prayers are also recited by an achar (or ceremonial leader) before witnesses. The kloeu relationship is much stronger than the thoa. One kloeu will use the same kinship terms when addressing his kloeu's parents and siblings as he would when addressing his own. The two friends can call upon each other for any kind of help at any time. The kloeu relationship apparently is limited to some rural parts of Cambodia and to Khmer-speaking areas in Thailand. As of the late 1980s, it may have become obsolete. The female equivalent of kloeu is mreak.\n\nLegally, the husband is the head of the Khmer family, but the wife has considerable authority, especially in family economics. The husband is responsible for providing shelter and food for his family; the wife is generally in charge of the family budget, and she serves as the major ethical and religious model for the children, especially the daughters. In rural areas, the male is mainly responsible for such activities as plowing and harrowing the rice paddies, threshing rice, collecting sugar palm juice, caring for cattle, carpentry, and buying and selling cows and chickens. Women are mainly responsible for pulling and transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting and winnowing rice, tending gardens, making sugar, weaving, and caring for the household money. Both males and females may work at preparing the rice paddies for planting, tending the paddies, and buying and selling land.\n\nOwnership of property among the rural Khmer was vested in the nuclear family. Descent and inheritance is bilateral. Legal children might inherit equally from their parents. The division of property was theoretically equal among siblings, but in practice the oldest child might inherit more. Each of the spouses might bring inherited land into the family, and the family might acquire joint land during the married life of the couple. Each spouse was free to dispose of his or her land as he or she chose. A will was usually oral, although a written one was preferred.\n\nAs the married couple moves through life they have children, nurture and train them, educate them, and marry them off. When they become too old to support themselves, they may invite the youngest child's family to move in and to take over running the household. At this stage in their lives, they enjoy a position of high status, they help care for grandchildren, and they devote more time in service to the wat (temple).\n"}
{"id": "23799435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23799435", "title": "Sustainable Governance Indicators", "text": "Sustainable Governance Indicators\n\nThe Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), first published in spring 2009 and updated in 2011, analyze and compare the need for reform in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, as well as each country's ability to respond to current social and political challenges. The project is designed to create a comprehensive data pool on government-related activities in the countries considered the world's most developed free-market democracies. In addition, it uses international comparisons to provide evidence-based input for reform-related public discourse taking place in these countries. The SGI are updated every two or three years.\n\nThe Bertelsmann Foundation is an operational think tank that encourages social change and aims to foster sustainability by identifying nascent challenges early on and by developing strategies to face these issues.\n\nThree scholars with established country expertise are involved in the analysis of each OECD state under review. In an attempt to identify and reduce subjective bias, the SGI project selects experts representing both domestic and external views as well as the viewpoints of political scientists and economists. Comparative political scientists with area expertise then integrate the two expert reports into a single country report, and select information according to certain validity and objectivity criteria.\n\nThe SGI concept is inspired by the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Transformation Index (BTI). The Transformation Index focuses on 128 countries—all of which are transitioning to a market-based democracy or potentially headed in that direction—and assesses the extent to which political management fulfils criteria regarding sustainability, democracy founded on the rule of law, social integration and welfare. Since 2002, the BTI has been documenting the progress 128 transformation countries have been making toward democracy and a market economy.\nUsing a similar approach to BTI, the SGI evaluate the extent to which OECD member states are in a position, given changing domestic and international conditions, to implement the reforms necessary for ensuring their future viability. By measuring the need for reform along with the effectiveness of existing initiatives, the SGI aims to identify the best policy solutions for promoting democracy and a market economy.\n\nThe need for reform within a country is analyzed in the Sustainable Governance Indicators in the Status Index, while the capacity for reform is analyzed in the Management Index.\n\nStatus Index scores are composite measures, based on numerous quantitative and qualitative assessments. The democracy category counts for half of the index score, while the four policy-specific categories collectively provide the remainder.\n\nThe Status Index analyzes the need for reform through two principle dimensions: \n\nManagement Index scores are composite measures, based on numerous quantitative and qualitative assessments. The three categories \"Steering Capability,\" \"Policy Implementation\" and \"Institutional Learning\" collectively count for half of the index score, while the Executive Accountability dimension provides the remaining half. The Management Index considers, in relative terms, how capable governments and societies are of effective reform.\n\nThe Management Index examines government performance and analyzes a country's reform capacity through two dimensions: \n\nThe top rankings of the Status Index are dominated by northern European countries. At the same time, the leading group also includes New Zealand, with its Anglo-Saxon heritage, and continental European Switzerland, two nations with different political and state welfare traditions.\n\nThe group of mid-range scorers (Canada, Australia, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United States, Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Czech Republic, France, Portugal, Japan, Chile, Spain, and Poland) and the lowest-ranking group (South Korea, Italy, Slovakia, Mexico, Greece, and Turkey) are geographically and culturally just as heterogeneous as the top group.\nStandard typologies in comparative political science are insufficient to explain the Status Index ranking of the OECD nations. For example, majoritarian democracies do not systematically score better or worse than consensus democracies. Classifying the countries as federalist and centralist states also fails to help explain the differences in reform capacity.\nThe top group includes, above all, social democratic welfare states such as the Scandinavian countries. However, liberal welfare states also achieve high scores, with New Zealand, Switzerland and Canada in the upper mid-range. In general, the findings of the Status Index reveal higher scores among long-term, established OECD members – although there are exceptions: Chile, a new member, places in the lower midrange, while Italy and Greece rank significantly lower than some Eastern European countries. This suggests that the smaller, more open national economies tend to pursue especially sustainable policies.\n\nAt the highest level of aggregation in the Management Index, the overview provides important initial indications of which countries exhibit the best performance of governance overall and which countries show deficiencies. Background information in greater depth on the performance of a given country can be found in the country reports on the SGI website. These include substantiated, qualitative information right down to the level of individual indicators.\n\nThe SGI Management Indicators are clearly led by Sweden and Norway, each with average scores exceeded 8 points. Next come Denmark, Finland, New Zealand and Australia. While the overall ranking of northern European countries is again outstanding, as observed in the Status Index, this sequence also underscores the fact that no particular system type is favored in the Management Index. This top group is followed by a broad mid-range in which the changes in index scores are incremental, leaving no discernible clusters. Clearly bringing up the rear of the survey are Greece and Slovakia. Both countries trail Italy, which is 29th in the ranking, by nearly an entire point. The new OECD member Chile stands out positively, already scoring higher than some established, longstanding OECD states.\n\nThe central finding of the SGI is that the quality of governance is most important in ensuring sustainable policy outcomes. Countries with \"good executive management performance, a sound democratic order and an effective inclusion of societal actors into policymaking processes are more successful in terms of sustainability and also in terms of social justice.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "11566278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11566278", "title": "Yanesha people", "text": "Yanesha people\n\nThe Yanesha' or Amuesha people are an ethnic group of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. Presently, the most recent census count puts their population at over 7,000 distributed among 48 communities located in Puerto Inca Province (Huánuco), Chanchamayo Province (Junín) and Oxapampa Province (Pasco). They are a relatively small group, making up barely 2.91% of indigenous inhabitants located in the Peruvian Amazon. Their communities are situated in altitudes ranging from 200 to 1600 meters above sea level and can also be found along the shores of various rivers including the Pichis, Palcazu, Pachitea, Huancabamba, Cacazú, Chorobamba, and the Yurinaqui Rivers.\n\nThe Yanesha' are also known as Amage, Amagues, Amaje, Amajo, Amoishe, Amueixa, Amuese, Amuesha, Amuetamo, Lorenzo, and Omage.\n\nThe Yanesha people speak Yanesha', a language belonging to the Maipurean language family, that also includes Asháninka, Yine, and others. A dictionary and grammar have been published in Yanesha', which is written in the Latin script.\n\nThe tribe's first contact with non-native people came through friars who, in the second half of the 16th century, made an incursion into the region. However, it was not until the 18th century that missionaries (this time Franciscans) managed to establish steady relations with the Yanesha’ and other ethnic groups living nearby. Father Francisco de San José founded various missions around Cerro de la Sal and Quimiri in order to convert the indigenous populations to Christianity. However, in 1742, indigenous people commanded by Juan Santos Atahualpa rebelled against the Spaniards and destroyed a number of missions, effectively cutting off outside contact for several decades.\n\nIt’s not known for sure the population of the Yanesha' people at this time but they had certainly already begun to die off from European diseases. During the 19th century, the area inhabited by the Yanesha’ and other groups was reexplored by expeditions looking to establish routes to the lower Amazon and to colonize the area.\n\nThe arrival of westerners represented for the Yanesha' the loss of land and a dramatic change of living customs ensued; they were grouped into towns and their extensive territories became the property of colonists. With this situation, they were compelled to group together and became the first ethnic group to form a professional organization: the Amuesha Congress. This later became the Yanesha' Federation. The Law of Indigenous Communities (sp: \"La Ley de Comunidades Indígenas\"), promulgated in 1974, partly repaired the situation of dispossession by granting some land to Yanesha' groups.\n\nThe Yanesha' people once lived through hunting, fishing, and subsistence agriculture; in modern times, the emphasis is on agricultural diversification and cultivation of cash crops like coffee and annatto. Hunting became much rarer after the Yanesha' people began raising animals for consumption. In addition, groups have begun exploiting Cat’s claw. The marketing of ceramic crafts has also become a source of income.\n\nIn 1988, a territory of over 34,774 hectares was set up in Palcazu District as the Yanesha' Communal Reservation (\"Reserva Communal Yanesha\"') with the purpose of protecting important fauna that serves as sustenance to Yanesha' communities in the area.\n\n"}
