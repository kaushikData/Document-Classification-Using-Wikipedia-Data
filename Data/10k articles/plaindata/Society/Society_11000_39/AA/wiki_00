The officers planned to remove the secular government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with an Islamic government led Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed. Sheikh Mujib and most of his family members were killed in the coup.\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence in 26 March 1971 from Pakistan. Bangladesh fought a 9-month liberation war that ended with the surrender of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh to an allied force of Bangladeshi and Indian Armed forces. Bangladesh Awami League in 1973 won by a landslide in the first parliamentary election of Bangladesh. On 7 June 1975, Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League was formed which made Bangladesh a one party state with the passing of the fourth amendment to the constitution; and Sheikh Mujibur was made the President of the one party state.\n\nIn 1973, Major Shariful Haque Dalim and his wife had gotten into a scuffle with the sons of Gazi Golam Mostafa, at a function in Dhaka Ladies club. In retaliation, some officers and soldiers of the Lancer unit and 2 Field Artillery Regiment of Bangladesh Army attacked the residence of Golam Mostofa. Golam Mostofa was a leader of Bangladesh Awami League, the ruling party of Bangladesh. Major Dalim, Major S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury and others officers were charged with breech of discipline. Major Dalim had sought help from President Sheikh Mujib but was refused. Major Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan resigned from the army over the incident. Major Dalim and Major Noor were among the officers who lost their commissions over the charges of indiscipline. In 1974, Major Syed Faruque Rahman, had become dissatisfied with Bangladesh Awami League government. He would often discuss his dissatisfaction with Major General Ziaur Rahman who was the Deputy Chief of Army Staff. Ziaur Rahman had suggested Faruque to \"do something\" about the situation in one such meeting.\n\nMajor Khandaker Abdur Rashid was able to communicate Commerce Minister Khandaker Moshtaque Ahmed about the situation in the country. Major Khandaker Rashid, Major Dalim, and Khandaker Moshtaque decided that they must repeal BAKSAL and remove Sheikh Mujib. Khandaker Rashid informed Major Faruque Rahman, who agreed with the plan, and he was also told that Major General Zia would support them.\n\nThe mutineers decided to be divided into teams, and each team were to be given specifics instructions and targets.\n\nThe operation at the residence of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was led by Major A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed. Major Bazlul Huda was placed in the team as he was the Adjutant to the First Field Artillery regiment, which was guarding the home of the President. The team also included Major S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury. Captain Abul Bashar who was incharge of the guards has served under Major Dalim.\n\nSome of the guards were killed defending the residence after the mutineers tried to force their way in the residence. Sheikh Kamal was injured defending the residence, he was executed by Captain Huda after the attackers had crossed into the compound. Sheikh Mujib asked \"what do you want?\" to the mutineers. It was Major Noor and Captain Huda who shot Sheikh Mujib as he was coming down the stairs. Sheikh Mujibs son Sheikh Jamal, Jamal's wife Rosy, Sheikh Kamal's wife Sultana Kamal, Sheikh Mujib's wife Sheikh Fazilatunnesa were taken to the bathroom on the first floor. They were shot there by Major Abdul Aziz Pasha and Risaldar Moslemuddin shot and killed all of them inside the bathroom. Major Faruque promoted Captain Huda to Major and Subedar Major Abdul Wahab Joardar to Lieutenant on the spot. Faruque had arrived and left on a tank. Colonel Jamil Uddin Ahmad, military secretary to the President, was killed on the way to Bangabondhu Residence after he was called by Sheikh Mujib.\n\nThe guards had surrendered after a brief firefight and were lined up outside the house. Major Noor shot Sheikh Nasser, the brother of Sheikh Mujib, in the reception area bathroom. Major Pasha ordered an Havilder to kill Sheikh Russel, who was crying for his mother. Witness reported soldiers looting the house. A dead policeman was seen at the entrance. Major Huda went to Sher Shah road at Mohammadpur to order 10 coffins from carpenters. Major Huda also removed the bodies the next day through an army escort.\n\nSheikh Fazlul Haque Mani was the nephew of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and viewed as a likely successor. He was killed in his home along with his wife, Begum Arzu Moni, who was believed to be pregnant at the time. His sons Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh and Sheikh Fazle Shams Parash survived. His home on Road 13/1 in Dhanmondi was surrounded by 20-25 army personnel on 15 August 1975.\n\nAbdur Rab Serniabat was a former Minister of Water and brother-in-law of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed in his home in Mintoo road, Dhaka on 5:00 am. His home was attacked by a team that was led Major Aziz Pasha, Captain Majed, Major Shahriar Rashid, and Captain Nurul Huda. Serniabat's nephew Shahid Serniabat, daughter Baby Serniabat, grandson Sukanto Abdullah Babu, and son Arif Serniabat were also killed in the attack. Three domestic servants were also killed in the attack. His son, Abul Hasnat Abdullah, survived the attack and 9 other people were injured in the household.\n\nArtillery under command of Fauque fired mortar shells towards Dhanmondi and Mohammadpur. In Mohammadpur, 14 people died from the mortar fire near Sher Shah Suri road.\n\nMajor Faruque attacked the Rakhi Bahini camp with 26 tanks under his command. The Rakhi Bahini surrendered without incident, Faruque moved towards the residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after the neutralization of the Rakhi Bahini was completed.\n\nThe main officer of Bangladesh Betar (radio) in Dhaka was attacked by the Mutineers early in the morning. They quickly disarmed the police stationed there and took control of the radio. Major Dalim and Maj Shahriar were in charge of the operation at the radio station. They controlled the flow of information from there.\n\nKhandaker Moshtaque addressed the nation from the Radio Station, his speech was written by Taheruddin Thakur, announced the formation of a new government led by him. Following him, the Chief of the army, his deputy, the Chief of Naval staff, the chief of the Air force, the police chief and Bangladesh Rifles pledged their allegiance to the new government. Khandaker Moshtaque General M. A. G. Osmani as his Defence Adviser. General Ziaur Rahman was made the Chief of Army Staff on 24 August 1975 and Khalilur Rahman was made the first Chief of Defence Staff of Bangladesh Army.\n\nOn 26 September 1975, Khandaker Moshtaque proclaimed the Indemnity Ordinance which protected those involved in the coup legal protection. The ordinance was rectified into an act by the 1979 Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which was founded by Major Ziaur Rahman. Bangladesh Parliament on 14 November 1996, controlled by Bangladesh Awami League, removed the indemnity Act, making way for trials to start. On 5 October 1975, the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini (Absorption in the Army) Ordinance was passed with strong support from Ziaur Rahman; which absorbed the Rakkhi Bahini into Bangladesh Army. On 3 November 1975, the situation had grown tense with some officers Bangladesh Army led by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf and Colonel Shafaat Jamil launched a coup to remove the mutineers and restore order to the Army. Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem was replace Khandaker Moshtaque as president and Mosharraf was made the Chief of Army Staff. The mutineers in the morning had killed former President Syed Nazrul Islam, former Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed and Ministers M Mansur Ali and AHM Qamruzzaman in Dhaka Central Jail where they were locked up since the mutiny on 15 August. Zia was placed under house arrest. On 4 November the Mutineers were provided safe passage to Bangkok. On 7 November 1975 Khaled Mosharraf was killed in coup that restored Ziaur Rahman to the Chief of Army Staff. The coup was led by the revolutionary soldier's organisation and Colonel Abu Taher. Taher himself was executed under the government formed by Major General Zia on 21 July 1976.\n\nIn 1976, the military regime of Bangladesh provided the coup plotters with diplomatic jobs. AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed was made the second secretary of the embassy in Algeria, AM Rashed Chowdhury was made the consulate general in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury was made the second secretary in the embassy in Tehran, Shariful Haque Dalim was made the first secretary to the embassy in Beijing, and Abdul Aziz Pasha was made the first secretary to the embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They held the positions till 1996 when the Bangladesh Awami League formed the government and recalled them to Bangladesh. They refused to comply and as a result were fired from their positions. in 2001, when the Bangladesh Nationalist Party returned to power, they cancelled the last order and reinstated the officers to their diplomatic positions.\n\nMajor Faruque, Major Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, and former state minister Taheruddin Thakur were arrested on 14 August 1996, the same year Bangladesh Awami League returned to power. AFM Mohitul Islam, personal assistant to President Sheikh Mujib, filled a case on 2 October 1996 against the mutineers with Dhanmondi Police Station. The Criminal Investigation Department starts investigating the case the next day. The CID pressed charges against 20 people on 15 January 1997.\n\nOn 12 March 1997, the trial starts with 6 accused in jail and 14 were outside the country. Zobaida Rashid, wife of Khandaker Abdur Rashid, was relieved of charges after she filled a number of appeals, reducing the accused to 19. Other cases filled with the High Court challenged the legality of the trial court and its location, the scarping of indemnity act, which delayed the trial. Major Huda was bought from Thailand in 1998, through the signing of an extradition treaty between Thailand and Bangladesh. Dhaka district Justice Kazi Golam Rasul, sentenced 15 accused to death on 8 November 1998. Appeals are filled with Bangladesh High Court. On 14 November 1998 the High Court delivers a split verdict with Justice Md Ruhul Amin upholding the death penalty of 10 of the convicts, Justice ABM Khairul Haque upheld the death penalty of all 15. The case was referred to a third Justice, Mohammad Fazlul Karim, who broke the tie by sentencing 12 of the accused to death.\n\nThen Chief Justice Ruhul Amin constituted an appeal court with 5 justices, who were Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha, Justice Md Abdul Aziz, Justice Md Tafazzul Islam, Justice BK Das, and Justice Md Muzammel Hossain. The verdict of the Appellate Division confirmed the death sentences of the 12 convicts on 19 November 2009. Three of whom sought presidential pardons but were refused. On 27 January 2010, Bangladesh Supreme Court refused the convicts application for review. On 28 January 2010, 5 of the convicts in custody were executed. The hanged were Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Syed Faruque Rahman, and Bazlul Huda.\n\nSince 1975, Bangladesh has been under different military governments, with democracy being restored in 1990. Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, the two daughters of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman survived as there were in Germany on August 1975. Sheikh Hasina is the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. She had been elected three times Prime Minister of Bangladesh, in 1996, 2009, and 2013.\n\n"}

It is apparently obsolete.\n\nIn Algerian Braille, the braille letters are assigned in numeric order to the Arabic alphabet; standard Arabic Braille on the other hand uses a completely different assignment, following international norms based on the order of the French alphabet. For example, the fifth braille letter, , is used in Algerian Braille for ج \"j\", the fifth letter of the Algerian/Arabic alphabet. In most braille alphabets today, is used for \"e\", the fifth letter of the French/Latin alphabet, or for a letter that sounds like \"e\", no matter where it occurs in those alphabets.\n\nAlgerian-type remapping was common in early braille adaptations, but was largely abandoned in favor of mutually understandable standards beginning with the unification French, English, German, and Egyptian Braille on the original French order in 1878.\n"}

Most Americans within the country tend to be based in the capital city of Doha and are largely attracted by the tax-free inducement of the Persian Gulf state. American expatriates run a number of community organisations, meetups and get-togethers.

{"id": "6347537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6347537", "title": "Anti-Armenian sentiment", "text": "Anti-Armenian sentiment\n\nAnti-Armenian sentiment, also known as anti-Armenianism and Armenophobia, is a diverse spectrum of negative feelings, dislikes, fears, aversion, derision and/or prejudice towards Armenians, Armenia, and Armenian culture. Modern anti-Armenianism is usually expressed by opposition to the actions or existence of Armenia, aggressive denial of the Armenian Genocide or belief in an Armenian conspiracy to fabricate history and manipulate public and political opinion for political gain.\n\nAlthough it was possible for Armenians to achieve status and wealth in the Ottoman Empire, as a community they were never accorded more than \"second-class citizen\" status and were regarded as fundamentally alien to the Muslim character of Ottoman society. In 1895, revolts among the Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire lead to Sultan Abdül Hamid's decision to massacre tens of thousands of Armenians in the Hamidian massacres.\n\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman government massacred between 1 and 1.5 million Armenians in the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish government has aggressively denied the Armenian Genocide. This position has been criticized in a letter from the International Association of Genocide Scholars to – then Turkish Prime Minister, now President – Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nCenk Saraçoğlu argues that anti-Armenian attitudes in Turkey \"are no longer constructed and shaped by social interactions between the 'ordinary people' [...] Rather, the Turkish media and state promote and disseminate an overtly anti-Armenian discourse.\" According to a 2011 survey in Turkey, 73.9% of respondents admitted having unfavorable views toward Armenians. The survey showed an unfavorable stance toward Armenians was \"relatively more widespread among those participants with lower levels of education and socioeconomic status.\" According to Minority Rights Group, while the government recognizes Armenians as a minority group, as used in Turkey this term denotes second-class status.\n\nThe Ankara Chamber of Commerce included a documentary, accusing the Armenian people of slaughtering Turks, with its paid tourism advertisements in the June 6, 2005 edition of the magazine \"Time\" Europe. The magazine later apologized for allowing the inclusion of the DVDs and published a critical letter signed by five French organizations. The February 12, 2007 edition of \"Time\" Europe included an acknowledgment of the truth of the Armenian Genocide and a DVD of a documentary by French director Laurence Jourdan about the genocide.\n\nHrant Dink, the editor of the weekly bilingual newspaper \"Agos\", was assassinated in Istanbul on January 19, 2007, by Ogün Samast. He was reportedly acting on the orders of Yasin Hayal, a militant Turkish ultra-nationalist. For his statements on Armenian identity and the Armenian Genocide, Dink had been prosecuted three times under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code for “insulting Turkishness.” (The law was later amended by the Turkish parliament, changing \"Turkishness\" to \"Turkish Nation\" and making it more difficult to prosecute individuals for the said offense.) Dink had also received numerous death threats from Turkish nationalists who viewed his \"iconoclastic\" journalism (particularly regarding the Armenian Genocide) as an act of treachery.\n\nİbrahim Şahin and 36 other alleged members of Turkish ultra-nationalist Ergenekon group were arrested in January, 2009 in Ankara. The Turkish police said the roundup was triggered by orders Şahin gave to assassinate 12 Armenian community leaders in Sivas. According to the official investigation in Turkey, Ergenekon also had a role in the murder of Hrant Dink.\n\nIn 2002, a monument was erected in memory of Turkish-Armenian composer Onno Tunç in Yalova, Turkey. The monument to the composer of Armenian origin was subjected to much vandalism over the course of the years, in which unidentified people had taken out the letters on the monument. In 2012 Yalova Municipal Assembly decided to remove the monument. Bilgin Koçal, the former mayor of Yalova, informed the public that the memorial had been destroyed by time and that it would shortly be replaced with a new one in the memory of Tunç. On the other hand, a similar memorial stays in place at the village of Selimiye, where an aircraft had crashed; and the people in the village of 187 expressed their protest about the vandalism claims regarding the memorial in Yalova, adding that they paid from their own funds to keep up the maintenance of the monument in their village against the wearing effect of natural causes.\n\nSevag Balikci, a Turkish soldier of Armenian descent, was shot dead on April 24, 2011, the day of the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide during his military service in Batman. It was later discovered that killer Kıvanç Ağaoğlu was an ultra-nationalist. Through his Facebook profile, it was uncovered that he was a sympathizer of nationalist politician Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and Turkish agent / contract killer Abdullah Çatlı, who himself had a history of anti-Armenian activity, such as the Armenian Genocide Memorial bombing in a Paris suburb in 1984. His Facebook profile also showed that he was a Great Union Party (BBP) sympathizer, a far-right nationalist party in Turkey. Testimony given by Sevag Balıkçı's fiancée stated that he was subjected to psychological pressure at the military compound. She was told by Sevag over the phone that he feared for his life because a certain military serviceman threatened him by saying, \"If war were to happen with Armenia, you would be the first person I would kill.\"\n\nOn February 26, 2012, on the anniversary of the Khojaly Massacre a demonstration took place in Istanbul which contained hate speech and threats towards Armenia and Armenians. Chants and slogans during the demonstration include: \"\"You are all Armenian, you are all bastards,\" \"bastards of Hrant\" [Dink] \"can not scare us,\" and \"Taksim Square today, Yerevan Tomorrow: We will descend upon you suddenly in the night.\"\"\n\nIn 2012 the ultra-nationalist ASIM-DER group (founded in 2002) had targeted Armenian schools, churches, foundations and individuals in Turkey as part of an anti-Armenian hate campaign.\nOn 23 February 2014, a group of protestors carrying a banner that said, \"Long live the Ogun Samasts! Down with Hrant Dink!\" went in front of an Armenian school in Istanbul and later walked in front of the main building of the Agos newspaper, the same location where Hrant Dink was assassinated in 2007.\n\nOn 5 August 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in a televised interview on NTV news network, remarked that being Armenian is \"uglier\" even than being Georgian, saying \"You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian...they have said even uglier things - they have called me Armenian, but I am Turkish.\"\n\nIn February 2015, graffiti was discovered near the wall of an Armenian church in the Kadikoy district of Istanbul saying, \"You’re Either Turkish or Bastards\" and \"You Are All Armenian, All Bastards.\" It is claimed that the graffiti was done by organizing members of a rally entitled \"Demonstrations Condemning the Khojali Genocide and Armenian Terror.\" The Human Rights Association of Turkey petitioned the local government of Istanbul calling it a \"Pretext to Incite Ethnic Hate Against Armenians in Turkey\". In the same month banners celebrating the Armenian Genocide were spotted in several cities throughout Turkey. They declared: \"We celebrate the 100th anniversary of our country being cleansed of Armenians. We are proud of our glorious ancestors.\"\n\nOn 20 February 2015, the Mayor of Bayburt Mete Memis called the deeds of Turkish soldiers who massacred Armenians a hundred years ago \"heroism.\" He made a congratulatory statement on the 97th anniversary of Bayburt’s sacking, in which its Armenian resident were massacred and exiled as part of the Armenian Genocide, claiming that 97 years ago, the Turkish soldiers in Bayburt had \"written their name in history for defending the homeland.\"\n\nIn March 2015, the mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek, filed a formal complaint on defamation charges against journalist Hayko Bağdat because he called him an Armenian. The complaint petitioned that the statements by the journalist are \"false and include insult and libel.\" Gökçek also demanded 10,000 liras in compensation under a civil lawsuit against Bağdat for psychological damages, and the lawsuit is now pending.\n\nDuring the official state funeral of Turkish serviceman Olgun Karakoyunlu, a man exclaimed: \"The PKK are all Armenians, but are hiding. I am Kurdish and a Muslim, but I am not an Armenian. The end of Armenians is near. God willingly, we will bring an end to them. Oh Armenians, whatever you do it is in vain, we know you well. Whatever you do will be in vain.\" Similarly, in 2007, a state-appointed imam, presiding over a funeral of a Turkish soldier killed by the PKK, said that the death was due to \"Armenian bastards.\"\n\nIn September 2015, during the Turkey–PKK conflict, a video was released which captured police in Cizre announcing on a loudspeaker to the local Kurdish population that they were \"Armenian bastards.\" A few days later, in another instance, the Cizre police made repeated announcements on loudspeaker saying \"You are all Armenians.\"\n\nOn 9 September 2015, a crowd of Turkish youth rallying in Armenian populated districts of Istanbul chanted \"We must turn these districts into Armenian and Kurdish cemeteries.\"\n\nIn September 2015, a 'Welcome' sign was installed in Iğdır and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian. The Armenian portion of the sign was protested by ASIMDER who demanded its removal. In October 2015, the Armenian writing on the 'Welcome' sign was heavily vandalized. The Armenian portion of the sign was ultimately removed in June 2016.\n\nIn April 2016, Barbaros Leylani, the head of the Turkish Worker's Union in Sweden, referred to Armenians as \"dogs\" in a public speech in Stockholm, and added: \"Turks awaken! Armenian scums must be finished, die Armenian scums, die, die!\" (external link of speech (in Turkish)) Juridikfronten, a Swedish watchdog organization, filed a report to the police due to an \"incitement to racial hatred\". Thereafter, Leylani resigned from his post.\n\nAnti-Armenianism exists in Azerbaijan on institutional and social levels. Armenians are \"the most vulnerable group in Azerbaijan in the field of racism and racial discrimination.\"\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Armenians and Muslim inhabitants of the Caucasus (Azerbaijanis were called Caucasian or Azerbaijani Tatars before 1918) had been involved in numerous conflicts, including \"pogroms\", massacres and wars. The two ethnic groups intensified \"mutual distrust\" and the clashes throughout the 20th century \"have been significant factors in the shaping of the national self-consciousness of the two peoples.\" From 1918 to 1920 organized killings of Armenians occurred in Azerbaijan, including in the cities of Baku and Shusha, the centers of Armenian cultural life under the Russian Empire.\n\nHowever, the current xenophobia in Azerbaijan toward Armenia and Armenians have shaped mostly during the last years of the Soviet Union, when Armenians demanded the Moscow authorities to incorporate the mostly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast with the Armenian SSR. In response to Armenian claims, the Azerbaijani nationalists, most prominently the Azerbaijani Popular Front, organized pogroms of Armenians in Sumgait, Kirovabad and Baku. An estimated of 350,000 Armenians left \"in two waves in 1988 and in 1990 after anti-Armenian violence.\"\n\nThe tensions eventually escalated into a large-scale military conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian forces took control of most of former NKAO and seven adjacent districts outside of NKAO area. A cease-fire was reached in 1994 and is still in effect as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is \"de facto\" independent, while \"de jure\" inside the Azerbaijani borders.\n\nSince then the Armenian side accuses the Azerbaijani government for carrying out anti-Armenian policy inside and outside the country, which includes propaganda of hate toward Armenia and Armenians and destruction of cultural heritage. In 2011, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance report on Azerbaijan stated that \"the constant negative official and media discourse concerning the Republic of Armenia helps to sustain a negative climate of opinion regarding people of Armenian origin, who remain vulnerable to discrimination.\"\n\nA 19th-century Russian explorer, Vasili Lvovich Velichko, who was active during the period when the Russian tzarism carried out a purposeful anti-Armenian policy, wrote \"Armenians are the extreme instance of brachycephaly; their actual racial instinct make them naturally hostile to the State.\"\n\nAccording to a 2012 VTSIOM opinion research, 6% of respondents in Moscow and 3% in Saint Petersburg were \"experiencing feelings of irritation, hostility\" toward Armenians. In the 2000s there have been racist murders of Armenians in Russia.\n\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century anti-Armenian sentiment was prevalent in both socialist and nationalist Georgian circles. The economic dominance of Armenians in Tbilisi fueled verbal attacks on Armenians. \"Droeba\", an influential journal, described Armenians as people who \"strip our streets and fatten their pockets\" and \"but the last piece of property from our indebted peasant families.\" Both Ilia Chavchavadze and Akaki Tsereteli, two major literary figures, attacked Armenians for their perceived mercantilism. Tsereteli portrayed Armenians as a flea sucking Georgian blood in one fable. Chavchavadze denounced Armenians for \"eating the bread baked by someone else or drinking that which is creating by another's sweat.\" Chavchavadze's newspaper, \"Iveria\", depicted Armenians as \"sly moneylenders and unscrupulous traders,\" according to Stephen F. Jones. The Social Democratic Party of Georgia (Georgian Mensheviks) attacked the bourgeoisie and imperialism to liberate Georgia from both Russian imperialism and perceived Armenian economic exploitation. During the existence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–21), the independent Georgian government saw Armenians as a potential \"fifth column\" for their supposed loyalty to the First Republic of Armenia and subject to manipulation by foreign powers. The Georgian–Armenian War of December 1918 increased anti-Armenian sentiments in Georgia. In post-Soviet Georgia, first president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an outspoken nationalist, viewed Armenians, along with other ethnic minorities, as \"guests\" or \"aliens\" who threaten Georgia's territorial integrity.\n\nAround the time of the March 4 parliamentary elections in the breakaway region of Abkhazia in 2007, the Georgian media emphasised the factor of ethnic Armenians in the area. The Georgian newspaper \"Sakartvelos Respublika\" predicted that much of the parliament would be Armenian and that there was even a chance of an Armenian president being elected. The paper also reported that the Abkazanian republic might already be receiving financial assistance from Armenians living in the United States.\nSome Armenian analysts believe such reports are attempting to create conflict between Armenians and ethnic Abkhazians to destabilize the region.\n\nA policy of desecration of Armenian churches and historical monuments on the territory of Georgia has actively been pursued. On November 16, 2008, Georgian monk Tariel Sikinchelashvili vandalised the graves of patrons of art Mikhail and Lidia Tamamshev. The Armenian Church of Norashen in Tbilisi, built in the middle of the 15th century, has been desecrated and misappropriated by the Georgian government despite the fact that both Armenia's and Georgia's Prime-Ministers have reached an agreement on not to maltreat the church. Due to no law on religion, the status of Surb Norashen, Surb Nshan, Shamhoretsor Surb Astvatsatsin (Karmir Avetaran), Yerevanots Surb Minas and Mugni Surb Gevorg in Tbilisi and Surb Nshan in Akhaltsikhe is unknown since being confiscated during the Soviet era. Since independence in 1991, Georgian clergy have occupied the Armenian churches. Armenians in Georgia and Armenia have demonstrated against the destruction. On November 28, 2008, Armenian demonstrators in front of the Georgian embassy in Armenia demanded that the Georgian government immediately cease encroachments on the Armenian churches and punish those guilty, calling the Georgian party's actions \"white genocide.\"\n\nIn August, 2011, Georgia's Culture Minister Nika Rurua sacked director Robert Sturua as head of the Tbilisi national theatre for \"xenophobic\" comments he made earlier this year, officials reported. \"We are not going to finance xenophobia. Georgia is a multicultural country,\" Rurua said. Provoking public outrage, Sturua said in an interview with local news agency that \"Saakashvili doesn't know what Georgian people need because he is Armenian.\" \"I do not want Georgia to be governed by a representative of a different ethnicity,\" he added.\n\nIn July 2014, the Armenian Ejmiatsin Church in Tbilisi was attacked. The Armenian diocese said it was \"a crime committed on ethnic and religious grounds.\"\n\nIn 2018 the Tandoyants Armenian church in Tbilisi was gifted to the Georgian Orthodox Patriarchate. The Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Orthodox Church in Georgia stated that the church was “illegally transferred” to the Georgian Patriarchate. According to the Human Rights Education and Monitoring Center, Tandoyants is not the only historic Armenian church the Georgian Patriarchate has targeted. There are at least six others the Patriarchate has its sights set on.\n\nThere has been historic prejudice against Armenians in the United States throughout various times, at least beginning from the early 1900s.\n\nIn early 1900s Armenians were among the group of minorities who were barred from loaning money, land, and equipment particularly because of their race. They were referred to as \"lower class Jews\". Moreover, among other minorities Armenians lived on one side of Van Ness Blvd. while the residents of white origin lived on the other side. A deed from one home stated, \"Neither said premises nor any part thereof shall be used in any matter whatsoever or occupied by any Negro, Chinese, Japanese, Hindu, Armenian, Asiatic or native of the Turkish Empire.\"\n\nIn Anny Bakalian's book \"Armenian-Americans: From Being to Feeling Armenian\", various groups of Armenians were polled for discrimination based on their identity. Roughly 77% of US-born Armenians felt they were discriminated in getting a job while 80% responded positively to a question whether they felt discriminated in getting admitted to a school.\n\nAmerican historian Justin McCarthy is known for his controversial view that no genocide was intended by the Ottoman Empire but that both Armenians and Turks died as the result of civil war. Some attribute his denial of the Armenian Genocide to anti-Armenianism, as he holds an honorary doctorate of the Turkish Boğaziçi University and he is also a board member of the Institute of Turkish Studies.\n\nOn April 24, 1998 during a campus exhibit organized by the Armenian Students' Association at UC Berkeley, Hamid Algar, a Professor of Islamic & Persian Studies, reportedly approached a group of organizers and shouted, “It was not a genocide but I wish it was—you lying pigs!” The students also claimed that Algar also spit at them. Following the incident members of the Armenian Students' Association filed a report with campus police calling for an investigation. After a five-month investigation the Chancellor's office issued an apology, though no hate charges were filed as incident did not create a \"hostile environment.\" On March 10, 1999 the Associated Students of University of California (ASUC) passed a resolution titled, \"A Bill Against Hate Speech and in Support of Reprimand for Prof. Algar,\" condemning the incident and calling for Chancellor to review the University decision not to file charges.\n\nIn April 2007, the \"Los Angeles Times\" Managing Editor Douglas Frantz blocked a story on the Armenian Genocide written by Mark Arax, allegedly citing the fact Arax was of Armenian descent and therefore had a biased opinion on the subject. Arax, who has published similar articles before, has lodged a discrimination complaint and threatened a federal lawsuit. Frantz, who did not cite any specific factual errors in the article, is accused of having a bias obtained while being stationed in Istanbul, Turkey. Harut Sassounian, an Armenian community leader, accused Frantz of having expressed support for denial of the Armenian Genocide and has stated he personally believed that Armenians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, an argument commonly used to justify the killings. Frantz resigned from the paper not long afterward, possibly due to the mounting requests for his dismissal from the Armenian community.\n\nIn March 2012 three of five Glendale Police Department's officers of Armenian origin filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Glendale Police Department claiming racial discrimination.\n\nIn 2012 surgeon's assistant Ani Chopourian, a graduate of UCLA and Yale, was awarded $168 million in punitive damages for racial and gender discrimination by her co-workers.\n\nAnother incident that received less coverage was a series of hate mail campaigns directed at Paul Krekorian, a city council candidate for Californian Democratic Primary, making racist remarks and accusations that the Armenian community was engaging in voter fraud.\n\nOn April 21, 2016 students at Clark Magnet High School, which currently has 60% Armenian student body, wrote an open letter accusing the school administrators of cultural insensitivity. In the letter students explained that as a day of remembrance students wore black T-shirts. Because of Clark's collar dress code policy school staff browsed through classrooms and gave detention slips to students who wore black T-shirts. They also accused one of the teachers of shaming their actions, who \"according to more than fifty Clarkies, one of the faculty members called the students' patriotic actions a \"disgrace to America\" and stated that she considers them to be \"disrespectful to other Americans.\"\n\nIn the 4th episode of Season 3 of the CBS sitcom \"2 Broke Girls\" (aired on October 14, 2013) \"when a new cappuccino maker is brought into the cupcake store by a co-worker, he says he bought it for a cheap price from a person who stole it but sells it at a profit, adding 'it's the Armenian way.' When the character is pressed that he is not Armenian, he says 'I know. But, it's the Armenian way.'\" This scene was characterized as \"racist\" by \"Asbarez\" Editor Ara Khachatourian, who criticized CBS for promotion of racial stereotypes in their shows.\n\nIn the January 9, 2018 episode of the Comedy Central late-night program \"The Daily Show\" Trevor Noah stated: \"This is, like, really funny. Only Donald Trump could defend himself and, in the same sentence, completely undermine his whole point. It would be like someone saying, ‘I’m the most tolerant guy out there, just ask this filthy Armenian.'\" Armenian American organizations criticized Noah for alleged racism against Armenians. In a joint press release the Armenian Bar Association and the Armenian Rights Watch Committee (ARWC) compared \"Filthy Armenians\" to racial epithets as \"Dirty Jew\" and \"Lazy Nigger\", which although \"may have been intended to coax a laugh from the audience by ridiculing President Trump's self-proclaimed genius and tolerance,\" constitutes \"affront and slander.\" The organizations called for \"The Daily Show\" and Trevor Noah to issue a retraction and an apology. The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) also called for an apology.\n\n\"The Jerusalem Post\" reported in 2009 that out of all Christians in Jerusalem's Old City Armenians were most often spat on by Haredi and Orthodox Jews. In 2011 several instances of spitting and verbal attacks on Armenian clergymen by Haredi Jews were reported in the Old City. In a 2013 interview Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem Nourhan Manougian stated that Armenians in Israel are treated as \"third-class citizens.\"\n\nPakistan is the only United Nations member state that has not recognized the Republic of Armenia, citing its support to Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n\nIn early 1990, 39 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan were settled in Tajikistan. False rumors spread that allegedly up to 5,000 Armenians were being resettled in new housing in Dushanbe experiencing acute housing shortage at that time. This led to riots which targeted both the Communist government and Armenians. The Soviet Ministry of Interior (MVD) suppressed the demonstrations, during which more than 20 people were killed and over 500 were injured.\n\nIn 2009, an ethnic conflict broke out in the city of Marhanets following the murder of a Ukrainian man by an Armenian. A fight between Ukrainians and Armenians started in the \"Scorpion\" café, and later turned into riots and pogroms against Armenians, accompanied by the burning of houses and cars, which led to exodus of Armenians from the city.\n\nUyghur separatist leader Isa Alptekin spouted anti-Armenian rhetoric while he was in Turkey and claimed that innocent Turkish Muslims were massacred by Armenians.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16742933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16742933", "title": "Consumer revolution", "text": "Consumer revolution\n\nThe term Consumer revolution refers to the period from approximately 1600 to 1750 in England in which there was a marked increase in the consumption and variety of \"luxury\" goods and products by individuals from different economic and social backgrounds. The consumer revolution marked a departure from the traditional mode of life that was dominated by frugality and scarcity to one of increasingly mass consumption in society.\n\nConsumerism has weak links with the Western world, but is in fact an international phenomenon. People purchasing goods and consuming materials in excess of their basic needs is as old as the first civilizations (e.g. Ancient Egypt, Babylon and Ancient Rome).\nThe consumer society emerged in the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century. Change was propelled by the growing middle-class who embraced new ideas about luxury consumption and the growing importance of fashion as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity. This revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed to cater for comfort and the increased availability of luxury goods aimed at a growing market. This included sugar, tobacco, tea and coffee; these were increasingly grown on vast slave plantations in Caribbean colonies as demand steadily rose. In particular, sugar consumption in Britain during the course of the 18th century increased by a factor of 20. Moreover, the expansion of trade and markets also contributed to the burgeoning consumer revolution, by increasing the variety of goods that could be made available to affluent society.\n\nThis pattern was particularly visible in London where the gentry and prosperous merchants took up residence and created a culture of luxury and consumption that was slowly extended across the socio-economic divide. Marketplaces expanded as shopping centres, such as the New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield.\n\nThere was growth in industries like glass making and silk manufacturing, and much pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of Bernard Mandeville's influential work \"The Fable of the Bees\" in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.\nThese trends were vastly accelerated in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as status symbols, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility.\n\nThe pottery inventor and entrepreneur, Josiah Wedgwood, noticed the way aristocratic fashions, themselves subject to periodic changes in direction, slowly filtered down through society. He pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes and preferences to cause his goods to be accepted among the aristocracy; it was only a matter of time before his goods were being rapidly bought up by the middle classes as well. His example was followed by other producers of a wide range of products and the spread and importance of consumption fashions became steadily more important.\n\nPopular culture drew aesthetic techniques, design, and technology from the goods England gathered from trade in Asia and the Mediterranean. With the increased demand for Asian ceramics, European markets had difficulty supplying buyers so inventors started imitating Chinese porcelain. Porcelain remained popular for tableware and pottery, but the style, shape and decoration of the porcelain changed to fit more Western tastes, painting flowers and English scenes rather than Chinese ones.\n\nImitation goods were also used to disguise social class. Middle-class consumers could not afford the same exotic luxury goods brought back from overseas trade that the elite class used to distinguish their elevated rank. Markets and shops whose target buyers were middle-class consumers began creating \"semi-luxury\" goods that imitated actual luxury goods. These goods were part of a movement to create a \"counterfeit culture\" that gave middle-class consumers an opportunity to emulate the wealth and luxurious life that the elite class lived without paying as much. Household decorations, kitchenware, clothes, and transportation vehicles were all objects that could be used to crossover into \"polite society.\"\n\nEngland was concerned with the quantity products exported out of England in comparison to the countries they traded with. England did not want to be overcome economically by countries in Asia because they did not export as much so merchants, artisans, and shopkeepers started creating their own goods to compete with the Asian market.To avoid entirely copying Asian goods, English inventors imitated goods from other countries that also traded with Asia such as France, Holland, Switzerland, and Spain. The goal was not to mimic the exact product, but instead use the techniques that proved successful in other European imitations to create a superior product. \n\nImitation and semi-luxury goods were also popular because they showed the modernization of English production and manufacturing processes. Large-scale production required standardization, advanced mechanical replication, and an organized system of assembly. Substitutes for the indigenous materials used to create the original products were seen as a show of enlightened and advanced thinking. The imitation and innovation of semi-luxury goods was a testament to the potential the English had to impact the global economy, to be France, China and India in national exports.\n\n\nFairchilds, Cissie. “Review: Consumption in Early Modern Europe.

{"id": "16711149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16711149", "title": "Domestic violence in Chile", "text": "Domestic violence in Chile\n\nViolence against women is prevalent across all classes of Chilean society. As of the early 1990s, it was reported that domestic violence affects about fifty percent of the women in Chile. All socioeconomic classes are affected by domestic violence, with some groups having higher rates of domestic violence than others. Consistent with these findings, a 2003 Chilean national survey indicated that 25–30% of female homicides occur at home. \n\nA 2004 Chilean National Women's Service (SERNAM) study reported that 50 percent of married women had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse (2007). Between January and November 2005, 76,000 cases of family violence were reported to the police; 67,913 were reported by women, 6,404 by men, and approximately 1,000 by children. Women are clearly the most likely to become victims of domestic violence, but other members of the household are also at risk for victimization.\n\nDomestic violence can be physical, psychological, emotional, verbal, or sexual. Men or women may be the offender, but research indicates that women suffer disproportionately from abuse by their male partners. Throughout history, women have been viewed by society as subordinate to men, leaving them susceptible to abuse by their male partners. Additionally, the home has been viewed as an essentially private institution, impeding lawmakers from moving forward with policies against domestic violence. With many choosing to look the other way when they learn of domestic violence, this problem persists and can be difficult to address. It is a common idea that outsiders, specifically lawmakers, should not interfere with such private matters as violence in the home. Growth of the women's movement in Chile, as elsewhere, has helped raise awareness and created concern at an international level.\n\nAmong the contributing factors to domestic violence are household factors, community and societal factors, and individual factors. Household factors include size, density and violence history. Community and societal factors include media violence, poverty level, crime rate, and environmental conditions. Lastly, individual factors are educational level, gender, age, and employment status. A 1999 study conducted by psychologists found that violence is a learned behavior and is passed down through generations. Exposure to violence in early childhood increases the risk for an individual to become violent in their own home.\n\nIn 2004, 44% of the Chilean population was living in poverty, and studies have shown that low socioeconomic status and stressful life events are positively correlated with domestic violence. Additionally, a 2003 study found that poverty, and escalation of negative life events that typically accompany poverty, increase Chilean women’s vulnerability to domestic abuse. So, while domestic violence occurs in all classes, it is more prevalent among poor households. In Chile, it has been found that families who experience domestic violence are usually isolated and lack supportive ties among the communities in which they live.\n\nThe geographic concentration of poverty in Chile, with regard to the socioeconomic opportunities and risk behaviors of marginalized families living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, has been linked to higher rates of domestic violence. In other parts of the world, there is some recent evidence to support reduced violence in cases where women own assets. Owning land or a house signifies a woman's option to exit a violent relationship and deters marital violence. In Chile, married women and men have equal rights to their assets upon divorce or if a spouse dies.\n\nIn rural Chile, inheritance is the principle way in which land is acquired by both men and women, whether the land has titles or not. Sometimes women cannot claim their inheritance to land without titles because the cost of legal documents is too high. The same effects on domestic violence have not been seen by female employment alone, since owning a home or land offers an immediate escape option. Land ownership can be empowering for women, a factor that, on its own, has been shown to reduce domestic violence. As these factors intersect, the risk for women is compounded and they become more susceptible to domestic violence.\n\nUntil 1989, the Civil Code of Chile legally sanctioned husbands’ ownership and authority over their wives, giving men power over their female partners and leading to abuse within the home. This power dynamic created by cultural beliefs can be seen around the world and is not isolated to Chile. The belief that Chilean women are more tolerant of male violence than other women has hindered policymakers from moving forward against domestic violence. This belief leaves Chilean women unprotected and trapped within abusive homes. Because events occurring in the home have been viewed as private family matters, historically, domestic violence has been socially and culturally accepted in Chilean society. \n\nThe secrecy that has protected these offenders is exemplified by research results from 2004 that reported that 30% of women from the Region de la Metropolitana and 21% of women from the Region de la Araucania had not told anyone about their experiences with domestic abuse. The combination of these beliefs has allowed Chilean society to turn a blind eye to the domestic violence problem that plagues their communities. These myths are slowly coming to light as attitudes change and a movement against domestic violence has begun among Chilean women.\n\nDomestic violence impacts the Chilean economy directly and indirectly. Chile has low levels of female labor force participation. A 2011 study found that while about 75% of U.S. women are engaged in paid employment, 43% of women in Chile are engaged in paid employment. More sick days are taken by battered partners, decreased household productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Increased healthcare costs are attributed to emergency room visits, mental health services, medication, and physical therapy (2011) . Criminal justice and social services costs increase with high rates of domestic violence, but studies have found that programs aimed at intervening in or preventing domestic violence are highly cost-effective.\n\nThe economy of Chile is impacted by domestic violence in several ways. These costs include increased expenditures on medical treatment, police services, criminal justice system, and social services. Injury from abuse leads to more emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. More time is spent by law enforcement responding to domestic violence calls, and criminal justice system costs are increased due to domestic violence court cases, which can lead, in turn, to prison costs.\n\nWith increased domestic violence rates, earnings are lower, productivity at work decreases, and labor market participation declines. A 1999 study conducted in Santiago, Chile, found that abused women were less likely to work outside the home. Another study based in Santiago, conducted in 2000, estimated that women who did not suffer physical violence earned an average of US$385 per month while women who faced physical violence at home earned only US$150 per month. This study displays the severe economic effects of domestic violence in the home.\n\nThe Chilean legal system has traditionally been very weak on family violence, due to structural problems, resulting from the failure to label domestic violence as a crime and the failure to prosecute domestic violence under general assault statutes. A study conducted in 1990 in Chile showed that 83.3% of battered women’s injuries were classified as ‘light injuries’ and were only punishable as a misdemeanor. Acts of violence that would otherwise be severe crimes under the law, when occurring within the home were passed as ‘light injuries’ and minimal punishment was pursued. \n\nThe Chilean National Ministry for Women (SERNAM, Servicio Nacional de la Mujer) addresses the Chilean legal systems’ treatment of domestic violence cases. SERNAM is responsible for developing preventative and remedial programs. They have opened offices across the country, providing legal and therapeutic assistance for victims of domestic violence.\n\nIn 1997 SERNAM issued a detailed set of policy proposals to assure rural women equality of opportunity, a product of consultative process.\n\nMichelle Bachelet was the first female president of Chile, leading the country between 2006 and 2010. During her presidency, Bachelet increased the budget of the National Women's Service (SERNAM) and helped the institution gain funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women. At the end of 2006, there were 29 government and private centers to attend to victims of intrafamily violence. During 2006, the SERNAM partnered with NGOs to conduct courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence for police officers and judicial and municipal authorities. This intensive training program by SERNAM has increasingly allowed many Chilean police to provide effective assistance in domestic violence cases. SERNAM has been active in advancing the domestic violence legislation (see below).\n\nThe Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address violence in the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005.\n\nAnother barrier is posed by the Chilean medical personnel, which has been criticized for continuing to mistreat victims of domestic violence and to minimize injuries, even though today they are required by law to report known cases of physical assault to the criminal justice system.\n\n"}

{"id": "3341044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3341044", "title": "Eagle warrior", "text": "Eagle warrior\n\nEagle warriors or eagle knights (Classical Nahuatl: \"cuāuhtli\" (singular) or \"cuāuhmeh\" (plural)) were a special class of infantry soldier in the Aztec army, one of the two leading military special forces orders in Aztec society. They were a type of Aztec warrior called a \"cuāuhocēlōtl\" . The word \"cuāuhocēlōtl\" derives from the eagle warrior \"cuāuhtli\" and the jaguar warrior \"ocēlōtl\" . These military orders were made up of the bravest soldiers of noble birth and those who had taken the greatest number of prisoners in battle. Of all of the Aztec warriors, they were the most feared. Eagle warriors, along with the jaguar warriors, were the only such classes which did not restrict access solely to the nobility, as commoners or, in Nahuatl, \"mācēhualli\" were occasionally admitted for special merit. The eagles were soldiers of the Sun, for the eagle was the symbol of the Sun. Eagle warriors dressed like eagles, adorning themselves with eagle feathers, and wearing headgear with an eagle head on it.\n\nThe life of Aztec warriors was one of constant battle, as the primary purpose for this continual warfare was to take prisoners to be sacrificed to their gods. As the Aztec Empire expanded, however, the expansion of the empire in size and power became increasingly important.\n\nIn current culture, the eagle warrior is a representation of the Aztec culture, and therefore the Mexican tradition. Some companies use the eagle warrior as a symbol that denotes strength, aggressiveness, competitiveness, and remembrance of the ancient cultures of Mexico. AeroMexico's logo, for instance, shows a \"cuāuhtli\".\n\nAll Aztec boys, both free commoners and nobility, learned about weaponry and warfare as part of their basic education. Until the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but was supervised by the authorities of their \"calpulli\". Periodically, they attended their local temples, which tested their progress. However, only the best students could progress to become eagle warriors, as they are considered as one of the nobility in Aztec society. The empire was split in pieces: kings (thought to be gods), nobles, generals, priests, peasants, and finally slaves. Pre-Columbian Aztec society was a highly complex and stratified society that developed among the Aztecs of central Mexico in the centuries prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico, and which was built on the cultural foundations of the larger region of Mesoamerica. Politically, the society was based around the independent city-state, called an \"altepetl\", composed of smaller divisions (\"calpulli\"), which were again usually composed of one or more extended kinship groups. Socially, the society depended on a rather strict division between nobles and free commoners, both of which were themselves divided into elaborate hierarchies of social status, responsibilities, and power. Economically the society was dependent on agriculture, and also to a large extent on warfare. Other economically important factors were commerce, long distance and local, and a high degree of trade specialisation.\n\nAt the age of 17, young Aztec men became warriors and entered formal military training. The recruits were expected to be brave and noble. Those who were of noble lineage also received training in religion, politics, or history by the priests. To achieve adult status, a young man had to capture his first prisoner.\n\nAztec warriors could move up in ranking by capturing enemies. After having done 20 or more great deeds (such as capturing foes to be used as sacrifices), they were eligible to become either a jaguar or eagle warrior.\n\nThe warriors used a number of weapons, including an \"atlatl\", spears and daggers. The Aztec blades (macuahuitl) were made by setting obsidian within wood. Firestones were flung at enemies using slings made of wool. Most Aztec weapons were intended to stun and capture opponents rather than to kill them.\n\nThe uniforms of eagle warriors signified both courage on the battlefield and physical strength. The Aztecs wore a lightweight close-fitting breastplate which suited the Mesoamerican climate. Their shields were brightly coloured and decorated with feathers. A warrior's legs would be covered with leather strips, an archaic version of greaves or shin guards. As headgear, eagle warriors wore the heads of eagles, including an open beak, and used eagle feathers as adornments.\n\nTheir slings were likely made from maguey fiber, either a type of ixtle from one of the agave type maguey plants such as henequen (\"Agave fourdes\").\n\nEagle and jaguar warriors were two of the only types of warriors who were recognised as having a full-time professional capacity. Thanks to their elite training and education, they were leaders and commanders both on and off the battlefield. On reaching this rank they were peers of nobles and other elite members of Aztec society, therefore the warrior's path was a way to raise one's social status in Aztec culture guaranteeing many of the same privileges as nobles. The graduate warrior was allowed to drink \"pulque\", keep concubines, and dine at the royal palace. At a civic level, They would also become full-time warriors working for the city-state to protect merchants and policing the city itself. Accordingly, they were the civil or police force of Aztec society. As well, Jaguar warriors would also be used in gladiatorial sacrifices. Due to these corps, the Aztecs were able to defeat the Spanish in La Noche Triste.\n\nThe Eagle Warrior Temple is located in Malinalco. The temple sits upon a hill and is completely carved out of bedrock. The temple is a circular structure with an entrance containing 13 steps, and includes two jaguar sculptures. The entrance to the temple was a carved open mouth of an Aztec earth monster.\n\nThe temple has a long extended bench that covers half of its inner chamber. There are carved sculptures on the bench of eagles and a jaguar. In the center of the inner chamber there is a giant carved eagle on the floor. Some believe the centre eagle would be used as an altar or throne. Surrounding buildings around Malinalco contained several murals depicting the life of a warrior. In additions there were murals of dancing eagles and jaguars within structures in Malinalco.\n\n\n"}

It is the traditional rural chicken of the area, a rustic dual-purpose breed of Atlantic type, and differs from Mediterranean Spanish breeds such as the Castellana Negra and the Minorca in several respects: it has yellow legs and feet, red earlobes, and lays brown eggs.\n\nThe Euskal Oiloa is the traditional chicken of the Basque rural economy. It was distributed throughout the historical territories of Araba, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, and gave both meat and brown eggs. In the twentieth century it was at first not threatened by imported commercial hybrid layer chickens and the spread of highly intensive chicken farming methods, as breeds such as the Leghorn laid white eggs, while Basque consumers preferred brown. Later, when brown-egg commercial hybrids appeared, they began to displace the traditional breed in many households.\n\nSelective breeding of the Euskal Oiloa was begun in 1975 as part of the conservation programme for indigenous chicken breeds of the Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria, the national public agrarian research institute. The decision to seek official breed status for these birds was taken at that time. A breed association, the Asociación de Criadores de Razas Aviares Vascas or EOALAK, was founded in 2006.\n\nThe breed standard of the Euskal Oiloa was officially approved on 15 March 2001. It is included in the official list of indigenous Spanish breeds in the royal decree of 26 December 2008, which established the national livestock breed conservation programme, where it is listed among the indigenous breeds at risk of extinction. At the end of 2013 a population of 10,872 birds was reported, all from the País Vasco.\n\nThe Euskal Oiloa is a medium-heavy breed: cocks weigh about , hens about . The comb is single, with five to seven well-defined points. The comb, face, wattles and earlobes are red; the earlobes are narrow and pointed. The beak is curved in the cock, less so in the hen. The legs, feet and skin are yellow.\n\nFive colour varieties are recognized: Beltza (black), Gorria (red), Lepasoila (naked-necked, red-brown), Marraduna (golden cuckoo) and Zilarra (black-tailed white). The Lepasoila, like other naked-necked chickens, has red skin on the neck.\n\nEuskal Oiloa hens lay 209–220 brown eggs weighing about per year. Much of the meat production is in the form of capons; chemical castration is not used. In 2008 the Euskal Oiloa was added to the Slow Food Ark of Taste.\n"}

{"id": "424402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424402", "title": "Free-market environmentalism", "text": "Free-market environmentalism\n\nFree-market environmentalism argues that the free market, property rights, and tort law provide the best means of preserving the environment, internalizing pollution costs, and conserving resources.\n\nFree-market environmentalists therefore argue that the best way to protect the environment is to clarify and protect property rights. This allows parties to negotiate improvements in environmental quality. It also allows them to use torts to stop environmental harm. If affected parties can compel polluters to compensate them they will reduce or eliminate the externality. Market proponents advocate changes to the legal system that empower affected parties to obtain such compensation. They further claim that governments have limited affected parties' ability to do so by complicating the tort system to benefit producers over others.\n\nWhile environmental problems may be viewed as market failures, free market environmentalists argue that environmental problems arise because:\n\n\nThough many environmentalists blame markets for many of today's environmental problems, free-market environmentalists blame many of these problems on distortions of the market and the lack of markets. Government actions are blamed for a number of environmental detriments. \n\nMarkets are not perfect, and free-market environmentalists assert that market-based solutions will have their mistakes. Through strong feedback mechanisms such as risk, profit and loss, market-driven have strong incentives to learn from mistakes.\n\n\nThe market is a non-political allocation device. Many environmentalists proposals call to return resources from markets to become political problems.\n\nSome economists argue that, if industries internalized the costs of negative externalities, they would face an incentive to reduce them, perhaps even becoming enthusiastic about taking advantage of opportunities to improve profitability through lower costs. Moreover, economists claim this would lead to the optimal balance between the marginal benefits of pursuing an activity and the marginal cost of its environmental consequences. One well-known means of internalizing a negative consequence is to establish a property right over some phenomenon formerly in the public domain.\n\nThe Coase theorem is one extreme version of this logic. If property rights are well defined and if there are no transaction costs, then market participants can negotiate to a solution that internalizes the externality. Moreover, this solution will not depend on who is allocated the property right. For example, a paper mill and a resort might be on the same lake. Suppose the benefits to the resort of a clean lake outweigh the benefits to the mill of being able to pollute. If the mill has the right to pollute, the resort will pay it not to. If the resort has the right to a pollution-free lake, it will keep that right, as the mill will be unable to compensate it for its pollution. However, critics have charged that the \"theorem\" attributed to Coase is of extremely limited practicability because of its assumptions, including no transaction costs, and is ill-suited to real world externalities which have high bargaining costs due to many factors.\n\nMore generally, free-market environmentalists argue that transaction costs \"count\" as real costs. If the cost of re-allocating property rights exceeds the benefits of doing so, then it is actually optimal to stay in the status quo. This means the initial allocation of property rights is not neutral and also that it has important implications for efficiency. Nevertheless, given the existing property rights regime, costly changes to it are not necessarily efficient, even if in hindsight an alternative regime would have been better. But if there are opportunities for property rights to evolve, entrepreneurs can find them to create new wealth.\n\nLibertarian Georgists (or Geolibertarians) maintain a strong essential commitment to free markets but reject the Coasian solution in favor of land value taxation, wherein the economic rent of land is collected by the community and either equally distributed to adult residents in the form of universal basic income, called the \"Citizen's Dividend\", or used to fund necessary functions of a minimal government. Under the LVT system, only landholders are taxed and on the basis of the market value of the earth in its unimproved state, that is to say, apart from the value of any structures or products of human labor. Geolibertarians regard the LVT as just compensation for a legal land title granting exclusive access to that which logically precedes and generates private capital, whose supply is inelastic, which properly belongs to all, and to which all have an equal right because it is vital to human existence and economic activity—the ground itself—and thus consider land value capture both morally imperative and a natural source of revenue.\n\nTaxation of land values has been advocated by many classical economists and theorists of classical liberalism, but this approach was popularized as the \"Single Tax\" by political economist and public intellectual Henry George in the late 19th century. Geolibertarians generally also support Pigouvian taxes on pollution and fees as compensation for natural resource extraction, negative externalities which adversely affect land values in particular. Many argue the monopolization of land promotes idle land speculation, real estate bubbles, urban sprawl and artificially severe wealth inequality, while violating the Lockean proviso and denying others rightful access to the earth.\n\nRothbardian anarcho-capitalists also reject the proposed Coasian solution as making invalid assumptions about the purely subjective notion of costs being measurable in monetary terms, and also of making unexamined and invalid value judgments (i.e., ethical judgments). ( ) The Rothbardians' solution is to recognize individuals' Lockean property rights, of which the Rothbardians maintain that \"Wertfreiheit\" (i.e., value-free) economic analysis demonstrates that this arrangement necessarily maximizes social utility. ( )\n\nMurray Rothbard himself believed the term \"free-market environmentalism\" to be oxymoronic. On his view the unimproved natural environment, undeveloped and unowned, can in no sense be considered property until it is transformed via Lockean homesteading. Unlike geolibertarians and many classical liberals, however, Rothbard emphatically rejected Locke's proviso as inconsistent with his theory of property acquisition. Against environmentalism Rothbard said: \"The problem is that environmentalists are not interested in efficiency or preserving private property...The environmentalists are acolytes and prisoners of a monstrous literally anti-human philosophy. They despise and condemn the human race, which by its very nature and in contrast to other creatures, changes and transforms the environment instead of being passively subjected to it...I have come to the conclusion that a 'free-market environmentalist' is an oxymoron. Scratch one and you get...an environmentalist.\"\n\nRecent arguments in the academic literature have used Friedrich Hayek's concept of a spontaneous order to defend a broadly non-interventionist environmental policy. Hayek originally used the concept of a spontaneous order to argue against government intervention in the market. Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, it is argued that we have an obligation to not disrupt such systems. This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek's analysis of markets to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders.\n\nProponents of free-market environmentalism use the example of the recent destruction of the once prosperous Grand Banks fishery off Newfoundland. Once one of the world's most abundant fisheries, it has been almost completely depleted of fish. Those primarily responsible were large \"factory-fishing\" enterprises driven by the imperative to realize profits in a competitive global market. It is contended that if the fishery had been owned by a single entity, the owner would have had an interest in keeping a renewable supply of fish to maintain profits over the long term. The owner would thus have charged high fees to fish in the area, sharply reducing how many fish were caught. The owner also would have closely enforced rules on not catching young fish. Instead commercial ships from around the world raced to get the fish out of the water before competitors could, including catching fish that had not yet reproduced.\n\nAnother example is in the 19th century early gold miners in California developed a trade in rights to draw from water courses based on the doctrine of prior appropriation. This was curtailed in 1902 by the Newlands Reclamation Act which introduced subsidies for irrigation projects. This had the effect of sending a signal to farmers that water was inexpensive and abundant, leading to uneconomic use of a scarce resource. Increasing difficulties in meeting demand for water in the western United States have been blamed on the continuing establishment of governmental control and a return to tradable property rights has been proposed.\n\n\nPolitical parties that have supported free-market environmentalism:\n\nSome critics argue that free-market environmentalists have no method of dealing with collective problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of collective regulation and control. They see natural resources as too difficult to privatize (e.g. water), as well as legal responsibility for pollution and degrading biodiversity as too hard to trace.\n\n\n"}

Another early reference is in \"Renri Hishō\" () by Nijō Yoshimoto, where it is used to refer to a Japanese person who is a stranger, not a friend. The Noh play, \"\" has a scene where a servant objects to the appearance of a traveling monk:\n\nHere, \"gaijin\" also means an outsider or unfamiliar person.\n\nThe word \"gaikokujin\" () is composed of \"gaikoku\" (foreign country) and \"jin\" (person). The Meiji government (1868–1912) introduced and popularized the term, which came to replace \"ijin\", \"ikokujin\" and \"ihōjin\". As the Empire of Japan extended to Korea and to Taiwan, the term \"naikokujin\" (\"inside country people\") came to refer to nationals of other imperial territories. While other terms fell out of use after World War II, \"gaikokujin\" remained the official term for non-Japanese people. Some hold that the modern \"gaijin\" is a contraction of \"gaikokujin\".\n\nWhile all forms of the word mean \"foreigner\" or \"outsider\", in practice \"gaikokujin\" and \"gaijin\" are commonly used to refer to racially non-Japanese groups, principally Caucasians. However the term is also sometimes applied to ethnic Japanese born and raised in other countries. \"Gaijin\" is also commonly used within Japanese events such as baseball (there is a limit to non-Japanese players in NPB) and professional wrestling to collectively refer to the visiting performers from the West who will frequently tour the country.\n\nJapanese speakers commonly refer to non-Japanese people as \"gaijin\" even while they are overseas. Also, people of Japanese descent native to other countries (especially those countries with large Japanese communities) might also call non-descendants \"gaijin\", as a counterpart to \"nikkei\". Historically, some usage of the word \"gaijin\" referred respectfully to the prestige and wealth of Caucasians or the power of western businesses. This interpretation of the term as positive or neutral in tone continues for some. However, though the term may be used without negative intent by many Japanese speakers, it is seen as derogatory by some and reflective of exclusionary attitudes.\n\nIn light of these connotations, the more neutral \"gaikokujin\" is often used as an alternative term to refer to non-Japanese people. Nanette Gottlieb, Professor of Japanese Studies at the School of Languages and Comparative Cultural Studies at the University of Queensland, suggests that the term has become controversial and is avoided now by most Japanese television broadcasters. The uncontroversial if slightly formal \"gaikokujin\" is commonly used instead.\n\n\"Gaijin\" appears frequently in Western literature and pop culture. It forms the title of such novels as Marc Olden's \"Gaijin\" (New York: Arbor House, 1986), James Melville's \"Go gently, gaijin\" (New York : St. Martin's Press, 1986), James Kirkup's \"Gaijin on the Ginza\" (London: Chester Springs, 1991) and James Clavell's \"Gai-Jin\" (New York: Delacorte Press, 1993), as well as a song by Nick Lowe. It is the title of feature films such as Tizuka Yamazaki's \"Gaijin – Os Caminhos da Liberdade\" (1980) and \"Gaijin – Ama-me Como Sou\" (2005), as well as animation shorts such as Fumi Inoue's \"Gaijin\" (2003).\n\n"}

Herrett's astronomical interests led him to construct a small building behind the store with an observatory on the roof and a home-built planetarium on the ground floor. He also built a room adjoining the store to exhibit the anthropological artifacts he collected on trips through the Americas, and later, the works of local artists. The Herrett Arts and Science Center, as it was known, featured an eclectic blend of exhibit styles, including a number of interactive displays with motorized action. The planetarium featured a variety of purpose-built projectors and special effects, and the observatory housed a 12.5\" Newtonian and 10\" Maksutov telescope. Local students were trained to present programs for school groups in the planetarium and museum.

It works in close cooperation with the Institut national d'études démographiques (INED).\n\nINSEE is responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France.

In 1833, the Statistics Bureau (French: \"Bureau de la statistique\") was created by Adolphe Thiers. In 1840 it was renamed \"SGF\" or \"General Statistics of France\".\n\nUnder the direction of Lucien March, the SGF expanded its activities. It began an investigation of consumption habits in 1907, following with periodic investigations on retail prices in 1911.\n\nIn 1920 Alfred Sauvy introduced competitive entrance exams for SGF recruitment. However, it was René Carmille, a pioneer of the use of the calculators, who laid the foundations of the modern organization. In 1940, the Demographic Service (\"Service de la démographie\") was created under the Ministry of Finance in order to replace the military recruitment office prohibited by the June 1940 Armistice with Nazi Germany. In order to better conceal its undertakings, the Demographic Service absorbed the SGF on 11 October 1941. The new organization was called the \"SNS\" or \"National Statistics Service\". As part of this reorganization, six new offices were created in the Northern (occupied) zone whose regional structure is maintained today in INSEE.\n\nRené Carmille created an Applied Sciences School (predecessor of the current ENSAE) to specially train members for the SNS.\n\nCarmille worked for Vichy France but he was actually a double agent for the French underground. From his position in the SNS he sabotaged the Nazi census of France, which saved untold numbers of Jewish people from death camps. He also used his department to help mobilize French resistance in Algeria. He was caught by the Nazis and sent to Dachau where he died in 1945.\n\nThe SNS was finally transformed into INSEE by the law of 27 April 1946, \"The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Surveys for the metropolis and overseas France\" (\"L'Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques pour la métropole et la France d'outre-mer\").\n\nThis is a list of directors of INSEE since its founding:\n\n\n"}

A Kolam is a geometrical line drawing composed of curved loops, drawn around a grid pattern of dots. In South India and Sri Lanka, it is widely practised by female Hindu family members in front of their houses. Kolams are regionally known by different names in India, \"Raangolee\" in Maharashtra, \" Aripan \" in Mithila, \"Hase\" and \"Raongoli\" in Kannada in Karnataka, \"Muggulu\" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. More complex Kolams are drawn and colors are often added during holiday occasions and special events.\n\nKolams are thought to bring prosperity to homes. Every morning in Tamil Nadu, millions of women draw kolams on the ground with white rice flour. Through the day, the drawings get walked on, washed out in the rain, or blown around in the wind; new ones are made the next day. Every morning before sunrise, the floor of the house, or where ever the Kolam may be drawn, is cleaned with water and the muddy floor swept well to create an even surface. The kolams are generally drawn while the surface is still damp so the design will hold better. Even powdered white stone (வெங்கசங்கள் பொடி / மொக்குமாவு) can be used for creating Kolam. Occasionally, cow dung is also used to wax the floors. In some cultures, cow dung is believed to have antiseptic properties and hence provides a literal threshold of protection for the home. It also provides contrast with the white powder.\n\nThe decoration is not the main purpose of a Kolam. In olden days, kolams were drawn in coarse rice flour, so the ants would not have to walk too far or too long for a meal. The rice powder also invites birds and other small creatures to eat it, thus welcoming other beings into one's home and everyday life: a daily tribute to harmonious co-existence. It is a sign of invitation to welcome all into the home, not the least of whom is Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. The patterns range between geometric and mathematical line drawings around a matrix of dots to free form art work and closed shapes. Folklore has evolved to mandate that the lines must be completed so as to symbolically prevent evil spirits from entering the inside of the shapes, and thus are they prevented from entering the inside of the home.\nIt used to be a matter of pride to be able to draw large complicated patterns without lifting the hand off the floor or standing up in between. The month of \"Margazhi\" was eagerly awaited by young women, who would then showcase their skills by covering the entire width of the road with one big kolam.\n\nIn the kolam patterns, many designs are derived from magical motifs and abstract designs blended with philosophic and religious motifs which have been mingled together. Motifs may include fish, birds, and other animal images to symbolise the unity of man and beast. The sun, moon and other zodiac symbols were also used. The Downward pointing triangle represented woman; an upward pointing triangle represented man. A circle represented nature while a square represented culture. A lotus represented the womb. A pentagram represented Venus and the five elements.\n\nThe ritual kolam patterns created for special occasions such as weddings often stretch all the way down the street. Many of these created patterns have been passed on from generation to generation, from mothers to daughters.\n\nSeasonal messages like welcome (நல்வரவு) can also be used in Kolam. Volunteering to draw the kolam at the temple is sometimes done when a devotee's wishes are fulfilled. The art of Kolam designs has found its way into the future through social networking sites like Facebook. Many Kolam artists have big fan followings online and are playing a role in making the Kolam art form a key part of South India's contemporary art scene.\n\nFor special occasions limestone and red brick powder to contrast are also used. Though kolams are usually done with dry rice flour, for longevity, dilute rice paste or even paints are also used. Modern interpretations have accommodated chalk, and more recently vinyl stickers.\n\nThough not as flamboyant as its other Indian contemporary, Rangoli, which is extremely colourful, a South Indian Kolam is all about symmetry, precision, and complexity. Due to their complexity, trying to figure out how, exactly, these designs were drawn can be a challenge that some viewers find enjoyable.\n\n\n\n"}

This includes the administrative districts of Mumbai, Mumbai Suburban, Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.\n\nThere is a diaspora Konkani Muslim community based in Persian Gulf states, United Kingdom and South Africa. A chunk of Konkani Muslims migrated to Pakistan after 1947 and are based in Karachi as part of the Muhajir community.\n\nSince antiquity, the Konkan coast has had mercantile relations with major ports on the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Konkani Muslims can trace their ancestry to Arab traders who visited the coast in the medieval era. Ancestry formed the basis for social stratification: direct descendants of Arab traders formed an elite class over those who had indirect descent through intermarriages with local converts to Islam.\n\nKonkani Muslims follow the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islamic law. This is in contrast to the rest of North India and Deccan regions whose Sunni Muslims adhere to the Hanafi school.\n\nKonkani Muslims speak a variety of dialects of Marathi collectively called Maharashtrian Konkani. Some of the dialects include Parabhi, Kunbi, Karadhi, Sangameshwari and Bankoti. These form a gradual linguistic continuum between standard Marathi in regions around Mumbai and Konkani language in regions around Goa.\n\nIn addition, the Muslims from south Sindhudurg, near Malvan, and the former princely state of Sawantwadi speak the Malvani Konkani dialect of the Konkani language.\n\nThe cuisine of Konkani Muslims is non-vegetarian, mostly seafood. Its staple food is rice and bread made of rice (preferred at dinners) with fish and lentils or vegetables. It is mainly influenced by Maharashtrian cuisine. The southern portion of Konkan region has Malvani cuisine which overlaps with Maharashtrian and Goan cuisines.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "873137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=873137", "title": "Landed gentry", "text": "Landed gentry\n\nThe landed gentry, or simply the gentry, is a largely historical British social class consisting in theory of landowners who could live entirely from rental income, or at least had a country estate. It was distinct from, and socially \"below\", the aristocracy or peerage, although in fact some of the landed gentry were wealthier than some peers, and many gentry were related to peers. They often worked as administrators of their own lands, while others became public, political, religious, and armed forces figures. The decline of this privileged class largely stemmed from the 1870s agricultural depression; however, there are still a large number of hereditary gentry in the UK to this day, many of whom transferred their landlord style management skills after the agricultural depression into the business of land agency, the act of buying and selling land.\n\nThe designation \"landed gentry\" originally referred exclusively to members of the upper class who were landlords and also commoners in the British sense – that is, they did not hold peerages – but usage became more fluid over time. Similar or analogous social systems of landed gentry also sprang up in countries that maintained a colonial system; the term is employed in many British colonies such as the Colony of Virginia and some parts of India. By the late 19th century, the term was also applied to peers such as the Duke of Westminster who lived on landed estates. The book series \"Burke's Landed Gentry\" recorded the members of this class. Successful burghers often used their accumulated wealth to buy country estates, with the aim of establishing themselves as landed gentry.\n\nThe term \"gentry\", some of whom were landed, included four separate groups in England:\n\n\nAll of the first group, and very many of the last three, were \"armigerous\", having obtained the right to carry a coats of arms. In many Continental societies, this was exclusively the right of the nobility, and at least the upper clergy. In France this was originally true but many of the landed gentry, burghers and wealthy merchants were allowed to register coats of arms and become \"armigerous\".\n\nThe term \"landed gentry\", although originally used to mean nobility, came to be used of the lesser nobility in England around 1540. Once identical, eventually these terms became complementary, in the sense that their definitions began to fill in parts of what the other lacked. The historical term gentry by itself, so Peter Coss argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable. The phrase \"landed gentry\" referred in particular to the untitled members of the landowning upper class. The most stable and respected form of wealth has historically been land, and great prestige and political qualifications were (and to a lesser extent still are) attached to land ownership.\n\nThe primary meaning of \"landed gentry\" encompasses those members of the land owning classes who are not members of the peerage. It was an informal designation: one belonged to the landed gentry if other members of that class accepted one as such. A newly rich man who wished his family to join the gentry (and they nearly all did so wish), was expected not only to buy a country house and estate, but also to sever all financial ties with the business which had made him wealthy in order to cleanse his family of the \"taint of trade\". However, during the 19th century, as the new rich of the Industrial Revolution became more and more numerous and politically powerful, this expectation was gradually relaxed. From the late 16th-century, the gentry emerged as the class most closely involved in politics, the military and law. It provided the bulk of Members of Parliament, with many gentry families maintaining political control in a certain locality over several generations (see List of political families in the United Kingdom). Owning land was a prerequisite for suffrage (the civil right to vote) in county constituencies until the Reform Act 1832; until then, Parliament was largely in the hands of the landowning class.\n\nMembers of the landed gentry were upper class (not middle class); this was a highly prestigious status. Particular prestige was attached to those who inherited landed estates over a number of generations. These are often described as being from \"old\" families. Titles are often considered central to the upper class, but this is certainly not universally the case. For example, both Captain Mark Phillips and Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the first and second husbands of HRH The Princess Anne, lacked any rank of peerage, yet could scarcely be considered anything other than upper class.\n\nThe agricultural sector's middle class, on the other hand, comprise the larger tenant farmers, who rent land from the landowners, and yeoman farmers, who were defined as \"a person qualified by possessing free land of forty shillings annual [feudal] value, and who can serve on juries and vote for a Knight of the Shire. He is sometimes described as a small landowner, a farmer of the middle classes.\" Anthony Richard Wagner of the Richmond Herald wrote that \"a Yeoman would not normally have less than 100 acres\" (40 hectares) and in social status is one step down from the gentry, but above, say, a husbandman. So while yeoman farmers owned enough land to support a comfortable lifestyle, they nevertheless farmed it themselves and were excluded from the \"landed gentry\" because they worked for a living, and were thus \"in trade\" as it was termed. Apart from a few \"honourable\" professions connected with the governing elite (the clergy of the established church, the officer corps of the British Armed Forces, the diplomatic and civil services, the bar or the judiciary), such occupation was considered demeaning by the upper classes, particularly by the 19th century, when the earlier mercantile endeavours of younger sons were increasingly discontinued. Younger sons, who could not expect to inherit the family estate, were instead urged into professions of state service. It became a pattern in many families that while the eldest son would inherit the estate and enter politics, the second son would join the army, the third son go into law, and the fourth son join the church.\n\nPersons who are closely related to peers are also more correctly described as gentry than as nobility, since the latter term, in the modern British Isles, is synonymous with \"peer\". However, this popular usage of 'nobility' omits the distinction between titled and untitled nobility. The titled nobility in Britain are the peers of the realm, whereas the untitled nobility comprise those here described as gentry.\n\nDavid Cannadine wrote that the gentry's lack of titles \"did not matter, for it was obvious to contemporaries that the landed gentry were all for practical purposes the equivalent of continental nobles, with their hereditary estates, their leisured lifestyle, their social pre-eminence, and their armorial bearings\". British armigerous families who hold no title of nobility are represented, together with those who hold titles through the College of Arms, by the Commission and Association for Armigerous Families of Great Britain at CILANE.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the names and families of those with titles (specifically peers and baronets, less often including those with the non-hereditary title of knight) were often listed in books or manuals known as \"Peerages\", \"Baronetages\", or combinations of these categories, such as the \"Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage\". As well as listing genealogical information, these books often also included details of the right of a given family to a coat of arms. They were comparable to the Almanach de Gotha in continental Europe. Novelist Jane Austen, whose family were not quite members of the landed gentry class, summarised the appeal of these works, particularly for those included in them:\n\nEqually wryly, Oscar Wilde referred to the Peerage as \"the best thing in fiction the English have ever done\".\n\nIn the 1830s, one peerage publisher, John Burke, expanded his market and his readership by publishing a similar volume for people without titles, which was called \"A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank\", popularly known as \"Burke's Commoners. Burke's Commoners\" was published in four volumes from 1833 to 1838.\nSubsequent editions were re-titled \"A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry; or, Commons of Great Britain and Ireland\" or \"Burke's Landed Gentry.\"\n\n\"Burke's Landed Gentry\" continued to appear at regular intervals throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, driven, in the 19th century, principally by the energy and readable style of the founder's son and successor as editor, Sir John Bernard Burke (who generally favoured the romantic and picturesque in genealogy over the mundane, or strictly correct).\n\nA review of the 1952 edition in \"Time\" noted:\n\nThe last three-volume edition of \"Burke's Landed Gentry\" was published between 1965 and 1972. A new series, under new owners, was begun in 2001 on a regional plan, starting with \"Burke's Landed Gentry; The Kingdom in Scotland\". However, these volumes no longer limit themselves to people with any connection, ancestral or otherwise, with land, and they contain much less information, particularly on family history, than the 19th and 20th century editions.\n\nThe popularity of \"Burke's Landed Gentry\" gave currency to the expression \"Landed Gentry\" as a description of the untitled upper classes in England (although the book also included families in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, where, however, social structures were rather different). An alternate name was employed by the publishers of a similar, though less genealogical, series, known as \"Walford's County Families\", wherein the term \"county family\" referred more or less to the same people Burke covered by the term, \"landed gentry\". They were also known as the upper ten thousand.\n\nFamilies were arranged in alphabetical order by surname, and each family article was headed with the surname and the name of their landed property, e.g. \"Capron of Southwick Hall\". There was then a paragraph on the owner of the property, with his coat of arms illustrated, and all his children and remoter male-line descendants also listed, each with full names and details of birth, marriage, death, and any matters tending to enhance their social prestige, such as school and university education, military rank and regiment, Church of England cures held, and other honours and socially approved involvements. Cross references were included to other families in \"Burke's Landed Gentry\" or in \"Burke's Peerage and Baronetage\": thus encouraging browsing through connections. Professional details were not usually mentioned unless they conferred some social status, such as those of civil service and colonial officials, judges and barristers.\n\nAfter the section dealing with the current owner of the property, there usually appeared a section entitled \"Lineage\" which listed, not only ancestors of the owner, but (so far as known) every male-line descendant of those ancestors, thus including many people in the ranks of the \"Landed Gentry\" families who had never owned an acre in their lives but who might share in the status of their eponymous kin as connected, however remotely to the \"landed gentry\" or to a \"county family\".\n\nThe Great Depression of British Agriculture at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.\n\nSo devastating was this for the ranks formerly identified as being of the landed gentry that \"Burke's Landed Gentry\" began, in the 20th century, to include families historically in this category who had ceased to own their ancestral lands. The focus of those who remained in this class shifted from the lands or estates themselves, to the stately home or \"family seat\" which was in many cases retained without the surrounding lands. Many of these buildings were purchased for the nation and preserved as monuments to the lifestyles of their former owners (who sometimes remained in part of the house as lessees or tenants) by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. The National Trust, which had originally concentrated on open landscapes rather than buildings, accelerated its country house acquisition programme during and after the Second World War, partly because of the widespread destruction of country houses in the 20th century by owners who could no longer afford to maintain them. Those who retained their property usually had to supplement their incomes from sources other than the land, sometimes by opening their properties to the public.\n\nIn the 21st century, the term \"landed gentry\" is still used, as the landowning class still exists, but it increasingly refers more to historic than to current landed wealth or property in a family. Moreover, the deference which was once automatically given to members of this class by most British people has almost completely dissipated as its wealth, political power and social influence have declined, and other social figures such as celebrities have grown to take their place in the public's interest.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27227412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27227412", "title": "Nabagopal Mitra", "text": "Nabagopal Mitra\n\nNabagopal Mitra () (1840–1894) was an Indian playwright, poet, essayist, patriot and one of the founding fathers of Hindu nationalism. He founded the Hindu Mela (which was inaugurated by Rajnarayan Basu ) the pioneer institution behind the genesis of Hindu nationalism. Mitra also founded National Press, National Paper, National Society, National School, National Theatre, National Store, National Gymnasium and National Circus, earning him the sobriquet 'National Mitra'.\n\nNabagopal Mitra was born into a Bengali Hindu Kayastha family residing at Shankar Ghosh Lane, near Cornwallis Street in Kolkata. The year of birth is disputed. While most historians agree that he was born in 1840, in some sources his year of birth is recorded as 1841. From his early days he was very close to the Tagore family. Satyendranath Tagore and Ganendranath Tagore were his classmates at the Hindu School. Gradually he became a close associate of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, the leader of the Adi Brahmo Samaj and Tattwabodhini Sabha. Maharshi Debendranath was conservative in outlook in comparison to Keshab Chandra Sen's ultra-reformist stand. While Keshab Sen's philosophy was rooted in universalism, Maharshi Debedranath believed in reforms from a nationalist perspective. Nabagopal Mitra was heavily influenced by Maharshi Debendranath's thinking.\n\nNabagopal Mitra contended unity to be the fundamental criterion of nationalism and maintained that for the Hindus the basis of national unity has been the Hindu religion. He also attempted a definition of the Hindu nation. According to him, \"Hindu nationality .. is not confined to Bengal. It embraces all of Hindu names and Hindu faiths throughout the length and breadth of Hindustan; neither geographical position nor the language is counted as a disability. Hindus are destined to be a religious nation.\"\n\nIn 1867, Nabagopal Mitra started an English weekly called \"National Paper\". It was financed by Maharshi Debendranath Tagore. Even being the chief editor, Mitra purposefully never used grammatically correct English in his columns. If somebody pointed out any grammatical error, he used to justify it by explaining that as English was not his mother tongue, there is no harm if his article had any grammatical mistakes. According to him, it would be enough for someone if he is able to express himself in English, even though it may not be grammatically correct. Mitra's disdain and contempt for the language of the oppressors, essentially a trait inherited from his mentor Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, had to reflect in the media, and that remained a key deciding factor in the choice of the language when then weekly was launched.\n\nIn 1867, the National Paper published the \"Prospectus of a Society for the Promotion of National Feeling among the Educated Natives of Bengal\" by Rajnarayan Basu. Inspired by this booklet Nabagopal Mitra founded the Hindu Mela and the National Society in 1867. The mela was first known as the Jatiya Mela.\n\nHe requested Jyotirindranath Tagore to recite poems he composed at the Hindu Mela.\n\nYoung Narendranath used to visit the Hindu Mela.\n\nAt the Hindu Mela, Nabagopal Mitra laid much emphasis on gymnastics, wrestling and other traditional sports. In 1868, he opened a gymnastic school at his own residence, which he named \"National Gymnasium\". It became very popular and within a few years the school produced a number of physical education teachers. In the early 1870s the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal George Campbell formulated a new educational policy. According to this new system, European style gymnasiums were set up in the government schools and colleges. The gymnasium of the Hindu College was equipped with parallel bars, horizontal bar, trapeze etc. The eldest son-in-law of Nabagopal Mitra was the instructor. Mitra, realising the usefulness and necessity of the European equipments, attempted to assimilate them within the Indian tradition. So, at the \"National Gymnasium\", while the emphasis was more on physical exercises, wrestling, sword fighting and stick wielding, gradually modern equipments like bars and trapeze were introduced. Mitra even employed a British trainer to train the Bengali Hindu pupils in European style gymnastics.\n\nApart from the physical training, the institution was also instrumental in imparting the first lessons of nationalism to the future leaders of India. The foremost amongst them were Bipin Chandra Pal, Sundari Mohan Das and Raj Chandra Chaudhuri. Swami Vivekananda too, in his early life had joined the National Gymnasium. Once a British sailor was hit by the toppled pole of trapeze at the gym and became unconscious. Many of the onlookers fled but young Narendranath and his friends took courage and nursed the sailor for a few days until he was revived.\n\nIn 1872, Mitra founded the National School in the premises of the Calcutta Training Academy at 13, Cornwallis Street. The institution was set up for the cultivation arts, music and physical training. The courses at the National School were overtly technical including drawing, modelling, geometrical drawing, architectural drawing, engineering and surveying. Shyamacharan Srimani became the chief teacher of the arts curriculum. Kalidas Pal, the founder of India's first art journal 'Shilpa Puspanjali' too joined the National School as a faculty.\n\nNabagopal Mitra was instrumental behind the formation of National Theatre in 1872. The name National Theatre was first suggested by Mitra. On 7 December 1873 the group staged their maiden play Nildarpan. The staging was hailed as 'an event of national importance' by Mitra in the National Paper.\n\nMitra had utilized his entire assets for the establishment of the pioneering national institutions. Finally he mortgaged his residence in order to raise money for the National Circus, the pioneer institution that spread the culture of acrobatics, gymnastics and physical culture in India and acted as the precursor to the highly renowned and successful Great Bengal Circus founded by Priyanath Bose. Ram Chandra Chatterjee, the pioneer balloonist and parachutist began his career as an acrobat at the National Circus.\n\nMitra founded the National Circus in June, 1881 at 10-2, Cornwallis Street.\n"}

Their ancestors arrived in Nepal from different parts of South Asia, Central Asia and Tibet during different epochs, and have since lived amidst the numerically dominant Hindus and Buddhists. About 97% of the Muslim community live in the Terai region, while the other 3% are found mainly in the city of Kathmandu and the western hills. The community numbers 971,056, about 4.4% of the total population of Nepal. Districts with large Muslim population include Sarlahi (9.9%), Rautahat (17.2%), Bara (11.9%), and Parsa (17.3%) in the central Terai bordering the state of Bihar, Kapilbastu (16.8%) and Banke (16%) in the western Terai and Siraha (7%) and Sunsari (10%) and Saptari (10%) eastern Terai.\n\nMuslims have lived in Nepal for long period of time and have shared common historical experiences with the Hindu majority, and as such have developed a stronger identification with the Nepali state. However, the Terai Muslims, on the other hand, like other Terai communities, also continue to have strong ties across the border and receive cultural sustenance from the larger Muslim population of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Nepali historians believe that the first Muslims settled in Kathmandu during King Ratna Malla's reign in the late 15th century. Kashmiri traders were probably the first Muslims to arrive, followed by Afghans, Persians and even Arabian. The Bajar in Indra Chok gets its name from the Iraqi merchants. \n\nThe Chaubise rajas of west Nepal also employed Afghan and Indian Muslims to train Nepali soldiers to use firearms and ammunition. Ratna Malla's envoy to Lhasa invited Kashmiri Muslims to Kathmandu in an attempt to profit from the rugs, carpets, shawls and woollen goods they traded between Kashmir, Ladakh and Lhasa. The first batch of Muslims came with a Kashmiri saint who built the first mosque, Kashmiri Taquia, in 1524, writes Shamima Siddika in her book Muslims of Nepal. \n\nInfluenced by the system of Mughal courts in Delhi, the Mallas also invited Indian Muslims to work as courtiers and counsellors-leading to rivalry with Newar nobles of the Malla courts. While the Muslim courtiers did not last long and returned to India, other Muslims stayed on. The Mallas also got Indian Muslims from the Mughal Empire to join their courts as musicians and specialists on perfumes and ornaments. Historian Baburam Acharya believes they were also there to protect King Ratna Malla from rebellious relatives and senior court officials. \n\nFollowing Nepal's unification, King Prithvi Narayan Shah also encouraged Muslim traders to settle down with their families. Besides trade, the Muslims from Afghanistan and India were experts in manufacturing guns, cartridges and canons, while others were useful in international diplomacy because of their knowledge of Persian and Arabic. \n\nMany Muslims, especially Kashmiri traders, are said to have fled to India during the economic blockade that Prithvi Narayan Shah imposed on the Valley. Fearing persecution from a Hindu king due to their religion and their ties with the Mallas, the traders left despite assurances that they would come to no harm. By 1774, only a handful of Kashmiri merchants remained. Even so, Kashmiri traders proved to be a great help during the unification process. Historians say that Prithvi Narayan Shah employed them as spies and informants as they had personal contacts with the Malla rulers. After his victory, he gave them permission to build a mosque, now near Tri-Chandra Campus (Nepali Jame Masjid, Ghantaghar). \n\nDuring Jang Bahadur Rana's regime, a large number of Muslims migrated to the tarai from India fleeing persecution by the British army during the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. These refugees settled in the tarai, selling leather goods or working as agricultural labourers. A senior courtier to Delhi Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar also fled to Kathmandu. Later, he renovated the Jama Masjid and was buried there. During the Sepoy Mutiny, Begum Hazrat Mahal, wife of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of Lucknow also escaped to Kathmandu via Nepalganj and was allowed by Jang Bahadur to take refuge in Nepal. She settled down at the Thapathali Durbar, and later died in Kathmandu and was also buried at the Nepali mosque.\n\nThe history of the Muslim community in Nepal is in fact the history of three distinct groups, the Tibetans, Kashmiris and the Madhesi.\n\nAccording to the Vamshavalis, Kashmiri Muslims arrived in Kathmandu during the reign of King Rama Malla (1484-1520 AD). They built a mosque, the Kashmiri Takia, and engaged in different occupations such as scribes to correspond with the Delhi Sultanate, and as scent manufacturers, musicians and bangle suppliers. Some were admitted as courtiers to the Malla durbar, and many traded with Tibet. The descendants of these migrants live in Kathmandu, numbering about two thousand. They tend to be well-educated and speak a mixture of Nepali and Urdu at home rather than Kashmiri. Many Kashmiri Muslims of Kathmandu are also fluent in Newari. While many work as petty businessmen, some have joined government service or entered politics. \n\nThe Kashmiri merchants who first arrived in the 1970s set up curio shops in Kathmandu´s tourist quarters. There has been a spurt in arrivals from Srinagar since the political turmoil in Jammu and Kashmir escalated in 1990. Many shopkeepers arrived with their stocks of handicrafts, rugs and furs. These recent arrivals have little or no interaction with the older Muslim residents, and most do not even know that there is an old Kashmiri Muslim stock in Kathmandu.\n\nMuslim migrants of Tibetan origin include both Ladakhis and those from Tibet proper. The latter arrived mostly after the Chinese Communist takeover in 1959, and in their language and dress these Tibetan Muslims are indistinguishable from their Tibetan Buddhist counterparts. Today, many are engaged in the trade of Chinese consumer durables and selling curios. On the whole, this groups tends to be more affluent than the other Muslim communities.\n\nThe story of the Tibetan Muslims is that of a unique community, that has blended different cultural strains to forge a distinct identity, that has been kept alive even in the face of adversity. According to the community,s traditions, Islam arrived almost a thousand years ago in Tibet, a region that has always been synonymous with a monolithic Buddhist culture. Sometime in the 12th century, it is believed, a group of Muslim traders from Kashmir and Ladakh came to Tibet as merchants. Many of these traders settled in Tibet and married Tibetan women, who later converted to the religion of their husbands. Author Thomas Arnold, in his book, The Preaching of Islam says that gradually, marriages and social interactions led to an increase in the Tibetan Muslim population until a sizable community came up around Lhasa, Tibet’s capital.\n\nThe Muslim society in the Terai region is organized along the principles of caste, but differs in many respects from the caste system found among the Madhesi Hindus. Although Muslim groupings are endogamous, and there are elements of hierarchy, there is no religious and ideological principles providing foundation for the concept of caste. For example, there is no question of ritual pollution by touch or restriction on interdinning. But each grouping does maintain a separate and distinct identity, especially with regards intermarriage. Below is a brief description of the larger groupings:\n\nWhile the smaller groups provide diversity, the largest community of Islam adherents, more than 74 percent—of the Muslims are found in the Madhesh region, a narrow Terai plain lying between the lower hills of the Himalaya and the border with India. Concentrated in the Madhesh districts of Banke, Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, Parsa, Bara and Rauthat, some of the Madhesi Muslims were present here at the time of Nepal´s unification while others migrated from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, Arabia, Tibet, Egypt, Persia from the 19th century onwards as wage labourers. While most are small-time proprietor farmers, a substantial number still work as tenants and agricultural labourers. At home they do speak Urdu, but also Awadhi, Bhojpuri and Maithili & Nepali depending on whether they are of the Western or Central or Eastern Madhesh.\n\nThe Muslim society in the Madhesh (Terai) region is organized along the principles of caste, but differs in many respects from the caste system found among the Madhesi Nepali Hindus. Although Muslim groupings are endogamous, and there are elements of hierarchy, there are no religious and ideological principles providing a foundation for the concept of caste. For example, there is no question of ritual pollution by touch or restriction on interdining. But each grouping does maintain a separate and distinct identity, especially with regard to intermarriage. Below is a brief description of the larger groupings:\n\nMembers of Madhesh-based Muslim communities reside in the Kathmandu valley and are the leaders of a revival and reform of Islam informed by global Islamist discourses and enabled and promoted by petrodollars and new technologies of communication linking them with Muslims communities around the world. The movement has both religious and political dimensions (though the two intertwine significantly in Islam), each represented by distinct organizations with their internal hierarchies and rules for membership. They provide scholarships for Muslim youth, support for mosques and madrases, and religious trainings. These organizations have centers in the Terai as well, but the national centers are in the Kathmandu valley. Their ideological influences range from the Muslim Brotherhood, to Salafism, to the Jamaat-e Islami.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2155325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155325", "title": "Northern Italy", "text": "Northern Italy\n\nNorthern Italy ( or just ) is a geographical region in the northern part of Italy. Non-administrative, it consists of eight administrative Regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. As of 2014, its population was 27,801,460. Rhaeto-Romance and Gallo-Italic languages are spoken in the region, as opposed to the Italo-Dalmatian languages spoken in the rest of Italy.\n\nFor statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the terms Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for two of Italy's five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first-level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\"NUTS 1 regions\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament.\n\nNorthern Italy was called by different terms in different periods of History. During ancient times the terms Cisalpine Gaul, Gallia Citerior or Gallia Togata were used to define that part of Italy inhabited by Celts (Gauls) during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Conquered by the Roman Republic in the 220s BC, it was a Roman province from c. 81 BC until 42 BC, when it was merged into Roman Italy. Until that time, it was considered part of Gaul, precisely that part of Gaul on the \"hither side of the Alps\" (from the perspective of the Romans), as opposed to Transalpine Gaul (\"on the far side of the Alps\").\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire and the settlement of the Lombards the name Langobardia Maior was used, in the Early Middle Ages, to define the domains of the Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy. The Lombard territories beyond were called Langobardia Minor, consisting of the Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento.\nDuring the Late Middle Ages, after the fall of the northern part of the Lombard Kingdom to Charlemagne, the term Longobardia was used to mean Northern Italy within the medieval Kingdom of Italy. As the area became partitioned in regional states the term Lombardy subsequentially shifted to indicate only the area of the Duchies of Milan, Mantua, Parma and Modena and later only to the area around Milan.\n\nIn late modern period the term High Italy (Alta Italia) was widely used, for example by the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia during the second World War. Starting from the 1960s the term Padania was sometimes used as geographic synonym of Po Valley. The term was appeared sparingly until the early 1990s, when Lega Nord, a federalist and, at times, separatist political party in Italy, proposed \"Padania\" as a possible name for an independent state in Northern Italy. Since then, it has carried strong political connotations.\n\nIn pre-Roman centuries it was inhabited by different peoples among whom the Ligures, the ancient Veneti, who prospered through their trade in amber and breeding of horses, the Etruscans, who colonized Northern Italy from Tuscany, founded the city of Bologna and spread the use of writing; later, starting from the 5th century BC, the area was invaded by Celtic – Gallic tribes. These people founded several cities like Turin and Milan and extended their rule from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea.\nTheir development was halted by the Roman expansion in the Po Valley from the 3rd century BC onwards. After centuries of struggle, in 194 BC the entire area of what is now Northern Italy became a Roman province with the name of Gallia Cisalpina (\"Gaul on the inner side (with respect to Rome) of the Alps\").\nThe Roman culture and language overwhelmed the former civilization in the following years, and Northern Italy became one of the most developed and rich areas of the western half of the empire with the construction of a wide array of roads and the development of agriculture and trade. In late antiquity the strategic role of Northern Italy was emphasized by the moving of the capital of the Western Empire from Rome to Mediolanum in 286 and later to Ravenna from 402 until the empire collapsed in 476.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Empire, Northern Italy suffered heavily from destruction brought about by migration from Germanic peoples and from the Gothic War. In the 570s the Germanic Lombards, or Longobardi, entered Northern Italy from Friuli and founded a long-lasting reign (with its capital in Pavia) that gave the medieval name to the whole Northern Italy and the current name to the Lombardy region. \nAfter the initial struggles, relationships between the Lombard people and the Latin-speaking people improved. In the end, the Lombard language and culture assimilated with the Latin culture, leaving evidence in many names, the legal code and laws, and other things. The end of Lombard rule came in 774, when the Frankish king Charlemagne conquered Pavia, deposed Desiderius, the last Lombard king, and annexed the Lombard Kingdom to his empire changing the name in Kingdom of Italy. The former Lombard dukes were mostly replaced by Frankish counts, prince-bishops or marquises.\n\nIn the 10th century Northern Italy was formally under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire but was in fact divided in a multiplicity of small, autonomous city-states, the medieval communes and maritime republic. The 11th century marked a significant boom in Northern Italy's economy, due to improved trading and agricultural innovations, culture flourished as well with many universities founded, among them the University of Bologna, the oldest university in Europe. \nThe increasing richness of the city-states made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power, represented by the German emperors and their local vassals. This process led to the creation of different Lombard Leagues formed by allied cities of Lombardy that defeated the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I, at Legnano, and his grandson Frederick II, at Parma, and becoming virtually independent from the German emperors. \nThe Leagues failed to develop from an alliance to a lasting confederation and subsequently, among the various local city-states, a process of consolidation took place; most of them became lordships ruled by powerful families like the Della Scala of Verona or the Visconti of Milan, and conquered neighboring cities threatening to unify Northern Italy under a single state. In the end a balance of power was reached in 1454 with the Peace of Lodi and Northern Italy ended up divided between a small number of regional states, the most powerful were the Duchies of Savoy, Milan, Mantua, Ferrara and the Republics of Genoa and Venice, which had begun to extend its influence in the mainland from the 14th century onwards.\n\nIn the 15th century Northern Italy became one of the centres of the Renaissance whose culture and works of art were highly regarded. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe and \"Lombards\", the term that designated the merchants or bankers coming from northern Italy, were present in all of Europe.\nThe Italian Wars between 1494 and 1559 ended the North Italian Renaissance and brought the region to be fought between France and the Spanish and Austrian House of Hapsburg. After the war Northern Italy became under direct or indirect control of Spain.\nAt the same time Ottoman control of the eastern Mediterranean and the discoveries of sea routes to Asia around Africa and of the Americas led to the decline of the Venetian Republic.\nPestilences, like that of 1628/1630, and the generally declining conditions of Italy's economy in the 17th and 18th centuries halted the further development of Northern Italy. The only state that managed to thrive in this period was the Duchy of Savoy that thanks to military and diplomatic victories in 1720 became the Kingdom of Sardinia and increased Turin's importance as a European capital.\n\nAfter the French Revolution in the late 18th century Northern Italy was conquered by the French armies, many client republics were created by Napoleon and in 1805 a new Kingdom of Italy, made of all of Northern Italy but Piedmont that was annexed to France, was established with Milan as capital and Napoleon as head of state.\nIn the congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored, and furthermore enlarged by annexing the Republic of Genoa to strengthen it as a barrier against France. The rest of Northern Italy was under Austrian rule, either direct like in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom or indirect like in the Duchies of Parma and Modena. Bologna and Romagna were given to the Papal State.\nThe Austrian imperial government was unpopular because of their anti-liberal politics and Northern Italy became the intellectual centre leading the Italian unification process. Piedmont and the Kingdom of Sardinia, in particular, was the state that launched Italy's unification in 1859–1861. After defeating the Austrians in 1859 and annexing Northern Italy the new state proceeded to launch a campaign to conquer Southern and Central Italy and Turin briefly became the capital of the whole of Italy.\n\nAfter Italian unification the capital was moved from Turin to Rome and the administrative and institutional importance of Northern Italy was deeply reduced. However, from the late 19th century and especially with the economic boom of the 1950s–1960s, Northern Italy and especially the cities of Turin, Genoa and Milan was the most important region in the Italian industrialization and sharpened its status of richest and most industrialized part of Italy.\nBetween 1943 and 1945, during the Second World War, Northern Italy was part of the Fascist Italian Social Republic and the main theatre of the anti-fascist partisan activity. Between April 19, 1945, and April 25, the cities of Northern Italy began an insurrection against fascist and nazist forces that lead to the liberation of Northern Italy by Allied forces. \nEconomic differences between Northern Italy and the rest of the country, as well as the short history of Italy as a single nation, led in the 1990s to the emergence of Padanian nationalism, as Lega Nord promoted either secession or larger autonomy for Padania, the name chosen to represent Northern Italy.\n\nNorthern Italy is made of the basin of the River Po, which comprises the whole of the broad plain extending from the foot of the Apennines to that of the Alps, together with the valleys and slopes on both sides of it, the Venetian Plain and the Ligurian coast.\nNorthern Italy has the Alps as northern and western boundary and the Apennine Mountains as the southern one. In between the two mountain ranges lies a large plain made of the Venetian Plain and the valley of the Po, the largest river in Italy, which flows 652 km eastward from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic Sea and receives all the waters that flow from the Apennines northwards, and all those that descend from the Alps towards the south. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy and held the vast majority of North Italian population.\n\nThe Alps are home to some worldwide-known mountains like the Matterhorn (Cervino), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the eastern Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side of the Alps. The highest peak in Europe is Mont Blanc, at 4,810 meters above sea level, located at the border with France.\n\nWith the exception of Liguria all of Northern Italy lies in the drainage basin of the Adriatic Sea (with rivers Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, Reno) though the waters from some border municipalities (Livigno in Lombardy, Innichen and Sexten in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol) drain into the Black Sea through the basin of the Danube, and the waters from the Lago di Lei in Lombardy drain into the North Sea through the basin of the Rhine.\n\nOn the foothills of the Alps there are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is Garda. Other well known of these subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore, whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como, Orta, Lugano, Iseo, Idro.\n\nThe climate of Northern Italy is mainly humid subtropical (Köppen Cfa), especially in the plains. Winter in Northern Italy is normally long, rainy and rather cold. In addition, there is a high seasonal temperature variation between Summer and Winter. In the hills and mountains, the climate is humid continental (Köppen Dfb). In the valleys it is relatively mild, while it can be severely cold above 1,500 mt, with copious snowfalls. The coastal areas of Liguria generally fit the Mediterranean climate profile. In the Alpine foothills, characterised by an Oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb), numerous lakes exercise a mitigating influence, allowing the cultivation of typically Mediterranean crops (olives, citrus fruit).\n\nA peculiarity of the regional climate is the thick fog that covers the plains between October and February, especially in the central Po Plain. The east coast, from Romagna to Trieste is occasionally affected by the cold bora winds in winter and spring.\n\nThe coldest month is January: the Po valley's mean temperature is between −1–1 °C. Winter morning lows can occasionally reach −30 to −20 °C in the Alps and −14 to −8 °C in the Po valley. Summer is usually more stable with July temperatures are 22–24 °C north of river Po, like in Milan or Venice, and south of river Po can reach 24–25 °C like in Bologna.\n\nwhile the number of days with lows below 0 °C is usually from 60 to 90 a year, with peaks of 100–110 days in the mainly rural zones. In the colder winters, the Venice Lagoon may freeze, and in the coldest ones even enough to walk on the ice sheet.\n\nPrecipitation evenly distributed during the year, although the summer is usually slightly wetter. is more intense in the Prealpine zone, up to 1,500 to 2,000 mm annually, but is abundant also in the plains and Alpine zones, with an average of 600 to 850 mm annually. The total annual rainfall is on average 827 mm. Regione Lombardia. Retrieved 21 July 2015.\nSnow is quite common between early December and early March in cities like Turin, Milan and Bologna, but sometime it appears in late November or late March and even April. Both the Alps and the Apennine can see up to 500–1,000 cm of snow in a year at 2,000 m; on the highest peaks of the Alps, snow may fall even during mid summer, and glaciers are present.\n\nBecause of high industrialization and the lack of wind due to being closed between mountain ranges air pollution remains a severe problem in Northern Italy. Even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, in 2005 a team of researchers at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute reported that Northern Italy was one of Europe's most polluted areas in terms of smog and air pollution due to its climatic and geographic conditions, which cause the stagnation of pollutants.\n\nNorthern Italy is the most developed and productive area of the country, with one of the highest GDPs per capita in Europe. It was the first part of Italy to become industrialised in the last half of the 19th century; the so-called \"industrial triangle\" was formed by the manufacturing centres of Milan and Turin, as well as the seaport of Genoa. Since then, the industrial core of the area has shifted eastward; the current industrial triangle consists of Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna. A similar shift happened for GDP per capita, and the eastern regions (including Lombardy) have since become wealthier than Piedmont and Liguria. With a 2008 nominal GDP estimated at €772,676 million, Northern Italy accounts for 54.8% of the Italian economy, despite having just 45.8% of the population.\n\nThe most populous cities (with over 100,000 inhabitants) as of December 31, 2016, estimates were:\n"}

It has since \nspread to businesses and security services as a way to get educated about counter-terrorism and crime prevention, be the 'eyes and ears' for the police and be prepared for major emergency. The goal of the program is to bring together the police, fire brigade, ambulance services, private security industry and other government agencies in deterring, disrupting and support operations targeting terrorist and extremist activity.\n\nSince its inception, the program has spread across the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, South Africa and the United States.\n\nA complementary program called 'Project Argus' is also deployed across the United Kingdom. Project Argus focuses on \"preventing, handling and recovering from a terrorist attack.\" It takes participants through simulated but realistic terrorist attack for participants to learn what would likely happen in an attack, what are the priorities during an attack and to\nhave the necessary plans in place before an attack.\n\nThere are 3 components to this program: Awareness Day, Bridge Call and Response.\n\nThis is a one-day seminar where police members will attend to teach course participants various skills. Depending on jurisdiction, these may include: explosives, threats identification, crime scene preservation, bomb threat management, CBRN management, conflict resolution, reconnaissance, cordon management, crime reduction strategy and legal matters. Participants who finish the entire course will be presented with a certificate and their name entered into a register in case for a deployment.\n\nEvery week (or regular interval as determined by the police force), a conference call is placed for all participants to obtain any terrorism issues, crime or security issues. Generally speaking, these information are police intelligence information for registered participants only.\n\nIn the event of a major emergency or disaster, trained members will be deployed to support the police. They will be responsible for securing the cordon line and assist in evacuation if necessary. The response phrase differs from each jurisdiction as liability, health and insurance coverage differ.\n\nVictoria Police Counter-Terrorism and Emergency Management Division adopted the project model to train security officers in threat identification and increase awareness in terrorism. They may be called upon for emergency response in an event of a major incident such as a terrorist attack. These security officers will be responsible for access control and manning the police cordon lines.\n\nIn February 2009, Vancouver Police Department adopted the project from the United Kingdom. While similar in structure and function, the primary objective for the VPD is crime prevention and crime reduction instead of counter-terrorism. Private security firms, Community Policing Centre volunteers and other security screened groups will participate on this project to receive the latest crime information and to assist police in an event of a major disaster.\n\nTermed 'Project Guardian', private security guards are trained and volunteer their service in case of a major emergency when terrorist targets are likely to occur, such as Exercise Heartbeat. Singapore Police Force disseminates information to registered volunteers on any safety and security development around the country. In an event of a street fight, they will assist police in crowd control, traffic diversion, evacuation and cordon control.\n\nSouth African Police Service launched a pilot project in South Africa in 2007 to train private security in crowd control, securing crime scenes, reporting suspect vehicles, participate in weekly police briefings. Project participants will respond in an event of a major disaster. Unlike other jurisdictions, these security guards will also participate in a non-emergency situation. For example, they form part of the security plan for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nNew York City Police Department launched the program called 'NYPD SHIELD'. Shield \"is an umbrella program for a series of current and future Police Department initiatives that pertain to private sector security and counterterrorism. This is a public private partnership based on information sharing.\" This program, unlike other jurisdictions, only pertains to information sharing and not the physical intervention in other programs. It was thought information sharing between police and businesses will educate business signs to look for and their potential for being targeted while serving as NYPD's 'eyes and ears'.\n\n"}

{"id": "8215268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8215268", "title": "Religion in Scouting", "text": "Religion in Scouting\n\nReligion in Scouting and Guiding is an aspect of the Scout method that has been practiced differently and given different interpretations over the years.\n\nIn contrast to the Christian-only Boys' Brigade, which started two decades earlier, Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scout movement as a youth organization (with boys as 'Scouts' and girls as 'Guides'), which was independent of any single faith or religion, yet still held that spirituality and a belief in a higher power were key to the development of young people.\n\nScouting organizations are free to interpret the method as laid down by the founder. As the modern world has become more secular and as many societies have become more religiously diverse, this has caused misunderstandings and controversies in some of the national member organizations.\n\nWhen creating the Scouting method, Baden-Powell was adamant that there was a place for God within it.\n\nIn Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell wrote specifically about Christianity, since he was writing for youth groups in the United Kingdom:\nWe aim for the practice of Christianity in their everyday life and dealings, and not merely the profession of theology on Sundays…\nIndeed, the Scout Promise as originally written by Baden-Powell states that Scout does their \"duty to God\".\n\nHowever, the founder's position moved shortly after the Scout movement began to grow rapidly around the world, and his writings and speeches allowed for all religions. He did continue to emphasise that God was a part of a Scout's life, without dictating a particular faith:\nWhen asked where religion came into Scouting and Guiding, Baden-Powell replied, It does not come in at all. It is already there. It is a fundamental factor underlying Scouting and Guiding.\n\nThough we hold no brief for any one form of belief over another, we see a way to helping all by carrying the same principle into practice as is now being employed in other branches of education…\n\nTake a negative instance. A Mahommedan Guider comes to England and addresses a lot of Girl Guides on religion, in the course of which she quotes Mahomet as the one divine teacher. This in spite of the fact that her audience are believers in Christ. How would you regard her action? As tactless, as insulting, as fanatical? At any rate it wouldn't be exactly polite or in accordance with our laws of courtesy. Yet I have known Christian Guiders as well as Scouters do exactly the same thing with Jews or Hindoos or people of other beliefs present, and these on their part have sat under it, too polite to raise objections but none the less made uncomfortable by it. Once, at a mixed gathering at a 'Scout's Own' a speaker carefully avoided much reference to Christ and was accused by some there of 'denying Him'. His defence was that he was rather following Christ in that he was showing Christian deference to the feelings of others who, equally with himself, were sons of one Father, under whatever form they rendered homage to God.\nBaden-Powell's gravestone bears no cross or other religious symbol. Rather, in addition to the Boy Scout and Girl Guide Badges, it bears a circle with a dot in the centre, the trail sign for \"Going home\" / \"I have gone home\":   .\n\nReligion and spirituality is still a key part of the Scouting method. The two major world organizations have slightly different interpretations.\n\nThe World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) states the following in its \"Fundamental Principles\":\n\nThe World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) stated the following in the 21st World Conference in 1972:\n\nNational organizations may further define it. For instance, the current Religious Policy of The Scout Association of the United Kingdom states that:\n\nMany Scout/Guide groups are supported by local religious bodies, including Christian, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh communities. These local groups often have a more strict interpretation on the original writings of Baden-Powell concerning religion. However, since they often belong to national organizations that are not of a specific religion, there are usually groups in the neighbourhood that have a less strict interpretation.\n\nAdditionally, some national organizations are aimed at the adherents of a specific religion, but there usually are other Scouting/Guiding organizations within that country that are more open or have a more neutral point of view concerning religion.\n\nThe Scout Promise is easily adapted to accommodate these, and other, faiths. For example, in its section on the Girl Scout Promise and Law, the website of the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) includes a note that:\n\n\"Duty to God\" is a principle of worldwide Scouting and WOSM requires its member National Scout Organizations to reference \"duty to God\" in their Scout Promises (see WOSM Scout Promise requirements). Scouting associations apply this principle to their membership policies in different ways. There are Scouting associations in some countries, such as France and Denmark, that are segregated on the basis of religious belief.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in the United States has taken a hard-line position in the past, excluding atheists and agnostics. The BSA has come under strong criticism over the past years due to their religious policy and stance against agnostics and atheists:\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America has accepted Buddhist members and units since 1920, and also accepts members of various pantheistic faiths. Many Buddhists do not believe in a supreme being or creator deity, but because these beliefs are still religious and spiritual in nature, they are deemed acceptable by the BSA since their leaders subscribe to the BSA Declaration of Religious Principle.\n\nIn March of 2016, the BSA signed a new Memorandum of Understanding with the Unitarian Universalist Association after many years of separation. The MOU gives any Unitarian Universalist congregation the absolute authority over all phases of the program that affect the spiritual welfare of those who participate. The MOU specifically mentions Humanism and Earth-centered traditions as being acceptable faiths in Scouting programs chartered by Unitarian Universalist congregations. Since Humanist teachings specifically emphasize reliance on critical thinking and evidence over dogma and superstition, this MOU allows for atheist and agnostic members to join the BSA through Scout units chartered by Unitarian Universalist congregations. As part of the agreement in the MOU, the religious emblems developed by the Unitarian Universalist Association have been reinstated as of May, 2016.\n\nScouts Canada states that all Scouts have what's called a \"Duty to God\", defined as \"The responsibility to adhere to spiritual principles, and thus to the religion that expresses them, and to accept the duties therefrom\". Additionally, the Scout promises for each age group include references to God such as the Beaver promise: \"I promise to love God and help take care of the world.\" and the Scout/Venturer promise \"... To do my duty to God and the Queen ...\". Scouts Canada maintains that a spiritual element is required for membership.\n\nScouts Canada has a \"Religion in Life\" emblem that is awarded upon completion of a particular denomination's program by a Scout. In 2009, a \"Spirituality Award\" for Scouts and Guides who did not belong to any denomination was established.\n\nGirl Guides of Canada suggested a new version of their Promise that uses \"my beliefs\" instead of a direct references to God in 2009. The new Promise was approved in 2010.\n\nIn Australia, Scouting makes no effort to find out if potential child members are atheists or agnostics. One version of the Australian Scout promise contains \"duty to my god\" as opposed to \"duty to God\" used by many other countries, allowing each member to make an individual personal interpretation.\n\nIn 2012, the promise was reworded to have to \"develop my beliefs\" instead of a direct reference to God.\n\nThe Scout Association of the United Kingdom allows members of any religion, or no religion at all. Leaders, like all members, are not expected to be a member of any particular faith nor hold any religious belief of their own. They are, however, expected to abide by the Association's religious policy which promotes mutual acceptance of beliefs within the Movement such as by encouraging young Scouts to explore their own beliefs as well as making general provisions and considerations for members, such as giving them advice and guidance and allowing for the observance of religious practices within the Group. Previous to January 2014 it was necessary for all members of the Association to hold a faith, however this is no longer the case. Scouts of religions other than Christianity can choose from a selection of alternatively worded promises. Scouts of no religion can choose to make a promise that replaces \"duty to God\" with \"to uphold our Scout values\" followed by \"to do my duty to the Queen\". Any member making their Promise can choose which version of the Promise they wish to do.\n\nThe change in policy followed a consultation conducted in 2012 to gauge support among members for an alternate atheist Scout promise, removing the invocation of a deity. At the same time, the Guide Association, the parallel movement which began two years later, is to launch a consultation about its very similar promise, with views sought on all parts of the wording from early January. TSA UK chief commissioner Wayne Bulpitt said religion would remain \"a key element\" even if a new variant of the promise was approved. Julie Bentley, chief executive of the Guide Association, said its consultation would begin on 3 January.\n\nFrom 1 September 2013 Girl Guiding UK introduced a new promise, in which members promise ‘to be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ replacing ‘to love my God’ \n\nApproaches toward religion vary considerably in Scouting organizations not aligned with WOSM and WAGGGS. For example, the website of Camp Fire states \"We are inclusive, welcoming children, youth and adults regardless of race, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation or other aspect of diversity\". On the other hand, the American Heritage Girls are explicitly Christian and require all adult leaders to adhere to a specific Statement of Faith. Indeed, the AHG was founded by parents who did not agree with the Girl Scouts' decision to allow other words to be substituted for \"God\" in the Promise (see above) and the GSUSA's official lack of membership policies based on sexual preference.\n\nScout groups handle religious practices in different ways.\n\nSome Scouting organizations have many obligatorily religious merit badges as a way of fulfilling a requirement for a rank and others have a single voluntary religious merit badge or none at all. Scouting organizations may recognise religious programs run by other organizations, like the religious emblems programs in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn Austria, Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs is a member of both WOSM and WAGGGS.\nThe association is open to members without prejudice to birth, nationality, religion or belief. Both Promise and Law contain references to god.\n\nThere are chaplains on national level for Lutheran and for Roman Catholic groups and members, as well as a commissioner for spirituality on national level. There can be chaplains on council- and group-level. Some groups are attached to religious communities or parishes; but even these are open to members of all denominations or religions.\n\nThere are religious merit badges. Requirements for awards include religion and spirituality.\n\nIn Belgium, The association \"Les Scouts\" offers a neutral Promise text, with no mention to God. FOS Open Scouting replaced \"duty to God\" with \"loyal to a higher ideal\" in their promise. The SGP association (Scouts et Guides Pluralistes) offer that same text as an alternative to \"God\" or \"my religion\".\n\nScouting Ireland is a member of WOSM. The association is open to members without prejudice to birth, nationality, sexual orientation, religion or belief. The Law contains no reference to God and members are offered three alternative variants of the promise, one which refers to God a second requiring that the member do their best to further their understanding and acceptance of a Spiritual Reality, and a third to uphold Scout Principles.\n\nIn Jordan the units are affiliated with the International Union of Muslim Scouts.\n\nIn Malaysia Girl Guides working on their Bintang Anugerah Ketua Pesuruhjaya (Head Commissioner Award) must complete a requirement about their faith.\n\nIn Slovenia, Zveza tabornikov Slovenije is a member of WOSM. The guiding principles include plurality, openness to members without prejudice to birth, nationality, religion or belief; provided the member abides by the principles of pacifism, personal freedom, high moral and ethical principles and principles of the international Scouting movement. In the promise the reference to God is replaced with \"acceptance and development of Spiritual reality\". No religious merit badges are in use.\n\nA separate organization, Združenje slovenskih katoliških skavtinj in skavtov actively practices the Roman Catholic religion in its ranks. This organization is a member of WAGGGS. By agreement, the two organizations have a common highest level body and reciprocally provide to their members the benefits of membership in the two international organizations.\n\nAll members of The Scout Association are encouraged to:\n\nIf a Scout Group, Explorer Scout Unit or Scout Network is composed of members of several denominations or religions, the young people should be encouraged to attend services of their own form of religion.\n\nIn October 2012 an eleven-year-old atheist boy was denied entry to the Scouts in Somerset, England.\n\nAs of 1 January 2014, an alternative promise is available for those of no faith.\n\nThere are 2 activity badges relating to faith, one for exploring the members own faith (my faith) and another for learning about several other faiths (world faiths) however both of these badges are optional.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (BSA) celebrates Scout Sunday and Scout Sabbath in February, while the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) celebrates similar holidays, known as Girl Scout Sabbath, Girl Scout Shabbat, and Girl Scout Sunday, in March.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) includes Scouting as an official part of its religious program for boys and young men. The LDS Church was the first institutional sponsor of the BSA in the USA, and currently sponsors more BSA units than any other organization. On May 9, 2018, the BSA announced that the LDS Church had decided to cease chartering BSA troops after January 1, 2020.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America requires all Scouts to believe in a God or comparable higher power, but currently admits Scouts who are non-theistic Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus from non-theistic sectarian groups. The religious awards of all three faiths are recognized by The Boy Scouts of America. The Girl Scouts of the USA does not have any requirement of faith or belief, and admits girls of any or no religious belief or doctrine, regardless of the presence or absence of belief in a God or comparable higher power.\n\nBoth organizations require their members to recite a pledge that includes a reference to God; the BSA pledge requires a commitment to do their \"duty to God\", while the GSUSA pledge asks girls \"to serve God\". However, while GSUSA allows the elimination or substitution of \"God\" with an alternate word that represents a Scout's beliefs, BSA does not.\n\nIn Cub Scouting, each rank must complete a requirement about their faith. Additionally, members of the BSA's Scouting programs are eligible to work on their faith's religious emblem.\n\nCurrently, the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) has been the only religious emblems program, Religion in Life, to lose its BSA recognition. In 1992, the UUA stated its opposition to the BSA's policies on homosexuals, atheists, and agnostics; and in 1993, the UUA updated the Religion in Life program to include criticism of the BSA policies. In 1998, the BSA withdrew recognition of the Religion in Life program, stating that such information was incompatible with BSA programs. The UUA removed the material from their curriculum and the BSA renewed their recognition of the program. When the BSA found that the UUA was issuing supplemental material with the Religion in Life workbooks that included statements critical of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or personal religious viewpoint, the BSA's recognition was again withdrawn.\nOn March 24, 2016, the Boy Souts of America and the Unitarian Universalist Association signed an historic Memorandum of Understanding to provide guidance to UU congregations who wish to sponsor Boy Scout troops. This move towards re-establishing organizational ties is due to the BSA’s recent policy changes making scouting more inclusive to gay scouts and gay scout leaders. \n\nIn 1970, the Swedish Scout Promise was changed by Svenska Scoutförbundet from \"I promise to do my best in performing my duty to God and the motherland, helping others, and following the Scout Law.\" to \"I promise to do my best in following the Scout Law.\".\n\nA number of religions and denominations have formed international organizations within Scouting and Guiding that should further the spiritual development of their adherents. Most of these organizations employ two types of membership: individual and organizational.\n\nThe religious organizations include:\n\nICCS, DESMOS, IUMS, WBSB, IFJS, CPGS enjoy consultative status with the World Scout Committee, ICCG and CPGS with WAGGGS.\n\nA number of non-religious associations, mainly from French speaking countries, formed in 1996 the Union Internationale des Associations Scoutes-Guides Pluralistes/Laïques (UIPL; International Union of pluralist/secular Scout and Guide associations).\n\nThe Friends Committee on Scouting is a religious body of the Religious Society of Friends and serves Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, Scouts Canada, Girl Guides of Canada and Camp Fire.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1246762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1246762", "title": "Rywin affair", "text": "Rywin affair\n\nThe Rywin affair ( was a corruption scandal in Poland, which began in late 2002 while the post communist government of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) was in power. It is named after the prominent Polish film producer Lew Rywin, who was a key figure.\n\nOn 22 July 2002, Lew Rywin called in at the office of Adam Michnik, editor of Poland's largest daily newspaper, \"Gazeta Wyborcza\". Rywin offered to arrange, in exchange for a bribe of 17.5 million USD, a change in a draft law aimed at limiting the print media's influence on radio and television, which would have been in Michnik's favour – as the original draft would have prevented the paper's publishing house, Agora S.A. from taking over the private TV station Polsat or the second channel of Poland's public TV broadcaster TVP. Rywin said he was acting on behalf of what he called a \"group in power\" which wanted to remain anonymous but possibly included then prime minister Leszek Miller of the post-communist SLD.\n\nMichnik secretly recorded the conversation and started investigations to establish the identity of the \"group in power\". He also arranged a meeting between Miller, Rywin, and himself in Miller's office. When Miller denied any involvement in the deal Rywin had put forward, according to the other persons present, Rywin lost his composure and even spoke of committing suicide. Rywin himself later claimed to have been under the influence of alcohol.\n\nOnly after the \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" alleged investigations had remained inconclusive, on 27 December 2002 – half a year after the incident, which cast some doubts on the real role of the newspaper in the affair – the paper printed the partial record of Michnik's conversation with Rywin, thus starting the actual scandal. However other papers had reported parts of the story earlier (e.g. weekly magazine \"Wprost\")\n\nIn January 2003, the Polish parliament (Sejm) created a special committee to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of the affair.\n\nA separate penal prosecution resulted in Rywin being sentenced to two years in prison and a 100,000 PLN fine on 26 April for 2004 fraud, as the court concluded that the \"group in power\" did not exist and Rywin had been acting on his own initiative. On 10 December 2004, the Warsaw court of appeals repealed this sentence, sentencing Rywin to a reduced term of two years for \"paid protection\" on behalf of a still anonymous group.\n\nIn the meantime, the protracted hearings of the Sejm's special committee continued. On April 5, 2004 the Sejm committee officially finished proceedings. With a majority vote supported by the SLD and Samoobrona deputies to the committee, it adopted without prior discussion a final report which came to the same conclusion as the penal court - according to which Rywin had been acting completely on his own.\n\nHowever, the dissenting minority, including committee chairman Tomasz Nałęcz, refused to back the report and began to compile minority reports. The Sejm then had to decide whether to accept the committee's official final report or one of the various minority reports as the outcome of the investigation. On September 24, 2004, the Sejm unexpectedly voted to accept the minority report that most radically departed from the majority report and named the following persons as the masterminds behind Rywin's mission:\n\nThe long-term impact of the affair on Poland's political culture has yet to be fully assessed. Certainly, it has once more reinforced the Polish population's already deeply rooted traditional suspicion of the state and politicians. Well-known former dissident Adam Michnik's reputation has been damaged as he was suspected to be more deeply entangled in the scandal, although in what way remains unclear. His friendly relations with members of the former communist political establishment were exposed. This increased the numbers of Poles who are convinced that politicians and opinion-leaders are involved with the large-scale shadow economy.\n\nWhile people were certainly satisfied when high-ranking politicians were supposedly revealed as masterminds, this has also disenchanted even more people away from politics: On the one hand, the supposed delinquents deny all accusations and cannot be held accountable; on the other hand, it was quite obvious that the Sejm's acceptance of the minority report, which claimed the involvement of high-ranking politicians, had itself been due to some clever tactics of the interested opposition factions and a certain inattentiveness of the SLD. This created the impression that the opposition was not really interested in neutrally establishing the truth, either, but rather playing a power game of its own. \n\nThe one person who seems to have benefited the most from the affair was Jan Rokita, the representative of the largest opposition party Civic Platform (\"Platforma Obywatelska\") at the time and a member of the investigative committee, the hearings of which were broadcast live on TV. With his aggressive style of interrogation he made a name for himself as a tough investigator, thus establishing himself as the opposition's most important figure within a few months and at the time came to be considered as the most likely aspirant to the post of prime minister after a probable SLD election defeat in 2005. \n\nApart from that, the right-wing party Law and Justice (\"Prawo i Sprawiedliwość\"), whose defining themes are the fight against crime and corruption, had benefited from the affair, which contributed to raising its public profile. It was the party's deputy Zbigniew Ziobro who had authored the radical minority report the Sejm had passed.\n\nBy late 2004, however, the Rywin affair had already being overshadowed by another scandal, which could have even more far-reaching effects: The so-called Orlen affair (\"afera Orlenu\", \"Orlengate\") surrounding the privatization of the largely state-owned oil giant PKN Orlen.\n\nAgainst the background of these affairs, right-wing politicians, in particular from the Law and Justice party, began calling for an end to the post-1989 Third Republic, which they consider inherently weak, morally corrupt and controlled by cliques. Law and Justice presidential candidate Lech Kaczyński and eventual winner called a \"moral revolution\", it should be completely replaced with a Fourth Republic, a \"strong and moral state\".\n\nThe fallout from the Rywin affair contributed to the SLD's massive defeat at the 2005 parliamentary election. The SLD has never really recovered, and lost all of its remaining seats in 2015.\n"}

{"id": "13974002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13974002", "title": "Strategic urban planning", "text": "Strategic urban planning\n\nThe general objectives of strategic urban planning (SUP) include clarifying which city model is desired and working towards that goal, coordinating public and private efforts, channelling energy, adapting to new circumstances and improving the living conditions of the citizens affected.\n\nStrategic planning is a technique that has been applied to many facets of human activity; we have only to mention Sun Tzu, Arthur Thomson or Henry Mintzberg; however, the application of strategic planning to urban contexts, or cities, regions and other metropolitan areas is a relatively recent development whose beginnings were eminently practical and artistical: a mixture of thought, techniques and art or expertise.\n\nFifteen years of practice proved to be enough time for the technique to spread and for the first “Meeting of American and European cities for the Exchange of Experiences in Strategic Planning” to be organized. Institutions sponsoring the meeting, held in Barcelona in 1993, included the Inter-American Development Bank, the European Community Commission and the Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute. The cities of Amsterdam, Lisbon, Lille, Barcelona, Toronto and Santiago de Chile participated, among others.\n\nAt that meeting it was demonstrated, along with other relevant aspects, that if cooperative processes are used in large cities in order to carry out strategic planning processes, and if a reasonable degree of comprehension is reached between the administration, businesses and an ample representation of social agents, organizational synergies will develop that will eventually improve resource management and citizens’ quality of life.\n\nStrategic Urban Planning processes (SUP), also known as Urban Renewal Projects, began to appear at the end of the 20th century. The city of San Francisco (U.S.A.) carried out its process between 1982 and 1984. The main motivation behind starting strategic urban planning processes was the attempt to adequately react to problematic situations (mainly economic crisis or standstill). At the beginning of the 21st century, this kind of organization is not reactive but proactive. In the case of Spain, crisis situations are not the main causes of these processes, rather they are motivated by the search for an improved level of public-private cooperation, the wish to coordinate activity, continued improvements, the wish to launch revitalization processes and even to follow others . The initial determination needed to launch this type of processes varies by region; in Spain, most processes are fronted by public entities, approximately 50%, while a significant percentage has mixed public-private leadership.\n\nAn SUP process, according to Borja and Castells is:\n\n\"The definition of a city project that unifies diagnoses, specifies public and private actions and establishes a coherent mobilization framework for the cooperation of urban social actors. A participative process is a priority when defining contents, as this process will be the basis for the viability of the objectives and actions proposed. The result of the Strategic plan should not necessarily be the creation of regulations or a government program (although its adoption by the State and Local Government should mean the instigation of regulations, investment, administrative measures, policy initiatives, etc) but rather a policy contract between public institutions and civil society. For this reason, the process following the approval of the plan and the monitoring and implementation of measures or actions is just as or more important than the process of elaboration and consensual approval.\"\n\nSUP is now considered a type of Governance.\n\n\nThe social and economic importance of these processes is quite relevant as they affect millions of people . In Spain, there are nearly one hundred localities that use this methodology, affecting a total population of nearly 15 million people.\n\nSectors in the area of civic participation, as well as planning professionals and political activists have all expressed criticism of SUP processes.\n\nHowever, SUP processes include aspects that favour selective participation, territorial organization and coordination/cooperation between public and private sectors. On the other hand, Strategic Urban Planning processes seem to be independent of political ideologies (for example, the SUP processes in Barcelona , Bilbao and Valencia are carried out with mixed Government teams including the following Spanish political formations: PSC-PSOE , PNV and PP respectively) and can produce a notable degree of stability in the majority behind the project.\n\nKnowledge relating to strategic urban planning processes is evolving in two complementary directions that can be denominated, borrowing concepts from programming, as Bottom-Up and Top-down.\n\nThere are clear differences between what could be called the traditional approach to Strategic planning and the emerging approach (Fernández Güell. Strategic planning of cities).\n\nOf course, in 2006 there was a clear evolution that attempted to adapt to changes, political sensitivities and even trends. In any case, this is a line of thought and action that takes full advantage of the experience of projects that have already been implemented.\n\nGiven that:\n\nthis line of research seeks to further the design of a model that will determine the factors related to the success of strategic planning processes in large cities and metropolitan areas .\n\nWithin this branch of research, which seeks a more general theory, two recent Doctoral Theses mentioned in the bibliography can be consulted for further information.\n\nIt should be pointed out that a theory explaining Strategic Urban Planning in Metropolitan Areas and/or Regions would involve furthering the consolidation of Social Design as a scientific study.\n\n\n"}

It can help to prevent tooth decay and gum disease.\n\nChew sticks are twigs or roots of certain plants that are chewed until one end is frayed.

The earliest chew sticks have been dated to Babylonia in 3500 BC and an Egyptian tomb from 3000 BC; they are mentioned in Chinese records dating from 1600 BC and in the Tipitaka, the Buddhist Canon, purported to be giving account of events which took place in the north-western India around the 5th century BC.\n\nIn Africa, chew sticks are made from the tree \"Salvadora persica\", also known as the \"toothbrush tree\".\n\nIn Islam, this tree is traditionally used to create a chew stick called miswak, as frequently advocated for in the \"hadith\" (written traditions relating to the life of Muhammad).\n\nTraditional Sikhs still use datun today as it is written in their scriptures:\n\nTeeth cleaning twigs can be obtained from a variety of tree species.

Her first book, \"My Feudal Lord\" (1991), shocked the conservative Pakistani society because of the sensational exposure of her politically famous but abusive husband, Mustafa Khar.\n\nHer three-year tenure of service alongside Abdul Satar Edhi was transformational and life changing. It also resulted in her authoring his (narrated) autobiography, \"A Mirror to the Blind\" (1996). The influence of Edhi spurred her into social work and inspired her to establish the 'Tehmina Durrani Foundation', with a mission to further Edhi's way of \"humanitarianism\", and his vision of Pakistan as a Social Welfare State.\n\nAs of 2018, she is married to politician Shahbaz Sharif.\n\nTehmina Durrani, born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan, is the daughter of a former Governor of State Bank of Pakistan and Managing Director of Pakistan International Airlines, Shahkur Ullah Durrani. Tehmina Durrani's paternal grandfather was Major Muhammad Zaman Durrani. Tehmina's mother, Samina Durrani, is the daughter of Nawab Sir Liaqat Hayat Khan, the prime minister of the former princely state of Patiala. Sir Liaqat Hyat Khan's brother, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, was a pre-1947 Punjab Premier, a statesman and leader. \n\nAt seventeen, she married Anees Khan, and they had one daughter together. Durrani and Khan divorced in 1976. Durrani later married Ghulam Mustafa Khar, a former Chief Minister and Governor of Punjab. Khar had been married five times. Durrani and Khar had four children. After being abused by Khar for several years, she ended her marriage of fourteen years in divorce.\n\nIn 1991, Durrani wrote an autobiography titled \"My Feudal Lord\" alleging abuse by Khar. She argued in the book that the real power of feudal landlords, like Khar, is derived from the distorted version of Islam that is supported by the silence of women and of society as a whole.\n\nAs a reaction to her expository book, her family on both the paternal and maternal sides disowned her and her five children for thirteen years.\n\nIn the years after leaving her second husband, Khar, one prominent event was her hunger strike in 1993 against government corruption, and the newly coined term, 'accountability', came into being. After seven days she was admitted to hospital and it was only when the prime minister of Pakistan, Moin Quraishi, visited her to break her fast did she do so.\n\nAfter many years of political exposure through her ex-husband, Mustafa Khar, who was a political leader, and in her struggle against corruption, she realized that the answers she was seeking would not come through politicians. In her search for someone who was in touch with the problems of the common man, and who had found a solution, she found Pakistan's most celebrated humanitarian, Abdul Sattar Edhi.\n\nShe moved in with the Edhi family and spent three years serving at Edhi Homes in Mithadar, Sorab Goth, and Kharadar, Karachi. She became his apprentice, and also got his permission to author his autobiography. These years shadowing Edhi sahab were a thesis for the dissertation of the book. These years were perhaps her most transformational as they laid the seeds for her further work as well as her spiritual quest for truth. \"While I tied coffins to abandoned babies, stepped over corpses, and drove with him in a ‘peoples’ ambulance, I recorded the thoughts, inspirations, motives, observations, views and works of Pakistan's most revered and renowned social reformer.\" In 1994, ‘\"A Mirror to the Blind’\", Mr. Edhi's official ‘narrated’ autobiography, was endorsed and published by the Edhi Foundation. \n\nIn 2003, Durrani married thrice-elected Chief Minister of Punjab, Mian Shahbaz Sharif. They were married in a private ceremony in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Durrani resides in Lahore with her husband, who is a part of the politically prominent Sharif family, and the brother of Nawaz Sharif, the Ex- Prime Minister of Pakistan.\n\nIn June 1991, \"My Feudal Lord\" was released by Vanguard Books, a company owned by the journalists Najam Sethi and Jugnu Mohsin. Durrani denied she signed a contract vesting complete foreign rights with Mohsin rather than with herself and her estate. The dispute was settled in 1992.\n\nOn 19 May 1999, Durrani accused Sethi of stealing her book profits. She said, \"[his actions were] an even bigger case of hypocrisy than my experience with the feudal system.\" At the time, Sethi was being detained without charge by Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan) for his comments to a British Broadcasting Corporation news team about government corruption. Durrani sued Sethi for mental torture, and he countersued for defamation. A review of the book contracts by the English newspaper \"The Independent\" described Sethi as acting in good faith and described him and Mohsin as \"the injured party\".\n\nSince 2005, Durrani has supported the social rehabilitation of women. In 2001, Durrani cared for Fakhra Younus, a former wife of Bilal Khar, the son of Khar from his third marriage. Younus had been attacked with acid, allegedly by her husband. Durrani's arrangements to take Younus abroad captured media attention. Younus was denied a passport to leave Pakistan but under public pressure was later allowed to leave. Durrani engaged the Italian cosmetics firm Sant' Angelica and the government of Italy to treat Younus. Smile Again, an Italian NGO head by Clarice Felli entered Pakistan to assist in the care of mutilated women. Italian mother left Pakistan after falling out with the chapter run by Musarat Misba of Depilex over financial discrepancies. On 17 March 2012, Younus committed suicide in Italy and was buried in Karachi. Durrani received Younus' body draped in an Italian and a Pakistan flag.The funeral prayers for Younus took place at the Edhi centre in Kharadar. The 2012 Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Daniel Junge directed critically acclaimed documentary film \"Saving Face\" was made on Younus' life, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, among several other accolades.\n\nFounded in 2015, Tehmina Durrani Foundation (www.tehminadurranifoundation.org) officially launched it's activities in January, 2017. Tehmina Durrani explains, \"We are picking the mission of Edhi, where he left. His duty was to serve the humanity without distinction of caste and creed – and so is ours.”\n\nThe core ideas in its Mission and Vision are:\n\n\nHer most famous book, which was an overnight best seller and sensation in Pakistan as well as around the world. It is based on her life. Tehmina Durrani was born into one of Pakistan's most aristocratic families. Her parents married her to Anees Khan when she was seventeen and they had a daughter together. While married, she met Mutafa Khar, an eminent Pakistani politician, who along with Bhutto founded the PPP political party. Tehmina and Khar got married after she divorced, but their honeymoon period turned bitter very quickly. The intense and grotesque abuse is described vividly in her book with gory details. She was brave enough to expose her then famous husband publicly in an extremely conservative Pakistani Muslim society. She paid a heavy price for it because she was shunned by society and her own parents disowned her. Her rebellious nature also cost her losing all financial support from her ex-husband, as well as the custody of her children. It did make her search for answers for the position of women within Islam and made her stand up for women's rights. \n\nAs no publisher was willing to take the liability of such a controversial book, she initially printed it herself, and after it became a hot selling book, it was published by Vanguard books. \"My Feudal Lord\" has been translated into 40 languages and has received many awards.\n\nDurrani's second book, \"A Mirror to the Blind\", is the biography of Abdul Sattar Edhi, who was Pakistan's highly decorated social worker. Over a three-year period, Durrani lived in Edhi's home and accompanied him on his visits. The book was published in 1996 by the National Bureau of Publications with the Edhi Foundation. It is the official document Abdul Sattar Edhi's life and message.\n\nHer third book, \"Blasphemy\" (1998), was successful but also controversial. In the novel she describes the secret lives of the Muslim clergy and spiritual leaders or \"pirs\". Durrani said that the story is factual, with some names and events altered to protect the identity of the women who are at the center of the story. The book also delves into a critical approach to the tradition and practice of Nikah Halala. She describes several cases resulting in the humiliation and torture of Muslim women. The book also made it into Pakistan's best-seller list.\n\nDurrani's fourth book \"Happy Things in Sorrow Times\" (2013) is a novel based on the childhood and youth of an Afghan girl Rabia. The novel was published by Pakistani Publishing group Ferozsons. In contrast to Blasphemy that is based on the issue of domestic violence, Hypocrisy of religious figures in rural Sindh (Pakistan), and distortion of Islamic values, this novel explores the dynamics of Afghan politics in the pre/post 9/11. The setting of the novel is Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, the protagonist of the novel is an Afghan girl. The novel critiques interventions of Russia and America in Afghanistan. This is the first novel where Durrani uses her artwork as well.\n\nTehmina Durrani is also a painter. She says she found another way of expressing and conveying her feelings through art, in addition to writing.\n\nHer first exhibit, \"Catharsis\", was held in 1992. One of those paintings became the cover of her third book \"Blasphemy\".\n\nTehmina Durrani's next exhibit, \"A Love Affair\", took place in 2016. She will be intertwining her writing and painting in her coffee table book by the same name, \"A Love Affair\", with a print version of these paintings along with poems and songs that inspired her paintings.\n\n\n"}

It is the main language of the Tutong people, the majority ethnic group in the Tutong District of Brunei.\n\nTutong is an Austronesian language and belongs to the Rejang-Baram group of languages spoken in Brunei as well as Kalimantan, Indonesia, and Sarawak, Malaysia. Tutong is related to the Belait language and roughly 54% of the words come from a common root.\n\nToday, many speakers of Tutong are shifting away from the traditional language and code-mix or code-shift with Brunei Malay, Standard Malay and English. The language has been given a vitality rating of 2.5 based on a scale of 0-6 that uses the measures of the rate of transmission to future generations, the level of official support, and the geographical concentration of speakers. This means it is considered endangered.\n\nNonetheless, there is interest in revitalizing the language. Since 2012, a module has been taught in Tutong at Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD). Similarly, the \"Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka\" (Brunei's Language Agency) published a Tutong-Malay, Malay-Tutong dictionary in 1991 and a word list of several Brunei languages in 2011.\n\n"}

{"id": "23573818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23573818", "title": "White backlash", "text": "White backlash\n\nA white backlash is an actual or hypothetical negative response of white people to racial progress. It is typically discussed in the United States in regard to advancement of African Americans in American society, though it has been discussed in the context of other countries, including the United Kingdom.\n\nOne early example of a white backlash occurred when Hiram Rhodes Revels was elected to the United States Senate in 1870, becoming the first African-American to be so elected. The resulting backlash derailed the then-ongoing post-Civil War Reconstruction, which had attempted to build an interracial democracy.\n\nAmong the earliest high-profile examples of a white backlash in the United States was in 1964, after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Many Democrats in Congress, as well as President Lyndon B. Johnson himself, feared that such a backlash could develop in response to the legislation, and Martin Luther King, Jr. popularized the \"white backlash\" phrase and concept to warn of this possibility. The backlash that they warned about did ensue, and was based on the argument that whites' immigrant descendants did not receive the benefits that were given to African Americans in the Civil Rights Act. After signing the Civil Rights Act, Johnson grew concerned that the white backlash would cost him the 1964 general election later that year. Specifically, Johnson feared that his opponent, Barry Goldwater, would harness the backlash by highlighting the black riots engulfing the country at the time.\n\nA significant white backlash also resulted from the election of Barack Obama as the first black President of the United States in 2008. As a result, the term is often used to refer specifically to the backlash triggered by Obama's election. The election of Donald Trump as president in 2016 is often cited by critics as another example of white backlash. For example, CNN contributor Van Jones coined the term \"whitelash\" (a portmanteau of \"white\" and \"backlash\") to describe one of the reasons he thought that Trump won the 2016 election.\n\n"}
{"id": "46418619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46418619", "title": "Women in climate change", "text": "Women in climate change\n\nThe contributions of women in climate change have received increasing attention in the early 21st century. Feedback from women and the issues faced by women have been described as \"imperative\" by the United Nations and \"critical\" by the Population Reference Bureau. A report by the World Health Organization concluded that incorporating gender-based analysis would \"provide more effective climate change mitigation and adaptation.\"\n\nWomen have made major contributions to climate change research and policy and to broader analysis of global environmental issues. They include many women scientists as well as policy makers and activists. Women researchers have made significant contributions to major scientific assessments such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and are reasonably well represented on key global change committees of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and US National Academy of Sciences. Women have played important leadership roles in international climate policy. For example, Christiana Figueres leads the international climate negotiations as the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and former Irish President Mary Robinson is the UN Special Envoy on Climate Change. Susan Solomon chaired the climate science working group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment in 2007.\n\nWomen are generally underrepresented in science and have faced many barriers to their success and recognition. Following the scientific revolution in the 17th century European women became involved in observational science, including astronomy, natural history and weather observations although many universities would not admit women until the late 19th century.\n\nThe latest report from the US National Science Foundation shows that while women are now earning half of the undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, most of these are in the biosciences (especially pre-med) compared to physics, computer sciences and engineering (20%). In terms of doctorates, women are also only 20% of the engineering and physics PhDs. Although the proportion of women full professors in the US has doubled since 1993 women occupy less than 1/4 of senior faculty positions in science and engineering and women earn less than men at the same level.\n\nIt has been noted that women of color, indigenous women and women from the global south are even more likely to be overlooked, to be poorly represented in the academy and leadership. This is associated with a legacy of discrimination, lack of educational opportunities, language barriers, and a lack of effort to identify and cite them.\n\nWomen are underrepresented in key disciplines for the study of climate change. For example, women are a minority in the earth sciences where surveys reveal that less than 20% of meteorologists and geoscientists are women. A recent analysis of US atmospheric science doctoral programs reveals that women were 17% of tenure track and tenured faculty, with even smaller proportions at higher rank, and 53% of departments had two or fewer women faculty. Women are slightly better represented in the ecological sciences. One study reports that women are 55% of graduate students in ecology but only 1/3 of tenured faculty are women and that 3/4 of the articles in the flagship international journal - Ecology - are written by men. Women received proportionally less research funding and were less likely to be cited by their colleagues. Women members of the Ecological Society of America increased from 23% in 1992 to 37% in 2010.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization publishes data on women in science worldwide. Overall women are better represented as a share of total scientific researchers in Latin America, Oceania and Europe (30%+) and least in Asia (19%).\n\nIt is argued that when women are overlooked as scholars and decision makers the world fails to take advantage of its full human capacity, which is needed for issues as urgent as climate change. Women may also take more collaborative approaches, especially in negotiations, and may pay more attention to disadvantaged groups and to the natural environment.\n\nGender has become an issue because of women's essential roles in managing resources such as water, forests and energy and as women lead fights for environmental protection.\n\nA general concern has been expressed about the need to highlight the work of women and to include more women in major committees in order to provide gender balance, social justice, and inspiration to young women to enter careers in science. This reflects more general arguments about the barriers to women's advancement and the need for women to 'Lean in' to leadership positions (e.g. Lean In). \nThe outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development - the Future we Want - recognized the need to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in decision making and management and the need to increase women in leadership positions. A report prepared by UN Women, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, the Global Gender and Climate Alliance and the UNFCCC recognizes the structural inequalities that impede the representation of women in climate science, negotiations and policies and recommends greater gender balance in the UNFCCC and national delegations. The report argues that the 'challenges of climate change cannot be solved without empowering women' and that women have been marginalized in international negotiations. It reports data that show weak representation of women in the institutions of the UNFCCC including the Adaptation Committee (25%), the GEF Council (19%) and the Expert Group (15%) and that overall women constitute less than 20% of delegation heads and less than 30% of delegation members at UNFCCC conferences.\n\nA call for international science to pay greater attention to the inclusion of women scholars was made by Kate Raworth on Twitter and then in her article \"Must the Anthropocene be the Manthropocene?\" She pointed out that the working group of 36 scientists and scholars who convened in Berlin in 2014 to begin assessing evidence humanity was entering a new epoch, the Anthropocene, was composed almost entirely of men. She stated: \"Leading scientists may have the intellect to recognize that our planetary era is dominated by human activity, but they still seem oblivious to the fact that their own intellectual deliberations are bizarrely dominated by white northern male voices\".\n\nThere are a variety of ways to identify women who have made major contributions to climate change. The first is the list of authors of the high level international assessments for the UN and other organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The second is to examine women who have been invited to join the editorial boards of climate change refereed journals. A third is to look at the membership of the global change committees of the International Council for Science (ICSU). And a fourth is to recognize women that are members of their National Academy of Sciences who work on climate change. Many of them are IPCC or other report authors, and also members of ICSU committees, members of their National Academy and other marks of accomplishment.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some Zhmaryani lineages live in Afghanistan. They are Kasi Pashtuns.\n\nThe name \"Zimri\" or \"Zmarai\" means \"fierce tiger\" in the Pashto language. The history shows that one day at the place located in Musakhail city between the Sherani and Isot, the father of Zhmaryani had a fight with tigers in the mountains. After being victorious, the father of Musakhail gave him the honour \"Zmarai\" (lion), which means \"lion\" in Pashto. Zimri, Mizri, the same nation named changed due to the languages of different areas.\n\nRough estimates show their population to be more than 90,000–100,000.\n\nThey live in the Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces of Pakistan. In Balochistan, the name \"Zhmaryani\" is common, but in the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the name \"Gumoriani\" or \"Gumaryani\" is used. Some of them live in Sibi and they call themselves \"Mizri\". These migrations have occurred primarily due to tribal conflicts and financial instability in the region. They are living in the mountainous range associated with Hazrat Suleman. They live between Sherani and Isot tribes. The mountains on which they live are very fertile. These valleys are thought to be one of the most beautiful places in Balochistan Province. The Zhmaryani country is drained by small hills torrents: the Ramak and Guzai.\n\nZhmaryani are respectable and educated nation in Afghanistan as well as in Pakistan. Due to some clashes, Zhmaryani migrated from Musakhail to other cities of Pakistan like Loralai, and other countries of the world. Some of the Zhmaryani migrated from Musakhail to the Luni area in the way of Khulo.\n\nIn Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan they are living in the famous village of Pirpiai, also known as Little England due to its high literacy rate, Pashtun Ghari and Mohib Banda in Nowshera. The founding father of Pirpiai was the son of Daulat Khan. Daulat Khan was a commander and confidant of Nadir Shah Afshar, the ruler of Iran. Nadir Shah awarded the area to Daulat Khan, his confidant. Daulat Khan belonged to the Zhmaryani tribe.\n\n"}
