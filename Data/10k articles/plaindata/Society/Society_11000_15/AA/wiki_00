It is opposed to behaviorism; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. \n\nAnecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of Clever Hans, to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing animal cognition. In the case of Clever Hans, a horse was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding European politics, but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the horse, and that when he was removed from the room, the horse would not respond.\n\nAnecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that behaviorism would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.\n\n\n"}

Since the 1930s, the Bakoya, in particular, have settled in Gabon in the Ogooue-Ivindo Province, in the northeastern region of the country.\nSimilar minority groups are the Babongo and the Baka pygmies. Before they adapted to the agricultural practices in the new settlements in Gabon along the flanks of the road, Bakoya were “semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers” like the other forest-dwelling pygmies; they resided in small huts. The word 'Pygmee' is a French coinage, adopted by the Gabonese. They are the earliest inhabitants of the forest and are nomadic hunter gatherers.\n\nPygmies living in the Imbong village are specifically known as Bakoya. They are situated in the Ogooue-Ivindo Province, which is one of the nine provinces of Gabon. They are settled along the Mékambo to Mazingo (Canton Djoua) road and (Canton Djoua), and from Mékambo to Ekata (Canton Loué) road in the Zadié Department.\n\nFollowing the many internecine wars among the tribal groups of the region, the Bakoya, who were living on the banks of the Ogooué River migrated along with the non-pygmy group of Bongom to an upstream region of the Ivindo and Zadié Rivers. According to the oral traditions of the Bakoya, during their travel through the forests they accompanied the Bongom, a non-pygmie tribe. While the Bongom moved out of the forests and established themselves on the Mékambo-Mazingo Road by setting up the villages of Ego, Grand Itumbi, Ngunangu and Ibea, the Bakoya had stayed back in the forest to harvest their crops of \"u.panda\" (\"Panda oleosa\") and did not move to the Mékambo-Mazingo Road immediately. At this time the French who had colonized Gabon also created better living facilities.\n\nThe Bakoya, Baka and Babongo are three minorities groups of Gabon who are known as the “Pygmies of Gabon” (said to be the first people to inhabit the forests of Gabon) and they form a very small minority of a few thousand people only. All of them have left behind their hunter-gatherer vocation to more \"sedentary\" modern way of life. Their skills of hunting game with “bow and poisoned arrows, game traps and harpoons” are however much more skillful than the majority population of the Bantu community in the country. But their lot is subject to humiliation at the hands of the Bantus. However, in recent years there is an effort to project their history as a matter of tourism interest and their culture has been brought forth in the form of exhibitions, lectures and discussions. One such initiative was taken in 2002 when an exhibition was organized to project the history of pygmies and their culture.\n\nThe government of Gabon recognized the \"Minorités Autochtones Pygmées au Gabon\" (MINAPYGA; the Indigenous Pygmy Minorities of Gabon) organization of Bokayo in 1997, which is one of three such indigenous organizations in the country; the other two recognized groups are the \"Edzendgui\" and the \"Association pour le Developpement de la Culture des Peuples Pygmees du Gabon\".\n\nLeonard Odambo is one of the few well educated Bokayo who is a qualified journalist and head of an NGO in Libreville.\n\n"}

{"id": "10600687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10600687", "title": "Co-regulation", "text": "Co-regulation\n\nCo-regulation (or coregulation) is a term used in psychology, defined most broadly as a \"continuous unfolding of individual action that is susceptible to being continuously modified by the continuously changing actions of the partner\". An important aspect of this idea is that co-regulation cannot be reduced down to the behaviors or experiences of the individuals involved in the interaction. The interaction is a result of each participant repeatedly regulating the behavior of the other. It is a continuous and dynamic process, rather than the exchange of discrete information.\n\nCo-regulation is often applied in the context of emotions. In this sense, the emotions of each individual within a dyad are constantly in flux, depending on the emotions and behaviors of the partner. If emotion co-regulation is in effect, the result will be a decrease in overall emotional distress. A working definition of emotion co-regulation has been offered as \"a bidirectional linkage of oscillating emotional channels between partners, which contributes to emotional stability for both partners\". Emotion co-regulation is thoroughly studied in the context of early emotional development, often between infants and caregivers. It has also been studied in adult interpersonal interactions, with an emphasis on close, romantic relationships. One important note regarding co-regulation is that there may be an imbalance within the dyad, such that one member is more actively regulating the behavior of the other.\n\nThe following is an example of co-regulation between a mother and her infant, from \"Emotional Development: The Organization of Emotional Life in the Early Years\". This scenario exemplifies a mother maintaining her infant's engagement via variations in her voice, facial expressions, and body language. She sensitively elicits behaviors from the infant and adds more stimulation when appropriate. Likewise, the infant indicates and maintains the mutual engagement with her own facial expressions, vocalizations, and body language.\n\nDespite a history of studies on co-regulation, researchers have lacked a clear, operational definition of co-regulation. In a review of emotional co-regulation in close relationships, Butler and Randall proposed the following three criteria for determining the presence of co-regulation:\n\nCo-regulation has been identified as a critical precursor for emotional self-regulation. Infants have instinctive regulatory behaviors, such as gaze redirection, body re-positioning, self-soothing, distraction, problem solving, and venting, but the most effective way for an infant to regulate distress is to seek out help from a caregiver. Sensitive, reliable responses by the caregiver, over time, indicate to the infant that emotional distress is manageable, either with the help of a caregiver, or by strategies developed during past interactions with a caregiver. The strongest theoretical and empirical support for this phenomenon comes from research on attachment theory. Attachment has even been explicitly defined as \"the dyadic regulation of emotion\". The basic premise is that early biological and behavioral co-regulation from the caregiver facilitates the child's development of secure attachment which then promotes self-regulation. Drawing from John Bowlby's theory of \"internal working models\", young children develop mental representations of the caregiving relationship, as well as relationships more generally, through repeated interactions with the caregiver. Sensitive and consistent caregiving promotes the development of the expectation that emotional arousal is manageable via eliciting the support of the caregiver (or others) and/or with independent coping. Alternatively, Bowlby hypothesized that infants who experience insensitive and inconsistent caregiving are likely to develop the expectation that emotional needs will not be met by others or the self. Furthermore, in studies testing the statistical dependencies between parent and infant behaviors, researchers have found support for contingencies of eye gaze, facial expressions, prosody, speech rhythms, attention, and physiological arousal.\n\nIn infancy, co-regulation is primarily initiated and maintained by the caregiver, such that the caregiver is putting forth effort to soothe the child's emotional distress. Caregiver responses are calibrated to closely fit infant responses and elicit the next behavior. This effect has been called \"caregiver-guided dyadic regulation\". Co-regulatory interactions between parents and children become more balanced over time, as children develop emotion regulation strategies of their own. Caregivers of preschoolers, for example, take a more passive co-regulating role. They demonstrate willingness to assist with distress and availability when needed, but not over-involvement. Instead of more actively co-regulating, these parents are more likely than parents of younger children to give their children space to independently regulate, suggest regulation strategies, or facilitate more abstract discussions regarding emotional experiences and appropriate responses.\n\nCo-regulation has also been examined in the context of close adult relationships, though less so than in the parent-child context. Research studies conducted thus far provide preliminary support for the phenomenon. Similar to the evidence for co-regulation in childhood, this literature is often rooted in the attachment framework. As such, it works from the hypothesis that early experiences of co-regulation are internalized and guide expectations about and behavior within future close relationships. There, however, are several points of divergence between the child and adult literature on co-regulation. First, co-regulation in adult relationships is defined by reciprocity between partners, such that the responsibility to regulate the other is more or less equally split. Second, research on adult co-regulation is more likely to incorporate physiological measures. Indeed, physiological substrates involved in reward systems (e.g., oxytocin, opioids), are strongly activated by sexual contact, which is an added mechanism through which adults co-regulate. Third, animal models are commonly utilized in studies of co-regulation within adult dyads.\n\nDespite these differences, research findings on adult co-regulation thus far seem to extend the parent-child co-regulation findings. So far, researchers have evidence that adult partners' emotions oscillate in a coordinated pattern and that presence of one's spouse leads to stress reduction, and even more so for individuals in reportedly high quality marriages.\n\nExamples of co-regulating parent behaviors/caregiver-guided dyadic regulation:\n\nInclusion of physiological measurements of co-regulation is a relatively recent innovation in the psychological research. The underlying premise is that, similar to observable indicators of co-regulation, co-regulating partners' physiology will be bidirectionally linked and subsequently stabilized. Some of these biological measures may be more effective research tools than others. More rapidly fluctuating indices, such as autonomic responses, for example, are proposed to be more temporally sensitive measures of biological co-regulation.\n\nAs co-regulation is contingent on reciprocal relationships between members of a dyad, it can be compromised by risk factors within the individuals. As such, a newer line of research has identified children on the autism spectrum as a risk group for disruptions in co-regulation in their parent-child dyads. In the DSM-5, the first diagnostic criterion of ASD is \"Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts\" Thus, disruptions with co-regulation are inherent in the disorder, in that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in social-emotional reciprocity and sharing of emotions. Although only a handful of studies have directly examined co-regulation in parent-child with ASD dyads, converging evidence has demonstrated that parents' immediate responses to emotional distress facilitates self-regulation for children with ASD. One particularly interesting finding was that, while mothers of typically developing children transition to more passive co-regulation over toddlerhood, as their children become more independent self-regulators, mothers of children with ASD continued to use active co-regulation strategies throughout the duration of the study. The authors conjectured that this continuation was a reflection of the mothers' sensitivity to their children's heightened developmental needs.\n\n"}

The photograph, which is part of a series, shows 19-year-old Diana Bryant and her 2-year-old goddaughter Tiare Jones falling from the collapsed fire escape of a burning apartment building on Marlborough Street in Boston on July 22, 1975. The fire escape at the fifth floor collapsed as a turntable ladder on a fire engine was being extended to pick up the two at the height of approximately 50 feet (15 meters).\n\nThe photo was taken with a motorized camera and also shows falling potted plants. Other photos of the series show Bryant and Jones waiting for a turntable ladder and the moment of the fire escape's collapse with both victims on it. Originally published in the \"Boston Herald\", the photo circulated in over a hundred newspapers and led to the adoption of new fire escape legislation in the United States.\n\nThe tillerman of the first fire engine to arrive at the scene, Robert O'Neill, asked 19-year-old Bryant to lift her 2-year-old goddaughter Jones to him on the roof, but Bryant was unable to do so and O'Neill jumped down to help before the ladder could reach them. O'Neill had moved from the fire escape to the ladder just before the fire escape collapsed. Bryant and Jones fell approximately 50 feet (15 meters). Bryant sustained multiple head and body injuries and died hours later. Jones survived the fall as she had landed on Bryant's body, softening the impact. A helicopter pilot, Joe Green, who provided traffic reports and landed on a nearby roof, reportedly offered to pick up Bryant and Jones, but got no response from the firefighter.\n\nPolice obtained an arrest warrant for the building's owner, Fred Durham, for trash fires behind the building. A police complaint charged Durham with keeping an unlicensed lodging house. Three trash fires behind the building were reported in the weeks preceding the accident.\n\nRecalling the accident, Forman said he was about to leave the office of the \"Boston Herald\" when, after a call about a fire, he rushed to the scene, following one of the fire engines. Hearing yelling for a ladder truck, Forman ran to the back of the burning building, where he saw Diana Bryant and Tiare Jones on the fire escape. Because of the heat of the fire behind, Bryant and Jones were \"basically leaning\" at the point farthest from the building. Forman then took a position where he could photograph what he thought was \"an impending routine rescue\" in his own words. Following the fire escape collapse, Forman acknowledged: \"It dawned on me what was happening and I didn't want to see them hit the ground. I can still remember turning around and shaking\". Forman, however, noted he was unable to see the moment Bryant and Jones hit the ground \"as they fell behind a fence where the bins were\".\n\nThis photograph and others from the incident were originally published in the \"Boston Herald.\" Forman made a set of prints for the Associated Press, which provided worldwide distribution of the photos. Tear sheets on the photos were placed on 128 American newspapers and those in several foreign countries.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours, action was taken in Boston to improve the safety of all fire escapes in the city. Fire safety groups used the photos to promote similar efforts in other American cities.\n\n"}

Little research has been done on the Garachi, and most of what is known about them is based on the works of the 19th-century Russian scholars Kerope Patkanov and Jean-Marie Chopin.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the term \"Garachi\" is sometimes used to describe the Domari-speaking people of northern Iran, who were previously thought to be of Romani stock. The confusion is explained by the fact that both groups live in the regions populated mostly by Azeri-speakers who apply the word \"Garachi\" to all medieval collective migrants from the Indian subcontinent, including the Dom. For information on the Dom of Iran, see the article under Dom people.\n\nEven though the Garachi of Azerbaijan call themselves \"Dom\" (the name \"Garachi\" was given to them by the local population and derives from the Azeri word \"qara\" - \"black\" and the suffix \"-çı\" denoting the stem-word's function/occupation), they do not seem to share same origins with the Dom people. According to Jean-Marie Chopin, the Azerbaijani Garachi descend from the medieval Romani nomads of Central Asia. In 1944, Vasily Yan suggested that the Garachi of Azerbaijan and the Dom of Iran (sometimes referred to as the Garachi) differ in terms of their origins.\n\nIn 1887, Kerope Patkanov stated that the Garachi of the South Caucasus (then part of the Russian Empire) numbered 2,399 people living mostly in the Goychay uyezd (present-day Goychay, Ujar, Agsu, and Ismayilli rayons of Azerbaijan) and Nakhichevan. The largest Garachi settlement was named after them and is situated around 4 km southeast of Khacmaz town in Khachmaz region.\n\nTheir main occupation was the production of household items such as baskets, sieves and chewing gum made by men and sold by women in the neighbouring towns. Among other sources of income Patkanov lists fortune-telling and cattle larceny. Nomadic Garachi groups used to train animals and make street song-and-dance performances. This practice was described in the famous 1913 story \"Garaja giz\" by the Azeri writer Suleyman Sani Akhundov. The Garachi claim to adhere to Shia Islam but in reality are non-religious for the most part.\n\nPatkanov's analysis of the language of the Garachi (based on 101 common phrases) indicated that despite being Indo-Aryan, it is not mutually intelligible with any of the Romani or Domari dialects of the Balkans, Russia, or the Middle East. In addition to it, the Garachi observed by Patkanov spoke Azeri and sometimes Tat as a second and third language respectively.\n\nHere are four phrases in Garachi and Romani languages with translation.\nMost Garachis nowadays are settled and live in communities in Yevlakh, Agdash, Gakh, Khachmaz and Baku suburbs numbering altogether around 2,000 people.

{"id": "21672045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21672045", "title": "Human trafficking in Latvia", "text": "Human trafficking in Latvia\n\nLatvia is a source and destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Latvian women are trafficked to Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom for commercial sexual exploitation. Latvian women and teenage girls are also trafficked within the country for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from Latvia are trafficked to the United Kingdom for the purpose of forced labor. In addition, Latvia may be a destination country for victims trafficked from Thailand for the purpose of forced labor.\n\nThe Government of Latvia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued steps to improve victim assistance by increasing access to government funded protections. The government also demonstrated increased efforts to investigate forced labor offenses. It also made modest prevention efforts by taking initial steps to combat sex tourism committed by foreign visitors to Latvia.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2 Watchlist\" in 2017.\n\nThe Government of Latvia demonstrated sufficient law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Latvia prohibits all forms of trafficking through Section 154-1 and 154-2 of its Criminal Code, which prescribes penalties of three to 15 years’ imprisonment. These prescribed penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Latvia also uses non-trafficking-related laws to prosecute traffickers. Police performed 12 trafficking investigations under section 165-1, compared to 22 reported last year, and an additional 14 investigations under other sections—including nine investigations under section 154-1 involving alleged sex trafficking and two investigations involving alleged forced labor. Authorities prosecuted and convicted 21 traffickers under section 165-1, a decrease from 36 reported last year. The government also prosecuted and convicted an additional 15 traffickers under other sections of the law including seven under section 154-1, compared to none in 2006. At least five of the convicted traffickers served time in prison. During the reporting period, two traffickers were sentenced to five to 10 years’ imprisonment, two traffickers were sentenced to three to five years’ imprisonment, and one trafficker was sentenced to one to three years’ imprisonment. At the time of this report, the government was investigating the two cases of potential labor trafficking; however, to date, no one has been prosecuted, convicted, or sentenced for forced labor trafficking.\n\nThe government made some efforts to improve victim protection. The Ministry of Welfare provided $14,500 for the training of 271 social workers to improve the administration of victim assistance and rehabilitation services. Although the government allocated $98,000 for victim assistance in 2007, it spent only $23,000 – an increase from $10,000 spent in 2006. The government offers foreign victims legal alternatives to removal; victims who agree to assist law enforcement may apply for temporary residency and work permits. In 2007, one trafficking victim received a temporary residency permit. Latvia encouraged victims to participate in investigations against their traffickers. In June 2007, the government instituted a 30-day “reflection period” during which non-Latvian victims and their dependent children are eligible for government-funded assistance and rehabilitation services while deciding whether to cooperate with law enforcement. Government authorities and two NGOs may authorize victims to obtain government assistance; during the reporting period, 12 out of 27 identified victims qualified for and received government- funded assistance. The remaining 15 victims received assistance from non-government-funded NGOs. The government continued to provide training to law enforcement officers and specialists in orphan courts to identify victims of trafficking; however, the government referred 13 victims total to NGOs for assistance in 2007. The government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked.\n\nLatvia demonstrated modest efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. The Ministry of Family and Children’s Affairs continued to train professionals in contact with vulnerable populations to advise potential victims of the dangers of trafficking. The Latvian government reported no measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.\n\n"}

The design of the Crown of Dom Pedro II also replaced the design of the older diadem in flag and coat of arms of the Brazilian Empire, thus making the new Crown the official imperial Crown of the State.\n\nThe Crown of Dom Pedro I was simpler, having been quickly manufactured in 1822 for the Coronation of Brazil's first Emperor, just a few months after the declaration of the country's independence. \n\nWhen Brazil's second Emperor, Pedro II, was declared of age and preparations for his coronation began, the government saw the need to commission the manufacturing of a new crown.\n\nThe Crown of Dom Pedro II was created by the goldsmith Carlos Martin in Rio de Janeiro, and was first exhibited to the public on July 8, 1841, just days before the new monarch's Coronation that took place on July 18 of the same year.\n\nThe Crown's frame is made of quality 18 carat gold. Its circlet base supports eight imperial semi-arches, connected at the top by a golden monde, which in turn is surmounted by a jeweled cross, forming a globus cruciger. Inside the half-arches lies a dark-green velvet cap (matching the dark green colour of the top surface of the Emperor's robe). The Crown is set with 639 precious stones (all diamonds), and 77 pearls of 8 millimeters each. \n\nThis Crown weighs 1,9 kilograms, has a diameter of 205 millimeters and is 31 centimeters high. It is considered one of the most splendid works of Brazilian jewelry.\n\nAside from the Coronation Mass, it was customary for Brazilian Emperors to wear their crowns only twice a year, for the ceremonies of opening and closing the session of the Brazilian Imperial Parliament, when the Emperor appeared in full regalia to deliver his Speech from the Throne.\n\nUpon the abolition of the monarchy in 1889, the government of the newly proclaimed republic took possession of all items of the Imperial Regalia, but, unlike what happened upon the abolition of other monarchies, no item of the Crown Jewels was sold or destroyed. Since 1943, the Imperial Crown of Brazil and all other items of the regalia have been kept on permanent public exhibition at the Imperial Palace in the City of Petrópolis, now converted to the Imperial Museum of Brazil.\n\nBefore the inauguration of the Imperial Museum in 1943, the Imperial Crown and other items of the Brazilian Crown Jewels were kept under lock and key in possession of the Department of the Treasury.\n\nThe Imperial Crown is the property of the Brazilian State.\n\nIn the first years of the 21st century, Brazilian Jewellers \"Amsterdam Sauer\" created a replica of the original Imperial Crown of D. Pedro II. The creation of the replica, using 19th century techniques not employed nowadays, took 18 months. The replica is on display at Amsterdam Sauer's Museum of Gemstones and Rare Minerals in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe replica is heavier and larger than the original Crown. It weights 2,77 kilograms and is set with 596 stones totaling 911.84 carats.\n"}

The central figure of the story is an activist attempting to organize abused laborers in order to gain fair wages and working conditions.\n\nPrior to publication, Steinbeck wrote in a letter:\n\nThis is the first time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had anything to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.\nThe title is a reference to a passage from John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\":\n\nInnumerable force of Spirits armed,\nThat durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,\nHis utmost power with adverse power opposed\nIn dubious battle on the plains of Heaven\nAnd shook his throne. What though the field be lost?\nAll is not lost—the unconquerable will,\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\n\n\"In Dubious Battle\" deals with a fruit-workers' strike in a California valley and the attempts of labor unions to organize, lead, and provide for the striking pickers.\n\n\nOn publication, \"New York Times\" reviewer Fred T. March compared it to the \"genial gusto\" of the \"picaresque\" \"Tortilla Flat\". He commented that \"You would never know that \"In Dubious Battle\" was by the same John Steinbeck if the publishers did not tell you so.\" He called it \"courageous and desperately honest,\" \"the best labor and strike novel to come out of our contemporary economic and social unrest,\" and \"such a novel as Sinclair Lewis at his best might have done had he gone on with his projected labor novel...\"\n\nIn 1943, with Steinbeck now famous, Carlos Baker \"revalued\" the novel. He opened by saying \"Among Steinbeck's best novels, the least known is probably \"In Dubious Battle.\"\" Steinbeck, he said, \"is supremely interested in what happens to men's minds and hearts when they function, not as responsible, self-governing individuals, but as members of a group... Biologists have a word for this very important problem; they call it bionomics, or ecology.\" He said that \"Steinbeck's bionomic interest is visible in all that he has done, from \"Tortilla Flat\", in the middle Thirties, through his semi-biological \"Sea of Cortez,\" to his latest communiqués as a war correspondent in England.\" He characterized \"In Dubious Battle\" as \"an attempt to study a typical mid-depression strike in bionomic terms.\"\n\nIn 1958, critic Alfred Kazin referred to \"In Dubious Battle\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as \"his most powerful books,\" contrasting them with \"Cannery Row\" and \"The Wayward Bus\". President Barack Obama told the \"New York Times\" that it was his favorite book by Steinbeck.\n\nThe novel likely recounts a fruit worker strike that occurred in Tulare County, California.\n\nOn January 30, 2015, it was announced that James Franco would direct and star in a film version of the novel. The screenplay was written by Matt Rager and will be produced by AMBI Productions, Rabbit Bandini Productions, and That's Hollywood Productions. The film stars Nat Wolff in the lead role, along with Josh Hutcherson, Bryan Cranston, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris, Selena Gomez, and others. Principal photography began on March 19, 2015 in Atlanta and Bostwick, Georgia. Additional footage was shot in orchards West of Yakima, Washington September 27 and 28, 2015. The film was released in theaters in the United States on February 17, 2017.\n\n\n"}

The cell contained no food, water or bathroom facilities. Five days later when he was found, he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems. The incident touched off a national furor, resulting in several investigations and a $20 million claim filed against the DEA. The incident has been described as a \"Kafkaesque nightmare,\" a \"debacle,\" and \"one of the worst cases of its kind.\"\n\nAt the time of the incident Daniel Chong was a 23-year-old student at the University of California, San Diego, a senior majoring in engineering, who is originally from Cerritos in Los Angeles County. On April 20, 2012, he was at a friend's apartment in the University City neighborhood of San Diego, where he and his friends were celebrating the 4/20 holiday, a day that refers to cannabis usage. The apartment was raided early on the morning of April 21 by the DEA, which seized marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and 18,000 ecstasy pills, along with guns and ammunition. Chong and eight other people were transported to the DEA field office in the Kearny Mesa neighborhood of San Diego, where they were interrogated.\n\nSeven of the nine detainees were then taken to county jail, one was released, and Chong was accidentally left in a holding cell at the DEA office, according to the DEA. Chong says he was told that he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he would be released and even given a ride home. He was placed in a holding cell, his wrists bound in handcuffs. He was then left in the windowless cell for five days despite repeated cries for help. He could hear people walking around outside the room but could not get their attention. At one point the lights went off for several days. While locked up, he was starving and hallucinating. He claimed that, while incarcerated, he had to drink his own urine for hydration, and ingested some methamphetamine that he found under a blanket inside the cell in order to keep himself awake. In an apparent fugue state, he was found to have bitten the lens in his eyeglasses, carved the phrase \"sorry mom\" in his arm with the shards and swallowed the glass. By the time he was discovered on April 25, he was hallucinating and completely incoherent.\n\nUpon his discovery on April 25, Chong was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital in Serra Mesa where he remained for five days, including three in the intensive care unit. He was treated for various problems including dehydration, near-failure of his kidneys, and a perforated lung from eating broken glass. He was never charged with any crime.\n\nOn May 1 he came forward with his story, accompanied by his lawyer, who said he planned to file a claim against the federal government.\n\nChong has since returned to UC San Diego.\n\nOn May 2, DEA San Diego acting special agent-in-charge William R. Sherman issued a statement saying \"I am deeply troubled by the incident that occurred here last week. I extend my deepest apologies to the young man and want to express that this event is not indicative of the high standards that I hold my employees to. I have personally ordered an extensive review of our policies and procedures.\"\n\nSenator Barbara Boxer (Democrat of California) called for an \"immediate and thorough\" investigation of the matter by the Department of Justice. Representative Darrell Issa (Republican of California) demanded a congressional investigation. Representative Duncan D. Hunter (Republican of California) asked the DEA for a full account of the incident as well as a report on detention policies and the steps DEA is taking to address this and any other incidents.\n\nSan Diego NORML organized a protest outside the office at 4560 Viewridge Avenue on May 7, at 4:20. The student government at UCSD denounced the DEA over the incident and asked UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox to take a \"clear stand\" on Chong's treatment.\n\nAttorneys for Chong filed a $20 million claim against the Drug Enforcement Administration, claiming that Chong's treatment constituted torture under the law and seeking damages for pain and suffering, future medical and psychiatric treatment, and loss of future earnings. On July 30, 2013 it was reported that Chong had settled his claim against the DEA for $4.1 million. The DEA said it has introduced national detention standards including daily inspections and cameras in cells.\n\nOn July 8, 2014, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Justice Department issued a report on this case. The OIG said they intervened in the investigation because it appeared the local DEA office was investigating the matter on its own, contrary to protocol, and because at least two of the local agents who were investigating the case had been involved with Chong and thus had a conflict of interest. Among other findings, the OIG report (issued as an executive summary) said that Chong was seen or heard while trapped in the holding cell by four DEA agents, who did nothing because they assumed someone else was taking care of it. The report also charged that supervisors responded improperly and in a way that compromised any potential criminal prosecutions of agents at fault.\n\nThe DEA, via its Board of Professional Conduct, concluded its internal investigation of the incident in March 2015, punishing all six agents involved with letters of reprimand and additional suspensions of 5 and 7 days, respectively, without pay, for two of them. Chong's lawyer, Gene Iredale, has expressed his disappointment over the punishments, labeling them \"insufficient,\" a sentiment echoed by many lawmakers and administrators, including Congressman Ted Lieu (D-Los Angeles), who has called for a civil rights investigation into the case. The Department of Justice, in a letter to Congress, has also articulated its dismay, stating that such incommensurate penalties are symptomatic of institutional inadequacies with the DEA \"disciplinary process\" and promising forthcoming recommendations for its improvement. Congress has also vowed rectification of said process by giving the DEA \"administrator more authority over civil service disciplinary rules;\" DEA officials have blamed this lack of authority for their Agency's history of inadequately disciplining and punishing its employees. These concerns and promises voiced, however, only target improvements to the DEA's disciplinary process to punish employees for incidences, like that experienced by Chong, after the fact and not to any potential systemic problems that allow them to happen in the first place. These latter issues, DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne assures, have been fixed, and such an assurance appears to have placated most lawmakers and administrators for now.\n\n"}

It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as \"Hurentag\" (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the \"Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual\", the International Day of the Sex Worker.\n\nIn the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, sex workers in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.\n\nThe police cleared the church after eight days.

{"id": "3880193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3880193", "title": "Kaiserpfalz", "text": "Kaiserpfalz\n\nThe term Kaiserpfalz (, \"imperial palace\") or Königspfalz (, \"royal palace\", from Middle High German \"phal[en]ze\" to Old High German \"phalanza\" from Middle Latin \"palatia\" [plural] to Latin \"palatium\" \"palace\") refers to a number of castles and palaces across the Holy Roman Empire that served as temporary, secondary seats of power for the Holy Roman Emperor in the Early and High Middle Ages. The term was also used more rarely for a bishop who, as a territorial lord (\"Landesherr\"), had to provide the king and his entourage with board and lodging, a duty referred to as \"Gastungspflicht\".\n\n\"Kaiserpfalz\" is a German word that is a combination of \"Kaiser\", meaning \"emperor\", which is derived from \"caesar\"; and \"Pfalz\", meaning \"palace\", and itself derived from the Latin \"palatium\", meaning the same (see palace). Likewise \"Königspfalz\" is a combination of \"König\", \"king\", and \"Pfalz\", meaning \"royal palace\".\n\nLike their peers in France and England, the medieval emperors of the Holy Roman Empire did not rule from a capital city, but had to maintain personal contact with their vassals on the ground. This was so-called \"itinerant kingship\"; a sort of \"travelling kingdom\" (\"Reisekönigtum\"). Because \"pfalzen\" were built and used by the king as a ruler within the Holy Roman Empire (\"rex Romanorum (Römischer König)\"), the correct historical term is \"Königspfalz\" or \"royal palace\". The term \"Kaiserpfalz\" is a 19th-century appellation that overlooks the fact that the king did not bear the title of the Roman Emperor (granted by the Pope) until after his imperial coronation. Unlike a \"pfalz\", where the itinerant ruler enacted his sovereign duties, a royal estate or \"Königshof\" is only an economic estate owned by the king, which was only occasionally used by the king on his itinerary.\n\nUnlike the common notion of \"palace\", a \"pfalz\" was not a permanent residence but a place where the emperor stayed for a certain time, usually less than a year; itineraries suggest that the monarch rarely would stay for longer than a few weeks. Moreover, they were not always grand palaces in the accepted sense: some were small castles or fortified hunting lodges, such as Bodfeld in the Harz. But in the main they were large manor houses (\"Gutshöfe\"), that offered catering and accommodation for the king and his many retainers, often running to hundreds of staff, as well as numerous guests and their horses. In Latin, such a royal manor was known as a \"villa regia\" or \"curtis regia.\" They were located either near the bishop's residences, near important abbeys, near towns the king held or in the countryside in the middle of royal estates. \"Pfalzen\" were generally built at intervals of 30 kilometres, which represented a day's journey by horse at that time.\n\nAt a minimum, a \"pfalz\" consisted of a \"palas\" with its Great Hall or \"Aula Regia\", an imperial chapel (\"Pfalzkapelle\") and an estate (\"Gutshof\"). It was here that kings and emperors carried out the business of state, held their imperial court sessions and celebrated important church festivals. Each was administered by a count palatine, who executed jurisdiction in the emperor's stead. One of the most important of them would eventually rise to the title of Prince-elector.\n\nThe \"pfalzen\" that the rulers visited varied depending on their function. Especially important were those palaces in which the kings spent the winter (winter palaces or \"Winterpfalzen\"), and the festival palaces (\"Festtagspfalzen\"), Easter being the most important and celebrated at Easter palaces (\"Osterpfalzen\").\n\nThe larger palaces were often in towns that had special rights (e.g. imperial immediacy), but could also be bishop's seats or imperial abbeys.\n\nIn the Hohenstaufen era of the Roman-German kingdom, important imperial princes began to demonstrate their claims to power by building their own \"pfalzen\". Important examples of these include Henry the Lion's Dankwarderode Castle in Brunswick and the Wartburg above Eisenach in Thuringia.

The FIA conducted raids in various parts of Karachi detained more than 12 people including Munaf Kalia, and ten officials of the National Database Registration Authority suspected of providing counterfeit identity cards.

{"id": "448564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448564", "title": "Pardo Brazilians", "text": "Pardo Brazilians\n\nIn Brazil, Pardo ( or ) is an ethnic/skin color category used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in the Brazilian censuses. The term \"pardo\" is a complex one, more commonly used to refer to Brazilians of mixed ethnic ancestries. Pardo Brazilians represent a wide range of skin colours and backgrounds. They are typically a mixture of white Brazilian, Afro-Brazilian and Native Brazilian.\n\nThe other categories are \"branco\" (\"white\"), \"preto\" (\"black\"), \"amarelo\" (\"yellow\", meaning East Asians), and \"indígena\" (\"indigene\" or \"indigenous person\", meaning Amerindians). The term was and is still popular in Brazil.\n\nPardo was also a \"casta\" classification used in Colonial Spanish America from the 16th to 19th centuries. The term \"pardo\" was used primarily in small areas of Spanish America whose economy was based on slavery during the Spanish colonization period. \n\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), \"pardo\" is a broad classification that encompasses Multiracial Brazilians such as \"mulatos\" and \"cafuzos\", as well as assimilated Amerindians known as \"caboclos\", mixed with Europeans or not. The term \"pardo\" was first used in a Brazilian census in 1872. The following census, in 1890, replaced the word \"pardo\" by \"mestiço\" (that of mixed origins). The censuses of 1900 and 1920 did not ask about race, arguing that \"the answers largely hid the truth\".\n\nIn Brazil the word \"pardo\" has had a general meaning since the beginning of the colonization. In the famous letter by Pero Vaz de Caminha, for example, in which Brazil was first described by the Portuguese, the Native Americans were called \"pardo\": \"Pardo, naked, without clothing\".\n\nA reading of colonial wills and testaments also shows it. Diogo de Vasconcelos, a widely known historian from Minas Gerais, mentions, for example, the story of Andresa de Castilhos. According to the information from the 18th century, Andresa de Castilhos was thus described: \"I declare that Andresa de Castilhos, pardo woman ... has been freed ... is a descendant of the natives of the land ... I declare that Andresa de Castilhos is the daughter of a white man and a native woman\".\n\nThe historian Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende also explains that the word pardo was employed to name people with native ancestry or even Native Americans themselves: a Manoel, natural son of Ana carijó, was baptised as 'pardo'; in Campanha several Native Americans were classified as 'pardo'; the natives João Ferreira, Joana Rodriges and Andreza Pedrosa, for example, were named 'freed pardo'; a Damaso called himself 'freed pardo' of the 'native of the land'; etc.\n\nAccording to Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende, the growth of the pardo population in Brazil includes the descendants of natives and not only those of African descent: \"the growth of the 'pardo' segment had not only to do with the descendants of Africans, but also with the descendants of the natives, in particular the carijós and bastards, included in the condition of 'pardo'\".\n\nThe American historian Muriel Nazzari specifically pointed out the \"pardo\" category absorbed those of Native American descent in São Paulo: \"This paper seeks to demonstrate that, though many Indians and mestizos did migrate, those who remained in São Paulo came to be classified as pardos\"\nThe question about race reappeared in the 1940 census. In this census, \"pardo\" was not given as an option, but if the answer was different from the options \"white\", \"black\" and \"yellow\", a horizontal line was drawn into the \"colour\" box. When the census data came to be tabulated, all responses with horizontal lines were collected into the single category of \"pardo\". The term \"pardo\" was not used as an option as an assurance to the public that census data would not be used for discriminatory purposes, as a result of rising European racism at the time. In the 1950 census, \"pardo\" was actually added as a choice of answer. This trend remains, with the exception of the 1970 census, which also did not ask about race.\n\nThe 20th century saw a large growth of the \"pardo\" population. In 1940, 21.2% of Brazilians were classified as \"pardos\". In 2000, they had increased to 38.5% of the population. This is only partially due to the continuous process of miscegenation in the Brazilian population. Races are molded in accordance with perceptions and ideologies prevalent at each historical moment. In the 20th century, a significant part of the Brazilians who used to self-report as Black in earlier censuses chose to move to the Pardo category. Also a significant part of the population that used to self-report as white also moved to the Pardo category with the growing racial and social awareness, and Magnoli describes this phenomenon as the \"pardização\" (\"pardoization\") of Brazil.\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study (the autosomal study is about the sum of the ancestors of a person, unlike mtDNA or yDNA haplogroup studies, which cover only one single line), the \"pardos\" in Rio de Janeiro were found to be predominantly European, at roughly 70% (see table). The geneticist Sérgio Pena criticised foreign scholar Edward Telles for lumping \"blacks\" and \"pardos\" in the same category, given the predominantly European ancestry of the \"pardos\" throughout Brazil. According to him, \"the autosomal genetic analysis that we have performed in non-related individuals from Rio de Janeiro shows that it does not make any sense to put \"blacks\" and \"pardos\" in the same category\".\n\nAnother autosomal DNA study has confirmed that the European ancestry is dominant throughout in the Brazilian population, regardless of complexion, \"pardos\" included. \"A new portrayal of each ethnic contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine 'American Journal of Human Biology' by a team from the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, as has been shown in previous studies\". \"Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. The Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, \"with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085)\". The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bio-anthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.\" It is important to note that \"the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: \"the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although \"likely to be leaning slightly towards the ‘‘pardo’’ group\"\".\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the \"pardos\" there were found to be on average over 80% European, and the \"whites\" (who thought of themselves as \"very mixed\") were found out to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. \"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry\", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The \"pardos\" for example thought of themselves as 1/3 European, 1/3 African and 1/3 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry was determined to be at over 80% European.\n\nAn autosomal study from 2011 (with nearly almost 1000 samples from all over the country, \"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\") has also concluded that European ancestry is the predominant ancestry in Brazil, accounting for nearly 70% of the ancestry of the population. \"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The \"pardos\" included were found to be predominantly European in ancestry on average. The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.\n\nThe formation of the Brazilian people is marked by a mixture of whites, blacks and Indians. According to geneticist Sérgio Pena \"with the exception of immigrants of first or second generation, there is no Brazilian who does not carry a bit of African and Amerindian genetic\". \"The correlation between color and genomic ancestry is imperfect: at the individual level one cannot safely predict the skin color of a person from his/her level of European, African and Amerindian ancestry nor the opposite. Regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a high degree of European ancestry. Also, regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a significant degree of African ancestry. Finally, most Brazilians have a significant and very uniform degree of Amerindian ancestry.\n\nThe high ancestral variability observed in whites and blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes\" (geneticist Sérgio Pena). The colonization of Brazil was characterised by a small proportion of women among the settlers. As there was a male predominance in the European contingent present in Brazil, most sexual partners of those settlers were, initially, Amerindian or African women, and, later, mixed-race women. This sexual asymmetry is marked on the genetics of the Brazilian people, regardless of skin color: there is a predominance of European Y chromosomes, and of Amerindian and African MtDNA. Haplogroup frequencies do not determine phenotype nor admixture. They are very general genetic snapshots, primarily useful in examining past population group migratory patterns. Only autosomal DNA testing can reveal admixture structures, since it analyses millions of alleles from both maternal and paternal sides. Contrary to yDNA or mtDNA, which are focused on one single lineage (paternal or maternal) the autosomal DNA studies profile the whole ancestry of a given individual, being more accurate in describing the complex patterns of ancestry in a given place. In the Brazilian \"white\" and \"pardos\" the autosomal ancestry (the sum of the ancestors of a given individual) tends to be largely European, with often a non-European mtDNA (which points to a non-European ancestor somewhere up the maternal line), which is explained by the women marrying newly arrived colonists, during the formation of the Brazilian people.\n\nIn the first century of colonization, there was generalised interbreeding between Portuguese males and Amerindian females in Brazil. However, the Amerindian population was decimated by epidemics, wars and slavery. Since 1550, African slaves began to be brought to Brazil in large numbers. Miscegenation between Portuguese males and African females was common. European and Asiatic immigrants who came to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries (Portuguese, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Arab, Japanese, etc.) also participated in the process. Among many of the immigrant groups in Brazil, there was a large predominance of men.\n\nIn all Brazilian regions European, African and Amerindian genetic markers are found in the local populations, even though the proportion of each varies from region to region and from individual to individual. However most regions showed basically the same structure, a greater European contribution to the population, followed by African and Native American contributions: \"Some people had the vision Brazil was a heterogeneous mosaic. ... Our study proves Brazil is a lot more integrated than some expected\". Brazilian homogeneity is, therefore, greater within regions than between them:\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1,300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a pred. degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).\n\nNot all descendants of this mixture of peoples are included in the \"pardo\" category. Since racial classifications in Brazil are based on phenotype, rather than ancestry, a large part of the self-reported white population has African and Amerindian ancestors, as well as a great part of the Black population has large European and Native American contributions. Besides skin color, there are social factors that influence the racial classifications in Brazil, such as social class, wealth, racial prejudice and stigma of being Black, Mulatto or Amerindian.\n\nThe following are the results for the different Brazilian censuses, since 1872:\n\nPardos have made a minor impact in the Brazilian political arena largely dominated by whites. Nilo Peçanha, who was disputably the only mulatto president of Brazil. Former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso also had some African ancestry and described himself as \"slightly mulatto\" and allegedly said he has \"a foot in the kitchen\" (a nod to 19th century Brazilian domestic slavery).\n\nSince the end of the military dictatorship, the political participation of pardos has increased. Former Senator Marina Silva is a descendant of Portuguese and black African ancestors in both her maternal and paternal lines.\n\nMany important names of Brazilian literature are or have been pardos. Machado de Assis, generally considered the most important Brazilian fictional writer, was himself \"pardo\". Other remarkable writers include: Lima Barreto, novelist, master of satyre and sarcasm, and pioneer of social criticism; João Ubaldo Ribeiro, novelist and short story writer; João do Rio, journalist; Paulo Leminski, poet.\n\nOther remarkable artists include Father José Maurício Nunes Garcia (baroque conductor and composer), or Aleijadinho (outstanding sculptor and architect) attained high prestige as artists, as did symbolist poet of refined inspiration, Lima Barreto, novelist, master of satire and sarcasm, pioneer of social criticism.\n\nIt is in popular music, however, that the talents of pardos (along with Afro Brazilians, an even more disenfranchised group) found the most fertile ground for their development. Some of the examples include Pixinguinha, Chiquinha Gonzaga and Lupicínio Rodrigues \n\nAnother field where \"pardos\" have excelled is football: Ronaldo, popularly dubbed \"the phenomenon\", is considered by experts and fans to be one of the greatest football players of all time., Arthur Friedenreich, Ademir da Guia, Romário are well known historic names of Brazilian Football.\n\nImportant athletes in other sports include Daiane dos Santos (gymnastics), known for the invention of original movements, Alex Garcia (basketball), who played in the NBA, etc.\n\nIn daily usage, Brazilians use the ambiguous term \"moreno\", a word that means \"dark-skinned\", \"dark-haired\", \"tawny\", \"swarthy\", \"Brown\" (when referring to people), \"suntanned\". \"Moreno\" is often used as an intermediate colour category, similar to \"pardo\", but its meaning is significantly broader, including people who self identify as black, white, Asian and Amerindian in the IBGE classification system. In a 1995 survey, 32% of the population self-identified as \"moreno\", with a further 6% self-identifying as \"moreno claro\" (\"light brown\"), and 7% self-identified as \"pardo\". Telles describes both classifications as \"biologically invalid\", but sociologically significant.\n\nThe Brazilian regions by percent of \"pardo\" people.\n\n2009 data:\n\n\nAccording to IBGE's data for 2009, of the ten states with greatest percentual \"pardo\" population, five were in the North and five in the Northeast.\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, together with the Federal District moved to the group of majoritarily non-white states, of which \"pardos\" are very likely to be the new majority if trends continue as they perform the greatest non-white group in all Brazilian states. The next to be minority-majority is probably Mato Grosso do Sul (51.78% white), followed by Rio de Janeiro (54.25% white). The four southernmost states were all >70% white in the 20th century, nevertheless in the last 2010 census São Paulo turned to be almost exactly 70.0% white, and according to the contemporary demographic trends it is likely to be less than 70% now.\n\nIt should be pointed out that self-identification and ancestry don't correlate well in Brazil. A predominantly self identified \"pardo\" state like Goiás turned out to be mostly European in ancestry according to an autosomal study from the UnB undertaken in 2008. According to that study, the ancestral composition of Goiás is 83,70% European, 13,30% African and 3,0% Native American.\n\nIn Fortaleza, for example, both \"whites\" and \"pardos\" displayed a similar ancestral composition, according to a 2011 autosomal study: a predominant degree of European ancestry (>70%) was found out, with minor but important African and Native American contributions.\n\nIBGE's data for 2000. Of the ten municipalities with the greatest percentual \"pardo\" population, eight were in the Northeast and two in the North.\n\n\n"}

The White, non-Hispanic or Latino population make up 61.3% of the nation's total, with the total White population (including White Hispanics and Latinos) being 76.9%.\n\nWhite Americans are the majority in every census-defined region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and in every state except Hawaii, but contribute the highest proportion of the population in the Midwestern United States, at 85% per the Population Estimates Program (PEP), or 83% per the American Community Survey (ACS). Non-Hispanic Whites make up 79% of the Midwest's population, the highest ratio of any region. However, 35% of White Americans (whether all White Americans or non-Hispanic/Latino only) live in the South, the most of any region.\n\n55% of the African American population lives in the South. A plurality or majority of the other official groups reside in the West. The latter region is home to 42% of Hispanic and Latino Americans, 46% of Asian Americans, 48% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 68% of Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 37% of the \"two or more races\" population (Multiracial Americans), and 46% of those self-designated as \"some other race\".\n\nIn the 2000 Census and subsequent United States Census Bureau surveys, Americans self-described as belonging to these racial groups:\n\nEach person has two identifying attributes, racial identity and whether or not they are of Hispanic ethnicity. These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They have been changed from one census to another, and the racial categories include both \"racial\" and national-origin groups.\n\nIn 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the US Department of Labor finalized its update of the EEO-1 report format and guidelines to come into an effect on September 30, 2007. In particular, this update concerns the definitions of racial/ethnic categories.\n\nThe question on Hispanic or Latino origin is separate from the question on race. Hispanic and Latino Americans have ethnic origins in the countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula. Latin American countries are, like the United States, racially diverse. Consequently, no separate racial category exists for Hispanic and Latino Americans, as they do not constitute a race, nor a national group. When responding to the race question on the census form, each person is asked to choose from among the same racial categories as all Americans, and are included in the numbers reported for those races.\n\nEach racial category may contain Non-Hispanic or Latino and Hispanic or Latino Americans. For example: the White (European-American) race category contains Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites (see White Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Black or African-American category contains Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic Blacks (see Black Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Asian-American category contains Non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanic Asians (see Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans); and likewise for all the other categories. See the section on Hispanic and Latino Americans in this article.\n\nSelf-identifying as both Hispanic or Latino \"and\" not Hispanic or Latino is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly prohibited.\n\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, Africans and Europeans were considered to belong to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, their social circle (how they lived), and their known non-White ancestry. History played a part, as persons with known slave ancestors were assumed to be African (or, in later usage, black), regardless of whether they also had European ancestry.\n\nThe differences between how Native American and Black identities are defined today (blood quantum versus one-drop and political assumptions) have been based on different historical circumstances. According to the anthropologist Gerald Sider, such racial designations were a means to concentrate power, wealth, privilege and land in the hands of Whites in a society of White hegemony and privilege (Sider 1996; see also Fields 1990). The differences had little to do with biology and more to do with the history of slavery and its racism, and specific forms of White supremacy (the social, geopolitical and economic agendas of dominant Whites \"vis-à-vis\" subordinate Blacks and Native Americans). They related especially to the different social places which Blacks and Amerindians occupied in White-dominated 19th-century America. Sider suggests that the blood quantum definition of Native American identity enabled mixed-race Whites to acquire Amerindian lands during the allotment process. The one-drop rule of Black identity, enforced legally in the early 20th century, enabled Whites to preserve their agricultural labor force in the South. The contrast emerged because, as peoples transported far from their land and kinship ties on another continent, Black labor was relatively easy to control, and they became reduced to valuable commodities as agricultural laborers. In contrast, Amerindian labor was more difficult to control; moreover, Amerindians occupied large territories that became valuable as agricultural lands, especially with the invention of new technologies such as railroads. Sider thinks the blood quantum definition enhanced White acquisition of Amerindian lands in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which subjected Native Americans to marginalization and resulted in numerous conflicts related to American expansionism.\n\nThe political economy of race had different consequences for the descendants of aboriginal Americans and African slaves. The 19th-century blood quantum rule meant that it was relatively easier for a person of mixed Euro-Amerindian ancestry to be accepted as White. The offspring of a few generations of intermarriage between Amerindians and Whites likely would not have been considered Amerindian (at least not in a legal sense). Amerindians could have treaty rights to land, but because an individual with only one Amerindian great-grandparent no longer was classified as Amerindian, he lost a legal claim to Amerindian land, under the allotment rules of the day. According to Sider's theory, Whites were more easily able to acquire Amerindian lands. On the other hand, the same individual who could be denied legal standing in a tribe, according to the government, because he was \"too White\" to claim property rights, might still have enough visually identifiable Amerindian ancestry to be considered socially as a \"half-breed\" or breed, and stigmatized by both communities.\n\nThe 20th-century one-drop rule made it relatively difficult for anyone of known Black ancestry to be accepted as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful to have as many Blacks as possible.\n\nAlthough some scholars of the Jim Crow period agree that the 20th-century notion of invisible Blackness shifted the color line in the direction of paleness, and \"expanded\" the labor force in response to Southern Blacks' Great Migration to the North. But, others (such as the historians Joel Williamson, C. Vann Woodward, George M. Fredrickson, and Stetson Kennedy) considered the one-drop rule a consequence of the need to define Whiteness as being pure, and justifying White-on-Black oppression.\n\nOver the centuries when Whites wielded power over both Blacks and Amerindians and believed in their inherent superiority over people of color, they created a social order of hypodescent, in which they assigned mixed-race children to the lower-status groups. They were often ignorant of the systems among Native American tribes of social classification, including kinship and hypodescent. The Omaha people, for instance, who had a patrilineal kinship system, classified all children with white fathers as \"white\", and excluded them as members of the clans and tribe, unless one was formally adopted by a male member. Tribal members might care for mixed-race children of white fathers, but considered them outside the hereditary clan and kinship fundamental to tribal society.\n\nThe hypodescent social construction related to the racial caste that was associated with African slavery and the conditions of the slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of \"partus sequitur ventrem\" into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790–1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.\n\nIn the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time by whites that classified individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories (Gossett 1997), but these were always porous. The decennial censuses conducted since 1790, after slavery was well established in the United States, included classification of persons by race: white, black, mulatto, and Indian (Nobles 2000). But, the inclusion of mulatto was an explicit acknowledgement of mixed race. In addition, before the Civil War, Virginia and some other states had legal definition of \"whiteness\" that provided for people being classified as white if no more than 1/8 black. (For example, if not born into slavery, Thomas Jefferson's children by his slave Sally Hemings would have been classified as legally white, as they were 7/8 white by ancestry. Three of the four surviving children entered white society as adults, and their descendants have identified as white.) In the late 18th and 19th centuries, people of mixed race often migrated to frontiers where societies were more open, and they might be accepted as white if satisfying obligations of citizenship.\n\nThe more familiar \"one-drop rule\" was not adopted by Virginia and other states until the 20th century, but it classified persons with any known African ancestry as black (Davis 2001). Passage of such laws was often urged by white supremacists and people promoting \"racial purity\" through eugenics, having forgotten the long history of multi-racial unions in the South that comprised the ancestry of many families.\n\nIn other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid. In some cases, people may move into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry, and appearance (Mörner 1967).\n\nThe term \"Hispanic\" as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century, with the rise of migration of laborers from Spanish-speaking countries of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word \"Latino\" is often used as a synonym for \"Hispanic\". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today they have begun to represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, \"Anglo\" is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-Hispanic White Americans or European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily English descent.\n\nThe United States is a racially diverse country. The growth of the Hispanic population through immigration and high birth rates is noted as a partial factor for the US' population gains in the last quarter-century. The 2000 census revealed that Native Americans had reached their highest documented population, 4.5 million, since the US was founded in 1776.\n\nThe immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to mix among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continents. In the United States, for example, most people who identify as African American have some European ancestors, as revealed by genetic studies. In one analysis of those genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ~ 23 % for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans, where there was historically a large class of mixed race (now called Louisiana Creoles) (Parra \"et al.\" 1998).\n\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African Americans, and European Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria among whites for membership in these groups were similar, comprising physical appearance, assumption of non-European ancestry, and social circle. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During and after Reconstruction, after the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, in the effort to restore white supremacy in the South, whites began to classify anyone with \"one drop\" of \"black blood\", or known African ancestry, to be black. Such a legal definition was not put into law until the early 20th century in most southern states, but many established racial segregation of facilities during the Jim Crow era, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures in the South.\n\nEfforts to track mixing between groups led to an earlier proliferation of historical categories (such as \"mulatto\" and \"octaroon\" among persons with partial African descent) and \"blood quantum\" distinctions, which became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry. In the 20th century, efforts to classify the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete categories generated many difficulties (Spickard 1992). By the standards used in past censuses, many mixed-race children born in the United States were classified as of a different race than one of their biological parents. In addition, a person may change personal racial identification over time because of cultural aspects, and self-ascribed race can differ from assigned race (Kressin \"et al.\" 2003).\n\nUntil the 2000 census, Latinos were required to identify as one race, and none was Latino. Partly as a result of the confusion generated by the distinction, 32.9% (U.S. census records) of Latino respondents in the 2000 census ignored the specified racial categories and checked \"some other race\". (Mays \"et al.\" 2003 claim a figure of 42%)\n\nHistorical trends influencing the ethnic demographics of the United States include:\n\nIn some cases, immigrants and migrants form ethnic enclaves; in others, mixture creates ethnically diverse neighborhoods.\n\nThe majority of people currently living in the United States are White and European Americans. The United States Census Bureau defines White people as those \"having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\" Like all official U.S. racial categories, \"White\" has a \"not Hispanic or Latino\" and a \"Hispanic or Latino\" component, the latter consisting mostly of White Mexican Americans and White Cuban Americans.\n\nWhite Americans are the majority in 49 of the 50 states, with Hawaii as the exception. \"Non-Hispanic Whites\" are the majority in 46 states; Hawaii, New Mexico, California, and Texas (and the District of Columbia) are the exceptions. These five jurisdictions have \"minority majorities\", i.e. minority groups compose the majority of the population.\n\nThe non-Hispanic White percentage (63% in 2012) tends to decrease every year, and this sub-group is expected to become a plurality of the overall U.S. population after the year 2043. White Americans overall (non-Hispanic Whites together with White Hispanics) are projected to continue as the majority, at 73.1% (or 303 million out of 420 million) in 2050, from currently 77.1%.\n\nAlthough a high proportion of the population is known to have multiple ancestries, in the 2000 census, the first with the option to choose more than one, most people still identified with one racial category. In the 2000 census, self-identified German Americans made up 17.1% of the U.S. population, followed by Irish Americans at 12%, as reported in the 2000 U.S. Census. This makes German and Irish the largest and second-largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States. Both groups had high rates of immigration to the U.S. beginning in the mid-19th century, triggered by the Great Famine in Ireland and the failed 1848 Revolution in Germany. However, English Americans and British Americans are still considered the largest ethnic group due to a serious under count following the 2000 census whereby many English and British Americans self-identified under the new category entry 'American' considering themselves 'indigenous' because their families had resided in the US for so long or, if of mixed European ancestry, identified with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.\n\n7.2% of the population listed their ancestry as American on the 2000 census (see American ethnicity). According to the United States Census Bureau, the number of people in the U.S. who reported American and no other ancestry increased from 12.4 million in 1990 to 20.2 million in 2000. This change in reporting represented the largest \"growth\" of any ethnic group in the United States during the 1990s, but it represented how people reported themselves more than growth through birth rates, for instance, and certainly did not reflect immigration.\n\nMost French Americans are believed descended from colonists of Catholic New France; exiled Huguenots, much fewer in number and settling in the eastern English colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s, needed to assimilate into the majority culture and have intermarried over generations. Isleños of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest have had, in part, direct Spanish ancestry; most self-reported White Hispanics are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origins, each of which are multi-ethnic nations. Hispanic immigration has increased from nations of Central and South America.\n\nBlack and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African-American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are \"Black\". Among these racial outliers are persons from Cape Verde, Madagascar, various Hamito-Semitic populations in East Africa and the Sahel, and the Afrikaners of Southern Africa including such notable figures as the inventor Elon Musk and actress Charlize Theron.\n\nAfrican Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa. According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 38,093,725 Black and African Americans in the United States, representing 12.4% of the population. There were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which comprised 12.1% of the population. This number increased to 42 million according to the 2010 United States Census, when including Multiracial African Americans, making up 14% of the total U.S. population. Black and African Americans make up the second largest group in the United States, but the third largest group after White Americans and Hispanic or Latino Americans (of any race). The majority of the population (55%) lives in the South; compared to the 2000 Census, there has also been a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\nMost African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from West Africa, who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States. As an adjective, the term is usually written \"African-American\". The first West Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean. All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves); by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved. During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy, while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units. By 1804, the northern states (north of the Mason–Dixon line) had abolished slavery. However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress, African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws, legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 due to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAccording to US Census Bureau data, very few African immigrants self-identify as African-American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as \"African-American\" or \"Afro-American\" on the 2000 US Census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as \"African-American\" or \"Afro-American\" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%-9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%-4%). Nonetheless, African immigrants often develop very successful professional and business working-relationships with African-Americans.\n\nIn 2008, \"Hispanic or Latino origin\" was the self-identification of 47 million Americans. They chiefly have origins in the Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. Very few also come from other places, for example: 0.2% of Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in Asia. The group is heterogeneous in race and national ancestry.\n\nThe Census Bureau defines \"Hispanic or Latino origin\" thus:\nThe leading country-of-origin for Hispanic Americans is Mexico (30.7 million), followed by Puerto Rico (4.2 million) (which actually has a special relationship with the US, of which its people are citizens), and Cuba (1.6 million), as of 2008. However, as of 2010, there were 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, the largest of the U.S.-Central American community. Salvadorans are poised to become the third largest Hispanic group by the next census, significantly overtaking and replacing Cubans. Recent estimates already put the Salvadoran population as high as 2 million, as of 2013, the third largest Hispanic-American group.\n\n62.4% of Hispanic and Latino Americans identified as white. 30.5% identified as \"some other race\" (other than the ones listed). According to the PEP 91.9% of Latinos are white, as these official estimates do not recognize \"some other race\". In the official estimates, Black or African American Hispanics are the second-largest group, with 1.9 million, or 4.0% of the whole group. The remaining Hispanics are accounted as follows, first per the PEP: 1.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.5% two or more races, 0.7% Asian, and 0.03% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Per the ACS: 3.9% two or more races, 1.9% Black or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.4% Asian, and 0.05% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.\n\nIn the United States the Hispanic and Latino population has reached 58 million in 2016. According to Pew Research Center the Latino population has been the principal driver of United States demographic growth since 2000. Mexicans make up most of the Hispanic and Latino population 35,758,000. There is also a growth of Hispanics who are receiving a college education in 2015, 40% of Hispanics age 25 and older have had a college experience. In 2000 the percentage was at a low 30%. In all the 50 US states California houses the largest population percentage of Latinos. In 2015, 15.2 million Hispanics lived in California.\n\nThe Hispanic or Latino population is young and fast-growing, due to immigration and higher birth rates. For decades it has contributed significantly to U.S. population increases, and this is expected to continue. The Census Bureau projects that by 2050, one-quarter of the population will be Hispanic or Latino.\n\nA third significant minority is the Asian American population, comprising 19.4 million in 2013, or 6.0% of the U.S. population. California is home to 4.5 million Asian Americans, whereas 495,000 live in Hawaii, where they compose the plurality, at 38.5% of the islands' people. This is their largest share of any state. Historically first concentrated on Hawaii and the West Coast, Asian Americans now live across the country, living and working in large numbers in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Houston, and other major urban centers.\n\nTheir histories are diverse. As with the new immigration from central and eastern Europe to the East Coast from the mid-19th century on, Asians started immigrating to the United States in large numbers in the 19th century. This first major wave of immigration consisted predominantly of Chinese and Japanese laborers, but also included Korean and South Asian immigrants. Many immigrants also came during and after this period from the Philippines, which was a US colony from 1898 to 1946. Exclusion laws and policies largely prohibited and curtailed Asian immigration until the 1940s. After the US changed its immigration laws during the 1940s to 1960s to make entry easier, a much larger new wave of immigration from Asia began. Today the largest self-identified Asian American sub-groups according to census data are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and Japanese Americans, among other groups.\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas, particularly Native Americans, made up 0.8% of the population in 2008, numbering 2.4 million. An additional 2.3 million persons declared part-American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry.\n\nThe legal and official designation of who is Native American has aroused controversy by demographers, tribal nations, and government officials for many decades. Federally recognized tribes and state recognized tribes set their own membership requirements; tribal enrollment may require residency on a reservation, documented lineal descent from recognized records, such as the Dawes Rolls, and other criteria. Some tribes have adopted the use of blood quantum, requiring members to have a certain percentage. The federal government requires individuals to certify documented blood quantum of ancestry for certain federal programs, such as education benefits, available to members of recognized tribes. But Census takers accept any respondent's identification. Genetic scientists estimated that more than 15 million other Americans, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans (specifically those of Mexican heritage), may have up to one quarter of American Indian ancestry.\n\nOnce thought to face extinction as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of aspects of their cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, as well as to promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.\n\nToday more than 800,000 to one million persons claim Cherokee descent in part or as full-bloods; of these, an estimated 300,000 live in California, 70,000—160,000 in Oklahoma, and 15,000 in North Carolina in ancestral homelands. \n\nThe second largest tribal group is the Navajo, who call themselves Diné and live on a 16-million acre (65,000 km²) Indian reservation covering northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah. It is home to half of the 450,000 Navajo Nation members. The third largest group are the Lakota (Sioux) Nation, with distinct federally recognized tribes located in the states of Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming; and North and South Dakota.\n\nNative Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders numbered 427,810 in 2008, or 0.1% of the population. Additionally, nearly as many individuals identify as having partial Native Hawaiian ancestry, for a total of 829,949 people of full or part Native Hawaiian ancestry. This group constitutes the smallest minority in the United States. More than half identify as \"full-blooded\", but historically most Native Hawaiians on the island chain of Hawaii are believed to have admixture with Asian and European ancestries. But, the Census takes reporting by individuals as to how they identify.\n\nSome demographers believe that by the year 2025, the last full-blooded Native Hawaiian will die off, leaving a culturally distinct, but racially mixed population. The total number of persons who have identified as Native Hawaiian in 2008 was more than the estimated Hawaiian population when the US annexed the islands in 1898. Native Hawaiians are receiving ancestral land reparations. Throughout Hawaii, they are working to preserve and assert adaptation of Native Hawaiian customs and the Hawaiian language. They have cultural schools solely for legally Native Hawaiian students.\n\nAccording to the Arab American Institute (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.\n\nThere are an estimated 1.9-2.0 million Middle Eastern Americans according to the U.S. Census, including both Arab and non-Arab Americans, comprising 0.6% of the total U.S. population; however, the Arab American Institute estimates a population closer to 3.6 million. U.S. Census population estimates are based on responses to the ancestry question on the census, which makes it difficult to accurately count Middle Eastern Americans. Though Middle Eastern American communities can be found in each of the 50 states, the majority live in just 10 states with nearly \"one third of the total liv[ing] in California, New York, and Michigan\". More Middle Eastern Americans live in California than any other state, but Middle Eastern Americans represent the highest percentage of the population of Michigan. In particular, Dearborn, Michigan has long been home to a high concentration of Middle Eastern Americans.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community. Following consultations with MENA organizations, the US Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the \"white\" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier \"white\" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization. This process does not currently include ethnoreligious groups such as Jews or Sikhs, as the Bureau only tabulates these groups as followers of religions rather than members of ethnic groups.\n\nAs of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Turkish, Sudanese, Somali, Mauritanian, Armenian, Cypriot, Afghan, Azerbaijani and Georgian groups.\n\nSelf-identified multiracial Americans numbered 7.0 million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population. They have identified as any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, \"some other race\") and ethnicities. The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement.\n\nWhile the colonies and southern states protected white fathers by making all children born to slave mothers be classified as slaves, regardless of paternity, they also banned miscegenation or interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks. This did little to stop interracial relationships, except as legal, consensual unions.\n\nDemographers state that, due to new waves of immigration, the American people through the early 20th century were mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities, who maintained cultural distinctiveness until, over time, assimilation, migration and integration took place. The Civil Rights Movement through the 20th century gained passage of important legislation to enforce constitutional rights of minorities.\n\nAccording to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white (which is the largest percentage of the multiracial population), is as follows:\n\nA 2002 study found an average of 18.6% European genetic contribution and 2.7% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 1.5% and 1.4% respectively) in a sample of 232 African Americans. Meanwhile, in a sample of 187 European Americans from State College, Pennsylvania, there was an average of 0.7% West African genetic contribution and 3.2% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 0.9% and 1.6% respectively). Most of the non-European admixture was concentrated in 30% of the sample, with West African admixture ranging from 2 to 20%, with an average of 2.3%.\n\nIn 1958 Robert Stuckert produced a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. He concluded that the growth in the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. He concluded that 21 percent of white Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. He also concluded that the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.\n\nMore recently, many different DNA studies have shown that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17 % and between 10.6% and 22.5%. Another recent study found the average to be 21.2%, with a standard error of 1.2%.\n\nThe Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group of the National Human Genome Research Institute notes that \"although genetic analyses of large numbers of loci can produce estimates of the percentage of a person's ancestors coming from various continental populations, these estimates may assume a false distinctiveness of the parental populations, since human groups have exchanged mates from local to continental scales throughout history.\"\n\nIn the 2000 census, the non-standard category of \"Other\" was especially intended to capture responses such as Mestizo and Mulatto, two large multiracial groups in most of the countries of origin of Hispanic and Latino Americans. However, many other responses are captured by the category.\n\nIn 2008 15.0 million people, nearly 5% of the total U.S. population, were estimated to be \"some other race\", with 95% of them being Hispanic or Latino.\n\nDue to this category's non-standard status, statistics from government agencies other than the Census Bureau (for example: the Centers for Disease Control's data on vital statistics, or the FBI's crime statistics), but also the Bureau's own official Population Estimates, omit the \"some other race\" category and include most of the people in this group in the white population, thus including the vast majority (about 90%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the white population. For an example of this, see The World Factbook, published by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe ancestry of the people of the United States of America is widely varied and includes descendants of populations from around the world. In addition to its variation, the ancestry of people of the United States is also marked by varying amounts of intermarriage between ethnic and racial groups.\n\nWhile some Americans can trace their ancestry back to a single ethnic group or population in Europe, Africa, or Asia, these are often first- and second-generation Americans. Generally, the degree of mixed heritage increases the longer one's ancestors have lived in the United States (see melting pot). In theory, there are several means available to discover the ancestry of the people residing in the United States, including genealogy, genetics, oral and written history, and analysis of Federal Population Census schedules. In practice, only few of these have been used for a larger part of the population.\n\nAccording to the 2010–2015 American Community Survey, the twenty largest ancestry groups in the United States were (see above for the OMB self-designation options):\nThese images display frequencies of self-reported ancestries, as of the 2000 U.S. Census.

{"id": "1626472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1626472", "title": "Reactions to On the Origin of Species", "text": "Reactions to On the Origin of Species\n\nThe immediate reactions to \"On the Origin of Species\", the book in which Charles Darwin described evolution by natural selection, included international debate, though the heat of controversy was less than that over earlier works such as \"Vestiges of Creation\". Darwin monitored the debate closely, cheering on Thomas Henry Huxley's battles with Richard Owen to remove clerical domination of the scientific establishment. While Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he read eagerly about them and mustered support through correspondence.\n\nReligious views were mixed, with the Church of England's scientific establishment reacting against the book, while liberal Anglicans strongly supported Darwin's natural selection as an instrument of God's design. Religious controversy was soon diverted by the publication of \"Essays and Reviews\" and debate over the higher criticism.\n\nThe most famous confrontation took place at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, when the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce argued against Darwin's explanation. In the ensuing debate Joseph Hooker argued strongly in favor of Darwinian evolution. Thomas Huxley's support of evolution was so intense that the media and public nicknamed him \"Darwin's bulldog\". Huxley became the fiercest defender of the evolutionary theory on the Victorian stage. Both sides came away feeling victorious, but Huxley went on to depict the debate as pivotal in a struggle between religion and science and used \"Darwinism\" to campaign against the authority of the clergy in education, as well as daringly advocating the \"Ape Origin of Man\".\n\nDarwin's ideas developed rapidly after returning from the Voyage of the Beagle in 1836. By December 1838, he had developed the basic principles of his theory. At that time, similar ideas brought others disgrace and association with the revolutionary mob. He was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing. While he continued with research, he had an immense amount of work in hand analyzing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition, and was repeatedly delayed by illness.\n\nNatural history at that time was dominated by clerical naturalists who saw their science as revealing God's plan, and whose income came from the Established Church of England. Darwin found three close allies. The eminent geologist Charles Lyell, whose books had influenced the young Darwin during the Voyage of the Beagle, befriended Darwin who he saw as a supporter of his ideas of gradual geological processes with continuing divine Creation of species. By the 1840s Darwin became friends with the young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker who had followed his father into the science, and after going on a survey voyage used his contacts to eventually find a position. In the 1850s Darwin met Thomas Huxley, an ambitious naturalist who had returned from a long survey trip but lacked the family wealth or contacts to find a career and who joined the progressive group around Herbert Spencer looking to make science a profession, freed from the clerics.\n\nThis was also a time of intense conflict over religious morality in England, where evangelicalism led to increasing professionalism of clerics who had previously been expected to act as country gentlemen with wide interests, but now were seriously focussed on expanded religious duties. A new orthodoxy proclaimed the virtues of truth but also inculcated beliefs that the Bible should be read literally and that religious doubt was in itself sinful so should not be discussed. Science was also becoming professional and a series of discoveries cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible and the honesty of those denying the findings. A series of crises erupted with fierce debate and criticism over issues such as George Combe's \"The Constitution of Man\" and the anonymous \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" which converted vast popular audiences to the belief that natural laws controlled the development of nature and society. German higher criticism questioned the Bible as a historical document in contrast to the evangelical creed that every word was divinely inspired. Dissident clergymen even began questioning accepted premises of Christian morality, and Benjamin Jowett's 1855 commentary on St. Paul brought a storm of controversy.\n\nBy September 1854 Darwin's other books reached a stage where he was able to turn his attention fully to \"Species\", and from this point he was working to publish his theory. On 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Alfred Russel Wallace enclosing about twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism that was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin put matters in the hands of his friends Lyell and Hooker, who agreed on a joint presentation to the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. Their papers were entitled, collectively, \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\". \n\nDarwin now worked on an \"abstract\" trimmed from his \"Natural Selection\" manuscript. The publisher John Murray agreed the title as \"On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection\" and the book went on sale to the trade on 22 November 1859. The stock of 1,250 copies was oversubscribed, and Darwin, still at Ilkley spa town, began corrections for a second edition. The novelist Charles Kingsley, a Christian socialist country rector, sent him a letter of praise: \"It awes me...if you be right I must give up much that I have believed\", it was \"just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which he himself had made.\" Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to \"a celebrated author and divine\".\n\nThe reviewers were less encouraging. Four days before publication, a review in the authoritative \"Athenaeum\"\n\nBy 9 December when Darwin left Ilkley to come home, he had been told that Murray was organising a second run of 3,000 copies. Hooker had been \"converted\", Lyell was \"absolutely gloating\" and Huxley wrote \"with such tremendous praise\", advising that he was sharpening his \"beak and claws\" to disembowel \"the curs who will bark and yelp\".\n\nRichard Owen had been the first to respond to the complimentary copies, courteously claiming that he had long believed that \"existing influences\" were responsible for the \"ordained\" birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him, and told Lyell that \"Under garb of great civility, he was inclined to be most bitter & sneering against me. Yet I infer from several expressions, that \"at bottom\" he goes immense way with us.\" Owen was furious at being included among those defending immutability of species, and in effect said that the book offered the best explanation \"ever published of the manner of formation of species\", though he did not agree with it in all respects. He still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialise man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in \"Creative Power\".\n\nDarwin had already made his views clearer to others, telling Lyell that if each step in evolution was providentially planned, the whole procedure would be a miracle and natural selection superfluous. He had also sent a copy to John Herschel, and on 10 December he told Lyell of having \"heard by round about channel that Herschel says my Book \"is the law of higgledy-piggledy\".– What this exactly means I do not know, but it is evidently very contemptuous.– If true this is great blow & discouragement.\" Darwin subsequently corresponded with Herschel, and in January 1861 Herschel added a footnote to the draft of his \"Physical Geography\" which, while disparaging \"the principle of arbitrary and casual variation and natural selection\" as insufficient without \"intelligent direction\", said that \"with some demur as to the genesis of man, we are far from disposed to repudiate the view taken of this mysterious subject in Mr. Darwin's book.\"\n\nIt was known that the geologic time scale was \"incomprehensibly vast\", if unquantifiable. From 1848 Darwin discussed data with Andrew Ramsay, who had said \"it is vain to attempt to measure the duration of even small portions of geological epochs.\" A chapter of Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" described the enormous amount of erosion involved in forming the Weald. To demonstrate the time available for natural selection to operate, Darwin drew on Lyell's example and Ramsay's data in chapter 9 of \"On the Origin of Species\" to estimate that erosion of the Weald's layered dome of Lower Cretaceous rocks “must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three hundred million years“. \n\nThe \"necessary corrections\" Darwin made to his drafts for the second edition of the \"Origin\" were based on comments from others, particularly Lyell, and added a caveat suggesting a faster rate of erosion of the Weald: \"perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three inches per century, and this would reduce the number of years to one hundred and fifty or one hundred million years.\" Copies of the second edition were advertised as ready on 24 December, in advance of official publication on 7 January 1860.\n\nThe \"Saturday Review\" of 24 December 1859 strongly criticised the methodology of Darwin's calculations. On 3 January 1860, Darwin wrote to Hooker about it: \"Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are very good, & the Reviewer gives me some good & well deserved raps,—confound it I am sorry to confess the truth. But it does not at all concern main argument.\" A day later, he said to Lyell \"You saw I suppose Saturday Review: argument confined to Geology, but has given me some perfectly just & severe raps on knuckles.\" \n\nIn the third edition published on 30 April 1861, Darwin cited the \"Saturday Review\" article as reason to remove his calculation altogether.\n\nThe December 1859 review in the British Unitarian \"National Review\" was written by Darwin's old friend William Carpenter, who was clear that only a world of \"order, continuity, and progress\" befitted an Omnipotent Deity and that \"any theological objection\" to a species of slug or a breed of dog deriving from a previous one was \"simply absurd\" dogma. He touched on human evolution, satisfied that the struggle for existence tended \"inevitably... towards the progressive exaltation of the races engaged in it\".\n\nOn Boxing Day (26 December) \"The Times\" carried an anonymous review. The staff reviewer, \"as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe\", gave the task to Huxley, leading Darwin to ask his friend how \"did you influence Jupiter Olympus and make him give three and a half columns to pure science? The old fogies will think the world will come to an end.\" Darwin treasured the piece more than \"a dozen reviews in common periodicals\", but noted \"Upon my life I am sorry for Owen... he will be so d—d savage, for credit given to any other man, I strongly suspect, is in his eyes so much credit robbed from him. Science is so narrow a field, it is clear there ought to be only one cock of the walk!\".\n\nHooker also wrote a favourable review, which appeared at the end of December in the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" and treated the theory as an extension of horticultural lore.\n\nIn his lofty position at the head of Science, Owen received numerous complaints about the book. The Revd. Adam Sedgwick, geologist at the University of Cambridge who had taken Darwin on his first geology field trip, could not see the point in a world without providence. The missionary David Livingstone could see no struggle for existence on the African plains. Jeffries Wyman at Harvard saw no truth in chance variations.\n\nThe most enthusiastic response came from atheists, with Hewett Watson hailing Darwin as the \"greatest revolutionist in natural history of this century\". The 68-year-old Robert Edmund Grant, who had shown him the study of invertebrates when Darwin was a student at the University of Edinburgh and who was still teaching Lamarckian evolution weekly at University College London, brought out a small book on classification dedicated to Darwin: \"With one fell-sweep of the wand of truth, you have now scattered to the winds the pestilential vapours accumulated by 'species-mongers'.\"\n\nIn January 1860, Darwin told Lyell of a reported incident at Waterloo Bridge Station: \"I never till to day realised that it was getting widely distributed; for in a letter from a lady today to Emma, she says she heard a man enquiring for it at Railway Station!!! at Waterloo Bridge; & the Bookseller said that he had none till new Edit. was out.— The Bookseller said he had not read it but had heard it was a very remarkable book!!!\"\n\nIn December 1859 the botanist Asa Gray negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, however, he learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print \"Origin\". Darwin wrote in January, \"I never dreamed of my Book being so successful with general readers: I believe I should have laughed at the idea of sending the sheets to America.\" and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5 per cent royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid January, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this was the first printing alone as there were four that year.\n\nWhen sending his \"Historical preface\" and corrections for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as \"a Review from a man, who is not an entire convert, if fair & moderately favourable, is in all respects the best kind of Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder.\" In April he continued, \"It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!\" A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and \"had no intention to write atheistically, \"but could not\" see, as plainly as others do, & as I sh wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars\" – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was \"inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton\" – referring to Isaac Newton.\n\nDarwin's brother Erasmus reported on 23 November that their cousin Henry Holland was reading the book and in \"a dreadful state of indecision\", sure that explaining the eye would be \"utterly impossible\", but after reading it \"he hummed & hawed & perhaps it was partly conceivable\". Erasmus himself thought it \"the most interesting book I ever read\", and sent a copy to his old flame Miss Harriet Martineau who, at 58, was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised \"the quality & conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness & simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, & the patient power by w. it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentious knowledge. I sh. much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.\"\n\nWriting to her fellow Malthusian (and atheist) George Holyoake she enthused, \"What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, & Natural (as far as Final Causes & Design are concerned) on the other. The range & mass of knowledge take away one's breath.\" To Fanny Wedgwood she wrote, \"I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of \"The Creator\" in the popular sense of the First Cause... His subject is the 'Origin of Species' & not the origin of Organisation; & it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all – There now! I have delivered my mind.\"\n\nThe Revd. Adam Sedgwick had received his copy \"with more pain than pleasure.\" Without Creation showing divine love, \"humanity, to my mind, would suffer a damage that might brutalise it, and sink the human race...\" He indicated that unless Darwin accepted God's revelation in nature and scripture, Sedgwick would not meet Darwin in heaven, a sentiment that upset Emma. The Revd. John Stevens Henslow, the botany professor whose natural history course Charles had joined thirty years earlier, gave faint praise to the \"Origin\" as \"a stumble in the right direction\" but distanced himself from its conclusions, \"a question past our finding out...\"\n\nThe Anglican establishment predominantly opposed Darwin. Palmerston, who became Prime Minister in June 1859, mooted Darwin's name to Queen Victoria as a candidate for the Honours List with the prospect of a knighthood. While Prince Albert supported the idea, after the publication of the \"Origin\" Queen Victoria's ecclesiastical advisers, including the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, dissented and the request was denied. Some Anglicans were more in favour, and Huxley reported of Kingsley that \"He is an excellent Darwinian to begin with, and told me a capital story of his reply to Lady Aylesbury who expressed astonishment at his favouring such a heresy – 'What can be more delightful to me Lady Aylesbury, than to know that your Ladyship & myself sprang from the same toad stool.' Whereby the frivolous old woman shut up, in doubt whether she was being chaffed or adored for her remark.\"\n\nThere was no official comment from the Vatican for several decades, but in 1860 a council of the German Catholic bishops pronounced that the belief that \"man as regards his body, emerged finally from the spontaneous continuous change of imperfect nature to the more perfect, is clearly opposed to Sacred Scripture and to the Faith.\" This defined the range of official Catholic discussion of evolution, which has remained almost exclusively concerned with human evolution.\n\nOn 10 February 1860 Huxley gave a lecture titled \"On Species and Races, and their Origin\" at the Royal Institution, reviewing Darwin's theory with fancy pigeons on hand to demonstrate artificial selection, as well as using the occasion to confront the clergy with his aim of wresting science from ecclesiastical control. He referred to Galileo's persecution by the church, \"the little Canutes of the hour enthroned in solemn state, bidding that great wave to stay, and threatening to check its beneficent progress.\" He hailed the \"Origin\" as heralding a \"new Reformation\" in a battle against \"those who would silence and crush\" science, and called on the public to cherish Science and \"follow her methods faithfully and implicitly in their application to all branches of human thought,\" for the future of England. \nTo Darwin such rhetoric was \"time wasted\" and on reflection he thought the lecture \"an entire failure \"which\" gave no just idea of \"natural\" selection,\" but by March he was listing those on \"our side\" as against the \"outsiders.\" His close allies were Hooker and Huxley, and in August he called Huxley his \"good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel – i.e. the devil's gospel.\"\n\nThe position of Richard Owen was unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee the need for a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that \"The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence? Visitors come to the British Museum, and they say, 'Let us see all these varieties of pigeons: where is the tumbler, where is the pouter?' and I am obliged with shame to say, I can show you none of them...\" As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely there ought to be a space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?\"\nHuxley's April review in the \"Westminster Review\" included the first mention of the term \"Darwinism\" in the question, \"What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?\" Darwin thought it a \"brilliant review.\"\n\nOverflowing the narrow bounds of purely scientific circles, the \"species question\" divides with Italy and the Volunteers the attention of general society. Everybody has read Mr. Darwin's book, or, at least, has given an opinion upon its merits or demerits; pietists, whether lay or ecclesiastic, decry it with the mild railing which sounds so charitable; bigots denounce it with ignorant invective; old ladies of both sexes consider it a decidedly dangerous book, and even savants, who have no better mud to throw, quote antiquated writers to show that its author is no better than an ape himself; while every philosophical thinker hails it as a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism; and all competent naturalists and physiologists, whatever their opinions as to the ultimate fate of the doctrines put forth, acknowledge that the work in which they are embodied is a solid contribution to knowledge and inaugurates a new epoch in natural history. – Thomas Huxley, 1860\n\nWhen Owen's own anonymous review of the \"Origin\" appeared in the April \"Edinburgh Review\" he praised himself and his own \"axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things\", and showed his anger at what he saw as Darwin's caricature of the creationist position and ignoring Owen's pre-eminence. To him, new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection. As well as attacking Darwin's \"disciples\" Hooker and Huxley, he thought that the book symbolised the sort of \"abuse of science to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation.\" Darwin had Huxley and Hooker staying with him when he read it, and he wrote telling Lyell that it was \"extremely malignant, clever & I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, & very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.– It scandalously misrepresents many parts. ... It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me.\" He commented to Henslow that \"Owen is indeed very spiteful. He misrepresents & alters what I say very unfairly. ... The Londoners says he is mad with envy because my book has been talked about: what a strange man to be envious of a naturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior!\"\n\nDarwin's had estimated that erosion of the Weald would take 300 million years, but in the second edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" published on 7 January 1860 he accepted that it would be safer to allow 150 million to 200 million years.\n\nGeologists knew the earth was ancient, but had felt unable to put realistic figures on the duration of past geological changes. Darwin's book provided a new impetus to quantifying geological time. His most prominent critic, John Phillips, had investigated how temperatures increased with depth in the 1830s, and was convinced that, contrary to Lyell and Darwin's uniformitarianism, the Earth was cooling over the long term. Between 1838 and 1855 he tried various ways of quantifying the timing of stratified deposits, without success. On 17 February 1860, Phillips used his presidential address to the Geological Society of London to accuse Darwin of \"abuse of arithmetic\". He said 300 million years was an \"inconceivable number\" and that, depending on assumptions, erosion of the Weald could have taken anything from 12,000 years to at most 1,332,000 years, well below Darwin's estimate. When giving the May 1860 Rede Lecture, Phillips produced his own first published estimates of the duration of the whole stratigraphic record, using rates of sedimentation to calculate it at around 96 million years.\n\nMost reviewers wrote with great respect, deferring to Darwin's eminent position in science though finding it hard to understand how natural selection could work without a divine selector. There were hostile comments, at the start of May he commented to Lyell that he had \"received in a Manchester Newspaper a rather a good squib, showing that I have proved 'might is right', & therefore that Napoleon is right & every cheating Tradesman is also right\". The \"Saturday Review\" reported that \"The controversy excited by the appearance of Darwin's remarkable work on the \"Origin of Species\" has passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street.\"\n\nThe older generation of Darwin's tutors were rather negative, and later in May he told his cousin Fox that \"the attacks have been falling thick & heavy on my now case-hardened hide.— Sedgwick & Clarke opened regular battery on me lately at Cambridge Phil. Soc. & dear old Henslow defended me in grand style, saying that my investigations were perfectly legitimate.\" While defending Darwin's honest motives and belief that \"he was exalting & not debasing our views of a Creator, in attributing to him a power of imposing laws on the Organic World by which to do his work, as effectually as his laws imposed upon the inorganic had done it in the Mineral Kingdom\", Henslow had not disguised his own opinion that \"Darwin has pressed his hypothesis too far\".\n\nIn June, Karl Marx saw the book as a \"bitter satire\" that showed \"a basis in natural science for class struggle in history\", in which \"Darwin recognizes among beasts and plants his English society\".\n\nDarwin remarked to Lyell, \"I must be a very bad explainer... Several Reviews, & several letters have shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose \"natural selection\" was bad term; but to change it now, I think, would make confusion worse confounded. Nor can I think of better; \"Natural preservation\" would not imply a preservation of particular varieties & would seem a truism; & would not bring man's & nature's selection under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated explanations finally to make matter clearer.\" It was too illegible for Lyell, and Darwin later apologised \"I am utterly ashamed & groan over my hand-writing. It was \"Natural Preservation\". Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer.\"\n\nAround February 1860 liberal theologians entered the fray, when seven produced a manifesto titled \"Essays and Reviews\". These Anglicans included Oxford professors, country clergymen, the headmaster of Rugby school and a layman. Their declaration that miracles were irrational stirred up unprecedented anger, drawing much of the fire away from Darwin. \"Essays\" sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than the \"Origin\" sold in twenty years, and sparked five years of increasingly polarised debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.\n\nThe most scientific of the seven was the Reverend Baden Powell, who held the Savilian chair of geometry at the University of Oxford. Referring to \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume\" and restating his argument that God is a lawgiver, miracles break the lawful edicts issued at Creation, therefore belief in miracles is atheistic, he wrote that the book \"must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature.\" He drew attacks, with Sedgwick accusing him of \"greedily\" adopting nonsense and Tory reviews saying he was joining \"the infidel party\". He would have been on the platform at the British Association debate, facing the bishop, but died of a heart attack on 11 June.\n\nThe most famous confrontation took place at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Saturday 30 June 1860. While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor John William Draper of New York University was to talk on Darwin and social progress at a routine \"Botany and Zoology\" meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, would speak to repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the \"Vestiges\" published anonymously by Robert Chambers. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the \"Origin\" for the Tory \"Quarterly\" for a fee of £60. Huxley was not going to wait for the meeting, but met Chambers who accused him of \"deserting them\" and changed his mind. Darwin was taking treatment at Dr. Lane's new hydropathic establishment at Sudbrooke Park, Petersham, near Richmond in Surrey. \n\nFrom Hooker's account, Draper \"droned on for an hour\", then for half an hour \"Soapy Sam\" Wilberforce replied with the eloquence that had earned him his nickname. This time the climate of opinion had changed and the ensuing debate was more evenly matched, with Hooker being particularly successful in defence of Darwin's ideas. In response to what Huxley took as a jibe from Wilberforce as to whether it was on Huxley's grandfather's or grandmother's side that he was descended from an ape, Huxley made a reply which he later recalled as being that \"[if asked] would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means and influence and yet who employs these faculties and that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape\". No verbatim record was taken: eyewitness accounts exist, and vary somewhat.\n\nRobert FitzRoy, who had been the captain of during Darwin's voyage, was there to present a paper on storms. During the debate FitzRoy, seen by Hooker as \"a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman\", stood in the centre of the audience and \"lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man\". As he admitted that the \"Origin of Species\" had given him \"acutest pain\" the crowd shouted him down.\n\nHooker's \"blood boiled, I felt myself a dastard; now I saw my advantage–I swore to myself I would smite that Amalekite Sam hip and thigh\", (he was invited up to the platform and) \"there and then I smacked him amid rounds of applause... proceeded to demonstrate... that he could never have read your book... wound up with a very few observations on the...old and new hypotheses... Sam was shut up... and the meeting was dissolved forthwith leaving you [Darwin] master of the field after 4 hours battle.\"\n\nBoth sides came away claiming victory, with Hooker and Huxley each sending Darwin rather contradictory triumphant accounts. Supporters of Darwinism seized on this meeting as a sign that the idea of evolution could not be suppressed by authority, and would be defended vigorously by its advocates. Liberal clerics were also satisfied that literal belief in all aspects of the Bible was now questioned by science; they were sympathetic to some of the ideas in \"Essays and Reviews\". William Whewell wrote to his friend James David Forbes that \"Perhaps the Bishop was not prudent to venture into a field where no eloquence can supersede the need for precise knowledge. The young naturalists declared themselves in favour of Darwin’s views which tendency I saw already at Leeds two years ago. I am sorry for it, for I reckon Darwin’s book to be an utterly unphilosophical one.\"\n\nIn late July Darwin read Wilberforce's review in the \"Quarterly\". It used a 60-year-old parody from the \"Anti-Jacobin\" of the prose of Darwin's grandfather Erasmus, implying old revolutionary sympathies. It argued that if \"transmutations were actually occurring\" this would be seen in rapidly reproducing invertebrates, and since it isn't, why think that \"the favourite varieties of turnips are tending to become men\". Darwin pencilled \"rubbish\" in the margin. To the statement about classification that \"all creation is the transcript in matter of ideas eternally existing in the mind of the Most High!!\", Darwin scribbled \"mere words\". At the same time, Darwin was willing to grant that Wilberforce's review was clever: he wrote to Hooker that \"it picks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, and brings forward well all the difficulties. It quizzes me quite splendidly by quoting the 'Anti-Jacobin' against my Grandfather.\"\n\nWilberforce also attacked \"Essays and Reviews\" in the \"Quarterly Review\", and in a letter to \"The Times\", signed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and 25 bishops, which threatened the theologians with the ecclesiastical courts. Darwin quoted a proverb: \"A bench of bishops is the devil's flower garden\", and joined others including Lyell, though not Hooker and Huxley, in signing a counter-letter supporting \"Essays and Reviews\" for trying to \"establish religious teachings on a firmer and broader foundation\". Despite this alignment of pro-evolution scientists and Unitarians with liberal churchmen, two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862.\n\nIn October 1860, John Phillips published \"Life on the Earth, its origin and succession\", reiterating points from his Rede Lecture and disputing Darwin's arguments. He sent a copy to Darwin, who thanked him, though \"sorry, but not surprised, to see that you are dead against me\". \n\nOn 20 November, Darwin told Lyell of his revisions for a third edition of the \"Origin\", including removing his estimate of the time it took for the Weald to erode: \"The confounded Wealden calculation, to be struck out. & a note to be inserted to effect that I am convinced of its inaccuracy from Review in Saturday R. & from Phillips, as I see in Table of Contents that he attacks it.\" He later told Lyell that \"Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you\", and advised caution: \"for Heaven-sake take care of your fingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant.\" The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated \"The computation of time required for the denudation of the Weald omitted. I have been convinced of its inaccuracy in several respects by an excellent article in the 'Saturday Review,' Dec. 24, 1859.\"\n\nThe \"Natural History Review\" was bought and refurbished by Huxley, Lubbock, Busk and other \"plastically minded young men\" – supporters of Darwin. The first issue in January 1861 carried Huxley's paper on man's relationship to apes, \"showing up\" Owen. Huxley cheekily sent a copy to Wilberforce.\n\nAs the battles raged, Darwin returned home from the spa to proceed with experiments on chloroforming carnivorous sundew plants, looking over his \"Natural Selection\" manuscript and drafting two chapters on pigeon breeding that would eventually form part of \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication\". He wrote to Asa Gray and used the example of fantail pigeons to argue against Gray's belief \"that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines\", with the implication of Creationism rather than Natural Selection.\n\nOver the winter he organised a third edition of the \"Origin\", adding an introductory historical sketch. Asa Gray had published three supportive articles in the \"Atlantic Monthly\". Darwin persuaded Gray to publish them as a pamphlet, and was delighted when Gray came up with the title of \"Natural Selection Not Inconsistent with Natural Theology\". Darwin paid half the cost, imported 250 copies into Britain and as well as advertising it in periodicals and sending 100 copies out to scientists, reviewers, and theologians (including Wilberforce), he included in the \"Origin\" a recommendation for it, available to be purchased for 1s. 6d. from Trübner's in Paternoster Row.\n\nThe Huxleys became close family friends, frequently visiting Down House. When their 3-year-old son died of scarlet fever they were badly affected. Henrietta Huxley brought their three infants to Down in March 1861 where Emma helped to console her, while Huxley continued with his working-men's lectures at the Royal School of Mines, writing that \"My working men stick with me wonderfully, the house fuller than ever, By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are monkeys.\"\n\nHuxley's arguments with Owen continued in the \"Athenaeum\" so that each Saturday Darwin could read the latest ripostes. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an \"advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape\", and one of his contributions was titled \"Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain\". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on \"pithecoid man\" – ape-like man, and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. He was determined to indict Owen for perjury, promising \"before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers.\" Darwin egged him on from Down, writing \"Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side\".\n\nTheir campaign ran over two years and was devastatingly successful, with each \"slaying\" being followed by a recruiting drive for the Darwinian cause. The spite lingered. When Huxley joined the Zoological Society Council in 1861, Owen left, and in the following year Huxley moved to stop Owen from being elected to the Royal Society Council as \"no body of gentlemen\" should admit a member \"guilty of wilful & deliberate falsehood.\" \n\nLyell was troubled both by Huxley's belligerence and by the question of ape ancestry, but got little sympathy from Darwin who teased him that \"\"Our\" ancestor was an animal which breathed water, had a swim bladder, a great swimming tail, an imperfect skull, and undoubtedly was a hermaphrodite! Here is a pleasant genealogy for mankind.\" Lyell began work on a book examining human origins.\n\nLike the geologist John Phillips, the physicist William Thomson (later ennobled as Lord Kelvin) had considered since the 1840s that the physics of thermodynamics required that the Earth was cooling from an initial molten state. This contradicted Lyell's uniformitarian concept of unchanging processes over deep geological time, which Darwin shared and had assumed would allow ample time for the slow process of natural selection. \n\nIn June 1861 Thomson asked Phillips how geologists felt about Darwin's \"prodigious durations for geological epochs\". and mentioned his own preliminary calculation that the Sun was 20 million years old, with the Earth at most 200 to 1,000 million years old. Phillips discussed his own published view that stratified rocks went back 96 million years, and dismissed Darwin's original estimate that the Weald had taken 300 million years to erode. In September 1861 Thomson produced a paper \"On the age of the Sun's heat\" which estimated that the Sun was between 100 and 500 million years old, and in 1862 he used assumptions on the rate of cooling from a molten condition to estimate the age of the Earth at 98 million years. The dispute continued for the rest of Darwin's life.\n\nThe reception of Darwin's ideas continued to arouse scientific and religious debates, and wide public interest. Satirical cartoonists seized on animal ancestry in relation to other topical issues, drawing on a long tradition of identifying animal traits in humans. In Britain mass circulation magazines were droll rather than cruel, and thus presented Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. Due to illness, Darwin began growing a beard in 1862, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 with a bushy beard, caricatures centred on Darwin and his new look contributed to a trend in which all forms of evolutionism were identified with Darwinism.\n\nFor a description of Darwin's life, work and influences in the following period see the article: Darwin from Orchids to Variation.\n\nNote: this article uses Desmond and Moore, \"Darwin\", as a general reference.

{"id": "2868695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2868695", "title": "Religion in Israel", "text": "Religion in Israel\n\nReligion in Israel is a central feature of the country and plays a major role in shaping Israeli culture and lifestyle. Religion has played a central role in Israel's history. Israel is also the only country in the world where a majority of citizens are Jewish. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the population in 2011 was 75.4% Jewish, 20.6% Arab, and 4.1% minority groups. The religious affiliation of the Israeli population as of 2016 was 74.7% Jewish, 17.7% Muslim, 2.0% Christian, and 1.6% Druze, with the remaining 4.1% including faiths such as Samaritanism and Baha'iism, and irreligious people with no faith.\n\nIsrael does not have a constitution. While the Basic Laws of Israel that serve in place of a constitution define the country as a \"Jewish state\", these Basic Laws, coupled with Knesset statutes, decisions of the Supreme Court of Israel, and various elements of the common law current in Israel, offer some protection for free practice of religion in the country. Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that places \"high\" restrictions on religion, and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism. Legal accommodation of the non-Jewish communities follows the pattern and practice of the Ottoman and British administrations, with some important modifications. Israeli law officially recognizes five religions, all belonging to the Abrahamic family of religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druzeism, and the Bahá'í Faith. Furthermore, the law formally recognizes ten separate sects of Christianity: the Roman, Armenian, Maronite, Greek, Syriac, and Chaldean Catholic Churches; the Eastern Orthodox Greek Orthodox Church; the Oriental Orthodox Syriac Orthodox Church; the Armenian Apostolic Church; and Anglicanism.\nRelations among religious groups—between Jews and non-Jews, between Muslims and Christians, and among the different streams of Judaism, such as Orthodox, Reform and Conservative—are often strained.\n\nIsrael, founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was created in the Jews' ancestral homeland to provide a national home, safe from persecution, for the Jewish people. Although Israeli law explicitly grants equal civil rights to all citizens regardless of religion, ethnicity, or other heritage, it gives preferential treatment in certain aspects to individuals who fall within the criteria mandated by the Law of Return, including preferential treatment to Jews and their relatives who seek to immigrate to Israel.\n\nThe Law of Return does not strictly follow the traditional Jewish religious law (halakha) in relation to the definition of who is a Jew. For example, some individuals who would be considered Jewish under halakha are excluded from the rights under the Law of Return - e. g., those who converted to another religion; while others are entitled to immigration though they are not considered Jewish under halakha, e. g., they are related by marriage to a Jew or a grandparent may have been a Jew.\n\nA Gallup survey in 2015 determined that 65 percent of Israelis say they are either \"not religious\" or \"convinced atheists\", while 30 percent say they are \"religious\". Israel is in the middle of the international religiosity scale, between Thailand, the world's most religious country, and China, the least religious.\n\n, 8% of Israeli Jews defined themselves as Haredim; an additional 12% as \"religious\"; 13% as \"religious-traditionalists\"; 25% as \"non-religious-traditionalists\" (not strictly adhering to Jewish law or halakha); and 42% as \"secular\" (, \"Hiloni\"). , 65% of Israeli Jews believed in God, and 85% participate in a Passover seder. However, other sources indicate that between 15% and 37% of Israelis identify themselves as either atheists or agnostics. A survey conducted in 2009 showed that 80% of Israeli Jews believed in God, with 46% of them self-reporting as secular. Israelis tend not to align themselves with a movement of Judaism (such as Reform Judaism or Conservative Judaism) but instead tend to define their religious affiliation by degree of their religious practice.\n\nOf the Arab Israelis, as of 2008, 82.7% were Muslims, 8.4% were Druze, and 8.3% were Christians. Just over 80% of Christians are Arabs, and the majority of the remaining are immigrants from the former Soviet Union who immigrated with a Jewish relative. About 81% of Christian births are to Arab women.\n\nMost citizens in the State of Israel are Jewish. As of the end of 2015, Jews made up 74.9% percent of the population.\n\nIn 2007, a poll by the Israeli Democracy Institute found that 27% of Israeli Jews say that they keep the Sabbath, while 53% said they do not keep it at all. The poll also found that 50% of the respondents would give up shopping on the Sabbath as long as public transportation were kept running and leisure activities continued to be permitted; however, only 38% believed that such a compromise would reduce the tensions between the secular and religious communities.\n\nBecause the terms \"secular\" and \"traditional\" are not strictly defined, published estimates of the percentage of Israeli Jews who are considered \"traditional\" range from 32% to 55%. A Gallup survey in 2015 determined that 65% of Israelis say they are either \"not religious\" or \"convinced atheists\", while 30% say they are \"religious\". Israel is in the middle of the international religiosity scale, between Thailand, the world's most religious country, and China, the least religious. The Israeli Democracy Index commissioned in 2013 regarding religious affiliation of Israeli Jews found that 3.9 percent of respondents felt attached to Reform (Progressive) Judaism, 3.2 percent to Conservative Judaism, and 26.5 percent to Orthodox Judaism. The other two thirds of respondents said they felt no connection to any denomination, or declined to respond.\n\nThe spectrum covered by \"Orthodox\" in the diaspora exists in Israel, again with some important variations.\n\nWhat would be called \"Orthodox\" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called \"dati\" (\"religious\") or \"Haredi\" (\"ultra-Orthodox\") in Israel. The former term includes what is called Religious Zionism or the \"National Religious\" community (and also Modern Orthodox in US terms), as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as \"Hardal\" (\"Haredi-Leumi\", i. e., \"ultra-Orthodox nationalist\"), which combines a largely \"Haredi\" lifestyle with a nationalist (i. e., pro-Zionist) ideology.\n\nHaredi applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) \"Lithuanian\" (i. e., non-Hasidic) \"Haredim\" of Ashkenazic (i. e., \"Germanic\" - European) origin; (2) Hasidic \"Haredim\" of Ashkenazic (mostly of Eastern European) origin; and (3) Sephardic (including mizrahi) \"Haredim\".\n\nThere is also a growing baal teshuva (Jewish returners) movement of secular Israelis rejecting their previously secular lifestyles and choosing to become religiously observant, with many educational programs and yeshivas for them. An example is Aish HaTorah, which received open encouragement from some sectors within the Israeli establishment.\n\nAt the same time, there is also a significant movement in the opposite direction toward a secular lifestyle. There is some debate which trend is stronger at present. Recent polls show that ranks of secular Jewish minority in Israel continued to drop in 2009. Currently, the secular make up only 42%.\n\nConservative Judaism and Reform Judaism are represented among Israeli Jews. According to The Israel Democracy Institute, as of 2013, approximately 8 percent of Israel’s Jewish population \"identified\" with Reform and Conservative Judaism, a study by Pew Research Center showed 5% did, while a Midgam survey showed that one third \"especially identified with Progressive Judaism\", almost as many as those who especially identify with Orthodox Judaism. The Chief Rabbinate strongly opposes the Reform and Conservative movements, saying they are \"uprooting Judaism\", that they cause assimilation and that they have “no connection” to authentic Judaism. The chief rabbinate's view does not reflect the majority viewpoint of Israeli Jews, however. A survey of Israeli Jews published in May 2016 showed that 72 percent of respondents said they disagreed with the Haredi assertions that Reform Jews are not really Jewish. The survey also showed that a third of Israeli Jews \"identify\" with progressive (Reform or Conservative) Judaism and almost two thirds agree that Reform Judaism should have equal rights in Israel with Orthodox Judaism. The report was organized by the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism ahead of its 52nd biennial conference.\n\nThe religious status quo, agreed to by David Ben-Gurion with the Orthodox parties at the time of Israel's formation in 1948, is an agreement on the role that Judaism would play in Israel's government and the judicial system. The agreement was based upon a letter sent by Ben-Gurion to Agudat Israel dated 19 June 1947. Under this agreement, which still operates in most respects today:\n\nNevertheless, some breaches of the \"status quo\" have become prevalent, such as several suburban malls remaining open during the Sabbath. Though this is contrary to the law, the government largely turns a blind eye.\n\nWhile the state of Israel enables freedom of religion for all of its citizens, it does not enable civil marriage. The state forbids and disapproves of any civil marriages or non-religious divorces performed amongst within the country. Because of this, some Israelis choose to marry outside of Israel. Many parts of the \"status quo\" have been challenged by secular Israelis regarding the Chief Rabbinate's strict control over Jewish weddings, Jewish divorce proceedings, conversions, and the question of who is a Jew for the purposes of immigration.\n\nThe Ministry of Education manages the secular and Orthodox school networks of various faiths in parallel, with a limited degree of independence and a common core curriculum.\n\nIn recent years, perceived frustration with the \"status quo\" among the secular population has strengthened parties such as Shinui, which advocate separation of religion and state, without much success so far.\n\nToday the secular Israeli Jews claim that they aren't religious and don't observe Jewish law, and that Israel as a democratic modern country should not force the observance thereof upon its citizens against their will. The Orthodox Israeli Jews claim that the separation between state and religion will contribute to the end of Israel's Jewish identity.\n\nSigns of the first challenge to the status quo came in 1977, with the fall of the Labor government that had been in power since independence, and the formation of a right-wing coalition under Menachem Begin. Right-wing Revisionist Zionism had always been more acceptable to the Orthodox parties, since it did not share the same history of anti-religious rhetoric that marked socialist Zionism. Furthermore, Begin needed the Haredi members of the Knesset (Israel's unicameral parliament) to form his coalition, and offered more power and benefits to their community than what they had been accustomed to receiving, including a lifting of the numerical limit on military exemptions for those engaged in full-time Torah study.\n\nOn the other hand, secular Israelis began questioning whether a \"status quo\" based on the conditions of the 1940s and 1950s was still relevant in the 1980s and 1990s, and reckoned that they had cultural and institutional support to enable them to change it regardless of its relevance. They challenged Orthodox control of personal affairs such as marriage and divorce, resented the lack of entertainment and transportation options on the Jewish Sabbath (then the country's only day of rest), and questioned whether the burden of military service was being shared equitably, since the 400 scholars who originally benefited from the exemption, had grown to 50,000 . Finally, the Progressive and Conservative communities, though still small, began to exert themselves as an alternative to the Haredi control of religious issues. No one was happy with the \"status quo\"; the Orthodox used their newfound political force to attempt to extend religious control, and the non-Orthodox sought to reduce or even eliminate it.\n\nIn 2010 a report released by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics showed that 8% of Israel's Jewish population defines itself as ultra-Orthodox, 12% as Orthodox, 13% as traditional-religious, 25% as traditional, and 42% as secular, on a descending scale of religiosity. Among the Arab population it showed that 8% define themselves as very religious, 47% as religious, 27% as not very religious, and 18% as not religious.\n\nIt was during the British Mandate of Palestine that the British administration established an official dual Ashkenazi-Sephardi \"Chief Rabbinate\" (\"rabbanut harashit\") that was exclusively Orthodox, as part of an effort to consolidate and organize Jewish life based on its own model in Britain, which encouraged strict loyalty to the British crown, and in order to attempt to influence the religious life of the Jews in Palestine in a similar fashion. In 1921, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935) was chosen as the first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi and Rabbi Jacob Meir as the first Sephardi Chief Rabbi (\"Rishon LeTzion\"). Rabbi Kook was a leading light of the religious Zionist movement, and was acknowledged by all as a great rabbi of his generation. He believed that the work of secular Jews toward creating an eventual Jewish state in Eretz Yisrael was part of a divine plan for the settlement of the land of Israel. The return to Israel was in Kook's view not merely a political phenomenon to save Jews from persecution, but an event of extraordinary historical and theological significance.\n\nPrior to the 1917 British conquest of Palestine, the Ottomans had recognized the leading rabbis of the Old Yishuv as the official leaders of the small Jewish community that for many centuries consisted mostly of the devoutly Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe as well as those from the Levant who had made aliyah to the Holy Land, primarily for religious reasons. The European immigrants had unified themselves in an organization initially known as the \"Vaad Ha'ir\", which later changed its name to \"Edah HaChareidis\".The Turks viewed the local rabbis of Palestine as extensions of their own Orthodox Hakham Bashis (\"[Turkish] Chief Rabbi/s\") who were loyal to the Sultan.\n\nThus the centrality of an Orthodox dominated Chief Rabbinate became part of the new state of Israel as well when it was established in 1948. Based in its central offices at \"Heichal Shlomo\" in Jerusalem the Israeli Chief rabbinate has continued to wield exclusive control over all the Jewish religious aspects of the secular state of Israel. Through a complex system of \"advice and consent\" from a variety of senior rabbis and influential politicians, each Israeli city and town also gets to elect its own local Orthodox Chief Rabbi who is looked up to by substantial regional and even national religious and even non-religious Israeli Jews.\n\nThrough a national network of Batei Din (\"religious courts\"), each headed only by approved Orthodox Av Beit Din judges, as well as a network of \"Religious Councils\" that are part of each municipality, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate retains exclusive control and has the final say in the state about virtually all matters pertaining to conversion to Judaism, the Kosher certification of foods, the status of Jewish marriages and divorces, and monitoring and acting when called upon to supervise the observance of some laws relating to Shabbat observance, Passover (particularly when issues concerning the sale or ownership of Chametz come up), the observance of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee year in the agricultural sphere.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces also relies on the Chief Rabbinate's approval for its own Jewish chaplains who are exclusively Orthodox. The IDF has a number of units that cater to the unique religious requirements of the Religious Zionist yeshiva students through the Hesder program of combined alternating military service and yeshiva studies over several years.\n\nA poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in April and May 2014 of which institutions were most and least trusted by Israeli citizens showed that Israelis have little trust in the religious establishment. When asked which public institutions they most trusted, the Chief Rabbinate at 29% was one of the least trusted.\n\nThe Karaites are an ancient Jewish community that practices a form of Judaism distinct from Rabbinical Judaism, dating ostensibly to between the 7th and 9th centuries based on textual evidence, though they claim a tradition at least as old as other forms of Judaism with some tracing their origins to the Masoretes and the Sadducees. Once making up a significant proportion of the Jewish population, they are now an extreme minority compared to Rabbinical Judaism. Nearly the entirety of their population, between 30,000 and 50,000, currently live in Israel, and reside mainly in Ramla, Ashdod and Beer-Sheva. There are an estimated 10,000 additional Karaites living elsewhere around the world, mainly in the United States, Turkey, Poland, and elsewhere in Europe.\n\nOn December 7, 2016, the chief rabbis of Israel issued a new policy requiring that foreign Jewish converts be recognized in Israel, and vowed to release criteria required for recognizing rabbis who perform such conversions. Previously, such conversions were not required to be recognized. However, within one week the chief rabbis had retracted their earlier promise and instead appointed members to a joint committee of five rabbis who would formulate the conversion criteria.\n\nIsrael is home to the only significant populations of Samaritans in the world.\nAs of November 1, 2007, there were 712 Samaritans. The community lives almost exclusively in Kiryat Luza on Mount Gerizim and in Holon. Their traditional religious leader is the Samaritan High Priest, currently Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach. Ancestrally, they claim descent from a group of Israelite inhabitants from the tribes of Joseph (divided between the two \"half tribes\" of Ephraim and Manasseh), and the priestly tribe of Levi. Despite being counted separately in the census, for the purposes of citizenship, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate has classified them as Jews according to law.\n\nMost Christians living permanently in Israel are Arabs, or have come from other countries to live and work mainly in churches or monasteries, which have long and enduring histories in the land. Ten churches are officially recognized under Israel's confessional system, which provides for the self-regulation of status issues, such as marriage and divorce. These are the Roman (Latin rite), Armenian, Syriac, Chaldean, Melkite (Greek Catholic) and Maronite Catholic churches, Eastern Orthodox Greek Orthodox Church, and Syriac Orthodox churches, as well as Anglicanism.\n\nChristian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Maariv has described the Christian-Arab sector as \"the most successful in the education system\", since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. Arab Christians were also the vanguard in terms of eligibility for higher education, and they have attained bachelor's and academic degrees at higher rates than Jews, Druze or Muslims in Israel.\n\nAccording to historical and traditional sources, Jesus lived in the Land of Israel, and died and was buried on the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, making the land a Holy Land for Christianity. However, few Christians now live in the area, compared to Muslims and Jews. This is because Islam displaced Christianity in almost all of the Middle East, and the rise of modern Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel has seen millions of Jews migrate to Israel. Recently, the Christian population in Israel has increased with the immigration of foreign workers from a number of countries, and the immigration of accompanying non-Jewish spouses in mixed marriages. Numerous churches have opened in Tel Aviv.\n\nMost Christians in Israel belong primarily to branches of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches that oversee a variety of church buildings, monasteries, seminaries, and religious institutions all over the land, particularly in Jerusalem.\n\nProtestant Christians account for less than one percent of Israeli citizens, but foreign evangelical Protestants are a prominent source of political support for the State of Israel (see Christian Zionism). Each year hundreds of thousands of Protestant Christians come as tourists to see Israel.\n\nMessianic Judaism is a religious movement that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity. They worship God the Father as one person of the Trinity. They worship Jesus, whom they call \"Yeshua\". Messianic Jews believe that Jesus is the Messiah. They emphasise that Jesus was a Jew, as were his early followers. Most adherents in Israel reject traditional Christianity and its symbols, in favour of celebrating Jewish festivals. Although followers of Messianic Judaism are not considered Jews under Israel's Law of Return, there are an estimated 10,000 adherents in the State of Israel, both Jews and other non-Arab Israelis, many of them recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union. In Jerusalem, there are twelve Messianic congregations. On 23 February 2007, Israel Channel 2 News released a news documentary about the growing number of Messianic Jews in Israel. In Israel Jewish Christians themselves, go by the name \"Meshiykhiyyim\" (from Messiah, as found in the Franz Delitzsch Hebrew New Testament) rather than the traditional Talmudic name for Christians \"Notzrim\" (from Nazarene).\n\nJerusalem is a city of major religious significance for Muslims worldwide.\nAfter capturing the Old City of Jerusalem in 1967, Israel found itself in control of Mount Moriah, which was the site of both Jewish temples and Islam's third holiest site, after those in Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia: The \"Haram al Sharif\" (Temple Mount) from which Muslims believe that Mohammad ascended to Heaven. This mountain, which has the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent Al-Aqsa Mosque on it, is the third-holiest site in Islam (and the holiest in Judaism). Since 1967, the Israeli government has granted authority to a Waqf to administer the area. Rumors that the Israeli government are seeking to demolish the Muslim sites have angered Muslims. These beliefs are possibly related to excavations that have been taking place close to the Temple Mount, with the intention of gathering archeological remnants of the first and second temple period, as well as the stance of some rabbis and activists who call for its destruction to replace it with the Third Temple.\n\nMost Muslims in Israel are Sunni Arabs with a small minority of Ahmadi Arabs. From 1516 to 1917, the Sunni Ottoman Turks ruled the areas that now include Israel. Their rulership reinforced and ensured the centrality and importance of Islam as the dominant religion in the region. The conquest of Palestine by the British in 1917 and the subsequent Balfour Declaration opened the gates for the arrival of large numbers of Jews in Palestine who began to tip the scales in favor of Judaism with the passing of each decade. However, the British transferred the symbolic Islamic governance of the land to the Hashemites based in Jordan, and not to the House of Saud. The Hashemites thus became the official guardians of the Islamic holy places of Jerusalem and the areas around it, particularly strong when Jordan controlled the West Bank (1948–1967).\n\nIn 1922 the British had created the Supreme Muslim Council in the British Mandate of Palestine and appointed Amin al-Husayni (1895–1974) as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The council was disbanded by Jordan in 1951. Israeli Muslims are free to teach Islam to their children in their own schools, and there are a number of Islamic universities and colleges in Israel and the territories. Islamic law remains the law for concerns relating to, for example, marriage, divorce, inheritance and other family matters relating to Muslims, without the need for formal recognition arrangements of the kind extended to the main Christian churches. Similarly Ottoman law, in the form of the Mecelle, for a long time remained the basis of large parts of Israeli law, for example concerning land ownership.\n\nAhmadiyya is a small Islamic sect in Israel. The history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Israel begins with a tour of the Middle East in 1924 made by the second caliph of the Community Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad and a number of missionaries. However, the Community was first established in the region in 1928, in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. The first converts to the movement belonged to the \"Odeh\" tribe who originated from Ni'lin, a small village near Jerusalem. In the 1950s they settled in Kababir, a former village which was later absorbed by the city of Haifa. The neighbourhood's first mosque was built in 1931, and a larger one, called the Mahmood Mosque, in the 1980s. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Ahmadi Muslims can openly practice their Islamic faith. As such, Kababir, a neighbourhood on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel, acts as the Middle Eastern headquarters of the Community. It is unknown how many Israeli Ahmadis there are, although it is estimated there are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir.\n\nIsrael is home to about 102,000 Druze who follow their own gnostic religion. Self described as \"Ahl al-Tawhid\", and \"al-Muwaḥḥidūn\" (meaning \"People of Oneness\", and \"Unitarians\", respectively), the Druze live mainly in the Haifa area, Acre and Peki'in. Since 1957, the Israeli government has also designated the Druze a distinct ethnic community, at the request of the community's leaders. Until his death in 1993, the Druze community in Israel was led by Shaykh Amin Tarif, a charismatic figure regarded by many within the Druze community internationally as the preeminent religious leader of his time.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith has its administrative and spiritual centre in Haifa on land it has owned since Bahá'u'lláh's imprisonment in Acre in the early 1870s by the Ottoman Empire. The progress of these properties in construction projects was welcomed by the mayor of Haifa Amram Mitzna (1993–2003). As far back as 1969 a presence of Bahá'ís was noted mostly centered around Haifa in Israeli publications. Several newspapers in Israel since then have noted the presence of Bahá'ís in the Haifa area of some 6-700 volunteers with no salaries, getting only living allowances and housing, and that if an Israeli citizen were to wish to convert they would be told that \"the religion does not seek or accept converts in the State of Israel\" and that if they persist it is a personal matter between them and God and not a matter of joining a community of believers. Bahá'ís generally practice a \"staunch political quietism\" and \"do not engage in any missionary activity in Israel\". Even Bahá'ís from outside Israel are instructed to not \"teach\" the religion to citizens of Israel. The religion's situation in Israel was specified in an agreement signed in 1987 by then Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres as a \"recognized religious community in Israel\", that the \"holiest places of the Bahá'í Faith, … are located in Israel, and confirms that the Universal House of Justice is the Trustee of the Bahá'í International Community over the Holy Places of the Bahá'í Faith in Israel and over the Bahá’í endowments in Israel\". As such, self-identifying as Bahá'ís have been noted in Israel: in 1990 World Christian Encyclopedia estimated there were 9500 Bahá'ís; in 2000 near 14,000 were reported, and they continue to grow. Bahá'ís from other countries, wishing to visit Israel, are required to seek written permission from the Universal House of Justice prior to their visit for Bahá'í pilgrimage.\n\nThe small Hindu community in Israel is mostly made up of representatives of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In 2002, most of the devotees lived in Katzir-Harish.\n\nAlthough the exact number of adherents are unknown (one old estimate was 150 total), primarily due to societal stigma and persecution, a growing number of young Israelis are secretly reviving the pre-Judaic polytheistic worship of ancient Canaanite gods known as Semitic neopaganism. Additionally, others worship in different neopagan traditions such as Celtic, Norse, and Wiccan.\n\nJerusalem plays an important role in three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - and Haifa and Acre play a role in a fourth - Baha'i. Mount Gerizim is a holy site to what can be considered a fifth - Samaritanism. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. Jerusalem has been sacred to the Jews since the 10th century BC. The Western Wall, a remnant of the Second Temple, is a holy site for Jews, second only to the Temple Mount itself.\n\nChristianity reveres Jerusalem not only for its role in the Old Testament but also for its significance in the life of Jesus. The land currently occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past two thousand years. In 1889, the Ottoman Empire allowed the Catholic Church to re-establish its hierarchy in Palestine. Other ancient churches, such as the Greek, Armenian, Syrian, and Coptic churches are also well represented in Jerusalem.\n\nDespite not being explicitly mentioned in the Quran, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. The Temple Mount is topped by two Islamic landmarks intended to commemorate the event — al-Aqsa Mosque, derived from the name mentioned in the Quran, and the Dome of the Rock, which stands over the Foundation Stone, from which Muslims believe Muhammad ascended to Heaven. As for the importance of Haifa and Acre in Baha'i Faith, it is related to Bahá'u'lláh, who was imprisoned in Acre and spent his final years there. Mount Gerizim is the holiest site to Samaritans, who used it as the site of their temple.\n\nThe State of Israel generally respects freedom of religion. Freedom House reports: \"Freedom of religion is respected. Each community has jurisdiction over its own members in matters of marriage, burial, and divorce.\"\n\nReligious tensions exist between Jewish \"haredi\" and non-\"haredi\" Israeli Jews. \"Haredi\" Israeli males devote their young adulthood to full-time Talmudic studies and therefore generally get exemptions from military service in the Israel Defense Forces. Many leaders of \"haredi\" Judaism encourage these students to apply for exemptions from the mandatory army service, ostensibly to protect them from the secularizing influence of the Israeli army. Over the years, the number of exemptions has grown to about 10% of conscriptable manpower. Many secular Israelis consider these exemptions to be a systematic shirking of their patriotic duty by a large segment of society.\n\n\"Haredi\" Israelis are represented by \"haredi\" political parties, which like all smaller parties in a system of proportional representation may tend to wield disproportionate political power at the point when government coalitions need to be negotiated following national elections. , the two main Haredi parties in the Knesset are Shas, representing Sephardi and Mizrahi interests, and United Torah Judaism, an alliance of Degel HaTorah (Lithuanian Haredi) and Agudath Yisrael. The Shinui party was created as a backlash to the perceived influence of the \"haredi\" parties, and to represent the interests of secular Jews that supposedly were not seen to by the other non-religious parties.\n\nTension also exists between the Orthodox establishment and the Conservative and Reform movements. Only Orthodox Judaism is officially recognized in Israel (though conversions conducted by Conservative and Reform clergy outside of Israel may be accepted for the purposes of the Law of Return). As a result, Conservative and Reform synagogues receive minimal government funding and support. Conservative and Reform rabbis cannot officiate at religious ceremonies and any marriages, divorces, and conversions they perform are not considered valid. Conservative and Reform Jews have been prohibited from holding services at the Western Wall on the grounds that they violate Orthodox norms regarding participation of women.\n\nTensions exist surrounding Mehadrin bus lines, a type of bus line in Israel which mostly runs in and/or between major Haredi population centers, in which gender segregation are applied. Non-Haredi female passengers have complained of being harassed and forced to sit at the back of the bus. In a ruling of January 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice stated the unlawfulness of gender segregation and abolished the “mehadrin” public buses. However, the court rule allowed the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period.\n\nMessianic Jews who are members of Messianic congregations are among the most active missionary movements in Israel. Their proselytising has faced demonstrations and intermittent protests by the Haredi anti-missionary group \"Yad LeAchim\", which infiltrates those movements, as well as other proselytising groups including Hare Krishna and Scientology, and maintains extensive records on their activities. Attempts by Messianic Jews to evangelize other Jews are seen by many religious Jews as incitement to \"avodah zarah\" (foreign worship or idolatry). Over the years there have been several arson attempts of messianic congregations. There have also been attacks on Messianic Jews and hundreds of New Testaments distributed in Or Yehuda were burned. While missionary activity itself is not illegal in Israel, it is illegal to offer money or other material inducements. Legislation banning missionary work outright has been attempted in the past.\n\nSome Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel have come under scrutiny for the negative stereotyping and scapegoating of Christian minorities in the region, including violent acts against Christian missionaries and communities. \nA frequent complaint of Christian clergy in Israel is being spat at by Jews, often haredi yeshiva students. The Anti-Defamation League has called on the chief Rabbis to speak out against interfaith assaults. In January 2010, Christian leaders, Israeli Foreign ministry staff, representatives of the Jerusalem municipality and the Haredi community met to discuss the problem. The Haredi Community Tribunal of Justice published a statement condemning the practice, stating that it was a \"desecration of God's name\". Several events were planned in 2010 by the liberal Orthodox Yedidya congregation to show solidarity with Christians and improve relations between the Haredi and Christian communities of Jerusalem.\n\nCurrently, Israel issues marriage licenses if performed under an official religious authority (whether it be Orthodox Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Druze, etc.) only between a man and a woman of the same religion. Civil marriages were officially sanctioned only if performed abroad, but 2010 changes in Israeli law allow secular marriage in Israel for people that have proven to lack any religion also. This is a major issue among secular groups, as well as adherents to non-Orthodox streams of Judaism. There is fear that civil marriage will divide the Jewish people in Israel between those who can marry Jews and those who cannot, leading to concerns over retaining the character of the Jewish state.\n\nThe census results are in thousands.\n\nIn 2011, non-Arab Christians, estimated to number 25,000, were counted as \"Jews and others\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38106744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38106744", "title": "SEED-SCALE", "text": "SEED-SCALE\n\nSEED-SCALE describes a comprehensive theory of social change sometimes also categorized as social development theory. SEED-SCALE can be used both to tell how to implement change and/or it can be used to analyze social change. SEED-SCALE's distinguishing feature is its focus on human energy as the primary currency that causes people to change behaviors.\n\nNormative thinking is that by allocating money to social programs (funding a health service, starting a micro-finance program, providing subsidies for agriculture, etc.) that intentional social action happens. SEED-SCALE does not deny the impact of budget driven projects. However, it suggests that a more available and sustainable approach is redirecting how people apply their energies. \"Money is powerful because other people want it or because every all want it… This means, among other things, that if it is taken to be the central factor in social change initiatives, those who do not have it (including countries, including people—the people who need it most) are powerless.\"\n\nSEED-SCALE notes that human energy is a resource that is already present, already being used in every community in the world. If the community exists, it has energy. The opportunity is to use that resource more effectively & timely. There are many types of relevant human energies: individual labor, cooperation, creativity, monitoring, learning, and the like. SEED-SCALE is an application of emergence within complexity theory, articulating how social change \"emerges\" with socio-economic development specific to each context of society, economics, and natural environment shaped by the interaction of these relationships; noting that the socio-economic product is not the result of inputs to the system (classical development thinking) but is the result of how relationships form within the system as a result of principle interaction (emergence).\n\nSEED-SCALE builds out of the most forward economic thinking, such as former World Bank economist, Paul Collier, \"change in societies at the very bottom must come primarily from within.\" Professor Dani Rodrik at Harvard, frames economic growth at the scale level as a consequence of growth aggregated from the local level, growing within the existing larger framework. Local growth occurs not because of inputs from outside but because it has figured out how to occur within the local situation of policies, stimuli, and resources.\n\nThe origins of SEED-SCALE began in UNICEF in 1992—when the then Executive Director James P. Grant was seeking a more accurate understanding of how to take successful pilot projects (\"seeds\") and to extend these to national level impact (\"scale\"). From the initial 1992 UNICEF charge two publications resulted. These publications were presented at the World Summit for Social Development, Copenhagen, March 1995.\n\nSEED-SCALE resides within the larger field of emergence and complexity theory. The thesis is that social change occurs within the complex intersection of people's values, economic dynamics, and environmental conditions (the socio-econo-info-biosphere), and that to either understand or to act in that complex world, answers do not directly follow from actions; they \"emerge\" out of interacting relationships in almost incomprehensible ways, obvious perhaps after the fact but impossible to predict ahead of time.\n\nRecent articulation of empowerment as basis of social change championed by Robert Chambers, who led in the development of participatory research and action (also called participatory rural appraisal) (PRA) \"astonished by the analytical abilities of poor people. Whether literate or not, whether children, women, or men, they showed that they could map, list, rank, score, and diagram better than professionals.\" Key contributions to the thinking also came from asset-based community development (ABCD) and the theory of positive deviance.\n\nSEED is an acronym for \"Self Evaluation for Effective Decision-making\". SCALE is an acronym for \"Systems for Communities to Adapt Learning and Expand\".\n\nDeep fundamental change happens because of what people do (not what they are given, not what is done to them). When people learn to make use of what they have, where they are, today—then people are moving forward to a future that they can shape according to their priorities.\nA feedback loop, a revolution of rising aspirations, gets started—where people's hopes cause them to work, then that work produces returns, those returns prompt further work, and this circle calls more people in working with their aspirations. As actions get fulfilled and cause new aspirations, what unfolds is society using what it has, for what it wants, and now calling in resources and action from outside.\n\n\nDiscussions of the four principles are at:\n\n\n\nThe scaling up process is a feedback loop of rising quality of life that then draws a rising number of participants into it. As more people become involved, their energy stimulates demand for further rising quality of life (typically moving cross sectors such as from health to income generation). Then the rising quality of life draws in more people. The cycle goes on of numerical growth feeding qualitative so long as there is an enabling environment for such of policies and learning that draws on local resource base or distant resources that can be accessed from locales.\n\nFuture Generations Graduate School (FGGS) 2015 class, on a residential in India learned on the practical applicability of the SEED Scale in Sevagram (Feb. 09-March 12, 2014).\nIt is an empowering concept that can grow to scale any initiative in the local community whose benefits are long lasting.This is an alternative development paradigm. The different economic development models which have been existing have all but shown their limits. SEED scale appears to be a good alternative for African countries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1560852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1560852", "title": "Sabra (person)", "text": "Sabra (person)\n\nA Sabra (, \"tzabar\") is a Jew born on Israeli territory. The term first appeared in the 1930s to refer to a Jew who had been born in the land of Israel (inclusive of the British Mandate of Palestine and Ottoman Palestine; \"cf. New Yishuv & Old Yishuv\"). Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Israelis have used the word to refer to a Jewish person born anywhere in Israel.\n\nThe term alludes to a tenacious, thorny desert plant, known in English as prickly pear, with a thick skin that conceals a sweet, softer interior. The cactus is compared to Israeli Jews, who are supposedly tough on the outside, but delicate and sweet on the inside.\n\nIn 2010, over 4,000,000 Israeli Jews (70%) were sabras, with an even greater percentage of Israeli Jewish youths falling into this category. In 2015, about 75% of Israel's Jewish population was native-born.\n\nAccording to \"The Dictionary of Slang (Hebrew)\" by Israeli linguist Ruvik Rosenthal, Jewish immigrants to Palestine began using the term in the early 1930s. The term was used by the Zionist movement, to celebrate the \"New Jew\" that emerged in the Holy Land. Unlike the bourgeois \"Old Jew\" born in the diaspora, the \"New Jew\" was a kibbutz member or a farmer. The \"Old Jew\" often spoke broken Hebrew with a heavy accent, while the sabra spoke the language as a mother tongue. Unlike the \"Old Jew\" who did not fight for his self-defense, the Sabra fought in the Jewish resistance movements, in the Palmach and after the establishment of Israel in the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nAn important influence on the Sabra personality was considered the participation in national youth movements, (such as the Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed, Hashomer Hatzair and Hatsofim) followed by the universal participation in military service for both sexes.\n\nThe sociological characteristics of the sabra were examined by Oz Almog in his book \"The Sabra: The Creation of the New Jew\". According to Almog the term \"Tzabar\" originated from the insult \"Sabras\" directed towards migrants of the First Aliyah (which consisted of the first generation of native born members of the Zionist movement) by migrants of the Second Aliyah and the Third Aliyah. The changing of the meaning of the term, to emphasize the softer interior rather than the roughness, was done by the journalist Uri Kesari who published an essay, \"We Are the Leaves of the Sabra!\", on 18 April 1931 in the newspaper Doar HaYom in which he argued against the discrimination which was cast against the native-born by the new immigrants.\n\nThe prestige of the Sabra increased during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Israeli public, and especially the older generation, tended to attribute the achievements of the war to the country's \"sabras\", while minimizing the part of the new immigrants and other groups. Even descriptions of the achievements of Operation Kadesh (1956) emphasized the image of the Sabra. The large immigration to Israel of Jews from Muslim countries during the 1950s, the penetration of Western culture and primarily the American culture, as well as the social and political changes which were created following the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, resulted in a decline of the use of the term after the 1970s.\n\nIn relation, those who were born in the country after independence in 1948 became known as the \"Dor haMedina\" (), or \"Statehood Generation\", and have been largely described by cultural commentators as being motivated less by the strident nationalism and/or socialism of the pre-independence generations and more by a general cultural pragmatism and sensitivity to the mass-cultural output of Western powers.\n\nThe Sabra received an artistic and symbolic representation in the form of the illustrated character \"Srulik\" (which wears shorts, sandals and a Tembel hat), created by cartoonist Dosh. Another character which became famous was the Israeli children's television character Kishkashta, a talking anthropomorphic cactus.\n\nThe English form of the word, Sabra, served Israeli manufacturers who wanted to brand their products as typical Israeli products, which was sold in the foreign markets. As a result, \"Sabra liqueur\" and \"Sabra sport\" (the sports model of the \"Sussita\") were created. The world's largest hummus manufacturer (as of 2009) is a U.S. company called the Sabra Dipping Company.\n\nIn popular culture, an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" contained a skit entitled \"Sabra Price Is Right\" featuring Tom Hanks as the guest host. The skit was written by Robert Smigel and is a parody of Israel-born Jews making bargains with people who believe this show is \"The Price Is Right\". In the skit, Hanks' character \"Uri Shurinson\" and the other Sabra are swindling the contestants, conning them into purchasing shoddy products (a Summit clock-radio, a \"Pinnacle satellite dish\" that's a v-aerial, a cordless phone that's a defective rotary phone, a microwave that's a toaster oven, a CD-player that's a child's bank, and a defective buzzer from the game show itself) for which they guess the price rather than winning them. The skit concludes with an Arab portrayed by Dana Carvey who bargains in the same manner as the Sabra and in the middle of their argument, they all \"disco\" as the skit concludes. A skit featured in an earlier SNL episode was entitled \"Sabra Shopping Network\" and also featured Uri (Tom Hanks) and his crew, this time bargaining with callers phoning into a television shopping show.\n\nThe American comedy film \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\" plays heavily on sabra stereotypes in an amicable manner.\n\nThe first \"sabra\" to exercise the powers of the office of the Prime Minister of Israel was Yigal Allon, who served as acting prime minister from February to March 1969; he was born in Kfar Tavor. The first \"sabra\" to serve as Prime Minister rather than acting Prime Minister was Yitzhak Rabin, who first held the office 1974–77, and then again 1992–1995. Since Rabin first took office, there have been four other \"sabra\" Prime Ministers: the current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is the first and (so far) only \"sabra\" Prime Minister to have been born in the modern state after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948; he first took office in 1996, before leaving office in 1999 and returning in 2009. Furthermore, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, and Ehud Olmert were all born in what is now the territory of the State of Israel during the Mandate period.\n\nIn addition to Netanyahu being the first of the Statehood Generation to serve as Prime Minister, Avraham Burg, speaker of the Knesset from 1999-2003, was also the first Speaker to have been born in the modern state since 1948.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31786467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31786467", "title": "Sudanese refugees in Chad", "text": "Sudanese refugees in Chad\n\nBy January 2011 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that there are 262,900 Sudanese refugees in Chad. The majority of them left Sudan escaping from the violence of the ongoing Darfur crisis, which began in 2003. UNHCR has given the Sudanese refugees shelter in 12 different camps situated along the Chadian-Sudanese border. The most pressing issues UNHCR has to deal with in the refugee camps in Chad are related to insecurity in the camps, (where children are being forcibly recruited by Chadian and Sudanese armed groups), malnutrition, access to water, HIV and AIDS, and education.\n\nSudan and Chad are both guests and hosts to thousands of refugees from the other country. There are 304,650 Sudanese refugees in Chad as of April, 2016 and 8,000 Chadian refugees in Sudan, the majority of which sought refuge escaping from violence and conflicts.\n\nDroughts, famines and political and armed conflicts have pushed Chadians and Sudanese alike in and out of their territories. For instance, Chadians have sought refuge in Sudan during the 1913-4 famine, the 1973 drought, and between 1979 and 1982 Sudan hosted 16,000 supporters of the Chadian leader Hissene Habre.\n\nSudan and Chad have also shared seasonal migratory patterns, in particular the area inhabited by the Masalit people, an ethnic group that shares a common language and that was separated when the contemporary borders of the states of Sudan and Chad were drawn. This seasonal migration entails the displacement of people between southeastern Chad and Darfur (Sudan), being the dry season when people are more mobile, roads are open and regional markets are integrated. Chadians move to southeastern areas into Sudan looking for food, water and income until the rainy seasons, when they return to their villages and sow their crops.\n\nSince the time Sudan became independent in 1956 from the British and Egyptian condominium, it has experienced 21 years of civil wars between the North and the South. The war ended with signature of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005, which stipulated the autonomy of South Sudan for six years followed by a referendum of self-determination that took place in January 2011. Southern Sudanese voters overwhelmingly opted for the independence of South Sudan, which will become a separate and independent state on 9 July 2011.\n\nIn 2003 the conflicts over land and water that had been ongoing in Darfur for decades took the shape of a civil war when the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) announced their existence and started fighting against the Janjaweed, a tribal militia backed by the Sudanese central government that had been attacking and razing villages in Darfur for a number of years. Since 2003, at least 300,000 people have been killed and 1.8 million people have been displaced in Darfur. The Darfur crisis still continues. In the first four months of 2011 more than 70,000 people have fled their homes and taken refuge in camps established for displaced persons in Darfur. The Obama administration is pushing towards solving the conflict in Darfur before the independence of South Sudan, although reaching a peace agreement remains unlikely.\n\nOverall, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated in the end of 2010 that between 1.2 and 1.7 million Sudanese live abroad, and that neighboring countries were hosting more than half of them. Since the signature of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, the Sudanese government, in cooperation with UNHCR, has signed tripartite agreements with Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and Uganda in order to organize the return of Sudanese refugees. The year 2007 registered a peak of returnees, 126,000, which has been decreasing during the following years: 70,000 in 2008 and 30,000 in 2009, the majority of which returned from Uganda. These return programs have efficiently reduced the number of Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries, which went from 635,000 in 2006 to the current figure of 390,000. Almost all of them have refugee status or protection (around 385,117) and live in Chad, Egypt, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nChad hosts the largest community of Sudanese refugees, approximately 262,900 by the beginning of 2011, of whom 248,700 are assisted by the UNHCR in camps located along the Chadian-Sudanese border. Due to the renewal of fighting in Darfur between the rebel group Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudanese government, approximately 5,000 Sudanese have crossed the border to Chad in April 2010. The second largest group of refugees in Chad is from the Central African Republic, approximately 73,500 persons. In addition, the UNHCR also gives assistance to 157,200 internally displaced persons, 1,500 returnees and 35,000 displaced returnees. The total number of people assisted by UNHCR on January 2011 were 530,590. This large number is a reflection of the conflicts and the general insecurity that proliferate in this region of Africa.\n\nMost of the Sudanese refugees that arrive to Chad are escaping from the Darfur crisis. UNHCR has established 12 camps to house them near along the border with Sudan. The camps are organized in different sectors divided by wide dirt roads, which are at the same time divided in blocks. Every refugee camp has a medical center, schools and a market, where refugees can buy or sell clothes, vegetables and goat meat. There is also a point for food distribution in each camp, to where World Food Program trucks bring the food rations (packages consisting of flour, vegetable oil, some cereal grains, sugar and salt) that are distributed to women on a monthly basis. Each family is provided a tent, which has an open fireplace for cooking and a storage place for firewood.\n\nUNHCR is facing real obstacles in maintaining security in and around the camps. For years now refugees and international organization have reported thousands of human trafficking cases in the camps, where boys between the age of nine and fifteen are being recruited, forcibly or willingly, by Chadian and Sudanese armed groups. In 2007, the UN estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 boys had been forcibly recruited in Chad to become soldiers.\n\nUNICEF is putting a great effort on dealing with this problem, and from 2007 to 2010 it had demobilized more than 800 child soldiers, most of whom had been recruited into Chadian rebel groups. In June 2010, the Chadian government together with five other Central African countries agreed on the \"N’Djamena Declaration\" which calls on stopping child recruitment in armed groups and on the integration of child soldiers into civilian society.\n\nChildren in the Chadian refugee camps are also vulnerable to gender-based violence, sexual harassment, prostitution and early marriage. UNICEF has reported that girls as young as 12 are forced to marry and bear children.\n\nInsecurity has prevented nutrition surveys in the camps in 2009 ad 2010. According to a survey conducted in August 2008, acute malnutrition is still found among 10 percent of the camps’ population. Despite the precarious situation, it represents an improvement if compared with to 2004 (over 30 percent) and 2005 (more than 25 percent), when most of the refugees were arriving.\n\nIn the camps located in northeastern Chad access to potable water is still a main challenge. At the beginning of 2011 UNHCR placed as a priority in this area the completion of boreholes and the installation of manual pumps in order to reduce dependency on electrical equipment. Provision of water in the refugee camps is 15 liters per day.\n\nAccording to UNHCR the risk of HIV and AIDS has been reduced due to prevention activities.\n\nIn 2005 primary schools and education centers were established in the refugee camps with an enrollment capacity of 44,000 children. Schooling in the camps has entailed for half of the children their first chance to learn how to read and write. According to UNICEF, these schools and centers do not only provide education, but also \"a sense of routine and normalcy for children caught up in conflict\", access to clean water and sanitation, physical protections for refugee children and also for Chadian children from neighboring villages. UNHCR’s strategies for 2011 regarding education is to improve its quality, build more schools and provide expand the post-primary education programs.\n\n"}

Opposition to the highway by local indigenous communities, environmentalists, as well as shifting relations between the Bolivian government and the project's builders and funders interrupted construction of Segment I from October 2011 until October 2013, indefinitely delayed Segment II, and postponed construction of Segment III until June 2015. The government has pledged to improve standards of living in the region before continuing with Segment II.\n\nWhile the highway has been discussed for decades, a $332 million loan from Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), approved by Bolivia in 2011, facilitated the start of construction. Under the terms of the loan, the Brazilian construction firm OAS was to build the road. In June 2011, President Evo Morales inaugurated the project with a ceremony at Villa Tunari. However, neither a final design nor environmental approval had been released for Segment II. Opposition from indigenous residents in the Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS) and environmentalists led to a protracted public conflict about the highway, ending with the prohibition of highway passing through the park. President Morales has stated that the controversy over the highway has \"instilled fear\" in potential financial backers of other highway projects in the country.\n\nThe government has remained publicly committed to the project while revising its timeline. The segment of the road from Villa Tunari to Insinuta was built between 2013 and 2016; the northern segment from Monte Grande and San Ignacio de Moxos is under construction. While Segment II within TIPNIS remains prohibited, initial construction work on the highway there was carried out in 2017. An August 2017 law repealed special protections for the park and authorized the drafting of a transportation plan for TIPNIS.\n\nProposals for a highway linking the region of San Ignacio de Moxos with Cochabamba have been raised perennially in the history of the region.\n\nIgnacio Flores, the Spanish governor of Mojos proposed opening a road from Cochabamba to Mojos via the Chapare in 1780. The purpose of the proposal was threefold: to encourage re-settlement of Cochabambinos in the region, where they could grow coca, sugar and other crops; to assist in the civilizing of the Yuracaré people, most of whom continued to resist missionary influence; and to bring Mojos into the economic orbit of Cochabamba, bypassing the control of Santa Cruz de la Sierra.\n\nThe proposed route is divided into three segments, numbered from south to North. Segment I from Villa Tunari to Isinuta (), Segment II from Isinuta to Santo Domingo (), and Segment III from Santo Domingo to San Ignacio de Moxos (). Current work on Segment III begins at Monte Grande, covering the northern 76 km of this segment.\nOAS, a Brazilian infrastructure corporation, won the contract to build the highway in 2008. Bolivia and the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) signed Financial Collaboration Contract N° 10219991 on February 15, 2011, in which the bank extended a $332-million loan to support construction. OAS' work on the road lasted from June 2011 to April 2012, although Segment II was halted in October 2011. On April 10, 2012, President Morales announced the cancellation of the contract, citing delays in construction as well as other technical failures on the part of OAS. The Brazilian development bank, which had agreed to the loan financing the bulk of the project contingent on the use of OAS, immediately withdrew its funding and has stated that not one dollar of the loan was disbursed.\n\nOn October 6, 2012, a new contract assigned $32.5 million for the construction of the 47-km Segment I from Villa Tunari and Insinuta. The newly created state-owned Bolivian Enterprise for Construction (, EBC) and the local, cocalero-owned Association for Road Maintenance (A\"sociación de Mantenimiento Vial\"; AMVI) were awarded the contract. They resumed construction on October 24, 2013, and are obligated to complete their work by September 9, 2015. As of December 2013, the firms reported 30% completion of their work on the segment. Segment II was finally completed in 2016, and was formally opened on September 11.\n\nOn June 27, 2015, a binational Bolivian-Venezuelan military unit began construction of Segment III from San Ignacio de Moxos to Santo Domingo. The government announced that $144 million would be invested in building this northern segment. On May 29, 2016, President Morales announced a $20 million government investment through the Agency for the Development of Macroregions and Frontier Zones (\"Agencia para el Desarrollo de las Macroregiones y Zonas Fronterizas\"; ADEMAF) to build the earthen platform and embankment of this road in the northern 76 kilometer stretch of this road, from Monte Grande to San Ignacio de Moxos. Construction passed to the Social Engineering Directorate (\"Dirección de Ingeniería Social\") of ADEMAF. In April 2017, ADEMAF described the platform as 60 to 80% complete, \"despite the rains and whirlwind which had wiped [it] out\"; the project resumed in late May.\n\nIn July 2017, TIPNIS community members reported that construction is underway on two bridges for Segment II of the highway inside the park, and offered photographic evidence of it. The newspaper \"El Deber\" confirmed that construction is underway at a bridge 6.7 km north of Insinuta and that construction firms Sergut and Incotec are working on the project under a contract with the Bolivian Highway Administration. Incotec's executive president told the paper that the contract has a confidentiality clause. Minister of Public Works, Milton Claros, testified in September 2017 that these bridges are authorized by Supreme Decree 1146 (of February 24, 2012) and an Environment and Water Ministry resolution of February 4, 2014. (He had denied, the previous month, that there was any active highway project inside TIPNIS.) According to Minister Claros, the three bridges are:\n\nIn March 2018, Fernando Vargas, ex-president of the Subcentral TIPNIS, estimated that two of the bridges are about 60% complete.\n\nIn May 2010, the a meeting of TIPNIS Subcentral and corregidores throughout the territory stated their \"overwhelming and unrenounceable opposition\" to the project. In July 2011, following the beginning of construction the Subcentral TIPNIS (the representative institution of indigenous residents in the territory), the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia, and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ announced they would participate in a national march opposing the project.\n\nA major concern about the impact of the road is its contribution to deforestation: \"Empirical evidence has shown that highways are motors for deforestation\" concluded a study of the project by the Program for Strategic Investigation in Bolivia (PIEB). The study projected that the road would markedly accelerate deforestation in the park, leaving up to 64% of TIPNIS deforested by 2030. A technical report submitted by the Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) established that the direct deforestation caused by the road itself would only be 0.03%; similarly, President Morales has spoken of a 180-hectare deforestation, an area equivalent to a rectangle 180 km long and 10 m wide.\nAccording to the last government survey 49 of 64 communities in TIPNIS are in favour of the construction of the road.\n\nThe Subcentral, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ carried out a national march from Trinidad, Beni to La Paz in opposition to the project, beginning on August 15, 2011. On September 25, a police raid on the march resulted in the detention of hundreds of marchers, who were later released. The march regrouped and arrived in La Paz on October 19 to a massive public welcome. During the march, other movements such as the Cochabamba campesino confederation and the \"colonos\" union in Yucumo mobilized in favor of the project. In early October, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly passed legislation authored by the MAS authorizing the road following a consultation process, but indigenous deputies and the indigenous movement opposed the bill. At the opening of negotiations with the protesters on October 21, Morales announced that he would veto the legislation and support the text proposed by the indigenous deputies. This text was passed by the Assembly and signed into law on October 24, effectively ending the conflict. Law 180 of 2011 declares TIPNIS an intangible zone and prohibits the construction of highways that cross it.\n\nBeginning in December 2011, the Bolivian government rallied supporters of the highway, in Cochabamba, San Ignacio de Moxos, and the southernmost port of TIPNIS, in a campaign to reverse Law 180. Conisur, an organization of communities living in Polygon 7 at the south of TIPNIS, led its own pro-highway march from December 19 in the territory to January 2012 in La Paz. While Conisur demand that Law 180 simply be annulled, the government proposed instead to conduct a \"prior consultation\" of TIPNIS indigenous communities on the question of the highway as well as Law 180's declaration of the highway as an intangible zone. This proposal was passed as Law 222 on February 10, 2012. Non-CONISUR TIPNIS communities and their traditional leaders rejected the proposed consultation declaring that it \"is not free, but rather is being imposed by force; is not informed, insofar as there is manipulation of information concerning the reach and effects of this law, which are hidden by the state … and does not deal in good faith\" The Subcentral TIPNIS and CIDOB organized a new 62-day march opposing the consultation which reached La Paz in June, but their demands were not attended to by the government.\n\nThe Plurinational Electoral Organ took on the task of carrying out the community consultation, visiting communities in the territory from July 29 through December 3, 2012. According to the official count, 58 communities of the 69 within TIPNIS participated and 55 of them supported the road, while 57 rejected the \"intangibility\" of the territory imposed by Law 180. However, a human rights observation mission led by the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights of Bolivia (APDHB), the Inter-American Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), and the Catholic Church from November 29 to December 14 reached a different conclusion. They found that \"of the 36 communities visited by FIDH and APDHB, only 19 stated having been consulted, and 30 communities rejected construction of the road.\" The observers also described \"numerous irregularities in the consultation process\" and denounced that \"the communities consulted reported having received gifts, having been pressured or being imposed restrictions in exchange for acceptance of the consultation; some were coerced through the suspension of development projects in case of refusal.\"\n\nCoinciding the publication of the consultation's results in April 2013, three laws were envisioned to address the future of the territory and the road project: one annulling Law 180, a second instituting environmental safeguards, and a third preventing further occupation of the territory by coca growers. However, legislative leaders and Minister of Public Works Vladimir Sánchez announced that the government would prioritize eliminating extreme poverty in TIPNIS through the end of 2014, and defer any action on the highway project and the suggested laws. Alex Ferrier, the governor of Beni after the 2015 elections, has pledged to advance the project.\n\nIn May 2015, Conisur announced that it held a gathering of pro-road communities who called for Segment II to be built. Later that month, Emilio Noza of the Subcentral Isiboro Sécure-Tipnis and Fernando Vargas president of the Subcentral Tipnis declared that their member communities continue to oppose the road and stating that a Subcentral Tipnis representative had confirmed that no such gathering had been held, as claimed, in Santa Trinidad.\n\nIn 2017, the governing MAS party introduced legislation to repeal the intangibility protections of Law 180 and to authorize the drafting of a transportation plan. This law, the Law for the Protection, Integral and Sustainable Development of TIPNIS (), was enacted as Law 266 on August 13, 2017.\n"}
