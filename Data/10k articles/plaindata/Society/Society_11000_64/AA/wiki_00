The event has been termed “the robbery of the century” and “mega-robbery” by the media, and is the “biggest heist in Paraguay’s history\".\n\nIn the night, about 50 to 80 heavily-armed robbers closed off the perimeter of the office with cars and, during a three hour assault, were reportedly able to access at least one of the three vaults of the company. One police officer was killed, and several people were wounded. The robbers were thought to have taken between 8 million to 40 million USD. According to Prosegur, 8 million USD were missing from one vault.\n\nAuthorities have assumed that the robbers came from and returned to Brazil where an apparent staging house was found across the border in Foz do Iguaçu. A subgroup of the robbers was reported to be intercepted in Itaipulandia resulting in a gun battle during which three suspects were killed and four arrested. Additional suspects were arrested in Parana. Paraguayan police suspects that the First Capital Command (PCC), a criminal Brazilian gang, may be behind the robbery.\n\nSeveral police chiefs of Ciudad del Este were fired after the robbery by the interior minister.\n"}

The ages of consent are currently set between 14 and 18. The vast majority of countries set their ages in the range of 14 to 16; only four countries, Cyprus (17), Ireland (17), Turkey (18) and Vatican City (18), do not fit into this pattern. The laws can also stipulate the specific activities that are permitted or differentially specify the age at which a given sex can participate. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age is that at which, or above which, an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. In 2014, the self-declared state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lifted the ban on sodomy, decriminalizing homosexual sex. All jurisdictions in Europe have an equal and gender-neutral age limit.\n\nThe below is a list of all jurisdictions in Europe as listed in List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe.\n\nNeither the European Union nor the Council of Europe have suggested any specific age of consent, and there has not been any effort so far to standardize the age across member states. However, most countries in Europe now have binding legal obligations in regard to the sexual abuse of children under 18. The Lanzarote Convention, which came into effect in 2011, obligates the countries that ratify it to criminalize certain acts concerning children under 18, such as the involvement of such children in prostitution and pornography. Other acts that must be criminalized include:\n\n\"Engaging in sexual activities with a child (child is defined in Article 3 as \"person under the age of 18 years\") where:\n\nThe age of consent is called \"the legal age for sexual activities\" and must be chosen by states at the age they see fit. (No specific age is recommended.) As of September 2018, the convention has been ratified by 44 states, while another 3 states have signed but not yet ratified the convention.\n\nIn the European Union (EU 28), there is a directive regarding the sexual abuse of children under 18, known as \"Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography\".\n\nSince 2001, the age of consent in Albania is 14, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. In the case of a girl, however, sex is illegal if she is over 14 but has not reached \"sexual maturity\", as provided by article 100 of the criminal code.\n\nThe age of consent in Andorra is 14, as specified by Article 147 of the penal code, which reads: \"Whoever carries out a sexual act with a person younger than fourteen years ... shall be punished with imprisonment for between three months and three years.\"\n\nAs specified by Articles 148 and 149, it is illegal - regardless of age - for a person occupying a position of authority or superiority over a person to engage in sexual activity with them, or when it involves the abuse of trust or situation of need or dependence. The penalty is more severe when the subject is below the age of 18.\n\nThe age of consent in Armenia is 16.\n\n\"Article 141. Sexual acts with a person under 16.\"\n\n\"Sexual intercourse or other sexual acts with a person obviously under 16, by a person who reached 18 years of age, in the absence of elements of crime envisaged in Articles 138, 139 or 140 of this Code, is punished with correctional labor for the term of up to 2 years, or with imprisonment for the term of up to 2 years.\"\n\nThe general age of consent in Austria is 14, as specified by Section 206 of the penal code. (The term \"unmündig\" is specified in Section 74 of the penal code.) Paragraph 4 of Section 206 defines a close-in-age exception of maximum three years.\n\n\"However\", Section 207b of the penal code contains an exception to the general age of consent: if one of the partners is \"younger than 16 years\" of age and \"not sufficiently mature to understand the significance of the act\", then the act is punishable.\n\nThe offence \"initiating sexual contacts with minors under 14 through the use of computer system\" is punishable by two years' imprisonment (Section 208a Penal Code).\n\nThe Austrian Criminal Code previously specified 18 as the age of consent for male homosexual sex in which the other partner was aged 14–18, while no equivalent provision existed for heterosexual sexual conduct; this was Section 209 of the Criminal Code. In November 1996, an amendment was put before the Austrian Parliament to remove Section 209; but the vote ended in a draw, and the amendment failed to pass. In July 1998, a similar amendment was put forward; it was voted down by the conservative majority. Section 209 came into force when homosexuality between males became legal in 1971.\n\nOn 24 June 2002, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that Section 209 was unconstitutional. The Section was later repealed on 14 August 2002. On 9 January 2003, the European Court of Human Rights held, in \"L & V v Austria\", that Section 209 violated Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe age of consent in Azerbaijan is 16.\n\n\"Article 152\"\n\n\"Sexual intercourse with the person below the age of 16 years, as well as the same offences linked with satisfaction of sexual passion in perverted forms shall be\n\"punished by imprisonment up to 3 years\".\"\n\nThe age of consent in Belarus is 16, as specified by Articles 168 and 169, which read: \"\"Sexual relations, sodomy, lesbian acts or other actions of sexual character of an adult, reached eighteen years of age, with a person who obviously has not reached sixteen years of age, at absence of attributes of the crimes stipulated by articles 166 and 167 present codes, are punished by restriction of freedom of two years to four years or by imprisonment of two years to five years.\" and \"Dissolute actions accomplished by a person, reached eighteen years of age, concerning a person who obviously has not reached sixteen years of age, at absence of attributes of the crimes stipulated by articles 166, 167 and 168 present codes, are punished by arrest of about six months or imprisonment of one year to three years.\"\n\nThe age of consent in Belgium is 16, as specified by Article 372 of the Criminal Code (Code pénal/Strafwetboek), which reads:\n\n\"Any indecent assault committed without violence or threat on the person or with the assistance of the person of a child of either sex, aged less than sixteen, shall be punished by imprisonment (of five years to ten years).\"\n\nThe Belgian Criminal Code previously specified an age of consent of 18 for homosexual sex. This provision - Article 372bis - was added in 1965 and repealed in 1985.\n\nSexual activity with children younger than 14 is illegal under Article 207, which prohibits sexual acts with a \"child\", and a \"child\" is defined in Article 2(8) as a person under 14. \"However\", Article 209 mentions a \"juvenile\" who is defined in Article 2(9) as a person \"under 18\", although it is not clear if this article refers only to sexual acts performed \"in view\" of a minor under 18 or if it can be used also to punish sexual acts performed \"with\" the minor:\n\nThe age of consent in Bulgaria is 14, as specified by Articles 149 and 151 (1). However Article 151 (2) has a provision for those who are over 14 and do \"not understand the characteristics or the importance of the act.\"\n\n\"Art. 151. (1) A person who has sexual intercourse with a person who has not completed the age of 14 years, insofar as the act does not constitute a crime under Article 152, shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for two to six years.\"\n\"Art. 149. (1) A person who performs an act for the purpose of arousing or satisfying sexual desire, without copulation, with a person under 14 years of age, shall be punished for lewdness by deprivation of liberty for one to six years.\"\n\nThe age of consent for all sexual conduct in Croatia under the new Criminal Code in force since 1 January 2013 is 15, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, regulated by Article 158.\n\n(1) Whoever performs sexual intercourse with a child under fifteen years of age or induces a child to commit sexual intercourse with a third person, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of one to ten years.\n\n(2) Whoever commits lewd act with a child under fifteen years of age or induces a child to commit lewd act on itself or with a third person, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term between six months and five years.\n\nHowever, there is a close-in-age exemption of three years.\n\nBefore the year 2013, the legal age of consent in Croatia was 14. Homosexual acts were illegal until 1977, when Croatia, then as a Yugoslav Federal Republic, changed its Penal Code. Age of consent was equalised in 1998.\n\nThe age of consent for all sexual conduct in Cyprus under the 2002 \"Criminal Code\" is 17, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.\n\nUntil 1998, homosexual acts between men were entirely forbidden under Section 171 (1929). In 1989, Alecos Modinos, president of the Cypriot Gay Liberation Movement, brought a case to the European Court of Human Rights. In 1993, the Court held that the prohibition of homosexual acts was a violation of Article 8. In January 1995, the Cypriot Government introduced a Bill in the Cypriot Parliament that would have abolished the ban. Strong opposition from the Orthodox Church meant the Bill stalled when referred to the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee. The European Commission repeated its warning that Cyprus must follow the Court's ruling. In May 1997, again a government measure to repeal the ban failed because of the strength of the opposition. In April 1998, the Council of Europe set a deadline for compliance of 29 May 1998 and on 21 May 1998, the House of Representatives voted 36 to 8 in favour legalising homosexual acts. However it was set at 18 while heterosexual acts remained at 16.\n\nIn 2002, under pressure from the EU the parliament finally ended the disparate provisions and changed the age of consent to 17 for both heterosexual and homosexual acts, under the revised \"Criminal Code\".\n\nFor both of these Sovereign Base Areas (British military enclaves) on the island of Cyprus, the age of consent is 16.\n\nThe age of consent in the Czech Republic is 15.\n\nAdditionally, the section of the new Czech penal code 40/2009 Sb. about \"crimes against family and children\" contains § 202 which criminalizes a \"seducing to sexual intercourse\" aimed at persons under 18 years with any promise or provide of payment, benefit/privilege or profit for a sexual intercourse, masturbation, exposure or similar behavior. This regulation was added to the old Czechoslovak penal code (140/1961 Sb.) adopted by the Czech Republic as § 217a by the amendment Czech act No. 218/2003 Sb. efficient since 2004 January 1. This also covers cases when there is any kind of trust/dependence, for example, teacher-student, employer-employee, etc.\n\nThe historic age limit in the Austrian Empire was 14 years by § 128 of the empire Penal Code from 1852. Homosexual sexual intercourse (as well as intercourses with animals) were generally criminalized as \"crime against nature\" by § 131. The Austrian Penal Code was not replaced in Czechoslovakia before 1950. The Czechoslovak Penal Code 86/1950 Sb. in § 239 elevated the limit to 15 years. Almost identic regulation contained Czechoslovak penal code 140/1961 Sb., which in § 242 reads: \"A person who has coitus with a person younger fifteen (15) years of age or who sexually abuses such a person by other way shall be sentenced to imprisonment for at least one and at most eight years.\" The new Czech Penal Code (40/2009 Sb., efficient since 2010 January 1) contents a similar regulation in § 187. Around 2008 and 2009, lowering of the limits of criminal responsibility as well as sexual restriction from 15 to 14 years was proposed by the Ministry of Justice and passed in Parliament within the new Penal Code 40/2009 Sb. efficient since 2010 January 1. Both changes were criticized. Before its efficiency, the amendment act 306/2009 Sb. changed both limits back to 15 years.\n\nUntil 1961, homosexual sexual intercourse was illegal in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak 140/1961 Sb. Penal Code, introduced in that year, still contained as a crime \"Sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex\" (§ 244) but affected only persons older 18 years who had intercourse with a person younger than 18 years. Between adults, payment receipt or provision and public nuisance were reasons for criminalization. In 1990, article § 244 was removed in its entirity by the Czechoslovak act 175/2009 Sb. efficient since 2009-07-01.\n\nThe age of consent in the Kingdom of Denmark is 15 as specified by Section 222:\n\n\"§ 222. Whoever has sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 15, shall be punished by imprisonment for up to 8 years, unless the situation is covered by § 216 paragraph 2. In determining the penalty, it shall be an aggravating circumstance if the perpetrator has gained intercourse by exploiting his physical or mental superiority.\"\n\nSection 223, part 1, reads: \"Any person who has sexual intercourse with any child under 18, who is said person's adopted child, stepchild or foster child, or who is entrusted to said person for education or upbringing, will be liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding four years.\" This applies, e.g., to teachers. Further, part 2 of § 223 establishes that the same punishment is applicable to any person found to have grossly exploited their age- and experience based superiority over a person under the age of 18 to seduce said minor into intercourse.\n\nThe laws in the Faroe Islands and Greenland are equivalent although regulated in separate penal codes for these autonomous countries.\n\nMale homosexual acts were legalised in Denmark (lesbianism was never illegal) with an age of consent set at 18, after a major reform of the Penal Code in 1930; At the same time, the age of consent for heterosexual acts was raised from 12 to 15. In 1976, the age of consent was harmonized at 15 for all acts . Sex with a child under the age of 12 results in double punishment, and sex with a minor under 18 is illegal for a person in charge of this child.\n\nUntil 1866, \"acts against nature\" [anal intercourse] were punishable with the stakes. However, until the late 18th century the rule was never used, and, when it came into rule, the convicts were always pardoned to 7 years in jail. This became the punishment introduced in the Penal Code 1866, but now only for homosexual acts.\n\nIn 1969, Denmark became the first country to legalise pictorial pornography, but this did not affect laws related to the age of people participating in its production. Consequently, the legal age of consent (15) equaled the limit for pornography produced \"within\" the country, but material produced in other countries (where the Danish consent law does not apply) was not covered and therefore legal. In 1980 it became illegal to sell, spread or possess pornography involving children under the age of 15, regardless of its country of origin (Danish Penal Code §235). The limit was later changed to 18 years, which is the standing law today, although it remains legal for a person over the age of 15 to take their own nude photos, as long as they are only shared with friends (for example with a boyfriend or girlfriend), the receiver explicitly has received the right to possess them, and they are not shared or spread any further. In the period between the legalisation of pornography and the 1980 amendment to the Danish Penal Code, some companies (infamously Color Climax) exploited the lack of age restrictions on material produced in other countries.\n\nThe age of consent in Estonia is 14, as specified by Section 145 (sexual intercourse with a child), which reads: \"\"An adult person who engages in sexual intercourse with a person of less than 14 years of age shall be punished by up to 5 years’ imprisonment.\"\n\nSection 141 defines rape as \"Sexual intercourse with a person against his or her will by using force or taking advantage of a situation in which the person is not capable of initiating resistance or comprehending the situation\"\"; and Section 147 reads:\n\nSection 147. Inability of person of less than 10 years to comprehend\n\nUntil 1992, male homosexual sex was illegal, the Estonian SSR Penal Code, Article 118, forbidding \"anal intercourse between men\". When regaining independence from USSR in 1991, the age of consent for male homosexual intercourse was set at 16, whereas the age for heterosexual intercourse was 14. The age of consent was harmonized in 2001 when the law was amended, specifying an age of 14 for sexual intercourse.\n\nThe age of consent in Finland is 16, as specified by Section 6(1) (Sexual abuse of a child), which reads: \"A person who has sexual intercourse with a child younger than sixteen years of age ... shall be sentenced for sexual abuse of a child to imprisonment for at most four years.\"\n\nThe sexual act may not be punishable if \"there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved\".\n\nThe act may be punished as the lesser crime of \"aggravated sexual abuse\" rather than \"rape\" if courts determine there was no force or fear.\n\nThe age is 18 when in connection with a person who has some formal power over the young person, like a school teacher.\n\nUntil 1971, homosexual acts were prohibited. After decriminalisation, the age of consent was set to 18 for homosexual acts and 16 for heterosexual acts.\nIn 1999, the age of consent was harmonized at 16 for all sexual acts.\n\nAccording to the Åland Treaty, Finnish federal law is applied as the minimum standard. The age of consent is therefore 16.\n\nThe age of consent in France is 15, as specified by Article 227-25 of the Penal Code, which reads: \"The fact of the commission without violence, constraint, threat or surprise of a sexual offence by an adult on the person of a minor under fifteen years of age is punished by five years' imprisonment and a fine of 75,000€.\"\n\nArticle 227-22 prohibits the \"organisation by an adult of meetings involving indecent exposure or sexual relations knowing that minors are present or participating\". (Minors refers to under 18s; the text of the article can be subject to interpretation).\n\nArticle 227-22-1 prohibits the \"soliciting of a minor under the age of fifteen, or a person pretending to be such minor, for sexual purposes through the use of a computer system\".\n\nArticle 227-27 prohibits sexual relations with minors over age 15 (aged 15, 16 or 17) \"1° where they are committed by an ascendant or by any other person having a legal or factual authority over the victim; 2° where they are committed by a person abusing the authority conferred by his functions.\"\n\nMale homosexual acts were illegal until 1791, when the ancient sodomy laws were dropped from the Criminal Code of that year. This continued to be the case under the Napoleonic Code of 1810.\n\nThe age of consent was set at 11 in 1832 and at 13 in 1863. In 1942, the age of consent for homosexual acts was set at 21, while for heterosexual acts it was still 13. The latter was increased to 15 in 1945. In 1974, the age for homosexual acts was lowered to 18. In 1982, it was lowered to 15, in line with that for heterosexual acts.\n\nThe age of consent in Georgia is 16 as per Georgian Penal Code Art. 140, and Art. 141.\n\nThe age of consent in Germany is 14, as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14- to 15-year-old person's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself. Otherwise the age of consent is 16, although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18 (under Section 182(1): it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 \"by taking advantage of an exploitative situation\").\n\nThis is specified by Sections 176 (Sexual abuse of children) and 182 (Sexual abuse of youths) of the Penal Code, which read:\n\n§ 176: \"(1) Whoever commits sexual acts on a person under fourteen (14) years of age (a child) or allows them to be committed on themself by the child, shall be punished by imprisonment from six months to ten years [...]\"\n\n§ 180: \"(1) Whoever abets the commission of sexual acts of a person under sixteen years of age on or in front of a third person or sexual acts of a third person on a person under sixteen years of age\":\nshall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine. [...]\"\n\n§ 182: \"(2) A person over twenty-one years of age who abuses a person under sixteen years of age, in that he: 1. commits sexual acts on the person or allows them to be committed on himself by the person; or 2. induces the person to commit sexual acts on a third person or to allow them to be committed on the person by a third person, and thereby exploits the victim's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine. [...] The act shall only be prosecuted upon complaint, unless the prosecuting authority considers ex officio that it is required to enter the case because of the special public interest therein. [...] The court may dispense with punishment pursuant to these provisions if, in consideration of the conduct of the person against whom the act was directed, the wrongfulness of the act is slight.\"\n\nThe current rules for age of consent in Germany were set following a post-reunification penal law reform in 1994. The ages of 14 and 16 had been relevant since the Criminal Code for the German Empire came into force in 1872: Under § 176, sexual acts with children under 14 were illegal and have been always since. Under § 182, seduction of an \"unblemished girl under the age of 16\" was prosecuted upon complaint of parents or legal guardian only. In West Germany the latter rule was kept, with minor changes in 1973: Unblemishedness was no longer required, and the court could refrain from punishment if the offender was under 21 years of age. The German Democratic Republic, by contrast, created a new socialist criminal code in 1968. Under § 149, sexual acts with persons of the opposite sex between the ages of 14 and 16 were punishable if the victim's \"moral immaturity\" was exploited by using \"gifts, the promise of benefits or similar\" methods of persuasion \"to initiate intercourse or actions similar to intercourse\".\n\nMale homosexuality had been illegal under § 175 regardless of age since 1872. Female homosexuality was not prosecuted. In West Germany, male homosexuality was legalized in 1969. The age of consent was set to 21 years and reduced to 18 years in 1975. Only only men of 18 or older could be offenders and courts could refrain from punishment if the offender was not yet 21. In East Germany, the criminal code was supplemented in 1957 by a provision that allowed the waiving of prosecution if no harm had been done to socialist society by the unlawful act. Concerning § 175, this meant that male homosexual acts were prosecuted only if they involved minors, which meant persons under 18. The new criminal code of 1968 officially legalized homosexuality and in § 151, which now was gender-neutral, criminalized only homosexual acts of adults with minors. In 1987 the GDR supreme court ruled homosexuality was a variant of sexual behaviour just as heterosexuality. In 1989 § 151 was repealed and § 149 amended to include any sexual orientation.\n\nAfter German reunification, according to the Unification Treaty of 1990, the § 149 code section stayed in force for the territory of the former GDR, and in West Germany, § 175 and § 182 were no longer enacted. West German law makers also saw the need for gender- and sexual-orientation-neutrality, and for rebalancing sexual self-determination with the protection of minors. In the ensuing 1994 reform, the minimum age of 14 for all of Germany was kept, and in building on legal traditions of both states, sexual acts committed by a person above 21 with a minor under 16 involving exploitation of the minor's individual lack of capacity for sexual self-determination were made punishable in new § 182. § 175 was abolished. In general, the need for a complaint from the former West German law was kept, but in the case of special public interest, the offence was made prosecutable ex officio, as had been the case in East German law.\n\nThe age of consent in Greece is 15.\n\nThe general provision for age of consent in Greece is 15 as specified by Article 339, as well as Articles 337, 348B of the Greek Penal Code. In 2015, along with the legalization of same-sex civil unions, Article 347 which provided a further prohibition of seducing a male under 17 if the actor is a male adult was repealed, therefore equalising age of consent for homosexual acts.\n\nThere are also several other prohibitions regarding positions of authority and acts of lewdness, as specified by Articles 342 and 343. Furthermore, there is a close-in-age exemption of 3 years age difference for indecent acts between persons younger than 15.\n\nThe age of consent in Hungary is 14. A close-in-age exemption allows sexual acts from age 12 if the older party is under 18.\n\nThe new criminal code in force since 1 July 2013 reads:\n\"The person who has completed eighteenth year has sexual intercourse with a person who has not yet completed his/her fourteenth year, commits a felony and shall be punishable with imprisonment from one year to five years\".\n\"The person who has sexual intercourse with a person who has not yet completed his/her twelfth year, commits a felony and shall be punishable with imprisonment from five years to ten years\".\n\nUntil 1961 homosexual acts were illegal. After decriminalisation the age of consent for homosexual acts was 20 and remained so until 1978. From then until 1999 the age of consent for such acts was 18, as specified by Section 199. In 2002 the Hungarian Constitutional Court repealed Section 199 and the age of consent for homosexual acts was lowered to 14 in line with heterosexual acts.\n\nThe age of consent in Iceland is 15, as specified by Section 202 of the Icelandic Penal Code, which reads: \"Anyone who has carnal intercourse or other sexual intimacy with a child younger than 15 years shall be subject to imprisonment for at least 1 year and up to 15 years.\"\"\n\nThe age of consent was raised from 14 to 15 in 2007.\n\nThe age of consent in Ireland is 17, in relation to vaginal, oral, or anal sex, and vaginal or anal penetration. This is the joint highest, with Cyprus, age of consent in the European Union.\n\nRelevant offences are found in the \"Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017\", which amended the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006. Sentences are longer for offences on children under 15, for repeat offences and where the offender is an authority-figure such as a close relative or teacher. In the case of offenses with children aged 15 and 16, the relevant statute, \"Sexual act with child under 17 years of age\", provides that \"8) Where, in proceedings for an offence under this section against a child who at the time of the alleged commission of the offence had attained the age of 15 years but was under the age of 17 years, it shall be a defence that the child consented to the sexual act of which the offence consisted where the defendant—(a) is younger or less than 2 years older than the child,(b) was not, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, a person in authority in respect of the child, and (c) was not, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, in a relationship with the child that was intimidatory or exploitative of the child.\"\n\nPrior to the 1922 independence of the Irish Free State, the law in Ireland was that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (see the UK history section). Anal sex was illegal under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, while the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 criminalised \"Defilement of girl between thirteen and sixteen years of age\", with more severe penalties for \"Defilement of girl under thirteen years of age\". The 1930 Carrigan Report into child sex abuse and underage prostitution recommended raising the age of consent to 18 years. The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 raised the age to 17, with more severe penalties under age 15, and disallowed a defence of mistake. The law on child sex abuse, including the age of consent, was the subject of a 1989 consultation paper and 1990 report by the Law Reform Commission (LRC). The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 decriminalised male homosexual acts and created offences of \"Buggery of persons under 17 years of age\" and \"Gross indecency with males under 17 years of age\". In 2006, the 1935 law was struck out when the Supreme Court found that its prohibition of the mistake defence violated a defendant's Constitutional rights. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, quickly passed within the scope of the Supreme Court's judgment, replaced the 1935 and 1993 offences with the current ones. The exemption for girls under 17 was recommended by the LRC and the Director of Public Prosecutions who felt \"it would be wrong to stigmatise mothers and pregnant girls of 15 or 16 years of age as if they were either the victims of violent rape or they had committed a crime\". While this was controversial, the Minister pointed out that the previous law had not criminalised any sex act by a girl under 17. The 2006 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Child Protection recommended changing the age of consent to 16, and 18 with a person in authority. It advised that close-in-age cases should remain criminalised, but with more lenient guidelines for sentencing. It also recommended wider publicity of the age limits. Most of the changes were implemented in 2017, although the age of consent remained 17.\n\nThe age of consent in Italy is 14 years, with a close-in-age exception that allows those aged 13 to engage in sexual activity with partners who are under the age of 18, provided that the age gap between them is less than 3 years. The age of consent rises to 16 if one of the participants has some kind of influence on the other (e.g. teacher, tutor, adoptive parent, etc.). Not knowing that the victim is underage is not a legal defense, except when it was unavoidable ignorance. If the minor involved is under the age of 11, the crime can be punished even without a complaint and the punishment is aggravated. It is also illegal to perform sexual acts in the presence of a minor aged less than 14 with the intent of allowing the minor to witness the acts, even if they do not take an active part.\n\nSee also related articles from the Italian Criminal Code (in Italian). See also more related articles from Interpol.\n\nThe age of consent in Kazakhstan is 16, according to article 122 of the Crime Criminal Code.\n\n\"Article 122. Sexual Intercourse and Other Actions of a Sexual Character with a Person Under Sixteen Years of Age\n\"Sexual intercourse, sodomy, or lesbianism or other acts of sexual nature, with a person who did not reach sixteen years of age, the guilty party being aware of that fact, shall be punished by restriction of freedom for a period up to three years, or by detention under arrest for a period up to six months, or deprivation of freedom for a period up to five years.\"\n\nThe age of consent in Kosovo is 16. Article 228 of the Penal Penalty Code states that \"Term 'Consent' means the voluntary agreement of a person \"who has reached the age of sixteen years\" to engage in the sexual act in question\", and Article 230 states that, 1. Whoever subjects another person to a sexual act without such person's \"consent\" shall be punished by imprisonment of two (2) to ten (10) years\".\n\nThe age of consent in Latvia is 16.\n\nThe main legislation is specified by the Latvian Criminal Law, Section 161 (Acts of a sexual nature with a Person who has not Attained the Age of Sixteen Years), which translated reads: \"Committing a sexual, anal or oral act or another unnatural sexual act of gratification, or other acts of a sexual nature committed in physical contact with the victim's body, if it was done with a person who has not attained the age of sixteen years and if such offence has been committed by a person who has attained the age of majority, is punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to five years, or short-term imprisonment, or community service, or a fine and probationary supervision for a period of up to five years.\" \n\nSections 159 and 160 provide harsher penalties for rape and forcible sexual assault of juveniles.\n\nUntil 1992, male homosexual acts were illegal under Section 124.1 of the Latvian Criminal Code. This provision was repealed by the Latvian Parliament in 1992 and the age of consent for male homosexual acts was set at 18. In 1998, the Latvian Parliament adopted a new Criminal Code that contained a complex system of sexual offences: the age of consent for all sexual acts other than vaginal intercourse was 14; for vaginal intercourse it was 16 (with a close-in-age exemption that allowed 14 and 15 year olds to have sex with a person under 18). In 2001, the law was amended to clarify the situation and confirm that the age of consent was 16 for all acts (only a person aged 18 or older can be punished for having sex with a 14–15 year old).\n\nThe age of consent in Liechtenstein is 14. Sexual activity with 14–15 year olds is generally legal, but it can still be punished if sexual access to these children has been obtained by exploiting their lack of sexual self-determination.\n\nThe age of consent in Lithuania is 16, as specified by the Lithuanian Criminal Code §151.1, introduced by the bill of 2 July 2010.\n\nPreviously the age of consent was set to 14 according to the Lithuanian Criminal Code §153 prohibiting any sexual molestation or sexual relationships with a minor under 14 years. The age of consent (14) was not set directly in this article of the Lithuanian criminal code, though. It has been established by the Lithuanian case law. This meant that both heterosexual and homosexual acts were allowed once a child had reached the age of 14. There was (and remains) an exception to this rule: §151.1(3) of the Lithuanian Criminal Code prohibits parents, guardians, or other people who are ex officio directly responsible for the upbringing and supervision of a child to have any relationships of sexual kind with the child, if he or she has not yet reached the age of 18.\n\nUntil 1993, male homosexual acts were prohibited under the Lithuanian Criminal Code, Article 1221, which was repealed in that year. The new law set an age of consent of 17 for male oral and anal intercourse, 16 for other male homosexual acts, and 14 for lesbian and heterosexual acts. In 2004, the law was amended to equalise the age of consent at 14 for all sexual acts; the age of consent was raised to 16 in 2010, regardless of gender and sexual orientation.\n\nThe age of consent in Luxembourg is 16, as specified by the Luxembourgish Penal Code, Article 372, which reads: \"\"All indecent assaults on modesty committed without violence or threat, by a person or by aiding the person, of a child of either sex, aged less than sixteen, will be punished by imprisonment of one to five years.\"\n\n\"The penalty will be imprisonment of five to ten years if the child was less than eleven years old.\"\"\n\nArticle 188(1) of the Criminal Code of Macedonia prohibits sexual conduct with a \"child\" and a \"child\" is defined by Article 71 as a person under 14.\n\n\"(1) A person who commits statutory rape or some other sexual act upon a child shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to five years.\"\n\nHowever, Article 197 prohibits an adult living in an extra-marital community with a Juvenile \"under 16\".\n\"Article 197\"\n\n\"(1) An adult who lives in an extra-marital community with a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen years, but not the age of sixteen, shall be punished with imprisonment of three months to three years.\n\nThe age of consent in Malta is 16. Sexual activity - typically by people over 16 - with people between 12 and 16 can be considered \"defilement of minors\" \"by\" \"lewd acts\" or \"corruption of a minor\", which, at the discretion of prosecutors and the courts, depending on the circumstances, may result in a conviction.\n\nArt 201 of Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta (\"Presumption of violence in cases of carnal knowledge and indecent assault\") states:\nThe punishment is imprisonment from three to nine years, with or without solitary confinement, as described in Art. 198 (\"Rape or carnal knowledge with violence\"). The punishment can be increased in certain cases described in Art. 202, such as when the person has not attained the age of nine years.\n\nArt. 204 of Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta (\"Defilement of minors\") reads:\nA number of aggravating circumstances exist to this blanket provision including: Abuse of parental authority or tutorship, where the victim is under the age of 12 and if the offence is committed by means of threats or deceit. There is no definition of how old the offender must be: Even another minor can be guilty of this crime, although there is no evidence that any such case has ever been prosecuted.\n\nThe age of majority is defined in Art 188 of Chapter 16 of the Civil Laws of Malta:\n\nTo apply Art. 203, there are requirements:\n\nThe interpretation of the law is situational and at the discretion of the prosecution and the courts, based on relevant factors that may be taken into account to decide whether the minor was actually \"defiled\". For example, in 2008 two brothers, aged 19 and 20, were found not guilty of defiling a girl, then aged 16 (until 2018 the age of consent was 18). Their sexual encounters were consensual, and it was clear that the girl had had several previous sexual adventures with several youths. In 2007 a man of 30 was found guilty of defiling a boy, then aged 14. He had set up a situation in which the boy came to his apartment; as a result of both childish curiosity and what the court deemed to be the guile of the adult man, the boy remained in the apartment even while man first showered and then committed the lewd acts. There are also other cases, where offenders have been found guilty even though the circumstances were not clear, such as the case of a hotel manager aged 35 with a 14-year-old girl on holiday, three men aged 18, 19 and 20 with three 14-year-old girls or another hotel manager of 46 and a boy of 14, who had encounters over a longer time.\n\nIn the wording of the law there is no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, discrimination can result from selective enforcement with regard to individual cases. \"This may therefore lead to a higher incidence of cases in which the minor and the perpetrator are of the same sex, given that there may be parents who would not resort to legal proceedings should their 17-year-old child have sexual relations with another person of the opposite sex but would do so if the person is of the same sex.\"\n\nMarriage is allowed as early as the age of 16, which until May 2018 theoretically would have allowed a case to arise in which a spouse press charges under this article. In practice, this problem has never arisen.\n\nThe concept of age-banding employed in for example Canada is not present in the Maltese legal system and sexual activity between one partner who is 15 years old and another who is 16 years old can constitute defilement of minors, depending on the circumstances, with no exception being allowed purely on the basis of the proximity of their ages.\n\nIn early 2018 Parliament voted in favour of the \"Gender-Based Violence and Domestic Violence Act, 2018\" which came into effect on 14 May 2018. The primary objective of the Act is to transpose the Council of Europe Convention on prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence, and it also includes amendments that lowered the age of consent to 16.\n\nThe age of consent in Moldova is 16, per Article 174- \"\"Sexual intercourse with a person under 16\", and Article 175- \"Perverted Actions\"\".\n\nArticle 174. Sexual Intercourse with a Person under the Age of 16\n\n(1) Sexual intercourse other than rape as well as any other acts of vaginal or anal penetration committed with a person certainly known to be under the age of 16 shall be punished by imprisonment for up to 5 years.\n\n(2) The person who committed the act set forth in par. (1) shall not be subject to criminal liability if he/she is similar to the victim in terms of age and physical and mental\ndevelopment.\n\n[Art.174 in version of Law No. 277-XVI dated 18.12.2008, in force as of 24.05.2009]\n\n[Art.174 amended by Law No. 211-XV dated 29.05.03, in force as of 12.06.03]\n\nArticles 171 and 172 provide harsher penalties for Rape and Violent Sexual Actions (including physical or mental coercion) against juveniles.\n\nThe age of consent in Monaco is 15.\n\nThe age of consent in Montenegro is 14, as set out in Article 206 of the Criminal Code. Article 207 makes it illegal for a teacher, instructor, guardian, adoptive parent, stepfather, stepmother or other person with a similar position to abuse one's position or authority in order to perform sexual intercourse or an equal act with a minor (under 18) entrusted for teaching, education, custody and care. Article 209 (2) makes it illegal for a person to \"provide for performing debauchery, an act equal to it or some other sexual act to a minor\". Article 216 prohibits \"Extramarital community with a minor\"\nArticle 216 reads: \"(1) An adult person who lives in an extramarital community with a minor, shall be punished by an imprisonment sentence of three months to three years.\n\"(2) A parent, adoptive parent or a guardian who enables a minor to live in an extramarital community with another person or incites him/her into it shall be punished by a penalty referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article.\"\".\n\nMontenegro decriminalized homosexual sex in 1977, with an equal age of consent, set at 14.\n\nThe age of consent in the Netherlands is 16, as specified by the Dutch Criminal Code at Article 245, and Article 247 which read:\n\nArt 245: \"\"A person who, out of wedlock, with a person who has reached the age of twelve but has not reached sixteen, performs indecent acts comprising or including sexual penetration of the body is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than eight years or a fine of the fifth category.\"\n\nArt 247: \"A person who, with a person whom he knows to be unconscious or physically unable to resist or to be suffering from such a degree of mental defect or mental disease that he is incapable or not sufficiently capable of exercising or expressing his will in the matter or of offering resistance, performs indecent acts, or who, with a person who has not yet reached the age of sixteen (16) years, out of wedlock, performs indecent acts, or by whom the latter is enticed into performing, or submitting to such acts, out of wedlock, with a third party, is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than six years or a fine of the fourth category.\"\"\n\nClose-in-age exceptions (for consensual acts between adolescents close in age, within \"social-ethical norms\") are at the discretion of the prosecution. Acts such as a ménage-a-trois, or an unequal relationship, e.g. the perpetrator (17) wasn't in love while the victim (15) was, can also be considered outside \"social-ethical norms\".\n\nIn the 1990s, the Netherlands gained international attention due to its policies regarding the age of consent. Between 1990 and 2002 the Netherlands operated what was in effect an age of consent of 12, subject to qualifications. The relevant law, passed in November, 1990, permitted sexual intercourse for young people between 12 and 16 in most circumstances, but allowed a challenge by parents or by the Child Protection Agency if there was evidence of exploitation. Although the age of consent was often reported internationally to be 12, this was partly misleading, because sexual acts up to 16 remained open to prosecution. The Netherlands has gained an international reputation of being extremely liberal on sexual issues, with some of this due to exaggerated reports in foreign media and claims by foreign politicians, rather than based on reality. For instance, during the 1980s, some conservative campaigners in the US claimed that children were sold into sexual slavery at \"auctions\" held in Amsterdam, but did not produce any evidence to support their claims.\n\nNorthern Cyprus has an age of consent of 16 as designated in the Penal Code (\"Ceza Yasası\", Art. 153 & 154).\n\nPrior to 2014, sodomy was illegal, the age of consent only applied to females and sexual contact with a female between the ages of 13 and 16 was a misdemeanor. As of 2014, the age of consent is set at 16 for both males and females, sexual contact with any child under 16 regardless of gender is a felony and the ban on sodomy is lifted, thereby legalizing homosexual sex.\n\nThe age of consent in Norway is 16, as specified by the 2005 Penal Code §304: which reads: \"\"Any person who performs a sexual act with a child under 16 years of age shall be subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, unless the conduct falls within the scope of section 299.\" Aggravating circumstances as recidivism, multiple perpetrators, and unusual degree of degradation and pain, or physical harm (including, specifically, sexually transmitted diseases) may raise the maximum penalty.\n\nThe penal code on the age of consent is three-tiered.\n\nIf the child is under 14 years, §299 of the same penal code, reads: \"A penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years shall be applied to any person who:\na) engages in sexual activity with a child under 14 years of age,\nb) makes a child under 14 years of age perform acts corresponding to sexual activity on himself/herself, or\nc) performs an aggravated sexual act with a child under 14 years of age.\" §300 and §301 of the same penal code, sets minimum penalty, of any person who engages in sexual acts with children under 14 years, to 3 year of imprisonment, and up to 21 years.\n\nIf the child is between 14 and 16 years, § 302, reads:\n\"Any person who engages in sexual activity with a child between 14 and 16 years of age shall be subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years, unless the conduct also falls within the scope of other provisions. The same penalty shall be applied to any person who makes a child between 14 and 16 years of age perform acts corresponding to sexual activity on himself/herself.\"\"\n\nAccording to Chapter 1, § 5, of the penal code, §299-306 applies also if the act was committed outside Norway and by a non-Norwegian citizen or resident.\n\nEven though one may be found guilty of violating the age of consent code, if those involved are \"about equal as regards age and development\", the court can exercise its own discretion to suspend passing a sentence.\n\nSexual relations between two women was never explicitly criminalized, but have been prosecuted under the general indecency law of the Civil Penal Code of 1842.\n\nIn 1951 a Norwegian ministry of justice white paper recommended de-criminalization of homosexual acts in the 1903 Civil Penal Code §213, but this was rejected by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget). The ban on sex between men, which also outlawed cohabitation as well as sex with animals, was repealed in 1972 (bestiality having been recriminalized in 2008).\n\nThe Penal Code of 2005, replaced the 1902 General Civil Penal Code, and was entered into force on October 1, 2005.\n\nAccording to the Svalbard Treaty, Norwegian law is applied as the minimum standard. The age of consent is therefore 16.\n\nThe age of consent in Poland is 15, as specified by the Polish Crime Criminal Criminality Penal Code, Article 200, which reads:\n\n\"\"Article 200. § 1. Whoever subjects a minor under 15 years of age to sexual intercourse or makes him/her submit to another sexual act or to perform such an act shall be subject to the penalty of the deprivation of liberty for a term of between 2 and 12 years.\" <br>\n\"§ 2. The same punishment shall be imposed on anyone, who records pornographic material with the participation of such a person.\"\"\n\nPoland never imposed laws against homosexuality. However, in 1876 homosexuality was criminalised by the laws of occupying countries (see Partitions of Poland). In 1932 the first Polish Criminal Code after regaining independence was introduced, making the age of consent of 15 for all sexual acts, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nSince September 2007, the age of consent laws of Portugal states 14, regardless of sexual behaviour, gender or sexual orientation, as a result of the constitutional court of Portugal ruling on constitutional protection that explicitly includes \"sexual orientation\", formally into the Constitution of Portugal back in 2004. Since September 2007, the age of consent was formally equalised as part of the Penal Code of September 2007. Although the age of consent is stipulated at 14 in Portugal, the legality of sexual acts with a \"minor between 14 and 16\" is open to legal interpretation since the law states that it is illegal to perform a sexual act with an adolescent between 14 and 16 years old \"by taking advantage of their inexperience\".\n\nHomosexual acts were legalised for the first time in Portugal in 1852, with an equal age of consent at that time - although homosexuality was again re-criminalised in 1912. They were decriminalised a second time in 1982 and an age of consent was set at 16, in line with heterosexual activities. In 1995, a new Penal Code was introduced with \"different circumstances\" for different sexual behaviours. Since September 2007, the age of consent, regardless of sexual behaviour, gender or sexual orientation, is 14 .\n\nThe new Romanian Criminal Code, which came into force on 1 February 2014, sets a general age of consent of 15. However, sexual acts that do not include penetration may be performed from age 13. There is also a close-in-age exemption: the sexual acts are not punished if the age difference between the partners is less than 3 years.\n\nThe law sets several other restrictions in regard to children under 13: it is illegal for an adult to perform sexual acts in view of such a child; to show pornographic materials to such a child or to induce the child to view sex shows; or to solicit such a child to meet for sexual acts (such as on-line solicitation).\n\nIn addition, it is illegal for an adult to engage in acts of sexual penetration with an adolescent under 18, if the adult abuses the authority or influence they have over the minor in order to gain the sexual access.\n\nThe relevant articles of the Criminal Code are Art. 220, Art. 221 and Art. 222. All these laws are gender neutral and apply regardless of the sexual orientation of those involved.\n\nFor a very long time, the age of consent in Romania was 14. The Penal Code of 1864, which followed shortly after the union of the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, and was in force between 1865 and 1936, set an age of consent of 14. Under this code, Article 263 read: \"Any assault against decency, whether completed or attempted, \"without violence\", upon the person of a child, either male or female, aged \"less than 14 years\", shall be punished with imprisonment between two and three years.\" Article 264 defined \"assault against decency with violence\", the equivalent of the nowadays crime of rape (although the term \"rape\" was not used in that code), and stipulated that the maximum penalty should be given if the victim was under 15 years of age. In 1936, a new criminal code came into force. Article 421 read: \"The man who has sexual intercourse with a girl under 14 years of age commits the offense of assault against decency without violence, and is punishable by imprisonment between one and three years.\" However, if aggravated factors existed (such as pregnancy, a sexually transmitted disease, or committed by a person with a specific relation to the victim, or by several persons) the punishment was increased. With regard to rape (article 419) the victim being under 14 constituted an aggravating factor. After the installation of the communist regime, the code was modified several time, and, in 1969, a new penal code came into effect. Nevertheless, the age of consent of 14 was maintained. Article 198 of the 1969 code read: \"Sexual intercourse with a female person who has not attained the age of 14 is punishable by imprisonment of one to five years.\" In a case of rape, similarly with the previous code, the victim being under 14 constituted an aggravating factor (Article 197).\n\nThe late 1990s and the early 21st century saw major modifications to the criminal code, in an effort to modify what was seen as outdated provisions, especially as Romania prepared to enter the EU. As such, homosexuality was decriminalized, the text of several criminal offences was modified by making it gender-neutral, the age of consent was lifted to 15 (applicable to both girls and boys), punishments for several sexual crimes were increased, and the stipulation that a rapist could avoid punishment after rape if he married his victim was abolished. Changes were made through Law no. 140/1996, Law No. 197/2000, Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, and Emergency Ordinance no. 143/2002. Nevertheless, the rapid adoption of numerous laws led to poorly drafted and contradictory texts, which have caused difficulty among the jurisprudence and doctrine, and several cases ended to the High Court of Cassation and Justice in order to clarify the interpretation of the law. Finally, a new criminal code entered into force on 1 February 2014.\n\nThe age of consent in Russia is 16. The age of consent changed several times in Russian history: the \"Criminal Code of RSFSR\" (Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic) stated \"sexual maturity\" as the age of consent; when the \"Criminal Code of Russia\" was adopted in 1996, the age of consent was proclaimed to be the same regardless of sexual orientation and was set to 16 years old; in 1998 it was lowered to 14 years; and in 2003 it was returned again to 16 years (which is the current age of consent in Russia). Law of early 2012 tightened the consent laws in Articles 134 and 135 considerably. However, only a person over 18 can be charged. Charges are relatively low (up to 4 years of prison) - regardless of gender - and \"obscene actions\" have even less charges. If the victim is not understanding the nature and consequences of the act (due to their age being under 12 or mental abilities), it will be considered rape and charged much more severely (up to 15 years of prison, or up to 20 if the victim is under 14).\n\n1. Sexual intercourse committed by a person who has reached the age of eighteen years with a person who has not reached the age of sixteen years - shall be punishable by obligatory labour for a term of up to 480 hours, or by restriction of liberty for a term of up to four years, or by compulsory labour for a term of up to four years with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain posts or to be engaged in a certain activity for a period of up to three years, or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to four years with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain posts or to be engaged in a certain activity for a period of up to ten years.\n\n2.

A person who for the first time has committed the crime stipulated by Part One of this Article, shall be relieved of punishment by court if it is established that such person and the action committed by him/her are no longer socially dangerous in connection with his/her entry into marriage with the victim.\n\n2. Where the age difference between the victim and the accused person is less than four years, the latter shall not be punishable by deprivation of liberty for the committed deed provided for by Part One of this article or by Part One of Article 135 of this Code.\n\n1. The commission of lecherous actions without using violence by a person who has reached eighteen years of age in respect of a person who has not reached sixteen years of age -\nshall be punishable by obligatory labour for a term of up to 440 hours, or by restriction of liberty for a term of up to three years, or by compulsory labour for a term of up to five years with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain posts or to be engaged in a certain activity for a period of up to three years, or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to three years with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain posts or to be engaged in a certain activity for a period of up to ten years.\n\n2. The same deed committed in respect of the person who has reached twelve years of age but has not reached fourteen years of age -\nshall be punishable with deprivation of freedom for a term of three to eight years with or without deprivation of the right to hold certain posts or to be engaged in a certain activity for a period of up to fifteen years and with restriction of liberty for a term of up to two years or without such.\n\n3.

The deed provided for by Part Two of this article which is made by the person who has a previous conviction for having committed an offence against sexual integrity of a minor -\n\nshall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a term of ten to fifteen years with deprivation of the right to hold definite offices or to engage in definite activities for a term of up to twenty years.\n\nArticle 134. Illicit Sexual Relations or Other Sexual Actions with a Person Who Has Not Reached 16 Years of Age\nIllicit sexual relations, pederasty, or lesbianism, committed by a person who has reached 18 years of age with a person who obviously has not reached 16 years of age, shall be punishable by restraint of liberty for a term of up to three years or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to four years.\n\nFederal Law No. 73-FZ of 21 July 2004 amended Article 135 of the present Code\n\nArticle 135. Depraved Actions Commission of depraved actions without the use of violence by the person who has reached the age of 18 years in relations to a person who obviously has not reached 16\nyears of age, shall be punishable by a fine in the amount up to 300 thousand roubles, or in the amount of the wage or salary, or any other income of the convicted person for a period up to two years, or by restraint of liberty for a term of up to two years, or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to three years.\n\nArticle 134.

For example, in 2005, Valentina Isaeva gave birth to a girl in Moscow, Russia at the age of 11 years, 10 months. The father was 19-year-old Habibula Patahonov from Tajikistan, who rented a room in a flat where Valentina was living with her grandmother. The child's father was sentenced conditionally for child abuse but was not jailed because he was willing to support Valentina and their daughter.\n\nThe age of consent in San Marino is 14, per \"Article 173\". It is also illegal, under \"Article 177\", to \"incite a minor under 18 years to sexual corruption\".\n\nThe age of consent in Serbia is 14, regardless of sexual orientation or gender. This is regulated by Chapter 18 (Sexual Offences) of the Penal Code of the Republic of Serbia and especially Article 180 (prohibiting sexual intercourse with a child). Article 112 defines a child as a person under 14 years of age.\nArticle 181 prohibits sexual intercourse with a juvenile (defined in Article 112 as a person under 18) if the juvenile is entrusted for learning, tutoring, guardianship or care. Article 190 furthermore forbids cohabitation with a minor (person under 18) unless a marriage is conducted.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1994, sexual acts between men of any age was a criminal offence in Serbia, although the law has never been applied. Then in 1994, the age of consent was 18 just for anal sex between males; \"any male performing anal sexual conduct with another male, is punishable by up to 1 year in prison\", 16 for all other sexual conduct. Since 2006, an equal age of consent came into force, regardless of sexual orientation or gender - This is regulated by the section 110 of the Penal Code of the Republic of Serbia stating that \"lewd acts\" between a male adult and a male under the age of 16 is punishable by imprisonment from 1 to 8 years. There is no specific reference to \"lewd acts\" between two females of the same offence.\n\nThe province of Vojvodina, a northern province of Serbia, had decriminalized homosexuality in 1978, thus effectively making an equal age of consent for any sexual practice regardless of sex or gender. This lasted until Vojvodina lost its law-making power in 1990.\n\nThe age limit of sexual acts in Slovakia is 15, as specified by the Slovak Criminal Code, Section 201.\n\n\"§ 201 Sexual abuse\n\"1. Any person, who has sexual intercourse with a person less than fifteen years\n\"of age or who subjects such person to other sexual abuse, shall be liable to a\n\"term of imprisonment of three to ten years.\"\n\nThe history before 1993 within Czechoslovakia is commons with the Czech Republic. Until 1961, homosexual acts were prohibited, however the Criminal Code of that year decriminalised such behaviour partially. However, under Paragraph 244, the age limit of restriction for homosexual acts was set at 18, besides the general limit 15 years. In 1990, the whole Paragraph 244 was repealed and the age limit became 15 for all.\n\nThe age of consent in Slovenia is 15, as specified by the Slovenian Penal Code, Article 173, Section 1, which reads: \"\"(1) Whoever has sexual intercourse or performs any lewd act with a person of the same or opposite sex under the age of fifteen (15) years where there is a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than six (6) months and not more than five (5) years.\"\n\nUntil 1959, male homosexual acts were prohibited, as was the case in all of former Yugoslavia. A new Penal Code was introduced in 1977, which decriminalised homosexual acts and all discriminatory provisions were removed. In 1995, the age of consent was set at 14 for all acts. In 1999, the code was amended to raise the age of consent to 15 years and added the condition for \"a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim'\".\n\nThe age of consent in Spain is 16, under a new law which came into effect on 1 July 2015.\n\nSpanish Criminal Code Article 183:\n\n\"(1). El que realizare actos de carácter sexual con un menor de dieciséis años, será castigado como responsable de abuso sexual a un menor con la pena de prisión de dos a seis años.\"\n\n\"(3). Cuando el ataque consista en acceso carnal por vía vaginal, anal o bucal, o introducción de miembros corporales u objetos por alguna de las dos primeras vías, el responsable será castigado con la pena de prisión de ocho a doce años, en el caso del apartado 1...\"\n\nThere is a close-in-age exemption: \"El consentimiento libre del menor de dieciséis años excluirá la responsabilidad penal por los delitos previstos en este Capítulo, cuando el autor sea una persona próxima al menor por edad y grado de desarrollo o madurez\"\n\nThe age of consent rises to 18 if there is deception or abuse of a recognized position of trust, authority or influence over the minor.\n\nSpanish Criminal Code Article 182:\n\n\"(1). El que, interviniendo engaño o abusando de una posición reconocida de confianza, autoridad o influencia sobre la víctima, realice actos de carácter sexual con persona mayor de dieciséis años y menor de dieciocho, será castigado con la pena de prisión de uno a tres años.\"\n\nHistorically, the age of consent was usually twelve in the Christian kingdoms of Iberia. A new Penal Code was introduced in Spain in 1995 which specified an age of consent of 12 for all sexual acts, but this was raised to 13 in 1999 and to 16 in 2015.\n\nSame-sex sexual acts were lawful in Spain from 1822 to 1954, with the exception of the offence of \"unusual or outrageous indecent acts with same-sex persons\" between the years 1928 and 1932. However, some homosexuals were arrested in the days of the Second Spanish Republic under the \"Ley de Vagos y Maleantes\" (Vagrants and Common Delinquents Law). Homosexual acts were made unlawful during Francisco Franco's time in power, first by an amendment to the \"Ley de Vagos y Maleantes\" in 1954, and later by the \"Ley de Peligrosidad y Rehabilitación Social \" (Social on Danger and Social Rehabilitation) in 1970. In 1979 Adolfo Suarez's government reversed the prohibition of homosexual acts in that law.\n\nThe age of consent in Sweden is 15, as specified by the Swedish Penal Code, Chapter 6 (On Sexual Crimes). The age of fifteen is referred to several times, for example in Section 4, which reads: \"\"A person who has sexual intercourse with a child under fifteen years of age or who with such a child carries out another sexual act that, having regard to the nature of the violation and the circumstances in general, is comparable to sexual intercourse, shall be sentenced for rape of a child to imprisonment for at least two and at most six years.\"\n\nThere is a \"position of trust\" rule in which the age of consent is raised to 18. The section mentioned above continues:\"The same applies to the person who carries out an act referred to in the first paragraph to a child more than fifteen years of age but less than eighteen years of age and who is offspring to the perpetrator or in the perpetrator's care or in a similar relationship to the perpetrator, or for whose care or guardianship the perpetrator is responsible due to the decision of a government agency.\"\n\nIt is not legal to have sexual intercourse with related adults either, but the sentences for that (up to two years) are considerably milder than those for rape of a child (two to six years, four to ten years if aggravated).\n\nThere is also a \"close in age exception\" (Chapter 6, Section 14) \"...not sentenced if it is obvious that the act is no violation of the child considered the small difference in age between the person who carries out the act and the child and other circumstances.\"\" In a verdict of 30 March 2007, the Supreme Court found that a 17-year-old boy had not committed a criminal act by having sexual intercourse with a girl 14 years and 7 months old. (Case B 415-07)\n\nThe Swedish age of consent also applies if the act takes place outside Sweden but the elder person later goes to Sweden. The elder person doesn't have to be a Swedish citizen or resident, but could be a tourist on a temporary visit. This is regardless of the age of consent in the country where the act took place.\n\nHomosexual acts, both between men and between women, were prohibited in Sweden since 1864, then in 1944 homosexual acts became legal - but with a higher age of consent of 18 (21 if the younger part was in a situation of dependency) than for heterosexual acts, which was always set at 15. The age of consent was finally equalized to 15 regardless of sexual orientation in 1978.\n\nPornography laws were softened in the 1960s. In 1965 there was a review of previous laws governing pornography depicting children as part of the \"child's rights to sexuality\". From 1971 to 1980 it was legal to buy, sell, and possess child pornography that featured children as young as 10 or 11.\n\nThe age of consent in Switzerland is 16, as specified by the Swiss Federal Criminal Code, Article 187(1). However, there exists a close-in-age exception if the difference between the ages of the participants is three years or less (Article 187(2)).\n\nThe age of consent in Turkey is the age of majority (set at 18 as per Article 11 of the Turkish Civil Code).\n\nAccording to Article 104 of the Turkish Penal Code (\"Türk Ceza Kanunu\"), sexual intercourse with minors aged 15, 16 and 17 can only be prosecuted upon a complaint. However, if the offender is a person who is forbidden to marry the child by law or is a person who is obliged to take care of the child due to adoption or foster care, then the prosecution doesn't require a complaint and the punishment is aggravated.\n\nArticle 103 regulates any kind of sexual activity with minors under 15 (or minors under 18 who lack the ability to understand the legal meanings and consequences of such actions) as child sexual abuse.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, a predecessor state to the Republic of Turkey, decriminalized sodomy in 1858. The age of consent in Turkey was set at 15 for both heterosexual and homosexual sex in the 1926 penal code, but this was raised to 18 in 1953. The new penal code of 2004 also set the age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual sex at 18, with some differences, such as the act of having sexual intercourse with a minor over 15 being punishable upon a complaint.\n\nThe age of consent in Ukraine appears to be 16, although it is not specifically set in any one statute.\n\nArticle 155 states that sexual intercourse with a sexually immature person shall be punishable. Immaturity is irrefutably presumed in those under 14 {Art. 120CC and court rulings}. Those under 14 are considered children in Ukrainian law, additionally those under 16 are considered minors (generally read from all articles and court rulings).\n\nHowever, sexual acts with those under 16 that are considered debauchery can also be prosecuted under Article 156.\n\n\"Article 155 – Sexual intercourse with a sexually immature person\n\n\"1. Sexual intercourse with a sexually immature person,\" \"–\n\"shall be punishable by restraint of liberty for a term up to three years or imprisonment for the same term.\"\"\n\"2. The same actions committed by a parent or surrogate parent, or where they caused sterility or other grave consequences, –\n\"shall be punishable by imprisonment for a term of three to five years.\"\n\n\"Article 156 – Debauchery of minors\n\n\"1. Debauched actions committed in regard of a person under 16 years of age, – shall be punishable by arrest for a term up to six months, or restraint of liberty for a term up to three years.\"\n\"2. The same actions committed in regard of a young child, or by a parent or surrogate parent, – shall be punishable by restraint of liberty for a term up to five years, or imprisonment for a term up to three years.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom consists of the jurisdictions of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. UK national age of consent legislation does not apply to its dependencies, but they all have it set as 16.\n\nThe age of consent in England and Wales is 16 regardless of sexual orientation or gender, as specified by the Sexual Offences Act 2003.\n\nThe vast majority of law relating to sexual offences in the England and Wales is laid out in legislation under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, of which contains upwards of 140 sections, of which around 70 of those sections relate directly to sexual offences. The main sections of the act that relate to sexual offences regarding children are sections 5-15. The main 3 sections that relate to sexual activity with persons under 16 or under 13 are,\n\nIf the victim is at least 13, but under 16,\n\nSection 1: Rape\n\n\"(1)A person (A) commits an offence if— (a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis, (b)B does not consent to the penetration, and (c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents. (2)Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents. (3)Sections 75 and 76 apply to an offence under this section.\n\n(4)A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.\" \n\nIf the victim is under 13,\n\nSection 5: Rape of a child under 13,\n\n\"(1)A person commits an offence if— (a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person with his penis, and (b)the other person is under 13.\n\n(2)A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for life.\" \n\nIf the victim is under 16, and the offence does not meet the category of Section 1 \"Rape\",\n\nSection 9: Sexual activity with a child,\n\n\"(1)A person aged 18 or over (A) commits an offence if— (a)he intentionally touches another person (B), (b)the touching is sexual, and (c)either— (i)B is under 16 and A does not reasonably believe that B is 16 or over, or (ii)B is under 13.\n\n(2)A person guilty of an offence under this section, if the touching involved— (a)penetration of B’s anus or vagina with a part of A’s body or anything else, (b)penetration of B’s mouth with A’s penis, (c)penetration of A’s anus or vagina with a part of B’s body, or (d)penetration of A’s mouth with B’s penis, is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.\n\n(3)Unless subsection (2) applies, a person guilty of an offence under this section is liable— (a)on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or both; (b)on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years.\" \n\nAny person who engages in sexual intercourse with a person under the age 16 could be prosecuted. However this therefore means that even sexual intercourse between willing people of a similar age (i.e. A 16 year old and a 15 year old) could result in the older person being liable for prosecution for committing a sexual offence. Because of this, when the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was created, separate sections of the act were put in place to be used on how to appropriately prosecute a person who had sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16, depending on exactly how young a person under the age of 16 was at time the sexual intercourse took place. This therefore maintained a \"two-tier\" cut off age system regarding sexual intercourse when it involved a person under the age of 16. Currently this depends on whether a younger person was \"Under 16\" or \"Under 13\" at the time of the sexual intercourse taking place, with the latter being automatically overall illegal, and the former still being illegal, but with defences due to the younger person's older age, more flexibility in sentencing and flexibility overall whether to prosecute or not based on individual case.\n\nThe age of a younger person matters substantially as under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 any sexual intercourse or any type of sexual activity with a person under the age of 13 is strictly illegal, with rape, assault by penetration and incitement offences carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and other non-penetration offences carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years depending on case. Where as if a younger person is aged between 13–15, the act does work more flexibly, as for example it is a reasonable defence by an older person to claim they thought a younger person aged 13–15 was aged 16 or over at the time, or for example that two teenagers over the age of 13 were in a relationship before any sexual intercourse took place. It is rare that prosecution would be brought against persons aged 13 or over engaging in sexual intercourse/activity willingly, as long as all persons involved were of similar age, and it did not involve other matters such as violence, abuse or blackmail.\n\nHowever, if person A is over the age of 18 and is in a position of trust to person B who is under the age of 18, it is illegal for A to engage in sexual activity with B. Section 47 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 makes it an offence to pay for or promise payment for sexual services of a person under 18 where the 'client' does not reasonably believe that person is over 18, or in any event for a person under 13.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n The age of consent for heterosexual acts in England was set at 12 in 1275 during the reign of Edward I. The wording was along the lines of \"It shall be deemed illegal to ravage a maiden who is not of age\" - at the time \"of age\" being 12. Therefore, there was technically no age of consent for the male participant. The English law became applicable in Wales following the Laws in Wales Acts (1536 and 1543). In medieval Welsh law there was no actual equivalent of the concept of the age of consent as such, but a girl was marriageable at 12–14 (the onset of puberty) and a fine was payable for the taking of a girl's maidenhood by force; the rules varied according to status and may not have been applied rigidly to commoners.\n\nA concern that young girls were being sold into brothels led Parliament to raise the age of consent to 13 in 1875 under the Offences against the Person Act 1875. After W. T. Stead's \"Maiden Tribute\" articles, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised the age of consent to 16.\n\nAnal intercourse, both male-male and male-female, had been illegal and punishable by death since the Buggery Act 1533. In 1861, parliament passed the Offences against the Person Act 1861, which abolished the death penalty for anal intercourse. The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 extended buggery laws to outlaw any kind of sexual activity between males. It is common folklore that an amendment that would have criminalised lesbian acts was rejected by Queen Victoria because she refused to believe that some women did such things; but it is likelier that those presenting the amendment excluded it (as did the House of Lords 40 years later) on the assumption that it would give women ideas.\n\nMale homosexual acts were decriminalised under the Sexual Offences Act 1967, Section 1, although the age of consent for such acts was set at 21, whereas the age of consent for heterosexual acts was 16. However, this particular legislation applied only in England and Wales.\n\nIn 1994, on the second reading of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Conservative Member of Parliament Edwina Currie introduced an amendment to lower the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16, in line with that for heterosexual acts; the amendment was defeated by 308 votes to 280. A compromise amendment that lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted by 427 votes to 162. Also during the readings were motions to equalise the age of consent to 17 for all, to maintain the age of consent for homosexual acts to 21, and a further attempt to lower the age of consent to 16, all of which were rejected.\n\nIn 1997, the European Court of Human Rights case of \"Sutherland\" v \"the United Kingdom\" held that a higher age of consent for homosexuals than for heterosexuals was a breach of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention. In response, the Government introduced the Crime and Disorder Bill that contained a provision lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16. Though accepted by the House of Commons, the provision was rejected by the House of Lords. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, introduced in 1998, contained a similar provision, but once again it was rejected by the House of Lords. The Bill was reintroduced in 2000 and, despite opposition from the House of Lords, was passed under the Parliament Act 1911 (which allows the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords under certain circumstances). As the Scottish Parliament had been established prior to the reintroduction of the Bill, and the relevant legislation was a devolved issue, the consent of that Parliament under the Sewel Convention was required – had that consent not been granted, the Scottish provisions would have had to be removed and it would not have been possible to use the Parliament Act.\n\nThe Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, became law in January 2001 throughout the UK, and thus equalized, regardless of gender, the age of consent at 16 for both heterosexual and homosexual acts (including, for the first time, lesbian acts), except those taking place between a 16–17 year old and someone \"in a position of trust\" (e.g. a teacher), where the age of consent was raised to 18.\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act 2003 officially ended the concept of buggery in British law, as technically, heterosexual anal intercourse had still been illegal until the passing of this law. The passing of this law meant that there was no legal difference made between vaginal and anal intercourse, as well as sexual touching and newly added oral penetration and penetration by other body parts than penis or anything else. The Act also raised the legal age for pornography and prostitution from 16 to 18.\n\nThere have been various suggestions to lower the age of consent to 14 – in 1998 the New Labour government proposed this, but despite some Left wing and Youth support this had been dropped by early 2003 as lacking support, a decade later in early 2013 the suggestion by civil servants to lower the age of consent to 14 was rejected by the Conservative led coalition as \"offensive\" (at least under some circumstances) and attention was drawn to the impact of recent scandals on the reception to any proposals.\n\nIf the child is 13–15 inclusive and the other person concerned reasonably believed that she (usually she) was 16 or more no offence is committed. In practice this discourages prosecution where that defence might successfully be run. If a young woman, for example, goes willingly into a pub (saloon) where nobody under 18 can lawfully go the prosecuting authorities will probably decide that the defendant will readily be believed if he says he thought she was 18, let alone 16 or up.\n\nSince 1 December 2010, the age of consent in Scotland is 16, regardless of sexual orientation or gender. Before that date, it was 16 for girls (under a statutory offence) and 14 for boys (the common law age of puberty). However, consensual sex with a girl aged between 13 and 16 is not rape, but a lesser offence; on 1 December 2010 this has been given the specific name of \"having intercourse with an older child\". Aged between 13 and 16 does not include 16, however.\n\nMale homosexual acts were illegal in Scotland until 1980 when they were decriminalised by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, Section 80, which specified an age of consent of 21. The Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 lowered the age of consent to 18 and this was further lowered to 16 by the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 described above. Male rape was recognised along with a complete overhaul of sexual offences legislation under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 (in force from 1 December 2010, except for sections 52 and 53).\n\nThe age of consent in Northern Ireland is 16, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, as specified by the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. The reason the age of consent was lowered from 17 to 16 in 2008 with the Order was to bring it in line with the rest of the UK; Criminal Justice Minister Paul Goggins said there was no compelling reason for the age to be different in Northern Ireland than elsewhere.\n\nPrior to 2008, the age of consent in Northern Ireland was always 17 for heterosexuals and lesbian sexual conduct.\n\nGay male sexual conduct was illegal in Northern Ireland until 1982, when they were decriminalised by the \"Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982\", which specified an age of consent of 21 – in line with the rest of the UK at the time. The change was a result of the judgement in the European Court of Human Rights case of \"Dudgeon\" v \"United Kingdom\" (1981) in which the ECHR held that a prohibition on homosexual acts was a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. The age of consent for gay male sexual conduct was lowered to 18 in 1994 when the \"Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994\" was implemented (as to be in line with England and Wales). The age of consent in 2001 was then lowered to 17 for gay male sexual conduct - so that was in line with heterosexual and lesbian sexual conduct, by the \"Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000\", Section 1. Then in 2008, the Order mentioned above lowered the age of consent for all individuals to 16 so it was inline with the rest of the UK.\n\nFor both of these Sovereign Base Areas (British military enclaves) on the island of Cyprus, the age of consent is 16.\n\nSince 2011, the age of consent is equal and gender-neutral at 16 in Gibraltar (a British overseas territory). The gender-neutral \"Crimes Bill 2011\" passed the Gibraltar Parliament and got assented - implementing the 2011 Supreme Court of Gibraltar decision and by repealing and updating 140-year-old criminal laws of Gibraltar.\n\nMale homosexual acts have been decriminalised in Gibraltar since 1993, where the age of consent was higher at 18 for gay men, 16 for lesbians and heterosexuals. Anal sex was illegal for heterosexuals regardless. An equal age of consent set at 16 and legalising heterosexual anal sex happened because of a Supreme Court decision in 2011. Then in 2011, the gender-neutral \"Crimes Act 2011\" implemented an equal and gender-neutral age of consent of 16 and legalised anal sex for heterosexuals - reflecting the Supreme Court of Gibraltar's decision and by repealing and updating 140-year-old criminal laws of Gibraltar.\n\nSince 2012, the age of consent in the Bailiwick of Guernsey (a Crown Dependency including Alderney, Herm and Sark) is 16, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation.\n\nIn 1983, male homosexual acts were decriminalised with the age of consent set at 21 (in line with the UK at that time). In 1999, the age of consent for male homosexual acts was lowered to 18. Then in 2012, the age of consent for male homosexual acts was equalised at 16, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation.\n\nThe age of consent in the Isle of Man, a Crown Dependency, is 16, last amended in 2006.\n\nPrior to 1992, sodomy was illegal, then under the \"Sexual Offences (Isle Of Man) Act 1992\" (after assent) the age of consent was set at 21 for sodomy (in line with the UK at that time). Then in 2001, the age of consent for male homosexual acts was lowered to 18 under the \"Criminal Justice Act 2001\". In 2006, under the \"Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2006\" the age of consent was lowered to 16, and became gender-neutral for all sexual conduct, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.\n\nThe age of consent in the Bailiwick of Jersey, a Crown Dependency, is 16, last amended in 2007.\n\nPrior to 1990, sodomy was illegal in Jersey for both men and women until 1990 although the age of consent for homosexual acts other than sodomy was the same as for heterosexual acts. In 1990, the age of consent for sodomy between consenting males was set at 21 (the UK at that time maintained the age of consent of 21 for all homosexual acts between males). In 1995, the sodomy age of consent became 18 (under the Sexual Offences (Jersey) Law 1995). In 2007, the age of consent was lowered to 16, became gender-neutral for all sexual conduct (including sodomy); regardless of sexual orientation or gender.\n\nLaw No. VIII of 11 July 2013, entitled \"Supplementary Laws on Criminal Law Matters\" establishes the present law for the State of Vatican City regarding criminal penalties for sexual acts with minors. Article 4 of Law No. VIII defines \"minor\" for the purposes of that law to mean \"every human being below the age of eighteen years.\" Article 8, paragraphs 1 through 4, establish criminal penalties for anyone who engages in sexual acts with a person below the age of 18. Paragraph 5 of Article 8 provides an exception to this by stating that \"the offence does not exist if the sexual acts take place within a marriage.\" Canon 1083 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law states that \"A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age and a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age cannot enter into a valid marriage.\" Thus, in the context of this article, the age of consent in Vatican City may be considered 14 for married females who are having sexual relations with their husbands only, 16 for married males having relations with their wives only, but 18 for everyone else, whether married or not.\n\nIt should also be noted that the \"Law of the Source of Law\" of the Vatican State requires that any local laws must first defer to divine law, to Papal decrees, and to canon law. As the Vatican understands divine law, even if not sanctioned with criminal penalties by the state, all sex outside of marriage is illicit regardless of the age or willingness of those who engage in it.\n\nWhen the Vatican City was first formed, it adopted the then-Italian age of consent of 12 as per the Lateran Treaty of 1929. Until July 2013 it had the lowest age of consent in Europe, but after that month, when the Pope made his decree, it became the highest.\n\n\n\n"}

Even before the death of an-Nasir in 934, three of his sons quarreled bitterly among themselves. Although the Zaidi imamship was not strictly hereditary but depended on personal qualifications and descent from Muhammad, succession tended to take place within particular families descended from al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) and his grandson al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya (d. 911). Two sons of an-Nasir, al-Muntakhab al-Hasan (d. 936) and al-Mukhtar al-Qasim (d. 956), contested the dignity. None of them is recognized as a right imam in later Zaidi chronicles. Their younger brother al-Mansur Yahya is, on the other hand, counted as imam from 934 to his death in 976. The internal dissension among the Zaydiyyah was accentuated by the behaviour of the tribal groups of the northern Yemeni highlands, which supported one side or the other according to their interests. Few details are otherwise known about al-Mansur Yahya, and the politics of highland Yemen were dominated by the rival Yu'firid Dynasty. Personally he was remembered as a man of learning who conveyed much of the religious tradition of his father and grandfather. At his demise, the imam was succeeded by his son ad-Da'i Yusuf.\n\n"}

Buratino originated as a character in the commedia dell'arte. The name Buratino is derived from the Italian \"burattino\", which means wooden puppet or doll. The book was published in 1936, and Buratino quickly became hugely popular among children in the Soviet Union, and remains so to this day (In other words, Buratino is one of the most popular characters of Russian children's literature). The story has been made into several films, including the animated 1959 film and the live action 1975 film .\n\nAccording to Tolstoy, he had read \"Pinocchio\" as a child, but, having lost the book, he started re-imagining it many years later in an attempt to come up with a series of bedside stories for his own children. The resulting story turned out to be so original and became so loved by the writer's children, that he decided to put it to paper and publish it.\n\nLike Pinocchio, Buratino is a long-nosed wooden puppet. According to the story, he is carved by \"Papa Carlo\" (the story's version of Geppetto) from a log, and suddenly comes to life. Upon creation, Buratino comes out long-nosed due to Papa Carlo's sloppy woodworking. Papa Carlo tries to shorten it, but Buratino resists.\n\nPapa Carlo then sells his only good jacket in order to buy textbooks for Buratino and sends him to school. However, the boy becomes distracted by an advertisement for a local puppet theater show, and sells his textbooks to buy a ticket to the show. There he befriends other puppets, but the evil puppetmaster \"Karabas Barabas\" (the story's Stromboli character) wants to destroy him because Buratino disrupted the show.\n\nKarabas Barabas releases Buratino after he learns that Papa Carlo's home contains a secret door for which Karabas has been searching. A Golden Key that Karabas once possessed, but later lost, opens this secret door. Karabas releases Buratino and even gives him five gold coins, asking only that Buratino watch after his father's home and make sure they do not move.\n\nThe story proceeds to tell of Buratino and his friends' hunt for the Golden Key, and their struggle against the evil Karabas, his loyal friend Duremar, as well as a couple of crooks: Alice the Fox and Basilio the Cat (based on the Fox and Cat), who are after Buratino's coins. Many of Buratino's further adventures are, however, derived from Collodi's \"Pinocchio\", but are reworked to fit into Tolstoy's story.\n\n\n\n\nThe name Buratino has and continues to be used as branding for a variety of products and stores marketed to children in the ex-Soviet Union and Russia — most notable of these are the brand soft drink, of caramel taste and the \"Golden Key\" (\"Zolotoy klyuchik\") toffee.\nBuratino is also the nickname of the TOS-1 multiple launch rocket system, due to the big \"nose\" of the launcher.\n\nA location in the story, Поле чудес [в Стране́ Дурако́в], literally \"The Field of Wonders [in the Land of Fools]\", is used as the name of the Russian adaptation of the American game show \"Wheel of Fortune\".\n\n"}

{"id": "4162073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4162073", "title": "Caucasus Germans", "text": "Caucasus Germans\n\nCaucasus Germans () are part of the German minority in Russia and the Soviet Union. They migrated to the Caucasus largely in the first half of the 19th century and settled in the North Caucasus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the region of Kars (present-day northeastern Turkey). In 1941, the majority of them were subject to deportation to Central Asia and Siberia during Joseph Stalin's population transfers in the Soviet Union. After Stalin's death in 1953 and the beginning of the Khrushchev Thaw, the Caucasus Germans were allowed to return, though few did. Many assimilated and, after 1991, emigrated to Germany. Although the community today is a fraction of what it once was, many German buildings and churches are still extant, with some turned into museums.\n\nThe victory of the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 ensured its expansion into the Caucasus. It also created a need in populating these lands with Russian subjects in order to hasten their exploration. In the late 18th century, the government permitted families of Volga Germans to settle in the Kuban. However, poor infrastructure, lack of organization of the officials responsible for the settlement and the refusal of the military personnel to have these lands populated by non-Russians were an obstacle to steady and constant migration of the Germans. In 1815, while participating in the Congress of Vienna, Russian Tsar Alexander I visited Stuttgart, a city in his mother's native Kingdom of Württemberg. Upon witnessing the oppression that local peasants were undergoing either due to belonging to different non-Lutheran Protestant sects or to their participation in separatist movements, he arranged for their settlement in Russian Transcaucasia in order to form agricultural colonies.\n\nOn September 21, 1818, the first German settlement in Transcaucasia, Marienfeld, was established by a group of Swabian Germans near the Georgian capital Tiflis (Tbilisi), along the Kakheti highway, now part of Sartichala. Two months later, another group of colonists founded another settlement in Georgia on the bank of the Asureti River and named it Elisabethtal, after the Emperor's wife Elizabeth Alexeievna (now Asureti in the Georgian province of Kvemo Kartli). Within the next year, five more colonies were established in eastern Georgia: New Tiflis (later Mikhailovsky Avenue, now part of David Agmashenebeli Avenue in Tbilisi), Alexandersdorf on the left bank of the Kura (now the vicinity of Akaki Tsereteli Avenue in Tbilisi), Petersdorf (near Marienfeld, now part of Sartichala) and Katharinenfeld (now Bolnisi). Three more colonies were founded in Abkhazia: Neudorf, Gnadenberg and Lindau.\n\nBy the late 1840s, there were five German colonies in the North Caucasus. The migration waves (especially to the Don Host Oblast) grew beginning in the second half of the 19th century with the capitalist influence on farming in Russia. Germans would immigrate not only from the regions adjacent to the Volga River but also from the Black Sea region and Germany. The majority of these Germans adhered to various branches of Protestantism, most commonly Lutheranism, Mennonitism and Baptism. Roman Catholics formed a minority and lived in six colonies.\n\nIn the winter of 1818–1819, 194 Swabian families primarily from Reutlingen arrived in Elisabethpol (Ganja) in eastern Transcaucasia from Tiflis. They were granted land 6 kilometres to the west of the city and founded the town of Helenendorf (Goygol) in the summer of 1819. Another German settlement, the town of Annenfeld (later merged with the city of Shamkir) was founded almost simultaneously 40 kilometres away from Helenendorf.\nGermans became an active and well-integrated community in Russian Transcaucasia. Unlike the settlement of Russian religious minorities, German colonies were located in \"places that were more economically advantageous, close to cities or important transportation routes.\" It became \"typical for Caucasian administrative centers to have a satellite agrarian German colony.\" According to Charles King, \"rows of trees lined the main streets\" of the German colonies near Tiflis. \"Schools and churches, conducting their business in German, offered education and spiritual edification. Beer gardens provided the main entertainment.\" In eastern Transcaucasia, German colonists learned Azerbaijani, while Russian was formally taught in schools starting in the late 19th century. Dolma, a traditional dish in the Caucasus popular among all Caucasus nationalities, became as common with the Caucasus Germans as traditional German dishes.\n\nThe Baltic German naturalist and explorer Friedrich Parrot encountered Swabian settlers near Tiflis on his expedition to Mount Ararat in 1829. He listed their settlements and personally visited Katharinenfeld and Elisabethtal, describing them:\n\nThe colonies suffered during the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28. Many of the settlements had been raided by marauding Kurds in 1826 who, according to Parrot, killed 30 people of Katharinenfeld's 85 families and captured 130 more. Half of those had not yet returned at the time of the naturalist's visit in 1829. While visiting the great bazaar in Erivan (Yerevan) with Khachatur Abovian (the Armenian writer and national public figure), Parrot encountered \"two Württemberg women, with five children\" who \"talked to one another in true Swabian dialect.\" They were from Katharinenfeld and Parrot resolved to tell their relatives back home about their location. When Parrot visited the village and told the colonists the news, he was very well received. The two women who he met in Erivan returned from comparably benign captivity with a \"wealthy Tatar chief\" where they had been pressured to convert to Islam. Parrot surmised that others might have been sold into slavery deeper into Turkish territory. Furthermore, he told of a case where a man received a letter from his wife who had married a Persian cleric in captivity and therefore allowed him to remarry.\n\nSome Germans moved voluntarily further south to Russian Armenia. Those who came from Württemberg were inspired by the concept of meeting the end of the world at the foot of Mount Ararat. On the invitation of Parrot, the Armenian writer Abovian attended the German-speaking University of Dorpat (Tartu) in present-day Estonia. He became a Germanophile and, after his return to the Caucasus, married a German woman, Emilia Looze, in Tiflis. They moved to Abovian's native Armenia and \"established a complete German household.\"\n\nDuring his travels to the Caucasus during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, the celebrated Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin visited one of the German colonies near Tiflis and recorded his experience in his \"Journey to Arzrum\". He ate dinner there, but was unimpressed by the food and the beer. \"We drank beer which is made there, with a very unpleasant taste, and paid very much for a very bad dinner,\" he wrote.\n\nIn 1843, during his visit to Russian Transcaucasia, German Baron August von Haxthausen also visited the German colonies of Georgia and the Tiflis region and extensively described their agricultural practices. He related an account from Moritz von Kotzebue about an unsuccessful religious pilgrimage of German colonists to Jerusalem, led by a woman who \"knew the whole Bible by heart, from beginning to end\" and who \"exercised a kind of magical influence on all around her.\" During his travels in the Caucasus, Haxthausen was accompanied by Peter Neu, a Swabian colonist from the Tiflis area who had \"a remarkable genius for languages and knew a dozen European and Asiatic tongues,—German, French, Russian, Circassian, Tatar, Turkish, Armenian, Georgian, Persian, Kurdish, etc.\" In addition, he \"possessed a rich gift of poetical imagination and had an inexhaustible treasury of \"märchen\", legends and popular songs, gleaned from all the countries he had visited.\" Neu accompanied Haxthausen, Khachatur Abovian and Abovian's uncle Harutiun on a visit to the Yazidi community of Armenia. Haxthausen, Abovian and Neu also visited the center of the Armenian Apostolic Church at Etchmiadzin and Neu accompanied Haxthausen on an excursion to the area of present-day South Ossetia.\n\nAdditional German colonies were established in eastern Transcaucasia during the latter half of the 19th century. Beginning in the 1880s six more German colonies were formed in the Elisabethpol Governorate: Georgsfeld in 1888, Alexejewka in 1902, Grünfeld and Eichenfeld in 1906, Traubenfeld in 1912 and Jelisawetinka in 1914. They became populated mostly by the descendents of the Germans from the two older colonies of Helenendorf and Annenfeld. By 1918 according to the German consul in Constantinople, there were 6,000 Germans living in these colonies overall. Helenendorf became the primary spiritual center for the Germans of the eight colonies. The oldest Lutheran church in present-day Azerbaijan, St. John's Church, was built in this town in 1857. Other Lutheran churches were built in Gadabay, Shamakhi, Elisabethpol, Baku and Annenfeld in 1868, 1869, 1885, 1897 and 1911 respectively. The ceremony of laying the first stone of Baku's German Church of the Saviour was attended by Emanuel Nobel, brother of Alfred Nobel, and other members of the city's elite.\n\nBaku's booming oil industry attracted many people from all over the Caucasus. By 1903, the German population of the city had grown to 3,749 (2.4% of the city's entire population at the time) and consisted mostly of natives of the original German colonies. Nikolaus von der Nonne, an ethnic German who had been working in Baku since 1883, was the mayor of Baku from 1898 to 1902. Notably, Richard Sorge, the famous ethnic German Soviet spy, was born in a suburb of Baku in 1895. His father was a German mining engineer who worked for the Caucasus Oil Company. Sorge is considered to have been one of the best Soviet spies in Japan before and during World War II and he was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union. The city of Baku dedicated a monument and park to him.\nCommonly referred to as \"nemsə\" (from the Russian \"немец\" – \"German\") by the local Azerbaijani population, Germans in the Elisabethpol Governorate were traditionally engaged in farming. However, starting from 1860, viticulture was becoming more and more important in the life of the German agricultural communities. By the end of the 19th century, 58% of the region's wine production was manufactured by the Vohrer Brothers and the Hummel Brothers of Helenendorf.\n\nIn 1865 and 1883, Siemens built two copper smelteries in Gadabay and a hydroelectric station in Galakand. In the 1860s, it initiated cobalt extraction in Dashkasan and built two power stations in Baku. The Siemens smelteries were officially closed down in 1914 when the Russian Empire entered World War I fighting against Germany and the tsarist government banned all German businesses in Russia.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Imperial Russia annexed the Kars region from the Ottoman Empire. The tsarist government launched a campaign to populate the newly established Kars Oblast with perceived \"reliable\" populations, including Germans. In 1891, a number of German families were resettled in Kars from the colony of Alexandershilf near Tiflis and established the village of Petrovka. Its population remained relatively low and consisted of about 200 people by 1911. Another two colonies in the province, Vladikars and Estonka, were founded between 1911 and 1914. These settlements were short-lived. Due to the Russian-Ottoman military confrontation at the start of World War I, most of the remaining German settlers from the Kars Oblast were evacuated to Eichenfeld. The Kars region itself was eventually annexed by Turkey in the treaties of Moscow and Kars.\n\nFrom 1906 to 1922, Baron Kurt von Kutschenbach published the German-language newspaper \"Kaukasische Post\" in Tiflis. It called itself the \"only German newspaper in the Caucasus.\" The editor-in-chief was the writer, journalist and Caucasus scholar Arthur Leist.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, Russian government attempts to Russify the German colonies in the Caucasus created a local backlash. Following Russian Revolutions of 1917 and the formation of the Transcaucasian Federation, German colonists formed the Transcaucasian German National Council (\"Transkaukasischer Deutscher Nationalrat\"), with its seat in Tiflis. In May 1918, the Transcaucasian Federation dissolved and the short-lived republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia were established. The German colonists strove to maintain their communities amid the upheaval of the Russian Civil War in the Caucasus. In the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the centenary of Helenendorf was marked by a public celebration within the community. The German community was also represented in the parliament of the republic by Lorenz Kuhn, a Helenendorf-born oil industry businessman.\n\nFollowing the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and the Sovietization of the Caucasus, the new Soviet government initially demonstrated a favorable attitude toward multiculturalism in the era of the New Economic Policy (NEP). The cultural and linguistic rights of ethnic groups were promoted by Soviet authorities in accordance with the \"korenizatsiya\" (nativization) policy of Soviet nationalities. In 1926, there were seven public primary schools in Soviet Azerbaijan with German as the language of instruction. The First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union in 1926 showed that 93,915 Caucasus Germans lived in the North Caucasus region of the Russian SFSR. Within the Transcaucasian SFSR, 13,149 lived in the Azerbaijan SSR, 12,047 in the Georgian SSR and 104 in the Armenian SSR. The situation changed with the rise of Joseph Stalin. The Soviet government gradually ordered all German-sounding place-names to be changed by the mid-1930s. The forced collectivization of agriculture under the first five-year plan and the resulting famine of 1932-33 hit the North Caucasus and the local German community very hard.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany in June 1941, the Caucasus Germans were internally deported by Soviet authorities to Central Asia and Siberia on the pretext that their loyalties were with Germany, even though this was not the case. According to scholar Pavel Polian, most of the Caucasus Germans (approximately 190,000 people) were deported from the North and South Caucasus to Kazakhstan and Siberia from September 1941 to June 1942.\n\nThe deportees were allowed to take very little luggage, hardly any food and then had to undergo a voyage across the Caspian Sea to the camps of Central Asia. They were told the voyage would only be for several days but many ships went back and forth for months, resulting in mass death from starvation and the climate, especially among children, the elderly and the sick. On one ship carrying deportees, about 775 Germans froze to death. Evidently, maritime officials had no clear instructions to land the deportees at a particular destination and were prohibited from landing them anywhere else. They eventually arrived by rail in the Lake Balkhash area, in Kazakhstan. This torment can be ascribed, in part, to the confusion caused by the war, but also, more importantly, to the typical callous treatment of political prisoners by the Stalin regime, which did not care if prisoners lived or died. The following eye-witness report relates a harrowing story of evacuation by ship:\n\nThe only ones not subject to deportation were German women who were married to non-Germans. Soon after Stalin's death in 1953 and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev to the Soviet leadership, the ban for the majority of the deported peoples to return to their homes was lifted. However, relatively few Germans returned to the Caucasus region. By 1979, there were only 46,979 Germans living in both North and South Caucasus.\n\nThere has been renewed interest in the Caucasus German community in the post-Soviet space since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In Georgia, there were approximately 30 older women of German ancestry left in Bolnisi as of 2002. The German town cemetery was leveled under Stalin and is marked today by a memorial honouring the memory of the German colonists. Recently, there has been increasing interest in Georgia on the part of local youth to find out more about their German heritage. Often this desire is closely related to Protestant beliefs, so as a result the New Apostolic Church works intensively with these young people as part of its regular youth programs.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, the remaining Germans are concentrated in the capital city of Baku, and many belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Community restored and officially registered in the early 1990s. The last German resident of Goygol (Helenendorf), Viktor Klein, died in 2007. The city has nowadays over 400 buildings whose construction dates back to the German period. In 2015, according to Klein's will, his familial house, built by his grandfather in 1886, was turned into the Museum of Caucasus German History. The former Lutheran church of Ganja has housed the Ganja State Puppet Theatre since 1986. In 2009, the non-functioning Lutheran church in Shamkir (into which Annenfeld was absorbed) was used as a community centre in the Soviet era was renovated and turned into a museum. Gadabay's German population left by 1922 after the exhaustion of the copper industry. The Lutheran church of the town was razed by the Soviet government in the 1920s.\n\nAlready small compared to the historical German communities of the neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia's remaining German population declined following the country's independence in 1991 due to economic factors. Many of the country's Germans emigrated to Germany. In recent years, the German community has been working closely with the German Educational and Cultural Center of Armenia to help organize German language schools and cultural events.\n\nThe last German resident of the Estonka colony (the present-day village of Karacaören in the Kars Province of Turkey), Frederik Albuk, died in 1999 in his native village, survived by his wife Olga Albuk of Russian-Estonian ancestry, who died there in August 2011. The 150-grave Lutheran cemetery where they were buried is the only remnant of the German community's presence in northeastern Turkey.\n\n\n\n"}

Similarly, David Cameron of the British Conservatives believes that citizen sourcing mechanisms and the advent of Web 2.0 technologies will help usher in “the next age of government” by truly enabling citizens to act on John Kennedy’s historic call to “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” \n\nCitizen sourcing is a derivative of the term crowdsourcing. “Citizen” is used instead of “crowd” to emphasis its governmental application and civic purpose. Citizen sourcing is a new take on the concept of the coproduction of public services by service users and communities enabled by the maturation of Web 2.0 participatory technologies.\n\nGranicus is an example of a solution that has been implemented in a number of cities like The City of Austin that allows the public to submit ideas for government services, improve upon these ideas with the help of government employees that moderate the discussions online, and ultimately design solutions in a crowdsourcing fashion that can be implemented by the city. HunchBuzz is another example which has been implemented by New Zealand's central government and is being rolled out to local city councils. CitizenLab is a more European-oriented ideation platform on which the citizens co-create their city through ideation and citizensourcing challenges. Their approach to civic engagement is through gamification, in order to incentivise citizens to share their input.\n\nThe City of Boston provides a Citizens Connect iPhone App that allows constituents to report various services requests, including for removing graffiti, filling potholes, and fixing traffic lights. A similar system, SeeClickFix, has been adopted in a number of cities across the United States.\n\nOnline communities of citizens such as the Crisis Commons (see Crisis camp) and the International Network of Crisis Mappers provide assistance to professional responders on the ground by performing data-driven tasks, such as locating missing persons (see, for instance, Person finder), converting satellite imagery into street maps (see, for instance, OpenStreetMap), and reporting and processing actionable citizen reports of needs and damage (see, for instance, the Ushahidi platform).\n\nThe Peer-to-Patent system enables citizens to assist the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in evaluating the validity of patent applications. Following the implementation of Peer-to-Patent, the USPTO started exploring how to further integrate citizens into the patent application review process. They invited experts to present at two roundtables on using citizen submissions in prior art. Presenters at the roundtables included experienced representatives from Peer-to-Patent, Ask Patents, Patexia, and Article One Partners. The USPTO also opened the process up to citizens by requesting public comments and suggestions on how to proceed following each of the two roundtables.\n\nThe City of Medellin, Colombia uses the power of the citizens' collective intelligence to identify potential solutions for important problems the city faces. The platform structures problems as open challenges; citizens can ideate, propose, identify, filter and vote on solutions, and the Mayor´s office reviews and implements solutions of its choosing.\n"}

In evolutionary biology, the term is also applied to males who are unwittingly investing parental effort in offspring that are not genetically their own.\n\nThe word \"cuckold\" derives from the cuckoo bird, alluding to its habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests. The association is common in medieval folklore, literature, and iconography.\n\nEnglish usage first appears about 1250 in the medieval debate poem \"The Owl and the Nightingale\". It was characterized as an overtly blunt term in John Lydgate's \"Fall of Princes\", c. 1440. Shakespeare's poetry often referred to cuckolds, with several of his characters suspecting they had become one.\n\nOne often-overlooked subtlety of the word is that it implies that the husband is deceived, that he is unaware of his wife's unfaithfulness and may not know until the arrival or growth of a child plainly not his (as with cuckoo birds).\n\nThe female equivalent \"cuckquean\" first appears in English literature in 1562, adding a female suffix to the \"cuck\".\n\nA related word, first appearing in 1520, is \"wittol\", which substitutes \"wit\" (in the sense of knowing) for the first part of the word, referring to a man aware of and reconciled to his wife's infidelity.\n\nIn Western traditions, cuckolds have sometimes been described as \"wearing the horns of a cuckold\" or just \"wearing the horns\". This is an allusion to the mating habits of stags, who forfeit their mates when they are defeated by another male. In Italy (especially in Southern Italy, where it is a major personal offence), the insult is often accompanied by the sign of the horns. In French, the term is \", which is used by Molière to describe someone whose consort has been unfaithful.\nIn German, the term is \", or \", the husband is \". Rabelais wrote the \"Tiers Livers\" of Gargantua and Pantagruel in 1546, by which time the symbol of the horns was \"so well-known and over-used that the author could barely avoid making reference to it\". Molière's \"L'École des femmes\" (1662) is the story of a man who mocks cuckolds and becomes one at the end. In Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (c. 1372–77), \"The Miller's Tale\" is a story that humorously examines the life of a cuckold. In Chinese usage, an altogether different allusion is used, when the cuckold (or wittol) is said to be \"\" (wearing the green hat), which derives from the sumptuary laws used in China from the 13th to the 18th centuries that required the males in households with prostitutes to wrap their heads in a green scarf (or later a hat).\n\nAn abbreviation of \"cuckold\", the term \"cuck\" has been used by the alt-right to attack the masculinity of an opponent. It was originally aimed at other conservatives, whom the alt-right saw as ineffective.\n\nUnlike the traditional definition of the term, in fetish usage a cuckold or wife watching is complicit in his (or her) partner's sexual \"infidelity\"; the wife who enjoys \"cuckolding\" her husband is called a cuckoldress if the man is more submissive. If a couple can keep the fantasy in the bedroom, or come to an agreement where being cuckolded in reality does not damage the relationship, they may try it out in reality. However, the primary proponent of the fantasy is almost always the one being humiliated, or the \"cuckold\": the cuckold convinces his lover to participate in the fantasy for them, though other \"cuckolds\" may prefer their lover to initiate the situation instead. The fetish fantasy does not work at all if the cuckold is being humiliated against their will.\n\nPsychology regards cuckold fetishism as a variant of masochism, the cuckold deriving pleasure from being humiliated. In Freudian analysis, cuckold fetishism is the eroticization of the fears of infidelity and of failure in the man's competition for procreation and the affection of females. In his book \"Masochism and the Self,\" psychologist Roy Baumeister advanced a \"Self Theory\" analysis that cuckolding (or specifically, all masochism) was a form of escaping from self-awareness, at times when self-awareness becomes burdensome, such as with perceived inadequacy. According to this theory, the physical or mental pain from masochism brings attention away from the self, which would be desirable in times of 'guilt, anxiety, or insecurity', or at other times when self-awareness is unpleasant.\n"}

The word can also refer to the people of this kingdom.\n\nThe Gonja are a Guan people who have been influenced by Akan, Mande and Hausa people. With the fall of the Songhai Empire (c. 1600), the Mande Ngbanya clan moved south, crossing the Black Volta and founding a city at Yagbum. The Gonja kingdom was originally divided into sections overseen by male siblings of Sumaila Ndewura Jakpa including their children and grandchildren.\n\nUnder the leadership of Naba'a, the Ngbanya dynasty of Gonja was founded. The capital was established at Yagbum.\n\nThe Ngbanya expanded rapidly, conquering several neighbors in the White Volta valley and beginning a profitable gold trade with the Akan states through nearby Begho. By 1675, the Gonja established a paramount chief, called the Yagbongwura, to control the kingdom. The Ngbanya dynasty has controlled this position from its founding to the present day, with only two brief interregnums. The current Yagbongwura, \"Tuntumba Sulemana Jakpa Bore Essa\", has held his position since 2010.\n\nPrecolonial Gonja society was stratified into castes, with a ruling class, a Muslim trader class, an animist commoner class, and a slave class.

While the word \"hinterland\" refers to an area near a coast line or river bank, the series explores wildlife throughout Canada in general, regardless of location.\n\nThe \"Hinterland Who's Who\" series was commissioned in 1962 by the Canadian Wildlife Service, as a way to generate interest in Canada's wildlife through a series of short, one-minute vignettes, broadcast during commercial breaks. The series, produced for the CWS by the National Film Board, has been airing on Canadian television since 1963.\n\nIn the original announcements, a distinctive refrain of flute music (John Cacavas' \"Flute Poem\") opens the ad, and is accompanied by the low-key style of the narrator, John Livingston (originally the executive director of the Canadian Audubon Society), describing the animal over footage of it taken in the wild.\n\nThe end of each message, where viewers were reminded to contact the Canadian Wildlife Service for additional information, varied. The earliest instalments from 1963 concluded with, \"For a more complete story on the [animal], why not contact the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa?\" After the series was introduced in color, it concluded with, \"For more information on the [animal], contact the Canadian Wildlife Service, in Ottawa.\" Newer segments in the late-1970s and 1980s ended with, \"For more information on the [animal], why not contact the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa?\", with later instalments including its postal code, K1A 0H3. Viewers requesting information received a four-page, illustrated brochure providing more details on the featured animal.\n\nBy the early-1990s, the series received about $3.6 million in free publicity, and over a million leaflets were sent out to inquiring viewers.\n\nA French version of this series was also produced, as Merveilles de la faune (\"Wonders of Wildlife\") or Faune et flore du pays (\"The country's fauna and flora\").\n\nIn 2003 the Canadian Wildlife Federation, in cooperation with the Government of Canada, began producing new episodes of \"Hinterland Who's Who\", featuring two versions:\n\nThese versions, now available as 30- or 60- second instalments, are often hosted on-camera and voiced by a female Canadian Wildlife Service worker, concluding with, \"To learn more about [subject], and how you can protect it, visit \"hww.ca\". The initial animals featured in the new series included the polar bear, the monarch butterfly, the leatherback sea turtle, and the loon.\n\nIn both cases, the new \"Hinterland Who's Who\" narrative includes suggestions for conservation along with the description of the animal and its behaviour.\n\nIn July 2013, it was announced that the first four instalments of \"Hinterland Who's Who\", released in the Summer of 1963, were presumed lost, as the Canadian Wildlife Federation and the Canadian Wildlife Service were unable to locate any copies for the series' 50th anniversary, despite extensive searches of various sources, including the NFB, Library and Archives Canada, the CBC archives, and even YouTube. These segments, filmed in black and white with versions in English and French, featured the beaver, the loon, the gannet and the moose.\n\nSoon after the problem of the search was made public, one of the missing instalments, an English-language version featuring the loon, were found in the CBC Vancouver archives a few days later, as part of a commercial break during a broadcast of the 1932 Laurel and Hardy classic comedy, \"Helpmates\" on July 1, 1969, a holiday then known as Dominion Day. According to Colin Preston, library coordinator at the CBC Vancouver Media Archives, the 1969 recordings were saved by a former CBC employee, who later donated them to the archives for posterity. The footage for the 1963 loon instalment was originally filmed in colour, but converted to black and white for the instalment. The colour film and soundtrack would be recycled in later versions of the series. Another of the missing four, the original beaver vignette, was subsequently found by Preston as well, as was the moose, and the gannet. To date, the French language versions of all four animals remain missing.\n\nStarting in August 2016, the local Mountain View, California television show John Wants Answers started airing the original Hinterland Who's Who vignettes in high definition. The show obtained digital high definition copies converted from the original film from the Canadian Film Board. \n\nThese announcements became a widely recognized and often-parodied feature of Canadian pop culture.\n\n\n\n"}

A scheduled tribe, their population in this region is estimated at 25,000 people. People of Irula ethnicity are called \"Irular\", and speak Irula, which belongs to the Dravidian family.\n\n\"Irular\" means \"dark people\" in Tamil and Malayalam, from the root word \"irul\", meaning \"darkness\", in reference to their dark skin complexion.\n\nThe tribe numbers 189,621 in significant region of Tamil Nadu and 23,721 in Kerala.\n\nEarly 20th century anthropological literature classified the Irular under the Negrito ethnic group. They belong to the Australoid race but are influenced from Caucasoids.\n\nUnlike the Negrito tribes in the Andaman Islands who have retained their language, Irular speak the Irula language, a Dravidian language that is closely related to Tamil, Yerukala, Sholaga and other Tamil languages.\n\nIrular live in two south Indian states – Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Tamil Nadu they live in the Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Erode districts. In Kerala they live in the Palakkad district and Attapady and Walayar panchayats.\n\nThey live in four taluks in Coimbatore district, namely Coimbatore South, Coimbatore North, Avinashi and Madathukulam. The Coimbatore district houses 4254 Irulas in 40 settlements comprising 139 villages. Nearly 100 Vettakada Irula settlements are found in the forest areas or in the deep mountainous jungles. There are 4 tribal settlements in the Siruvani Hills comprising 14 villages.\n\nThe Census of Kerala identified 756 Irulan individuals from 189 families, who lived in 9 settlements covering .23 km² in the state.\n\nTraditionally, the main occupation of the Irulas has been snake and rat catching. They also work as labourers (coolies) in the fields of the landlords during the sowing and harvesting seasons or in the rice mills. Fishing is also a major occupation.\n\nRats destroy a quarter of the grain grown on Tamil Nadu-area farms annually. To combat this pest, Irula men use a traditional earthen pot fumigation method. Smoke is blown through their mouths, which leads to severe respiratory and heart problems.\n\nIn January 2017, Masi Sadaiyan and Vadivel Gopal from the Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu were brought in, along with two translators, to work with detection dogs to track down and capture invasive Burmese pythons in Key Largo, Florida. The Irula men and their translators were paid $70,000 by the State of Florida, and captured 14 pythons in less than two weeks.\n\n\n"}

In the 14th century, Alania was destroyed by Timur and the decimated population dispersed into the mountains. Timur's incursion into the North Caucasus introduced the local nations to Islam.\n\nIn the nineteenth century Russia took over the area during the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. On October 20, 1828 the took place, in which the Russian troops were under the command of General Georgy Emanuel. The day after the battle, as Russian troops were approaching the \"aul\" of , the Karachay elders met with the Russian leaders and an agreement was reached for the inclusion of the Karachay into the Russian Empire.\n\nAfter the annexation, the self-government of Karachay was left intact, including its officials and courts. Interactions with neighboring Muslim peoples continued to take place based on both folk customs and Sharia law. In Karachay, soldiers were taken from Karachai Amanat, pledged an oath of loyalty, and were assigned arms.\n\nFrom 1831 to 1860, the Karachays joined the anti-Russian struggles carried out by the Caucasian peoples. Between 1861 and 1880, to escape reprisals by the Russian army, large numbers of Karachays migrated to Turkey.\n\nIn 1942 the Germans permitted the establishment of a Karachay National Committee to administer their \"autonomous region\"; the Karachays were also allowed to form their own police force and establish a brigade that was to fight with the Wehrmacht. This relationship with Nazi Germany resulted, when the Russians regained control of the region in November 1943, with the Karachays being charged with collaboration with Nazi Germany and deported. The majority of the total population of about 80,000 were forcibly deported and resettled in Central Asia, mostly in Kazakhstan and Kirghizia. In the first two years of the deportations, disease and famine caused the death of 35% of the population; of 28,000 children, 78%, or almost 22,000 perished.\n\nMany Karachays migrated to Turkey after the Russian annexation of the Karachay nation in the early 19th century. Karachays were also forcibly displaced to the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia during Joseph Stalin's relocation campaign in 1944. Since the Nikita Khrushchev era in the Soviet Union, many Karachays have been repatriated to their homeland from Central Asia. Today, there are sizable Karachay communities in Turkey (centered on Afyonkarahisar), Uzbekistan, the United States, and Germany.\n\nThe Karachay nation, along with the Balkars and Nogays occupy the valleys and foothills of the Central Caucasus in the river valleys of the Kuban, Big Zelenchuk River, Malka, Baksan, Cherek and others.\n\nThe Karachays are very proud of the symbol of their nation, Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain in Europe, with an altitude of 5,642 meters.\n\nLike other peoples in the mountainous Caucasus, the relative isolation of the Karachay allowed them to develop their particular cultural practices, despite general accommodation with surrounding groups.\n\nKarachay people live in communities that are divided into families and clans (\"tukums\"). A \"tukum\" is based on a family's lineage and there are roughly thirty-two Karachay \"tukums\". Prominent \"tukums\" include: Aci, Batcha (Batca), Baychora, Bayrimuk (Bayramuk), Bostan, Catto (Jatto), Cosar (Çese), Duda, Hubey (Hubi), Karabash, Laypan, Lepshoq, Ozden (Uzden), Silpagar, Tebu, Teke, Toturkul, Urus.\n\nKarachay people are very independent, and have strong traditions and customs which dominate many aspects of their lives: e.g. weddings, funerals, and family pronouncements. They are fiercely loyal to both their immediate family and their \"tukum\". They will never offend a guest. Cowardice is the most serious shame for a male.\n\nThe Karachay dialect of the Karachay-Balkar language comes from the northwestern branch of Turkic languages. The Kumyks, who live in northeast Dagestan, speak a closely related language, the Kumyk language. The majority of the Karachay people are followers of Islam.\n\n\n"}

Although it shares a lot of vocabulary with the neighboring Luang language, and is marginally mutually intelligible.\n\nFewer than 1% of Leti speakers are literate in Leti, though between a quarter and a half are literate in another language.\n\nThe main dialectological division in Leti is between eastern varieties, spoken in the domains of Laitutun and Luhuleli, and western varieties, spoken in the domains of Batumiau, Tutukei, Tomra, and Nuwewang. This article focusses on the Tutukei variety and is based on a descriptive study by Aone van Engelenhoven (2004), a Dutch linguist of Leti descent. Tutukei itself divides into two sociolects, \"lirlèta\" (<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"lèta\" language', \"lèta\" meaning '(walled) village') and \"lirkòta\" ('city language').\n\nLeti also has two literary or ritual varieties, \"lirmarna\" ('royal language') and \"lirasnïara\" ('sung language'). Both of them prominently feature lexical parallelism.\n\nPer van Engelenhoven 2004, \"the major issue in formal Leti discourse is to keep speaking as long as possible. Indeed, the important element in 'royal speech' is not what is said, but rather how it is said and how long it takes to be said\". In particular \"lirmarna\" features formulaic pairs of clauses which are syntactically identical, each pair of corresponding words in the two clauses forming a lexical pair.\n\n\"Lirasnïara\" is the sung form of \"lirmarna\". It employs a repertoire of approximately 150 Luangic-Kisaric words with distinctive sound changes: e.g. 'flower' and 'point' are and in \"lirasniara\". Often borrowings from Malay are inserted as well. Again per van Engelenhoven 2004, \"in Southwest Malukan society turn-taking in singing is ritualized and as such a fixed strategy, which makes it a powerful rhetoric device in Leti discourse. [...] [A] song may not be interrupted when performed. Singing is thus a means to prevent interruption in a speech event or an instrument to surpass the other speech participants\".\n\nIn addition, the phonemes , , , , and occur only in loans, mostly from Indonesian, Tetum, and the local variety of Malay.\n\nThese vowels can also occur long; the phonemic status of long vowels hangs on the interpretation of Leti's pervasive metathetic processes.\n\nThe mid vowels are restricted to the penult of lexical morphemes, which is stressed. The majority of these morphemes provide no evidence for the height contrast — are found before an ultimate and in other positions — and diachronically there was no contrast. However, the contrast is set up synchronically on account of certain exceptions ( 'he, she', 'refuse', 'stay'), and the fact that when suffixed the conditioning vowel can disappear: \n\nMetathesis and apocope, together \"binding\" processes, are pervasive in Leti as a feature of combinations of morphemes. The preferred \"flow of speech\" in Leti seems to involve chains of CCV units.\n\nThe free form of any Leti morpheme always features a final vowel, so those whose bound forms end in consonants feature two allomorphs which are related by CV metathesis. Thus 'skin, fly (n.), fish, bird' have bound forms (the latter two with long vowels) but free forms .\n\nWhen a morpheme whose bound form ends in a vowel is prefixed to another component, that final vowel may apocopate or metathesise into the following component. CV metathesis happens when the metathesising vowel is high and it's followed by at most one consonant and a nonhigh vowel. The metathesised vowel is realised as a glide, written as \"ï ü\". Thus \"sivi + ternu\" 'chicken + egg' becomes \"sivtïernu\" 'chicken egg', \"au + laa\" 1st sing. pronoun + 'go' becomes \"alüaa\" 'I go'. In other contexts apocope happens, unless this would leave an illicit three-consonant cluster. So \"sivi + ruri\" 'chicken + bone' becomes \"sivruri\" 'chicken bone', \"kusa + nama\" 'cat + tongue' becomes \"kusnama\" 'cat's tongue'.\n\nA similar metathesis is found with the nominaliser, historically an infix \"-in-\", but now taking the form \"-nï-\" among many other allomorphs (detailed more below): thus \"sora\" 'sew' derives \"snïora\" 'needle'.\n\nHuman nouns pluralise with the third person plural pronominal clitic \"-ra\", which must follow another suffixed element: \"püata\" 'woman', \"püat=e\" 'the woman', \"püat=e=ra\" 'the women'. Nonhuman nouns pluralise by repetition: \"kuda\" 'horse', \"kuda kuda\" 'horses'.\n\nLeti has four possessive suffixes, which undergo binding. \n\nThe vowel V in the first person plural and third person suffix copies the last vowel of its base.\n\nNouns can be zero-derived to verbs: e.g. \"rita\" 'roof' → \"na-rita\" 'he roofs' or 'it has a roof'.\n\nNominal compounding is highly productive as a derivational process. Some examples are \"rai + lavna\" 'king' + 'big' → \"ralïavna\" 'emperor', \"pipi + ïadmu\" 'goat' + 'shed' → \"pipïadmu\" 'goat shed', \"vutu + müani\" 'ribbon' + 'man' → \"vutumüani\" 'man's ribbon', \"vika + papa\" 'buttocks' + 'cucumber' → \"vikpapa\" 'cockroach', \"kapla + nèma\" reduplicated 'ship' + 'fly' → \"kapalnèmnèma\" 'airplane'.\n\nVerbs fall into two classes according to whether their subject prefixes exhibit binding or not: those of Class I do not, those of Class II do. By default verbs are in Class II. Certain verbs are lexically in Class I (like \"nòa\" 'advise'), together with all verbs with complex onsets (\"ssòrna\" 'cough') and denominal or causativised verbs\n(\"veli\" 'buy', from the noun \"veli\" 'price'). The subject prefixes are as follows. \n\nVerbs with first person singular inflection necessarily take the pronoun \"a=\" 'I' as a proclitic.\n\nSome causatives are marked only by class change: \"pali\" means 'float' in class II and 'make float' in class I.\n\nThe nominalising affix productively derives nouns from verbs. It takes several different forms, most of which are infixes, depending on the phonological shape and the class of its base. \nReduplication, which usually copies a root-initial CV or CVCV sequence with binding, has a variety of functions, among them adjectivisation of nouns (\"üau\" 'idiot' → \"üa-üau\" 'idiotic') and verbs (\"mèra\" 'redden' → \"mèr-mèra\"), derivation of nouns, especially instruments (\"sòra\" 'sew' → \"sòr-sòra\" 'needle'), marking atelicity, and relativising on an object (\"n-vèèta\" 'he pulls' → \"(n-)vèvèèta\" 'which he pulls').\n\nMany of Leti's lexical items are organised into lexical pairs,\nwhich are always deployed as fixed combinations in a fixed order. \nA few pairs involve adjectives or numerals, but the\nvast majority consist of nouns (e.g. \"püata // müani\" 'woman // man', \n\"üèra // vatu\" 'water // stone') or verbs\n(e.g. \"kili // toli\" 'look // see', \"keri // kòi\" 'scratch / scrape').\n\nSome words are confined to lexical pairs, \nsuch as \"tirka\" in \"tirka // llena\" 'lightning', \nor both \"dupla\" and \"mavla\" in \"dupla // mavla\" 'witchcraft';\nthese pairs are restricted to \"lirmarna\".\nIn \"lirmarna\" the function of lexical pairs is to\nhighlight particular elements of a sentence, or simply to mark formality. \nWhen used in ordinary speech, the meanings of\nlexical pairs can relate in various ways to those of their components:\nOr they can simply have the sense of a conjunction, e.g.\n\"asu // vavi\" 'dog // pig' = 'the dog and the pig';\nthese are the only sort of conjoined phrases that do not require\nthe conjunction \"na\".\n\nThe phones of Luangic-Kisaric continue those of \nProto-Malayo-Polynesian according to the following sound changes (based on Mills 2010).\nIn Western Leti, LK has vanished and\nLK from MP *e is manifested as .\nIn Eastern Leti, LK becomes \nand LK becomes in the penult before a low vowel.\n\nRoger Mills suggests that Luangic-Kisaric retained distinct reflexes of PMP *ŋ, on the basis of other languages in the family, and *Z. Moreover, although the status of *Z as a PMP phoneme is unclear — Mills along with John U. Wolff and Robert Blust no longer admit it, realigning it with *z — the Luangic languages have no clear examples of inherited *z, despite numerous examples of *Z > .\n\nMills explains the metathesis found in consonant-final basis\nas arising from an original echo vowel added to consonant-final forms,\ne.g. *\"kúlit\" 'skin' > \"kúliti\", after which the original\npost-tonic vowel was deleted, e.g. yielding \"kúlti\" > Leti \"ulti\".\n\nJonker (1932) was the first full-scale investigation of Leti, based on a native informant and the few 19th-century works on the language then available.\n\nThe following paragraph is the opening of the Sailfish story as told by Upa S. Manina of \"Talvunu // Resïara\" house in the Ilwiaru quarters in Tutukei and reproduced in van Engelenhoven (2004). The Sailfish story is of great importance to Leti society: it provides an origin story for the Leti 'boat owner clans' of Luang origin, describing the destruction of the mythical former Luang continent and the migrations that brought its inhabitants to Leti.\n\nLeti\n\nEnglish\n\n"}

{"id": "37829036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37829036", "title": "Mobile phone overuse", "text": "Mobile phone overuse\n\nMobile phone overuse (smartphone addiction, mobile-phone addiction, problem mobile phone use, or mobile phone dependency) is a dependence syndrome seen among mobile phone users. Some mobile phone users exhibit problematic behaviors related to substance use disorders. These behaviors can include preoccupation with mobile communication, excessive money or time spent on mobile phones, use of mobile phones in socially or physically inappropriate situations such as driving an automobile. Increased use can also lead to increased time on mobile communication, adverse effects on relationships, and anxiety if separated from a mobile phone or sufficient signal.\n\nOveruse is often defined as a \"dependence syndrome\", which is the term used by the World Health Organization (WHO Expert Committee, 1964) to replace \"addiction\" or \"habituation.\" This is categorized either as substance abuse, such as from psychoactive drugs, alcohol and tobacco under ICD-10, or a behavioral addiction, such as a mobile phone addiction.\n\nSubstance use disorders can be defined by 11 factors, according to the DSM-5, including: (1) use in larger quantities or for longer than initially intended, (2) a desire to cut down or control use, (3) spending a great deal of time obtaining, using, or recovering from the substance, (4) craving, (5) use in situations in which it is physically hazardous, (6) continued use of the substance despite adverse physical or psychological consequences associated with use, and (7) withdrawal symptoms.\n\nSmartphone addiction can be compared to substance use disorders in that smartphones provide the drug (entertainment and connection) while acting as the means by which the drug is consumed. A study conducted at Alabama State University on the effects of smartphones on students, defines the issue by stating that we are not addicted to smartphones themselves, but that we \"are addicted to the information, entertainment, and personal connections [that a smartphone] delivers.\" People have an affinity for constant entertainment, and smartphones provide the quickest, most easily accessible route to it.\n\nPrevalence of mobile phone overuse depends largely on definition and thus the scales used to quantify a subject's behaviors. Two scales are in use, the 20-item self-reported Problematic Use of Mobile Phones (PUMP) scale, and the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS), which have been used both with adult and adolescent populations. There are variations in the age, gender, and percentage of the population affected problematically according to the scales and definitions used. The prevalence among British adolescents aged 11–14 was 10%. In India, addiction is stated at 39-44% for this age group. Under different diagnostic criteria, the estimated prevalence ranges from 0 to 38%, with self-attribution of mobile phone addiction exceeding the prevalence estimated in the studies themselves. The prevalence of the related problem of Internet addiction was 4.9-10.7% in Korea, and is now regarded as a serious public health issue.\n\nBehaviors associated with mobile-phone addiction differ between genders. Women are more likely to develop addictive mobile phone behavior than men. Men experience less social stress than women and use their mobile phones less for social purposes. Older people are less likely to develop addictive mobile phone behavior because of different social usage, stress, and greater self-regulation.\n\nOveruse of mobile phones can affect social and psychological well-being and health.\n\nThere is an enormous impact of the mobile phone on contemporary society from a social scientific perspective. In his 2002 book \"Perpetual contact: mobile communication, private talk, public performance\", the author, James Katz, writes: \"They [mobile phones] have transformed social practices and changed the way we do business, yet surprisingly we have little perception on their effect in our [lives].\"\n\nSome people are replacing face-to-face conversations with cybernetic ones. Clinical psychologist Lisa Merlo says, \"Some patients pretend to talk on the phone or fiddle with apps to avoid eye contact or other interactions at a party.\" In a survey made by Gazelle, \"More than 25% of respondents reported that they 'almost always' use their smartphone while in a social setting such as during a meal or during a party. In addition, 58% said they use it 'usually' or 'occasionally' during these settings.\" Furthermore,\n\nThis change in style from face-to-face to text-based conversation has also been observed by Sherry Turkle. Her work cites connectivity as an important trigger of social behavior change regarding communication; therefore, this adaptation of communicating is not caused only by the phone itself. In her book, \"Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other\", Turkle argues that we now find ourselves in a state of \"continual co-presence.\" This means that digital communication allows the occurrence of two or more realities in the same place and time. Subsequently, we also live in a \"world of continual partial attention,\" the process of paying simultaneous attention to a number of sources of incoming information, but at a superficial level. Bombarded with an abundance of emails, texts, messages, we not only find ourselves divesting people of their human characteristics or individuality, but also increasingly treating them as digital units. This is often referred to as depersonalization.\n\nAccording to Elliot Berkman, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon, the constant checking of our phones is caused by reward learning and the fear of missing out. Berkman explains that, “Habits are a product of reinforcement learning, one of our brain's most ancient and reliable systems,” and we tend, thus, to develop habits of completing behaviors that have rewarded us in the past. For many, using our mobile phone has been enjoyable in the past, leading us to feel excited and positive when we receive a notification from our phones. Berkman also iterates that we often check our smartphones to relieve the social pressure we place upon ourselves to never miss out on exciting things. As Berkman says, “Smartphones can be an escape from boredom because they are a window into many worlds other than the one right in front of you,” helping us feel included and involved in society. When we do not check our mobile phones, we are unable to satisfy this “check habit” or suppress the fear of missing out, leading us to feel anxious and irritable. A survey conducted by Hejab M. Al Fawareh and Shaidah Jusoh also found that people also often feel incomplete without their smartphones. Of the 66 respondents, 61.41% strongly agreed or agreed with the statement, “I feel incomplete when my smartphone is not with me.”\n\nOther implications of cell phone use in mental health symptoms were observed by Thomée et al. in Sweden. This study found a relationship between report of mental health and perceived stress of participants' accessibility, which is defined as the possibility to be disturbed at any moment of day or night.\n\nThere is some evidence supporting the claim that excessive mobile phone use can cause or worsen health problems.\n\nGerms are everywhere, and considering the number of times people interact with their cellphone under different circumstances and places, germs are very likely to transfer from one place to another. Research from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine at Queen Mary in 2011 indicated that one in six cell phones is contaminated with fecal matter. Under further inspection, some of the phones with the fecal matter were also harboring lethal bacteria such as \"E. coli\", which can result in fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nAccording to the article \"Mobile Phones and Nosocomial Infections,\" written by researchers at Mansoura University of Egypt, it states that the risk of transmitting the bacteria by the medical staff (who carry their cellphones during their shift) is much higher because cellphones act as a reservoir where the bacteria can thrive.\n\nCancer, specifically brain cancer, and its correlation with phone use, is under ongoing investigation. Many variables affect the likelihood of hosting cancerous cells, including how long and how frequently people use their phones. There has been no definitive evidence linking cancer and phone use if used moderately, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization said in 2011 that radio frequency is a possible human carcinogen, based on heavy usage increasing the risk of developing glioma tumors. Although a relationship has not been fully established, research is continuing based on leads from changing patterns of mobile phone use over time and habits of phone users. Low level radio frequency radiation has also been confirmed as a promoter of tumors in mice.\nMinor acute immediate effects of radio frequency exposure have long been known such as the Microwave auditory effect which was discovered in 1962.\n\nStudies show that users often associate using a mobile phone with headaches, impaired memory and concentration, fatigue, dizziness and disturbed sleep. There are also concerns that some people may develop electrosensitivity from excessive exposure to electromagnetic fields, although these symptoms may be primarily psychological in origin due to the nocebo effect.\n\nUsing a cell phone before bed can cause insomnia, according to a study by scientists from the Karolinska Institute and Uppsala University in Sweden and from Wayne State University in Michigan. The study showed that this is due to the radiation received by the user as stated, \"The study indicates that during laboratory exposure to 884 MHz wireless signals, components of sleep believed to be important for recovery from daily wear and tear are adversely affected.\" Additional adverse health effects attributable to smartphone usage include a diminished quantity and quality of sleep due to an inhibited secretion of melatonin.\n\nIn 2014, 58% of World Health Organization states advised the general population to reduce radio frequency exposure below heating guidelines. The most common advice is to use hands-free kits (69%), to reduce call time (44%), use text messaging (36%), avoid calling with low signals (24%) or use phones with low specific absorption rate (SAR) (22%). In 2015 Taiwan banned toddlers under the age of two from using mobile phones or any similar electronic devices, and France banned WiFi from toddlers' nurseries.\n\nAs the market increases to grow, more light is being shed upon the accompanying behavioural health issues and how mobile phones can be problematic. Mobile phones continue to become increasingly multifunctional and sophisticated, which this in turn worsens the problem.\n\nAccording to optician Andy Hepworth, blue violet light, a light that is transmitted from the cell phone into the eye is potentially hazardous and can be \"toxic\" to the back of the eye. He states that an over exposure to blue violet light can lead to a greater risk of macular degeneration which is a leading cause of blindness.\n\nThere are concerns that some mobile phone users incur considerable debt, and that mobile phones are being used to violate privacy and harass others. In particular, there is increasing evidence that mobile phones are being used as a tool by children to bully other children.\n\nThere is a large amount of research on mobile phone use, and its positive and negative influence on the human's psychological mind and social communication. Mobile phone users may encounter stress, sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression, especially young adults.\nConsistent phone use can cause a chain reaction, affecting one aspect of a user's life and expanding to contaminate the rest. It usually starts with social disorders, which can lead to depression and stress and ultimately affect lifestyle habits such as sleeping right and eating right.\n\nAccording to research done by Jean M. Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, there is a correlation between mobile phone overuse and depression. According to Twenge and her colleagues, at the same time that smartphones were on the rise, there was also an increase seen in depressive symptoms and even suicides among adolescents in 2010. The theory behind this research is that adolescents who are being raised as a generation of avid smartphone users are spending so much time on these devices that they forgo actual human interaction which is seen as essential to mental health, “The more time teens spend looking at screens, the more likely they are to report symptoms of depression.” While children used to spend their free time outdoors with others, with the advancement of technology, this free time is seemingly now being spent more on mobile devices.\n\nPsychologist Nancy Colier makes the point that we all have lost sight of what is truly important to us in life. She says that people have become “disconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings.” Our addiction to technology has deterred neurological and relationship development because tech is being introduced to people at a very young age. People have become so addicted to their phones that they are almost dependent on them. Our bodies are not meant to be constantly staring at a screen as we need time to relax our eyes and more importantly our minds. Colier states, “Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down — it’s in constant fight-or-flight mode. “We’re wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we’re not doing it.”\n\nThe amount of time spent on screens appears to have a correlation with happiness levels. A nationally-representative study of American 12th graders funded by the \"National Institute on Drug Abuse\" titled \"Monitoring the Future Survey\" found that “teens who spent more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non screen activities are more likely to be happy.” One of the most important findings of this study is how the amount of time spent on non screen activities versus on screen activities affects the happiness levels of teenagers.\n\nHowever, while it is easy to see a correlation between cell phone overuse and these symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation, it is much harder to prove that cell phones themselves cause these issues. Studies of correlations cannot prove causation because there are multiple other factors that increase depression in people today. Although parents and other figures share these concerns, according to Peter Etchells, a psychologist at Bath Spa University in England, other possible variables must be reviewed as well. Etchells proposes two possible alternative theories: depression could cause teens to use iphones more or teens could be more open to discussing the topic of depression in this day and age.\n\nA survey done by a group of independent opticians reviled that 43% of people under the age of 25 experienced anxiety or even irritation when they were not able to access their phone whenever they wanted. This survey shows the psychological effect that cell phones have on people, specifically young people. Checking a cell phone has become a normal daily event for many people over the years just as getting dressed in the morning is, people don't feel right when they don't do it.\n\nMobile phone overuse can be especially dangerous in certain situations such as texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving. Over 8 people are killed and 1,161 are injured daily because of distracted driving. At any given daylight moment across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or electronic devices while driving. The significant number of injuries and accidents from distracted driving can be contributed at least partially to mobile phone overuse. There is currently no national ban on texting while driving, but many states have implemented laws to try to prevent these accidents.\n\nGerman psychotherapist and online addiction expert Bert te Wildt recommends using tools such as Offtime and Menthal to help prevent mobile phone overuse.\n\nMany smartphone addiction activists (such as Tristan Harris) recommend turning one's phone screen to grayscale mode, which helps reduce time spent on mobile phones by making them boring to look at.\n\nThere are many apps available on Android and iOS stores which help track mobile usage. For example, in iOS 12 Apple added a function called \"Screen Time\" that allows users to see how much time they have spent on the phone.\n\n\n"}

The Moorish Orthodox Church of America published a journal entitled the \"Moorish Science Monitor\" from 1965-1967, which has been revived at times over the next few decades, including its most recent revival in 2017. Moorish Orthodoxy was founded to explore the more esoteric dimensions of Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science teachings, but quickly developed into a movement of spiritual exploration beyond its intended purpose, though it maintains Moorish Science as its core. After a long period of quiescence, the Moorish Orthodox Church of America experienced a small renaissance in the mid-1980s owing to the involvement of former members of the beat/beatnik movement, the counter-cultural hippie community, and the gay liberation movement, along with the continued involvement of Sultan Rafi Sharif Bey (who founded the Moorish League) and the prolific writings of Hakim Bey.\n\nAfter the death of Sultan Rafi Sharif Bey and the disassociation and controversy involving Hakim Bey, membership decreased substantially to only a handful of members internationally. In 1991, the Khalwat-i-Khidr Lodge of Moorish Orthodox Church was founded in Dallas, Texas by a disparate coalition of artists, musicians, rocket scientists, cybermeticists, alternative mystics, and the like. Yehoodi El and Mustafa al-Layla are regarded to be the \"leaders\" of this new revival of Moorish Orthodoxy through their founding of Khalwat-i-Khidr Lodge, the re-publishing of the Moorish Science Monitor, the establishment of a Dallas radio segment known as the Moorish Radio Flyer on the Mansion of Madness radio show, and by bringing the Moorish Orthodox Church of America to social media, which has been its main avenue of promulgation to this day. Modern Moorish Orthodoxy has been further influenced by and has influenced different movements such as Chaos Magic, Punk subculture, Rave, Thelema, and other non-conformist seekers desiring to embrace a spiritual tradition with an anarchist ethos. \n\nMoorish Orthodoxy embraces an anarchist model of organization, believing strongly in the concept that \"you are, each one, a priest, just for yourself\" as proclaimed in the Circle 7 Koran. As such, temples are mostly self-declared and/or choose to affiliate themselves and derive their \"authority\" through another temple and/or an autonomous charter-granting body. These temples also range in size (from one person to near a hundred), focus (Judaism, Christianity, Moorish Science, Zoroastrianism, Islam, etc.), membership credentials (the most popular being the \"spiritual passport\"), and name (lodge, temple, ashram, church, chapel, etc.) The most \"organized\" portions of Moorish Orthodoxy tend to be its Adept Chamber, in which bodies are established for the formal study and exploration of both the core and fringes of various spiritual systems. The current bodies of the Adept Chamber are the Order of the Paraclete (Christian), the Fatamid Order (Islam), the Order of Jerusalem (Judaism), the Sabian Order (Paganism and Western Esotericism), with their own initiation rites and rituals.\n\n\n \n"}

Below these sit a number of other decorations, associated and otherwise, that do not confer knighthoods. However, the Royal House of Savoy, Italy's former Royal Family, also continues to bestow knighthoods in three orders of chivalry previously recognised by the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe degrees of knighthood, not all of which apply to all orders, are Knight (\"Cavaliere\" abbreviated \"Cav.\"), Officer (\"Ufficiale\" abbreviated \"Uff.\"), Commander (\"Commendatore\" abbr. \"Comm.\"), Grand Officer (\"Grand'Ufficiale\", abbr. \"Gr. Uff.\"), Knight Grand Cross (\"Cavaliere di Gran Croce\", abbr. \"Cav. Gr. Croce\") and Knight Grand Cross with cordon (\"Cavaliere di Gran Croce con cordone\"). Italian citizens may not use within the territory of the Republic honours or distinctions conferred on them by non-national orders or foreign states, unless authorised by decree of the President of the Council of Ministers. The use of awards of the Holy See (including the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre) is subject to permission, while the use of those of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta is unregulated.\n\nThe Order of Merit of the Italian Republic effectively replaced as national orders the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1362), the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) and the Order of the Crown of Italy (1868), which the sovereign, as \"fons honorum\", did not abdicate. Today these continue merely as dynastic orders of the Royal House in exile. While their bestowal is suppressed by law in Italy, the use of those decorations conferred prior to 1951 is recognised, exclusive of any right of precedence in official ceremonies.\nThe Sardinian orders of the Most Holy Annunciation, of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and the Military and Civil orders of Savoy were continued on the unification of Italy in 1861. These were augmented during the Liberal period by the Order of the Crown of Italy, the Chivalrous Order of Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Merit, the Colonial Order of the Star of Italy and later, by the Civil and Military Order of the Roman Eagle. In contrast to the Republican orders, the feminine style \"Dama\" is used for women.\n\nThe Knight Bachelor, usually transmitted by male primogeniture, was similar to a British baronetcy but older.

These domestic buildings could include workshops, livestock stalls and stables; storage facilities such as barns, sheds and granaries, as well as quarters for servants such as maids, farm workers, and even the castle governors or castellans. In many cases there was also a brewery, a bakehouse and a kitchen, if the latter was not located in the hall or \"palas\". An outer bailey was often called a base court in England. Depending on topography it could also be referred to as a lower bailey or lower ward, the keep being in the upper bailey or ward. Chepstow Castle has lower, middle and upper baileys.\n\nThe domestic buildings of the continental \"schloss\", often a stately home or palace, may also be referred to as an outer ward (German: \"Vorburg\"). These frequently contained a carriage house or a cavalier house, buildings that were not common in medieval castles. Large castles often have more than one bailey; examples include Monschau and Bürresheim. At some larger castles, markets were held in the outer bailey (c.f. \"suburbium\").\n\nOuter baileys were usually enclosed and protected by a ring wall and separated from the actual living area of the castle – the inner ward and keep – by a moat, a wall and a gate.\n\nIn lowland castles, the outer bailey is usually arranged in a half-moon shape around the main castle. In the case of hill castles, the topographic features of the terrain had to be taken account of, with the result that the outer bailey was usually slightly lower than the inner ward, hence the alternative names of \"lower bailey\" or \"lower ward\". Rudelsburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt is one of the rare cases of a hill castle where both baileys are at the same level.\n\nIn many cases the main entrance to the inner living quarters led through the outer bailey, which thus formed a kind of defensive buffer and often also served as refuge for the villagers who lived outside the castle walls. This explains why the castle chapel was often found in the bailey: it served as the parish church for the commoners.\n\n\n"}

They are sometimes referred to as a sub-caste of the Govigama caste.\n\nAncient rock inscriptions of Sri Lanka and historical literature refer to this community as \"Pamunu Parapuru\" in contexts such as \"vahal, sarak, pamunu parapuru\", which translates into English as \"slaves, oxen and heritable agricultural labour\" (EZ III.87,105,126& 132).\n\nBased on their region of residence these communities have now been mostly absorbed by the Bathgama or Govigama castes. The word Pamunu still survives in Sri Lankan family names and place names such as \"Pamunugama\", \"Pamunuvita\", and Pamunuva\". However, in the 20th century many of these have been changed to \"Bamunu\", to convey an association with Brahmins.\n\n"}
{"id": "56846326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56846326", "title": "Platform economy", "text": "Platform economy\n\nThe platform economy is economic and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such platforms are typically online matchmakers or technology frameworks. Sometimes are refereed as digital platform, two sided market (see recent review paper on digital platform ) By far the most common type are \"transaction platforms\", also known as \"digital matchmakers\". Examples of transaction platforms include Amazon, Airbnb, Uber and Baidu. A second type is the \"innovation platform\", which provides a common technology framework upon which others can build, such as the many independent developers who work on Microsoft's platform.\n\nForerunners to contemporary digital economic platforms can be found throughout history, especially in the second half of the 20th century. Yet it was only in the year 2000 that the \"platform\" metaphor started to be widely used to describe digital matchmakers and innovation platforms. Especially after the financial crises of 2008, companies operating with the new \"platform business model\" have swiftly came to control an increasing share of the world's overall economic activity, sometimes by disrupting traditional business. Examples include the decline of BlackBerry and Nokia due to competition from platform companies, the closing down of Blockbuster due to competition from the Netflix platform, or the many other brick and mortar retailers that have closed in part due to competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Platform expert David S. Evans wrote that in 2015, three of the top five companies in the world used the platform business model, as did seven of the ten top start up companies. Traditional businesses need not always be harmed by platforms however; they can even benefit by creating their own or making use of existing third party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture \"81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years.\" In the year 2000 there were only a handful of large firms that could be described as platform companies. As of 2016, there were over 170 platform companies valued at US$1 billion or more. The creation and usage of digital platforms is also increasing in the government and NGO sectors.\n\nThe rise of platforms has been met by a mixed response from commentators. Many have been enthusiastic, arguing that platforms can improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, provide flexibility and accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Arguments against platforms include that they may worsen technological unemployment, that they contribute to the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection, that they can worsen declining tax revenues, and that excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. Since the early 2010s, the platform economy has been the subject of many reviews by academic groups and NGOs, by national governments and by trans national organisations like the EU. Early reviews were generally against the imposition of heavy regulation for the platform economy. Since 2016, and especially in 2017, some jurisdictions began to take a more interventionist approach.\n\nThe 'platform' metaphor has long been used in a variety of ways. In the context of \"platform economy\", 21st century usage of the word platform sometimes refers solely to online matchmakers such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit etc. Academic work and some business books often use the term in a wider sense, to include non-digital matchmakers like a business park or a nightclub, and also to other entities whose function is not primarily to support transactions. Platforms scholars Professor Carliss Y. Baldwin and Dr C. Jason Woodard have offered a generalised definition of economic platforms where the focus was on the technical side of the platform: \"a set of stable components that support variety and evolvability in a system by constraining the linkages among the other components\". Woodard and Baldwin have stated that at a high level of abstraction, the architecture of all platforms is the same: a system partitioned into a set of core components with low variety and a complementary set of peripheral components with high variety.. Others define it based on the ecosystem perspective where the focus was on the actors around the platform ecosystem (e.g., buyers, sellers). To view all available definitions see \n\nAlso known as the \"digital platform\" or \"online platform economy\", the platform economy is the economic and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such activity is wider than just commercial transactions, including for example online collaboration on projects such as Wikipedia. While scholarship on platforms sometimes includes discussion of non digital platforms, the term \"platform economy\" is often used in a sense that encompasses only online platforms.\n\n\"Platform economy\" is one of a number of terms aiming to capture subsets of the overall economy which are now mediated by digital technology. The terms are used with diverse and sometimes overlapping meanings; some commentators use terms like \"sharing economy\" or \"access economy\" in such a broad sense they effectively mean the same thing. Other scholars and commentators do attempt to draw distinctions and use the various terms to delineate different parts of the wider digital economy. The term \"platform economy\" can be viewed as narrower in scope than \"digital economy\", but wider in scope than terms like \"on demand economy\", \"sharing economy\" or \"gig economy\". Several scholars have argued that \"platform economy\" is the preferable term for discussing several aspects of emergent digital phenomena in the early 21st century. \n\nThe term Digital economy generally refers to all or nearly all economic activity relying on computers. As such it can be seen as having the widest scope; encompassing the platform economy, and also digital activities not mediated by actual platforms. For example, economic transactions completed solely by email, or exchanges over EDIs, some of which operate between only two companies so are too closed off to be considered platforms. Some scholars draw a distinction between platforms and earlier websites, excluding even sites such as Craigslist that are used to support economic transactions. Such sites can be considered outside the platform economy, not because they are too closed off, but as they are too open to be classed as platforms.\n\nThe terms \"On-demand\" or access economy are sometimes used in a broad sense, which would capture all activity from transaction platforms, and much else. Some commentators however assign the access economy a narrower definition, so that it excludes platforms in the sharing economy. Even when sharing and on-demand platforms are distinguished in this way however, they are still both included in the \"platform economy\".\n\nThe term sharing economy is also used with a broad range of scopes. Due to the positive connotations of the word \"sharing\", several platforms that don't involve sharing in the traditional sense of the word have still liked to define themselves as part of the sharing economy. Yet academic and some popular commentators define the sharing economy as only including activity that involves peer to peer transactions; in these narrow definition most of the platform economy is outside of the sharing economy.\n\nThe \"Gig economy\" refers to various forms of temporary employment. The phrase is sometimes used with a broad scope, to include traditional offline temporary and contract work. In the narrow sense of the phrase, the gig economy refers solely to work mediated by online labour market platforms, for example PeoplePerHour. In this narrow sense, an important sub division is between physical jobs where the worker needs to be present in person like Uber or most TaskRabbit work, and the so-called global \"human cloud\", where tasks can be done anywhere in the world (e.g. as with much Mechanical Turk work.\n\nBusinesses operating on some of the principles that underpin contemporary digital platforms have been in operation for millennia. For example, matchmakers that helped men and women find suitable marriage partners operated in China since at least 1100 BC. Grain exchanges from ancient Greece have been compared to contemporary transactional platforms, as have medieval fairs.\nExamples of innovation platforms also predate the internet era. Such as geographic regions famous for particular types of production, institutions like Harvard Business School, or the Wintel technology platform that became prominent in the 1980s.\n\nThe viability of large scale transaction platforms was vastly increased due to improvements in communication and connectedness brought about by the Internet. Online market platforms such as Craigslist and eBay were launched in the 1990s. Forerunners to modern social media and online collaboration platforms were also launched in the 1990s, with more successful platforms such as Myspace and Wikipedia emerging in the early 2000s. After the financial crisis of 2007–08, new types of online platforms have rose to prominence, including asset-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, and labour market platforms such as TaskRabbit.\n\nAccording to the OED, the word \"platform\" has been used since the 16th century, both in the concrete sense to refer to a raised surface, and as a metaphor. However it was only in the 1990s that the concept of economic platforms began to receive significant attention from academics. In the early 90s, such work tended to focus on innovation or product platforms, defined in a broad sense that did not focus on online activity. Even as late as 1998, there was little focus on transaction platforms, and according to professors David S. Evans and Richard L. Schmalensee, the platform business model as it would be understood in the 21st century was not then recognised by scholars.\n\nThe first academic paper to address the platform business model and its application to digital matchmakers is said to be \"Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets\" by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole. One of the academics most responsible for connecting those working in the emerging field of platform scholarship was professor Annabelle Gawer; in 2008 she held the first international conference on platforms at London.\n\nThe platform business model involves profiting from a platform that allows two or more groups of users to interact. The model predates the internet; for example, a newspapers with a classified ads section effectively uses the platform business model. The emergence of digital technology has \"turbocharged\" the model, although it is by no means a sure path to success. While the most successful \"born-social\" firms can in just a few years achieve multibillion-dollar valuations, along with brand loyalty comparable to the largest traditional companies, most platform business start ups fail. \nSome companies are dedicated to the platform business model; for example, many so called born-social startups. Other companies can operate their own platform(s) yet still run much of their business on more traditional models. A third set of firms may not run their own platform, but still have a platform strategy for utilising third party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture, \"81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years.\" \nSome of the principles governing the operations of matchmaking platforms differ sharply when compared with traditional business models. The selling of products or services is central to most traditional businesses, whereas for transaction platforms, connecting different groups of users is the key focus. For example, a traditional mini cab company sells taxi services, whereas a platform company might connect drivers with passengers. \nAnother distinguishing feature of the platform business model is that it emphasises network effects, and the inter-dependence of demand between the different groups that use the platform. So with a platform business, it often makes sense to provide services free to one side of the platform, e.g. to the users of a social media service like Facebook. The cost of this subsidy is more than offset by the extra demand a large user base generates for the revenue generating side(s) of the platform (e.g. advertisers).\n\nAccording to authors Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson, BlackBerry Limited (formerly RIM) and Nokia lost massive market share to Apple and Google's Android in the early 2010s, as RIM and Nokia were acting as product companies in a world now best suited to platforms. As former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop wrote in 2011 \"We’re not even fighting with the right weapons, ... The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems.\"\n\nMany books covering the platform economy devote chapters to the challenges involved in creating platforms: both for new platform startups, and for traditional organisations wishing to adopt a platform strategy. Some books are even dedicated just to certain aspects of operating a platform, such as nurturing ecosystems. The work involved in creating a platform can be broadly divided into elements relating to technical functionality and network effects; for many but not all platforms, a great deal of effort also needs to go into the cultivation of ecosystems.\n\nDeveloping the core technical functionality can sometimes be unexpectedly cheap. Courtney Boyd Myers wrote in 2013 that a platform with the core functionality of Twitter could be developed almost for free. A person who already had a laptop could take a $160 Ruby on Rails course, spend about 10 hours writing the code, and then host the Twitter clone on a free Web hosting service. A service that would have a chance of attracting a good user base however, would need to be developed to at least the level of being a Minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP requires development well beyond a core set of technical functionality, for example it needs to have a well polished user experience layer. Boyd Meyers reported estimates that to develop a MVP for a platform like Twitter, the cost could range from $50,000 to $250,000, whereas for a platform needing more complex functionality such as Uber, the cost could range from $1 to $1.5 million. This was in 2013, considerably more has since been spent on technical development for the Uber platform. For other platforms however, developing the needed technical functionality can be relatively easy. The more difficult task is to attract a large enough user base to ensure long term growth, in other words to create sufficient network effects.\n\nPlatforms tend to be a strong beneficiary of network effects; phenomena which can act to increase the value of a platform to all participants as more people join. Sometimes it makes sense for a platform to treat different sides of their network differently. For example, a trading platform relies on both buyers and sellers, and if there is say a shortage of buyers compared to the number of sellers, it might make sense for the platform operator to subsidize buyers, at least temporarily. Perhaps with free access or even with rewards for choosing to use the platform. Sometimes the benefits of network effects can be overestimated, such as with the so-called \"grab all the eyeballs fallacy\", where a large audience is attracted to a platform, but there proves to be no profitable way to monetise it.\n\nIn the context of digital platforms, ecosystems are collections of economic actors not controlled by the platform owner, yet who add value in ways that go beyond being a regular user. A common example is the community of independent developers who create applications for a platform, such as the many developers (both individuals and companies) that create apps for Facebook. With Microsoft, significant components of their ecosystem include not just developers, but computer and hardware peripheral manufactures, as well as maintenance and training providers. \nA traditional company embarking on a platform strategy has a head start in creating an ecosystem if they already have a list of partners, alliances and / or resellers. A startup company looking to grow an ecosystem might expose elements of its platform via publicly available APIs. Another approach is to have an easily accessible partnership sign up facility, with the offer of free or subsidised benefits for partners.\n\nPlatform owners usually attempt to promote and support all significant actors in their ecosystems, though sometimes there is a competitive relationship between the owner and some of the companies in their ecosystem, very occasionally even a hostile one.\n\nScholars have acknowledged platforms are challenging to categorise, due to their variety. A relatively common approach is to divide platforms into four types, based on the principle ways they add utility, rather than being concerned with which particular sectors they server. These four types are transaction, innovation, integrated and investment.. To view different ways to categorize digital platforms see \n\nAlso known as two-sided markets, multisided markets, or digital match making firms, transaction platforms are by far the most common type of platform. These platforms often facilitate various forms of online buying and selling, though sometimes most or all transactions supported by the platform will be free of charge.\n\nInnovation platforms provide a technological foundation, often including a set of common standards, upon which an ecosystem of third parties can develop complementary products and services to resell to consumers and other businesses. Examples of platform companies include Microsoft and Intel.\n\nIntegrated platforms combine features of both transaction and innovation platforms. Apple, Google and Alibaba have been classified as integrated platforms. Several integrated platform companies operating multiple discreet platforms and could also be described as \"platform conglomerates\". An alternative meaning for 'integrated platform' involves providers supporting different X2X relationships to the market, which target value add among A (administration), B (business) and C (consumer) platform users.\n\nPlatforms are sometimes studied through the lens of their differing distributions and impact across the world's geographic regions. Some early work speculated that the rise of the \"platform economy\" could be a new means by which the United States could maintain its hegemony. While the largest platform companies by market capitalisation remain US based, platforms based in India and Asia are fast catching up, and several authors writing in 2016 and later took the opposite view, speculating that the platform economy will help accelerate a shift of economic power towards Asia. \n\nNumerous successful platforms have been launched in Africa, several of which have been home grown. In the early 2010s, there were reports by journalist, academics and development workers that Africa has been leading the world in some platform related technologies, such as by \"leapfrogging\" traditional fixed line internet applications and going straight to developing mobile apps. In the field of mobile money for example, it was the success of Kenya's M-Pesa that brought the technology to global attention. \n\nSimilar systems have been introduced elsewhere in Africa, for example m-Sente in Uganda. M-Pesa itself has expanded out of Africa to both Asia and Eastern Europe. The system allows people who only have cheap SMS capable mobile phones to send and receive money. This and similar platform services have been enthusiastically welcomed both by the end users, and by development workers who have noted their life enhancing effects. Ushahidi is another set of technologies developed in Africa and widely used on platforms to deliver various social benefits. While many platforms in Africa are accessible just by SMS, uptake of smartphones is also high, with the FT reporting in 2015 that mobile internet adoption is happening at double the global rate. Compared to other regions, there may have been less negative effects caused by platforms in Africa, as there has been less legacy economic infrastructure to disrupt, which also has provided an opportunity to build new systems from \"ground zero\". Though some legacy businesses have still been disrupted by the rise of platforms in Africa, with sometimes only the more productive firms being able to overcome barriers to adopting digital technologies.\n\nBy 2017, some of the excitement concerning home grown platform technology and the wider Africa Rising narrative has cooled, in line with recent falls in commodity prices reducing the short term economic prospects for much of the continent. Yet optimism remains that the continent is heading in the right direction. A global survey identified 176 platform companies with a valuation over one billion dollars, yet only one was based in Africa. This was Naspers, which is headquartered in Cape Town, a city that also hosts many other smaller platform companies. A survey focused on smaller platforms based in Africa found few are either wholly foreign or indigenously owned, with most being a mixture. \n\nNorth America, in particular the United States, is home to the world's top 5 global platform companies Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and IBM. A 2016 global survey of all platform companies with a market cap over $1bn, found 44 such companies headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area alone, with those companies having a total value of $2.2 trillion 52% of the total worldwide value of such platform companies. Overall, the United States had 63 platform companies valued over $1bn, with Canada having one. While North America has less large platform companies than Asia, it is the clear leader in terms of overall market capitalisation, and in having platform companies with a global reach.\n\nThe 2016 global survey found that Asia was home to the largest number of platform companies having a market capitalisation over $1bn. Asia had 82 such companies, though their combined market value was only $719, second to the United States. Much of Asia's platform companies are concentrated in hubs located in Bangalore and Hangzhou. Within China, home grown platforms tend to dominate across the whole platform economy, with most of the big American platforms being banned. eBay is allowed to trade in China, but has a relatively small market share compared to Chinese eCommerce platforms. Outside of China, Asian-based platforms have been enjoying rapid growth in areas relating to eCommerce, but not so much in social media and search. Facebook for example is the most popular social media platform even in India, a country with several large home grown platforms, while in Myanmar, the \"New York Times\" described Facebook as \"so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself.\"\n\nEurope is home to a large number of platform companies, but most are quite small. In terms of platform companies that were valued over $1bn, Europe was found to have only 27 in the 2016 global survey. So far ahead of Africa and South America, but lagging well behind Asia and North America.\n\nAccording to data from early 2016, only three home grown platform companies with a market capitalisation greater than $1bn had emerged in South America: these are MercadoLibre, Despegar.com and B2W. \nThe continent is however home to many start up companies. In Brazil, the Portuguese language gives an advantage to home grown companies, with an especially active start up scene existing in São Paolo. Argentina has been the most successful in creating platforms used outside its own borders, with the countries relatively small home market encouraging a more global outlook from its start up platform companies.\n\nWith a high proportion of workers already employed on an informal bases, the platform based gig economy has not grown as fast in South America as elsewhere. Though from a progressive perspective, scholars such as Adam Fishwick have noted that Latin America's tradition of worker organised activism may have valuable lessons for workers elsewhere seeking ways to mitigate the sometimes adverse effects of platforms on their economic security.\n\nMost of the widely used platforms are owned by the private sector. In the 2016 GCE survey of platform companies valued over $1 billion, a total of 107 privately owned companies were found, versus 69 public companies (public in the sense of being private sector, but publicly traded ). While more numerous, the privately owned companies tended to be smaller, having a total market value of $300 billion, compared to $3,900 billion for the publicly traded companies.\n\nSome digital platforms are run by multilateral institutions, by national governments, and by local municipal bodies.\n\nOver 90% of NGOs maintain a presence on the large privately owned social media platforms such as Facebook, with some also operating their own platforms.\n\nPlatform cooperatism involves mutually owned platforms, being run \"bottom up\" by the people involved. Sometimes these platforms can effectively be competing for business with the privately owned platforms. In other cases, platform cooperatism seeks to help ordinary people have their say about political questions of the day, possibly supporting interaction with local government.\n\nWith the increasingly centrality of digital platforms to the global economy following the 2008 financial crisis, there was an intensification of interest in assessing their impact on society and the wider economy. Many hundreds of reviews have been carried out: some by individual scholars, others by groups of academics, some by think tanks bringing together folk from a range of backgrounds, and yet others overseen by governments and trans national organisations such as the EU. Many of these reviews focussed on the overall platform economy, others on narrower areas such as the gig economy or the psychological impact of social media platforms on individuals and communities.\n\nMuch early assessment was highly positive, sometimes even taking a \"utopian\" view on the benefits of platforms. It's been argued and to some extent demonstrated that platforms can enhance the supply of services, improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, increase flexibility and labour market accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Both the IMF and World Bank for example have suggested that it's the countries and industries that are quickest to adopt new platform technologies that achieve the fastest and most sustainable growth,\n\nVarious arguments have been made against platforms. They include that platforms may contribute to technological unemployment. That they accelerate the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection. That they may contribute to declining tax revenues. That excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. That they can increase inequality. That they can reproduce patterns of racism. That platforms have a net negative impact on the environment.\n\nUntil 2017, most mainstream assessments of the platform economy were largely positive about its benefits to wider society. There were some exceptions, a general hardening of attitudes towards platforms from some commentators and regulators had been detectable from at least early 2015. There had been a few highly critical views, e.g. from Evgeny Morozov, who in 2015 described most platforms as \"parasitic: feeding off existing social and economic relations. But such negative assessments were rare, especially from prominent commentators who had the attention of policy makers. This began to change in 2017. Across the world, the larger privately owned platforms were subject to increasing questioning about their expanding role and responsibilities.\n\nIn the US, the Financial Times reported a marked change of attitudes towards online platforms across the American political spectrum, triggered by their \"sheer size and power\". Among U.S. Democrats, leaders of the large platform companies reportedly went from \"heroes to pariahs\" in just a few months.\nThere has also been growing hostility towards the large platform companies from some members of the American right. High-profile figures such as Steve Bannon and Richard Spencer have argued for the break up of the large tech companies, and more mainstream Republicans are reported to be running for the 2018 congressional elections on anti big-tech tickets. \n2017 also saw increased critical attention towards the larger platforms from both European and Chinese regulators. In the case of China where several of the larger US owned platforms were already banned, the focus was on their biggest home grown platforms, with commentators expressing concerns that they have become too powerful.\n\nMuch recent criticism focusses on major platforms being too big; anti competitive; damaging to democracy, such as with the Russian meddling in the 2016 election; and bad for users mental health. In December 2017 Facebook itself admitted passive consumption of social media could be harmful to mental health, though said active engagement can be helpful. In January 2018 Facebook made major changes to increase user engagement. In February 2018, Unilever, one of the world's leading spenders on advertising, threatened to pull adverts from digital platforms if they \"create division, foster hate or fail to protect children.\" \nDespite recent criticism from media figures and politicians, the large privately owned platforms tend to remain \"wildly popular\" among ordinary consumers. After leading US platform companies revealed high Q1 revenue growth in late April 2018, the \"Financial Times\" reported they are untouched by the backlash, in a \"stunning demonstration of their platform power\". While conceding there are risks, many commentators and institutions remain overall highly positive about the potential of platforms for empowering ordinary people to improve their lives and benefit society.\n\nDuring their early years, digital platforms tended to enjoy light regulation, sometimes benefiting from measures intended to help fledgling internet companies. The \"inherently border-crossing\" nature of platforms has made it challenging to regulate them, even when a desire has been there. Yet another difficulty has been lack of consensus about what exactly constitutes the platform economy. With most large platforms concentrated in China or the U.S., two contrasting approaches to regulation. In the U.S., platforms have largely been left to develop free of state regulation. In China, while large platform companies like Tencent or Baidu are privately owned and in theory have much more freedom than SOEs, they are still tightly controlled, and also protected by the state against foreign competition, at least in their home market.\n\nAs of 2017, there has been talk of a \"third way\" being developed in Europe, less Laissez-faire than the approach in the U.S., but less restrictive than the approach in China. Possibilities for Co-regulation, where public regulators and the platform companies themselves cooperative to design and enforce regulation, are also being explored.\nIn March 2018, the EU published guidelines concerning the removal of illegal media from social media platforms, suggesting that if platform companies do not improve their self-regulation, new rules will come into effect at EU level before the end of the year.\n\n"}

{"id": "1303062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1303062", "title": "Radio Society of Great Britain", "text": "Radio Society of Great Britain\n\nThe Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB), first founded in 1913 as the London Wireless Club, is the United Kingdom's recognised national society for amateur radio operators. The society's patron is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and it claims to represent the interests of the UK's 80,000 licensed radio amateurs. A long recognised amateur radio organisation, the society is the national member society representing the United Kingdom and certain dependent territories of the United Kingdom in the International Amateur Radio Union. It also acts as a medium for communication between the licensed operators and the UK government.\n\nThe RSGB has traditionally acted as the organisation through which its members interact with the telecommunications regulatory authority of the United Kingdom, Ofcom. Although Ofcom has used its web site to solicit opinions directly from all amateur radio enthusiasts and other interested parties, the RSGB continues to advise and to seek to influence Ofcom on the likely impact of proposed changes in many areas – from decisions on licensing and bandwidth controls through to the use of broadband over power lines PLT (which it is thought would cause large amounts of electromagnetic noise).\n\nRSGB also acts as a parent organisation to oversee and govern many smaller groups and societies. Some of these societies unite local areas (such as repeater groups) or groups of individuals (such as Forces service groups, or old timer groups) or even people interested in a particular amateur radio band (such as 2-metre band groups).\n\nThe society publishes a monthly magazine called \"RadCom\", along with a range of technical books.\n\nThe roots of the Radio Society of Great Britain can traced back to the formation of the London Wireless Club, inaugurated in West Hampstead on 5 July 1913. The first President was Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton who was succeeded in 1920 by James Robert Erskine-Murray.\n\nAt its first meeting in September 1913, it was decided that the name should change from the London Wireless Club to the Wireless Society of London. In November 1922, the name of the Society was changed to that it holds to this day, the substitution of the term 'Great Britain' for 'London' being made with the view to extend the perceived scope of the Society's work.\n\nThe RSGB made the first radio transmission across to the United States, but failed to have any receiving equipment. Many members were slightly annoyed by this fact and so formed other sections of the RSGB which were later absorbed into the RSGB itself.\n\nDuring World War II, the entire RSGB Council and many of its members were recruited into MI8, also known as the Radio Security Service. Its mission was to intercept clandestine enemy transmissions.\n\nIn 2006, the RSGB cooperated with Ofcom to revise the amateur radio licence in the United Kingdom. Changes included removing the annual licence fee and removing the requirement to log all transmissions. Amateur radio operators gained permission to operate one's amateur radio station remotely, and the changes increased the spectrum available to the lower classes of licensees.\n\nThe National Radio Centre at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire opened in 2012. It has a library, radio station, museum and bookshop in a newly constructed building close to the main Bletchley Park entrance.\n\nOn 28 March 2011, the Board announced that the RSGB's general manager, Peter Kirby G0TWW, had left the Society's employment after the discovery of financial irregularities, allegedly to the tune of £41,000. RSGB Director, Don Beattie G3BJ, acted as general manager until the appointment of a new general manager, Graham Coomber G0NBI, in May 2012.\n\nThe following notice appeared on the RSGB website on 16 October 2013:\n“The Board is pleased to be able to report to Members that the debt owed to the Society by its previous General Manager, who left the Society in early 2011, has been repaid in full, together with statutory interest and the Society’s court fees. This will be reflected in the 2013 accounts as a write-back of the provision taken against the debt in the 2011 accounts. Details will be in the annual report and accounts which will be published in time for the AGM in 2014. The Board expresses its thanks to the Society team which has brought about the recovery of this debt and now regards the matter as closed. No further comment will be made.”\n\nIn 2013 the RSGB celebrated its centenary with a programme of events including a special callsign G100RSGB, the RSGB Centenary Award 2013 and a construction competition. The special callsign G100RSGB travelled around the 13 RSGB regions and was operated by groups in each area.\n\nThere are competing demands from more and more non-amateur uses of radio (for example mobile operators and wireless devices). Despite this, the RSGB has been able to maintain existing amateur radio allocations and negotiate some new ones.\n\nWith the formation of the Youth Committee the society is catering for the demands of the younger licensees. In 2014, The society took part in the International Amateur Radio Union's Youngsters on the Air event in Finland. The RSGB will be hosting YOTA in 2017. The Youth Committee is chaired by Milo Noblet, M0ILO, who acts as Youth Coordinator for the UK for the International Amateur Radio Union \n\nThe RSGB publishes many books on amateur radio and related matters, including:\n\n\"RadCom\" is the official journal of the Radio Society of Great Britain, and is posted free monthly to all RSGB members.

{"id": "317886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317886", "title": "San people", "text": "San people\n\nSān or Saan peoples (also, \"Sākhoen\", \"Sonqua\", and in Afrikaans: \"Boesmans\", or in English: \"Bushmen\", after Dutch \"\"; and \"Saake\" in the Nǁng language) are members of various Khoesān-speaking indigenous hunter-gatherer groups representing the first nation of Southern Africa, whose territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and South Africa. There is a significant linguistic difference between the northern peoples living between the Okavango River in Botswana and Etosha National Park in northwestern Namibia, extending up into southern Angola; the central peoples of most of Namibia and Botswana, extending into Zambia and Zimbabwe; and the southern people in the central Kalahari towards the Molopo River, who are the last remnant of the previously extensive indigenous Sān of South Africa.\n\nThe ancestors of the hunter-gatherer Sān are considered to have been the first inhabitants of what is now Botswana and South Africa. The historical presence of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana's Tsodilo Hills region. In this area, stone tools and rock art paintings date back over 70,000 years and are by far the oldest known art. Sān were traditionally semi-nomadic, moving seasonally within certain defined areas based on the availability of resources such as water, game animals, and edible plants. As of 2010, the Sān populations in Botswana number about 50,000 to 60,000.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1990s, Sān communities switched to farming because of government-mandated modernisation programs. Despite the lifestyle changes, they have provided a wealth of information in anthropology and genetics. One broad study of African genetic diversity completed in 2009 found that Sān people were among the five populations with the highest measured levels of genetic diversity among the 121 distinct African populations sampled. Certain Sān groups are one of 14 known extant \"ancestral population clusters\". That is, \"groups of populations with common genetic ancestry, who share ethnicity and similarities in both their culture and the properties of their languages\".\n\nDespite some positive aspects of government development programs reported by members of Sān and Bakgalagadi communities in Botswana, many have spoken of a consistent sense of exclusion from government decision-making processes, and many Sān and Bakgalagadi have alleged experiencing ethnic discrimination on the part of the government. The United States Department of State described ongoing discrimination against San, or \"Basarwa\", people in Botswana in 2013 as the \"principal human rights concern\".\n\nThe endonyms used by Sān themselves refer to their individual nations, including\n\nthe ǃKung (!Xuun) (subdivisions ǂKx'ao-ǁ'ae (Auen), Juǀ'hoan, etc.)\n\nthe Tuu (subdivisions ǀXam, Nusan (Nǀu), ǂKhomani, etc.)\n\nand Tshu–Khwe groups such as the Khwe (Khoi, Kxoe), Haiǁom, Naro, Tsoa, Gǁana (Gana) and Gǀu (Gwi). \nRepresentatives of Sān peoples in 2003 stated their preference of the use of such individual group names where possible over the use of the collective term \"San\".\n\nBoth designations \"Bushmen\" and \"San\" are exonyms in origin, but \"San\" had been widely adopted as an endonym by the late 1990s.\n\"San\" originates as a Khoekhoe appellation used by pastoralists to refer to foragers, from a \nroot \"saa\" \"picking up from the ground\" + plural \"-n\" in the Haiǁom dialect.\nThe term \"Bushmen\", from 17th-century Dutch \"\", is still widely used by others and to self-identify, but in some instances the term has also been described as pejorative.\n\nAdoption of the Khoekhoe term \"San\" in Western anthropology dates to the 1970s, and this remains the standard term in English-language ethnographic literature, although some authors have later switched back to \"Bushmen\", \nThe compound Khoisan, used to refer to the pastoralist Khoi and the foraging San collectively, was coined by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s and popularised by Isaac Schapera in 1930, and anthropological use of \"San\" was detached from the compound \"Khoisan\".\nas it has been reported that the exonym \"San\" is perceived as a pejorative in parts of the central Kalahari. but by the late 1990s, the term \"San\" was in general use by the people themselves. \nThe adoption of the term was preceded by a number of meetings held in the 1990s where delegates debated on the adoption of a collective term. These meetings included the Common Access to Development Conference organised by the Government of Botswana held in Gaborone in 1993, the 1996 inaugural Annual General Meeting of the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) held in Namibia, and a 1997 conference in Cape Town on \"Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage\" organised by the University of the Western Cape. \nThe term \"San\" is now standard in South African, and used officially in the blazon of the national coat-of-arms. The \"South African San Council\" representing San communities in South Africa was established as part of WIMSA in 2001. \n\"Bushmen\" is now considered derogatory by many South Africans, to the point where, in 2008, use of \"boesman\" (the modern Afrikaans equivalent of \"Bushman\") in the \"Die Burger\" newspaper was brought before the Equality Court, which however ruled that the mere use of the term cannot be taken as derogatory.\n\nThe term \"Basarwa\" (singular \"Mosarwa\") is used for the San collectively in Botswana. \nThe term is a Bantu (Tswana) word meaning \"those who do not rear cattle\".\nUse of the \"mo/ba-\" noun class indicates \"people who are accepted\", \nas opposed to the use of \"Masarwa\", an older variant which is now considered offensive.\n\nIn Angola they are sometimes referred to as \"mucancalas\", or \"bosquímanos\" (aPortuguese of the Dutch term for \"Bushmen\"). \nThe terms \"Amasili\" and \"Batwa\" are sometimes used for them in Zimbabwe.\nThe San are also referred to as \"Batwa\" by Xhosa people and \"Baroa\" by Sotho people. \nThe Bantu term \"Batwa\" refers to any foraging tribesmen and as such overlaps with the terminology used for the \"Pygmoid\" Southern Twa of South-Central Africa.\n\nThe San kinship system reflects their interdependence as traditionally small mobile foraging bands. San kinship is comparable to Eskimo kinship, with the same set of terms as in European cultures, but also uses a name rule and an age rule. The age rule resolves any confusion arising from kinship terms, as the older of two people always decides what to call the younger. Relatively few names circulate (approximately 35 names per sex), and each child is named after a grandparent or another relative.\n\nChildren have no social duties besides playing, and leisure is very important to San of all ages. Large amounts of time are spent in conversation, joking, music, and sacred dances. Women have a high status in San society, are greatly respected, and may be leaders of their own family groups. They make important family and group decisions and claim ownership of water holes and foraging areas. Women are mainly involved in the gathering of food, but may also take part in hunting.\n\nWater is important in San life. Droughts may last many months and waterholes may dry up. When this happens, they use sip wells. To get water this way, a San scrapes a deep hole where the sand is damp. Into this hole is inserted a long hollow grass stem. An empty ostrich egg is used to collect the water. Water is sucked into the straw from the sand, into the mouth, and then travels down another straw into the ostrich egg.\n\nTraditionally, the San were an egalitarian society. Although they had hereditary chiefs, their authority was limited. The San made decisions among themselves by consensus, with women treated as relative equals. San economy was a gift economy, based on giving each other gifts regularly rather than on trading or purchasing goods and services.\n\nVillages range in sturdiness from nightly rain shelters in the warm spring (when people move constantly in search of budding greens), to formalised rings, wherein people congregate in the dry season around permanent waterholes. Early spring is the hardest season: a hot dry period following the cool, dry winter. Most plants still are dead or dormant, and supplies of autumn nuts are exhausted. Meat is particularly important in the dry months when wildlife can not range far from the receding waters.\n\nWomen gather fruit, berries, tubers, bush onions, and other plant materials for the band's consumption. Ostrich eggs are gathered, and the empty shells are used as water containers. Insects provide perhaps 10% of animal proteins consumed, most often during the dry season. Depending on location, the San consume 18 to 104 species, including grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and termites.\n\nWomen's traditional gathering gear is simple and effective: a hide sling, a blanket, a cloak called a \"kaross\" to carry foodstuffs, firewood, smaller bags, a digging stick, and perhaps, a smaller version of the kaross to carry a baby.\n\nMen hunt in long, laborious tracking excursions. They kill their game using arrows and spears tipped in diamphotoxin, a slow-acting arrow poison produced by beetle larvae of the genus \"Diamphidia\".\n\nA set of tools almost identical to that used by the modern San and dating to 44,000 BCE was discovered at Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal in 2012.\n\nHistorical evidence shows that certain San communities have always lived in the desert regions of the Kalahari; however, eventually nearly all other San communities in southern Africa were forced into this region. The Kalahari San remained in poverty where their richer neighbours denied them rights to the land. Before long, in both Botswana and Namibia, they found their territory drastically reduced.\n\nVarious Y chromosome studies show that the San carry some of the most divergent (oldest) human Y-chromosome haplogroups. These haplogroups are specific sub-groups of haplogroups A and B, the two earliest branches on the human Y-chromosome tree.\n\nMitochondrial DNA studies also provide evidence that the San carry high frequencies of the earliest haplogroup branches in the human mitochondrial DNA tree. This DNA is inherited only from one's mother. The most divergent (oldest) mitochondrial haplogroup, L0d, has been identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African San groups.\n\nIn a study published in March 2011, Brenna Henn and colleagues found that the ǂKhomani San, as well as the Sandawe and Hadza peoples of Tanzania, were the most genetically diverse of any living humans studied. This high degree of genetic diversity hints at the origin of anatomically modern humans.\n\nRecent analysis suggests that the San may have been isolated from other original ancestral groups for as much as 100,000 years and later rejoined, re-integrating the human gene pool.\n\nA DNA study of fully sequenced genomes, published in September 2016, showed that the ancestors of today's San hunter-gatherers began to diverge from other human populations in Africa about 200,000 years ago and were fully isolated by 100,000 years ago, well before the first archaeological evidence of modern behaviour in humans.\n\nMuch aboriginal people's land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San people (or \"Basarwa\"), was lost during colonization, and the pattern of loss of land and access to natural resources continued after Botswana's independence. \nThe San have been particularly affected by encroachment by majority peoples and non-indigenous farmers onto land traditionally occupied by San people. Government policies from the 1970s transferred a significant area of traditionally San land to White settlers and majority agro-pastoralist tribes. Much of the government's policy regarding land tended to favor the dominant Tswana peoples over the minority San and Bakgalagadi. Loss of land is a major contributor to the problems facing Botswana's indigenous people, including especially the San's eviction from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The government of Botswana decided to relocate all of those living within the reserve to settlements outside it. Harassment of residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce residents to leave. The government has denied that any of the relocation was forced. A legal battle followed. The relocation policy may have been intended to facilitate diamond mining by Gem Diamonds within the reserve.\n\n\"Hoodia gordonii\", used by the San, was patented by the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 1998, for its presumed appetite suppressing quality. A licence was granted to Phytopharm, for development of the active ingredient in the \"Hoodia\" plant, p57 (glycoside), to be used as a pharmaceutical drug for dieting. Once this patent was brought to the attention of the San, a benefit-sharing agreement was reached between them and the CSIR in 2003. This would award royalties to the San for the benefits of their indigenous knowledge. During the case, the San people were represented and assisted by the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA), the South African San Council and the South African San Institute.\n\nThis benefit-sharing agreement is one of the first to give royalties to the holders of traditional knowledge used for drug sales. The terms of the agreement are contentious, because of their apparent lack of adherence to the Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing, as outlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The San have yet to profit from this agreement, as P57 has still not yet been legally developed and marketed.\n\nThe San of the Kalahari were first brought to the globalized world's attention in the 1950s by South African author Laurens van der Post. In 1955, Van der Post was commissioned by the BBC to go to the Kalahari desert with a film crew in search of the San. The filmed material was turned into a very popular six-part television documentary a year later. Driven by a lifelong fascination with this \"vanished tribe\", Van der Post published a 1958 book about this expedition, entitled \"The Lost World of the Kalahari\". It was to be his most famous book. In 1961, he published \"The Heart of the Hunter\", a narrative which he admits in the introduction uses two previous works of stories and mythology as \"a sort of Stone Age Bible\", namely \"Specimens of Bushman Folklore\"' (1911), collected by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and Lucy C. Lloyd, and Dorothea Bleek's \"Mantis and His Friend\". Van der Post's work is largely discredited, as it is the subjective view of a European in the 1950s and 1960s. His opinions branded the San as simple \"children of Nature\" or even \"mystical ecologists\".\nThat record was set straight in 1992 by John Perrot and team with the publication of the book \"Bush for the Bushman\" - a \"desperate plea\" on behalf of the aboriginal San addressing the international community and calling on the governments throughout Southern Africa to respect and reconstitute the ancestral land-rights of all San.\n\nJohn Marshall, the son of Harvard anthropologist Lorna Marshall, documented the lives of San in the Nyae Nyae region of Namibia over a more than 50-year period. His early film \"The Hunters\", released in 1957, shows a giraffe hunt. \"A Kalahari Family\" (2002) is a five-part, six-hour series documenting 50 years in the lives of the \"Juǀʼhoansi\" of Southern Africa, from 1951 to 2000. Marshall was a vocal proponent of the San cause throughout his life. His sister Elizabeth Marshall Thomas wrote several books and numerous articles about the San, based in part on her experiences living with these people when their culture was still intact. \"The Harmless People\", published in 1959 (revised in 1989), and \"The Old Way: A Story of the First People\", published in 2006, are the two primary works. John Marshall and Adrienne Miesmer documented the lives of the !Kung San people between the 1950s and 1978 in \"Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman\". This film, the account of a woman who grew up while the San lived as autonomous hunter-gatherers, but who later was forced into a dependent life in the government-created community at Tsumkwe, shows how the lives of the !Kung people, who lived for millennia as hunter gatherers, were forever changed when they were forced onto a reservation too small to support them.\n\nSouth African film-maker Richard Wicksteed has produced a number of documentaries on San culture, history and present situation; these include \"In God's Places\"/\"Iindawo ZikaThixo\" (1995) on the San cultural legacy in the southern Drakensberg; \"Death of a Bushman\" (2002) on the murder of San tracker Optel Rooi by South African police; \"The Will To Survive\" (2009), which covers the history and situation of San communities in southern Africa today; and \"My Land is My Dignity\" (2009) on the San's epic land rights struggle in Botswana's Central Kalahari Game Reserve.\n\nA documentary on San hunting entitled, \"The Great Dance: A Hunter's Story\" (2000), directed by Craig and Damon Foster. This was reveiewed by Lawrence Van Gelder for the \"New York Times\", who said that the film \"constitutes an act of preservation and a requiem\".\n\nSpencer Wells's 2003 book \"The Journey of Man\"—in connection with National Geographic's Genographic Project—discusses a genetic analysis of the San and asserts their genetic markers were the first ones to split from those of the ancestors of the bulk of other \"Homo sapiens sapiens\". The PBS documentary based on the book follows these markers throughout the world, demonstrating that all of humankind can be traced back to the African continent (see Recent African origin of modern humans, the so-called \"out of Africa\" hypothesis).\n\nThe BBC's \"The Life of Mammals\" (2003) series includes video footage of an indigenous San of the Kalahari desert undertaking a persistence hunt of a kudu through harsh desert conditions. It provides an illustration of how early man may have pursued and captured prey with minimal weaponry.\n\nThe BBC series \"How Art Made the World\" (2005) compares San cave paintings from 200 years ago to Paleolithic European paintings that are 14,000 years old. Because of their similarities, the San works may illustrate the reasons for ancient cave paintings. The presenter Nigel Spivey draws largely on the work of Professor David Lewis-Williams, whose PhD was entitled \"Believing and Seeing: Symbolic meanings in southern San rock paintings\". Lewis-Williams draws parallels with prehistoric art around the world, linking in shamanic ritual and trance states.\n\nPaul John Myburgh wrote The Bushmen Winter has Come after spending seven years with the ‘People of the Great Sand Face’, a group of /Gwikwe Bushmen in the Kalahari Desert. For Paul, they were years of physical and spiritual immersion into a way of life of which only an echo remains in living memory. It is a true story of exodus, the inevitable journey of the last of the First People, as they leave the Great Sand Face and head for the modern world and cultural oblivion.\n\nA 1969 film, \"Lost in the Desert\", features a small boy, stranded in the desert, who encounters a group of wandering San. They help him and then abandon him as a result of a misunderstanding created by the lack of a common language and culture. The film was directed by Jamie Uys, who returned to the San a decade later with \"The Gods Must Be Crazy\", which proved to be an international hit. This comedy portrays a Kalahari San group's first encounter with an artifact from the outside world (a Coca-Cola bottle). By the time this movie was made, the ǃKung had recently been forced into sedentary villages, and the San hired as actors were confused by the instructions to act out inaccurate exaggerations of their almost abandoned hunting and gathering life.\n\n\"Eh Hee\" by Dave Matthews Band was written as an evocation of the music and culture of the San. In a story told to the Radio City audience (an edited version of which appears on the DVD version of \"Live at Radio City\"), Matthews recalls hearing the music of the San and, upon asking his guide what the words to their songs were, being told that \"there are no words to these songs, because these songs, we've been singing since before people had words\". He goes on to describe the song as his \"homage to meeting... the most advanced people on the planet\".\n\nIn Peter Godwin's biography \"When A Crocodile Eats the Sun\", he mentions his time spent with the San for an assignment. His title comes from the San's belief that a solar eclipse occurs when a crocodile eats the sun.\n\nLaurens van der Post's two novels, \"A Story Like The Wind\" (1972) and its sequel, \"A Far Off Place\" (1974), made into a 1993 film, are about a white boy encountering a wandering San and his wife, and how the San's life and survival skills save the white teenagers' lives in a journey across the desert.\n\nJames A. Michener's \"The Covenant\" (1980), is a work of historical fiction centered on South Africa. The first section of the book concerns a San community's journey set roughly in 13,000 BC.\n\nIn Wilbur Smith's novel \"The Burning Shore\" (an installment in the Courtneys of Africa book series), the San people are portrayed through two major characters, O'wa and H'ani; Smith describes the San's struggles, history, and beliefs in great detail.\n\nNorman Rush's 1991 novel Mating features an encampment of Basarwa near the (imaginary) Botswana town where the main action is set.\n\nTad Williams's epic \"Otherland\" series of novels features a South African San named ǃXabbu, whom Williams confesses to be highly fictionalised, and not necessarily an accurate representation. In the novel, Williams invokes aspects of San mythology and culture.\n\nIn 2007, David Gilman published \"The Devil's Breath\". One of the main characters, a small San boy named ǃKoga, uses traditional methods to help the character Max Gordon travel across Namibia.\n\nAlexander McCall Smith has written a series of episodic novels set in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. The protagonist of \"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" series, a Motswana woman, adopts two San children, sister and brother Motholeli and Puso.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are found in Perak, Kedah and Pahang of Malaysia. \n\nThey have been recorded to have lived here since before the 3rd century. They are ethnologically described as nomadic hunter-gatherers. See also Bajaus and Aetas.\n\nIn Malaysia they are officially called Negrito (\"Orang Negrito\" in Malay language) or Semang (\"Orang Semang\" in Malay language). The first term has an outright racial context, as Negrito in Spanish language means \"little negro\". In the past, eastern groups of Semang people have been called Pangan. Lowland Semang tribes are also known as Sakai, although this term is considered to be derogatory by the Semang people.\n\nMalaysian Semang people are included as part of the Orang Asli; where various groups of indigenous peoples of the country that still maintain a tribal way of life. Orang Asli includes 18 officially recognized tribes that are divided into 3 ethnic groups namely the Negrito, Senoi and Proto-Malay (Aboriginal Malay). The group of Negrito consists of 6 tribes that are known as the Kensiu people, Kintaq people, Lanoh people, Jahai people, Mendriq people and Batek people. All Orang Asli are under the care of the state government, namely the Department of Orang Asli Development (\"Jabalan Kemajuan Orang Asli\", JAKOA); whose goal is to integrate indigenous populations into the wider Malaysian society.\n\nThe three category division of the indigenous population was inherited by the Malaysian government from the British administration of the colonial era. It is based on racial concepts, according to which the Negrito were seen as the most primitive race leading the vagrant way of life of hunter-gatherers. The Senoi were considered more developed, and the Proto-Malay were placed at almost the same level with the Malaysian Malay Muslims.\n\nOrang Asli ethnic groups that are classified as \"Semang\" by the Malaysian government.\n\nThe Semangs live in caves or leaf-shelters that form between branches. A loincloth for the men, made of tree bark hammered out with a wooden mallet from the bark of the terap, a species of wild bread-fruit tree, and a short skirt of the same material for the women decorated with segments of bamboo in patterns to magically protect its wearer from disease, is the only dress worn; some go naked although not customary.\n\nScarification is practised. Young boys and girls are scarified in a simple ritual to mark the end of their adolescence. The finely serrated edge of a sugarcane leaf is drawn across the skin, then charcoal powder rubbed into the cut.\n\nThey have bamboo musical instruments, a kind of jaw harp, and a nose flute. On festive occasions, there is song and dance, both sexes decorating themselves with leaves.\n\nThe Semang bury their dead on the same day itself with the corpse wrapped in mat and the personal belonging of the deceased kept in a small bamboo rack placed over the grave. Only people of great importance, such as chiefs or great magicians are given a tree burial.\n\nThey have used Capnomancy (divination by smoke) to determine whether a camp is safe for the night.\n\nIn 1906, the Thai King Chulalongkorn adopted a Semang orphan boy named Khanung.\n\n\n"}

The \"t\"-closeness model extends the \"l\"-diversity model by treating the values of an attribute distinctly by taking into account the distribution of data values for that attribute.\n\nThis is useful because in real data sets attribute values may be skewed or semantically similar. However, accounting for value distributions may cause difficulty in creating feasible \"l\"-diverse representations. The \"l\"-diversity technique is useful in that it may hinder an attacker leveraging the global distribution of an attribute's data values in order to infer information about sensitive data values. Not every value may exhibit equal sensitivity, for example, a rare positive indicator for a disease may provide more information than a common negative indicator. Because of examples like this, \"l\"-diversity may be difficult and unnecessary to achieve when protecting against attribute disclosure. Alternatively, sensitive information leaks may occur because while \"l\"-diversity requirement ensures “diversity” of sensitive values in each group, it does not recognize that values may be semantically close, for example, an attacker could deduce a stomach disease applies to an individual if a sample containing the individual only listed three different stomach diseases.\n\nGiven the existence of such attacks where sensitive attributes may be inferred based upon the distribution of values for \"l\"-diverse data, the \"t\"-closeness method was created to further \"l\"-diversity by additionally maintaining the distribution of sensitive fields. The original paper by Ninghui Li, Tiancheng Li, and Suresh Venkatasubramanian defines \"t\"-closeness as:\n\nCharu Aggarwal and Philip S. Yu further state in their book on privacy-preserving data miningthat with this definition, threshold \"t\" gives an upper bound on the difference between the distribution of the sensitive attribute values within an anonymized group as compared to the global distribution of values. They also state that for numeric attributes, using \"t\"-closeness anonymization is more effective than many other privacy-preserving data mining methods.\n\n"}
{"id": "1935238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1935238", "title": "Tamborrada", "text": "Tamborrada\n\nTamborrada of Donostia (in Basque Donostiako Danborrada) is a celebratory drum festival held every year on January 20 in the city of San Sebastián, Spain. At midnight, in the Konstituzio Plaza in the \"Alde Zaharra/Parte Vieja\" (Old Town), the mayor raises the flag of San Sebastián. The festival lasts for 24 hours. Participants, dressed as cooks and soldiers, march in companies across the city. The celebration ends at midnight, when people congregate at the Konstituzio Plaza and the \ncity flag is simultaneously lowered at various locations.\n\nThe last Carlist War in Spain took place between the end of the 18th century and the Second Carlist War (Literal translation from Catalan/Spanish: The War of the Matiners or Madrugadores) (1846-1849) and the Third Carlist War (in Spanish: Tercera Guerra Carlista) (1872–1876). As a walled military stronghold, the city of San Sebastián was subject to heavy property damage due to military activity, sometimes with dire consequences. This was especially true during the Siege of San Sebastián (1813), in which international powers (Spain, France, Great Britain, and Portugal) were involved. The war caused between 7,000 and 50,000 casualties.\n\nThe festival is said to originate from the 1830s custom of locals using buckets and hardware from the water pump to mock the soldiers stationed in the city by aping their daily procession from the San Telmo headquarters to the Main Gate at the city walls (\"Puerta de Tierra\"). The comic procession in carnival mood may have developed into a youth music group, the Carnival of Donostia, which started on the 20th of January, followed by the Caldereros at the beginning of February.\n\nIn the early days, the procession also heralded the ox run event, held on the same day. At this stage, the members of the procession dressed in everyday clothes, as they had not adopted uniforms yet. The procession further developed when local tradesman Vicente \"Txiki\" Buenechea donated barrels to be used as drums. In 1881, unused military outfits were discovered in the San Telmo headquarters. These were donated to the council, which in turn gave them to the Union Artesana club (the oldest in existence) for use in the Tamborrada. By 1886, barrels were added to the formations in attendance. Other \"sociedades gastronómicas\" (\"gourmet clubs\") joined the Union Artesana in following years, thus expanding the festival attendance.\n\nAccording to an urban legend, a baker was fetching water from a fountain during a drought in San Sebastián in 1720. As he began to sing, local women around him started pounding on their water basins to accompany him. To his surprise, the water kept on flowing and they kept on drumming with glee. Soon a crowd gathered. As the legend has it, there has not been a drought ever since, nor has the music of the barrels ever stopped playing.\n\nThe event was cancelled in 1902 and was revived in 1906, but remained the same way even up to the years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, which banned Carnival statewide, but maintained the two iconic festivals of the city, the Tamborrada and the Caldereros. To ensure the continuity of the city's traditions the first Children's Tamborrada was held in 1962, and has now become a permanent part of the festivities. From just only 3 in the 1920s, today there are over 125 clubs and organizations that have formations for the event.\n\nIn 1861, local musician Raimundo Sarriegui composed the occasion's iconic marches, including the \"March of San Sebastian\", which caught on and gained popularity. Other works of his include \"Erretreta\", \"Tatiago\", \"Diana\" and \"Iriyarena.\" Additional pieces have been added more recently. The traditional lyrics sung to the marches were composed by local writer Serafin Baroja.\n\nThe old city march, composed by José Juan Santesteban, was added to the official songlist in 2013, marking the bicentennial year since the historic siege of 1813. The Old March was played in the 1830s as part of the festivities during those times.\n\nAdults usually have dinner in \"sociedades gastronómicas\" (\"gourmet clubs\"), which provide elements of the procession, and traditionally admitted only males. Even the strictest ones now allow women on the \"Noche de la Tamborrada\". They eat sophisticated meals, mostly composed of seafood (traditionally elver, now no longer served due to its exorbitant price) and drink the best wines.\n\nDepending on the time the company is marching, parade-goers take to the streets and are sometimes offered drinks between the musical performances. Nowadays the Tamborrada is made up of mixed sex companies for the most part, while proportions may vary a lot from one to the other. For \"Donostiarras\" this is the most celebrated festival of the year. These drummer groups often have marching bands playing along with them.\n\nAfter hearing drums all night, children wake up with a version of the Tamborrada for children. They dress traditionally as soldiers from Napoleonic times and march around the city. Children from all the schools of San Sebastián march that day. They wear costumes that usually represent a particular country (such as England, Germany, or Romania). More recently, the parade has been pushed back to days before the festival proper, thus Children's Tamborrada is the first activity of the festival. 2018 marks the 57th anniversary of the Children's Tamborrada, which launched in 1961 to promote the cultural legacy of the festival to the younger generations. A repeat performance is held at noon of the festival day. 52 contingents from schools in the city join the celebrations beating their snare drums while honoring the heroes of the defense of the city and its patron.\n\nEach of the contingents are formed by and sponsored by traditionally the txokos, and today by a variety of organizations sanctioned by the city council to form delegations for the festival. These also send liaisons to coordinate with a city council representative on the route of the march and on what district/s and/or borough/s of the city they will have to hold their festivities for the year.\n\nMost of these are of company size save for one - the Peña Anastasio association - with 400 men and women, the size of a small battalion, and split into 3 formations. It is also affiliated with the local football team in the area.\n\nEach for the formations are composed of:\n\n\nFormed in 1934, the Gaztelubide association's contingent serves as the official band for the opening and closing ceremonies. By 2015 they are joined by the Coro Easo in singing the San Sebastian March.\n\nGiven San Sebastián's status as one of the two cities chosen to be the European Capital of Culture for 2016, it is no surprise, however, that Wroclaw, Poland, the other ECC city, has begun celebrating the festival as well in 2015 - as the \"Wroclaw Tamborrada\". The 2016 event even had Polish Armed Forces bands in attendance. Just like in San Sebastián, children also take part in the event as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "30840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30840", "title": "Tetrarchy", "text": "Tetrarchy\n\nThe term \"tetrarchy\" (from the , \"tetrarchia\", \"leadership of four [people]\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when mutually destructive conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half.\n\nAlthough the term \"tetrarch\" was current in antiquity, it was never used of the imperial college under Diocletian. Instead, the term was used to describe independent portions of a kingdom that were ruled under separate leaders. The tetrarchy of Judaea, established after the death of Herod the Great, is the most famous example of the antique tetrarchy. The term was understood in the Latin world as well, where Pliny the Elder glossed it as follows: \"each is the equivalent of a kingdom, and also part of one\" (\"regnorum instar singulae et in regna contribuuntur\").\n\nAs used by the ancients, the term describes not only different governments, but also a different system of government from the Diocletianic arrangements. The Judaean tetrarchy was a set of four independent and distinct states, where each tetrarch ruled a quarter of a kingdom as they saw fit; the Diocletianic tetrarchy was a college led by a single supreme leader. When later authors described the period, this is what they emphasized: Ammianus had Constantius II admonish Julian for disobedience by appealing to the example in submission set by Diocletian's lesser colleagues; Julian himself compared the Diocletianic tetrarchs to a chorus surrounding a leader, speaking in unison under his command. Only Lactantius, a contemporary of Diocletian and a deep ideological opponent of the Diocletianic state, referred to the tetrarchs as a simple multiplicity of rulers.\n\nMuch modern scholarship was written without the term. Although Edward Gibbon pioneered the description of the Diocletianic government as a \"New Empire\", he never used the term \"tetrarchy\"; neither did Theodor Mommsen. It did not appear in the literature until used in 1887 by schoolmaster Hermann Schiller in a two-volume handbook on the Roman Empire (\"Geschichte der Römischen Kaiserzeit\"), to wit: \"die diokletianische Tetrarchie\". Even so, the term did not catch on in the literature until Otto Seeck used it in 1897.\n\nThe first phase, sometimes referred to as the diarchy (\"rule of two\"), involved the designation of the general Maximian as co-emperor—firstly as \"Caesar\" (junior emperor) in 285, followed by his promotion to \"Augustus\" in 286. Diocletian took care of matters in the eastern regions of the empire while Maximian similarly took charge of the western regions. In 293, Diocletian thought that more focus was needed on both civic and military problems, so with Maximian's consent, he expanded the imperial college by appointing two \"Caesars\" (one responsible to each \"Augustus\")—Galerius and Constantius Chlorus.\n\nIn 305, the senior emperors jointly abdicated and retired, allowing Constantius and Galerius to be elevated in rank to \"Augustus\". They in turn appointed two new Caesars — Severus II in the west under Constantius, and Maximinus in the east under Galerius — thereby creating the second Tetrarchy.\n\nThe four tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire against bordering rivals (notably Sassanian Persia) and barbarians (mainly Germanic, and an unending sequence of nomadic or displaced tribes from the eastern steppes) at the Rhine and Danube. These centres are known as the tetrarchic capitals. Although Rome ceased to be an operational capital, Rome continued to be nominal capital of the entire Roman Empire, not reduced to the status of a province but under its own, unique Prefect of the City (praefectus urbi, later copied in Constantinople).\n\nThe four tetrarchic capitals were:\n\n\nAquileia, a port on the Adriatic coast, and Eboracum (modern York, in northern England near the Celtic tribes of modern Scotland and Ireland), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.\n\nIn terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division among the four tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theater'. Each tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective Pretorian Prefect, each supervising several Vicarii, the governors-general in charge of another, lasting new administrative level, the civil diocese. For a listing of the provinces, now known as eparchy, within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see Roman province.\n\nIn the West, the Augustus Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his Caesar, Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the Augustus Diocletian and his Caesar, Galerius, were much more flexible.\n\nHowever, it appears that some contemporary and later writers, such as the Christian author Lactantius, and Sextus Aurelius Victor (who wrote about fifty years later and from uncertain sources), misunderstood the tetrarchic system in this respect, believing it to have involved a stricter division of territories among the four emperors.\nAlthough power was shared in the tetrarchic system, the public image of the four emperors in the imperial college was carefully managed to give the appearance of a united empire (\"patrimonium indivisum\"). This was especially important after the numerous civil wars of the 3rd century.\n\nThe tetrarchs appeared identical in all official portraits. Coinage dating from the tetrarchic period depicts every emperor with identical features—only the inscriptions on the coins indicate which one of the four emperors is being shown. The Byzantine sculpture \"Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs\" shows the tetrarchs again with identical features and wearing the same military costume.\n\nOne of the greatest problems facing emperors in the Third Century Crisis was that they were only ever able to personally command troops on one front at any one time. While Aurelian and Probus were prepared to accompany their armies thousands of miles between war regions, this was not an ideal solution. Furthermore, it was risky for an emperor to delegate power in his absence to a subordinate general, who might win a victory and then be proclaimed as a rival emperor himself by his troops (which often happened). All members of the imperial college, on the other hand, were of essentially equal rank, despite two being senior emperors and two being junior; their functions and authorities were also equal.\n\nUnder the Tetrarchy a number of important military victories were secured. Both the Dyarchic and the tetrarchic system ensured that an emperor was near to every crisis area to personally direct and remain in control of campaigns simultaneously on more than just one front. After suffering a defeat by the Persians in 296, Galerius crushed Narseh in 298—reversing a series of Roman defeats throughout the century—capturing members of the imperial household and a substantial amount of booty and gaining a highly favourable peace treaty, which secured peace between the two powers for a generation. Similarly, Constantius defeated the British usurper Allectus, Maximian pacified the Gauls, and Diocletian crushed the revolt of Domitianus in Egypt.\n\nWhen in 305 the 20-year term of Diocletian and Maximian ended, both abdicated. Their Caesares, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus, were both raised to the rank of Augustus, and two new Caesares were appointed: Maximinus (Caesar to Galerius) and Flavius Valerius Severus (Caesar to Constantius). These four formed the second tetrarchy.\n\nHowever, the system broke down very quickly thereafter. When Constantius died in 306, Galerius promoted Severus to Augustus while Constantine, Constantius' son, was proclaimed Augustus by his father's troops. At the same time, Maxentius, the son of Maximian, who also resented being left out of the new arrangements, defeated Severus before forcing him to abdicate and then arranging his murder in 307. Maxentius and Maximian both then declared themselves Augusti. By 308 there were therefore no fewer than four claimants to the rank of Augustus (Galerius, Constantine, Maximian and Maxentius), and only one to that of Caesar (Maximinus).\n\nIn 308 Galerius, together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the supposedly retired Maximian, called an imperial \"conference\" at Carnuntum on the River Danube. The council agreed that Licinius would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared an usurper. This agreement proved disastrous: by 308 Maxentius had become \"de facto\" ruler of Italy and Africa even without any imperial rank, and neither Constantine nor Maximinus—who had both been Caesares since 306 and 305 respectively—were prepared to tolerate the promotion of the Augustus Licinius as their superior.\n\nAfter an abortive attempt to placate both Constantine and Maximinus with the meaningless title \"filius Augusti\" (\"son of the Augustus\", essentially an alternative title for Caesar), they both had to be recognised as Augusti in 309. However, four full Augusti all at odds with each other did not bode well for the tetrarchic system.\n\nBetween 309 and 313 most of the claimants to the imperial office died or were killed in various civil wars. Constantine forced Maximian's suicide in 310. Galerius died naturally in 311. Maxentius was defeated by Constantine at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 and subsequently killed. Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in 313 after being defeated in battle by Licinius.\n\nBy 313, therefore, there remained only two emperors: Constantine in the West and Licinius in the East. The tetrarchic system was at an end, although it took until 324 for Constantine to finally defeat Licinius, reunite the two halves of the Roman Empire and declare himself sole Augustus.\n\nAfter the retirement of the two \"Augusti\" both previous \n\"Caesares\" succeeded them, and two new \"Caesares\" were appointed. Maximinus Daia was Galerius' nephew.\n\nAfter the death of Constantius his legions proclaim his son Constantine the new \"Augustus\", but Galerius elevates Severus to be the new \"junior Augustus\" and compensates Constantine with the rank of \"Caesar\".\n\nAfter the death of Severus, Constantine does not succeed him. At the council of Carnutum, Diocletian decides that \nLicinius will be the new \"Augustus\" of the West.\n\nAfter the death of Galerius he was succeeded by Maximinus Daia in as \"Augustus\" of the East, but is crowded by Licinius, who wants to have the status of the \"senior Augustus\". Maximinus appoints no new \"Caesar\", although it was assumed that this position should later on be filled out with the son of Severus, Flavius Severianus, or at least that he was scheduled for this position.\n\nShortly before the turn of the year 316/317, Constantine, now \"Augustus\" in the West, appointed a \"Caesar\", while Licinius briefly appointed one of his officers, Valerius Valens, as the third \"Augustus\". This was apparent from coins, though Valens was apparently inferior to Licinius, who soon executed him. Even the chronology is unclear, as the date stamping could also be the turn of the year 314/315.\n\nThe tetrarchic system is at its end. Both \"Augusti\" appoint their own sons as co-emperors, restoring a dynastic system. However, before his death, Licinius appoints the General Martinianus on 3 July 324 as \"Augustus\" in name only, as Martinianus was intended to replace Constantine in the west. \n\nAlthough the tetrarchic system as such only lasted until 313 CE, many aspects of it survived. The fourfold regional division of the empire continued in the form of Praetorian prefectures, each of which was overseen by a praetorian prefect and subdivided into administrative dioceses, and often reappeared in the title of the military supra-provincial command assigned to a magister militum.\n\nThe pre-existing notion of \"consortium imperii\", the sharing of imperial power, and the notion that an associate to the throne was the designated successor (possibly conflicting with the notion of hereditary claim by birth or adoption), was to reappear repeatedly.\n\nThe idea of the two halves, the east and the west, re-emerged and eventually resulted in the permanent de facto division into two separate Roman empires after the death of Theodosius I, though it is important to remember that the empire was never formally divided, the emperors of the eastern and western halves legally ruling as one imperial college until the fall of Rome's western empire left Byzantium, the \"second Rome\", sole direct heir.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1188334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1188334", "title": "Viennese German", "text": "Viennese German\n\nViennese German (, ) is the city dialect spoken in Vienna, the capital of Austria, and is counted among the Bavarian dialects. It is distinct from written Standard German in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Even in Lower Austria, the state surrounding the city, many of its expressions are not used, while farther to the west they are often not even understood.\n\nViennese differs from the Austrian form of Standard German, as well as from other dialects spoken in Austria (\"see also Austrian German and Bavarian\").\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, one could differentiate between four Viennese dialects (named after the districts in which they were spoken): \"Favoritnerisch\" (Favoriten, 10th District), \"Meidlingerisch\", (Meidling, 12th District), \"Ottakringerisch\" (Ottakring, 16th District), and \"Floridsdorferisch\" (Floridsdorf, 21st District). Today these labels are no longer applicable, and one speaks of a single Viennese dialect, with its usage varying as one moves further away from the city.\n\nBesides the locational dialects of Old Vienna, there were also class-based dialects. For example, \"Schönbrunnerdeutsch\", or German as spoken by the courtiers and attendants of the Habsburg Imperial Court at Schönbrunn Royal Palace, was a manner of speech with an affected bored inflection combined with overenunciation. The nasal tonality was akin to German spoken with a French accent. While far less used today, educated Viennese are still familiar with this court dialect.\n\nAll in all, speaking Viennese masterly by intonating sentences with distinctive ups and downs creates a very warm, melodic sound - particularly in said \"Schönbrunn\" variant.\n\nFeatures typical of Viennese German include:\n\nThe following Viennese German characteristics are also found in other Bavarian dialects:\n\n\nThere are not many grammatical differences from other Bavarian dialects, but the following are typical:\n\nThe dialect is distinct mostly in its vocabulary.\n\nVocabulary displays particular characteristics. Viennese retains many Middle High German and sometimes even Old High German roots. Furthermore, it integrated many expressions from other languages, particularly from other parts of the former Habsburg Monarchy, as Vienna served as a melting pot for its constituent populations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBecause transcription of Viennese has not been standardised, the rendering of pronunciation here is incomplete:\n\n\nIn Viennese, the following pragmatics peculiarities are found quite often:\n\nIn more recent times Viennese has moved closer to Standard German; it has developed into a kind of Standard German spoken with a typical Viennese accent (for example, the original Viennese \"Wos host’n fir a Notn gschriebn?\" becomes modern \"Was hast’n für eine Note gschriebn?\"). The typical Viennese monophthongization, through which the dialect differentiates itself from the neighboring dialects, remains, but mostly in the form of a developing \"Pseudo-Standard German\" that many foreigners, particularly from other states, feel is ugly.\n\nFor example: \"Waaaßt, wos mir heut in der Schule für än gråååsliches Fläääsch kriegt ham?\" (Standard German \"Weißt du, was für ein widerliches Fleisch wir heute in der Schule vorgesetzt bekamen?\") (\"Do you know what disgusting meat we were served at school today?\") The monopthongized diphthongs, like \"ei\" ~ \"äää\" or \"au\" ~ \"ååå\", are particularly stressed and lengthened.\n\nThe reason for the convergence of the typical Viennese dialects is the attitude, strengthened by the media, that \"Urwienerisch\" (old Viennese) is associated with the lower classes. With the rising standard of living, the original Viennese can further converge, as it is considered a sign of low-class origins, while the unique Viennese words (such as \"Zwutschgerl\") (cf Zwetschge/Zwetsche/Pflaume depending on dialect (\"plum\")) however generally remain in use.\n\nViennese dialects have always been influenced by foreign languages, particularly due to immigration. In the past 40 years immigrants mostly came from the former Yugoslavia, Turkey and most recently (East) Germany; but modern-day immigration has changed, which in turn has affected and created new varieties of modern-day Viennese. As an ongoing process, particularly in areas with a high percentage of first- and second-generation immigrants, new loanwords find their way into Viennese, and so do changes in pronunciation.\n\n\n"}
