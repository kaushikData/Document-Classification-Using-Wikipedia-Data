The program legally requires the Department of Defense to make various items of equipment available to local law enforcement.\n\n, 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participated in the program that has transferred $5.1 billion in military material from the Department of Defense to law enforcement agencies since 1997. According to the Defense Logistics Agency, material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone. Some of the most commonly requested items include ammunition, cold weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies, sleeping bags, flashlights and electrical wiring. Small arms and vehicles such as aircraft, watercraft and armored vehicles have also been obtained.\n\nThe program has been criticized over the years by local media, by the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense in 2003, and by the GAO which found waste, fraud and abuse. It was not until media coverage of police during August 2014 Ferguson unrest that the program drew nationwide public attention; the Ferguson Police Department had equipment obtained through the 1033 program.\n\nPresident Obama signed Executive Order 13688 on May 2015 limiting and prohibiting certain types of equipment. On 28 August 2017 President Trump rolled back Obama's Executive Order. The ACLU and the NAACP have raised concerns about they call the militarization of police forces in the US. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the move early Monday morning of that week at the Fraternal Order of Police convention in Nashville, and said the president would do so by executive order. At the same time, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the director of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) pointed out the use of 1033 equipment as life saving devices seeing restrictions on distributing military surplus to police as “too far.\" The FOP also pointed out that the armored vehicles weren't tanks.\n\nIn 1944, the Surplus Property Act provided for the disposal of surplus government property, and spawned numerous short lived agencies like the Surplus War Property Administration (SWPA), in the Office of War Mobilization (OWM, February–October 1944), the Surplus Property Board (SPB), in the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion (OWMR, October 1944 – September 1945), the Surplus Property Administration and also corporations like the Petroleum Reserves Corporation (PRC) and the War Assets Corporation to deal with it. The War Assets Administration was the latest to operate and was abolished in 1949.\n\nThe \"National Defense Authorization Act of 1990\", section 1208 authorized transfer of military hardware from the Department of Defense broadly to \"federal and state agencies\", but specifically \"for use in counter-drug activities\". as this legislation was passed in the context of the War on Drugs. Until 1997, it was called the 1208 program and run by the Department of Defense from the Pentagon and its regional offices.\n\nIn 1995, the \"Law Enforcement Support Office\" was created within the DLA to work exclusively with law enforcement.\n\nWith passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, the 1208 program was expanded to the 1033 program allowing \"all law enforcement agencies to acquire property for bona fide law enforcement purposes that assist in their arrest and apprehension mission\", and that \"Preference is given to counter-drug and counter-terrorism requests\". It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on 23 September 1996.\n\nIn October the DLA Disposition Services first released information about the equipment distribution by county. An inflection point occurred in the fall 2014 after several events brought increasing public scrutiny, and the eventual release of Federal records on the movement of military goods to civilian police forces was made public on November 21, 2014. \n\nThe U.S. Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLA) help the Department of Defense to dispose of its \"excess property [...] from air conditioners to vehicles, clothing to computers\" by \"transfer to other federal agencies, or donation to state and local governments and other qualified organizations\", as well as by \"sale of surplus property\". Availability of surplus equipment has been facilitated by the reduced American presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 1033 program is designed to specifically work with law enforcement agencies, like local police forces, school district police and others.\n\nFrom 1997 until 2014, $5.1 billion in military hardware were transferred from the Department of Defense to local American law enforcement agencies, according to DLA's \"Law Enforcement Support Office\" (LESO) and material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone. About a third of the equipment is new. The most commonly obtained item from the 1033 program is ammunition. Other most commonly requested items include cold weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies, sleeping bags, flashlights and electrical wiring. The 1033 program also transfers office equipment such as fax machines, which many smaller police departments are unable to afford. The DLA also offers tactical armored vehicles, weapons, including grenade launchers, watercraft, and aircraft.\n\n, 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participate in the reutilization program. Police departments are responsible for paying for shipment and storage of material acquired, but do not pay for the donation. The largest number of requests for material comes from small to mid-sized police departments who are unable to afford extra clothing, vehicles and weapons. The program gives smaller police departments access to material that larger police departments are usually able to afford without federal assistance. A memorandum of agreement between the DLA and the states participating in 1033 requires that local police forces either utilize the military equipment within one year or return it. The rules allow police to dispose of or sell some goods after at least one year of usage.\n\n more than twenty school district police agencies received military-grade equipment through the program. The San Diego school district planned to return a military surplus vehicle after negative public reaction.\n\nThe Los Angeles School Police Department has also received excess military equipment, including 61 assault rifles, three grenade launchers, and an MRAP vehicle. Ten School Police Departments in Texas also participate in the 1033 program, in total acquiring 25 automatic pistols, 64 M16 assault rifles, 18 M14 assault rifles, 15 vehicles and tactical vests.\n\nAs of 2014, at least 117 colleges and universities in the United States have used the 1033 program to acquire military-grade equipment through their campus police departments. Higher education institutions that participate in the program include local community colleges, state universities, and Ivy Leagues, ranging from Hinds Community College, University of Central Florida, University of California, Columbia University, and Yale.\n\nIn 2012, the University of California at Berkeley attempted to use the federal program to acquire an Armored Response Counter Attack Truck, also referred to as a Lenco BearCat, to deal with possible campus shootings, but public outcry forced UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgenau to reverse procurement of the eight-ton armored truck. In 2013, Ohio State University acquired an MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle that was equipped with a machine gun turret, becoming the first campus in the U.S. to integrate this kind of military-grade equipment into their campus police department. Florida State University used the program to acquire a Humvee, which campus police say is only to be used in the case of an active shooter, not a civil disturbance. Central Washington University has also received an armored truck through the program, claiming the truck is used to train for active-shooter scenarios. The most popular military equipment acquired by colleges and universities through the 1033 program is the M16. Campus police at the Arizona State University currently hold the most M16’s with a total of 70, followed by Florida International University and the University of Maryland, which both carry 50 M16’s. \n\nThe Department of Defense has provided a variety of military and police equipment to both private and public universities across the country. Equipment allocated has ranged from gauze, trousers, and other basic supplies, to armored vehicles, grenade launchers, and M-16 assault rifles. Many spokespersons for colleges and universities that received this military equipment have cited cost efficiency as the main motivation for engaging in this partnership, including University of Florida’s dean of students Jen Day Shaw, who stated that the program \"is a cost savings for taxpayers.”\n\nParticipating campus departments pay only for delivery and maintenance of allocated military supplies, paying a mere $507.43 for as many as 12 M-16 rifles (University of Louisiana at Monroe). If colleges and universities seek to acquire material not obtainable directly through the 1033 program, like other local law enforcement agencies, they may purchase said equipment through federal grants allocated by the DOD. Another justification for involvement in the 1033 program is the epidemic of school shootings on U.S. campuses, with many college and university representatives citing the Virginia Tech shooting as reason for concern and increased militarization of campus police departments.\n\nIn instances where campus police departments fail to or do not directly attempt to acquire excess military material from the 1033 program, partnership with local and regional law enforcement through mutual aid allows colleges and universities to indirectly benefit from the program by utilizing military equipment obtained by law enforcement agencies in the surrounding area. Where police jurisdiction overlaps between college and universities and the municipal area they inhabit, the acquisition of material such as an MRAP by a municipal law enforcement agency can substitute acquisition by a campus police department, as was the case between the city of Davis, CA and the University of California at Davis in 2014.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies must declare the intended use for each item, maintain an audit trail for each item and conduct inventory checks for DLA. Firearms, certain vehicles and other equipment must be returned to the Defense Department after use. \"For security reasons [1033 program record] information is not subject to public review\", per DLA.\n\nA state coordinating agency in each U.S. state, except for Hawaii, headed by a state coordinator that is appointed by the state governor must approve an application, and is supposed to function as oversight after dispersion of equipment. The state coordinating agency is housed within a state agency that varies from state to state, for example in the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, the Alaska Department of Public Safety and so on. The fact that in Arizona a Payson, Arizona Police Department Detective, was appointed as the state coordinator, made it easier for Paul Babeu, Sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona to amass \"more than $7 million worth of Humvees, fire trucks, firearms, defibrillators, barber chairs, underwear, thermal-imaging scopes, computers, motor scooters and other in 2010–2012, which he told county supervisors he would auction off to balance his budget. This is because the detective had appointed an office grants administrator in the Pinal County Sheriff Office to help him \"oversee and authorize military-surplus requisitions\". The Sheriff's speaker described it as chance to cherry-pick, \"as we can start approving our own requests\". After the Arizona Republic newspaper expose the DLA \"announced agency-wide reforms, and Sheriff Paul Babeu was directed to retrieve vehicles and other equipment his office distributed to non-police organizations\" and \"about the same time, weapons requisitions were temporarily suspended and audited nationwide.\n\nIn 2003, a Defense Department Inspector General audit found incorrect or inadequate documentation in about three-quarters of the transactions analyzed, declaring 1033 Program records unreliable.\n\nIn 2005, the Government Accountability Office found that the Pentagon \"does not have management controls in place\" to avert waste, abuse and fraud in the program. Investigators identified \"hundreds of millions of dollars in reported lost, damaged, or stolen excess property ... which contributed to reutilization program waste and inefficiency.\"\n\nIn August 2014, the militarized response to civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri led to increased criticism of the 1033 program:\n\nIn September 2014, Senator Claire McCaskill organized the Senate's first hearing on the program, and federal officials faced bipartisan criticism:\n\nIn October 2014,\nIn November 2014,\n\nIn May 2015, following the 2015 Baltimore protests, Obama announced reviews of the use of military equipment, stating \"We've seen how militarized gear sometimes gives people a feeling like they are an occupying force as opposed to a part of the community there to protect them,\" and \"Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments.\"\n\nKara Dansky, senior counsel for the ACLU, wrote that the federal government is deliberately militarizing local law enforcement agencies.\n\nAccording to a study by social scientist Dr. Casey Delehanty and colleagues, larger 1033 transfers are associated with increased killings by police.\n\nDLA public-affairs chief Kenneth MacNevin stated in 2012, that \"more than 30 Arizona police agencies have been suspended or terminated for failing to meet program standards and nine remain under suspension\". One of them was the Maricopa County, Arizona law enforcement after failing to account for 20 of the 200 military weapons it had received. The suspension did not affect police acquisition of high powered weaponry due to anti-racketeering or confiscated drug funds, according to Maricopa's Sheriff.\n\nIn North Carolina, law officials are working to reinstate the 1033 program through more rigorous inventory management, after the state was suspended for failing to account for some transferred equipment. North Carolina officials state that 3,303 out of the 4,227 pieces of equipment obtained through the program are tactical items including automatic weapons and military vehicles and the remainder is not used in combat, and includes cots, containers and generators.\n\nFusion reported in August 2014 that a total of 184 state and local police departments had been suspended from the program for missing weapons and failure to comply with guidelines. Missing items included M14 and M16 assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, and two Humvee vehicles.\n\nInvestigative journalist Susan Katz Keating reported in October 2017 that certain elements of the program were restored despite the compliance issues.\n\n\n"}

Allbirds first shoe was the Wool Runner, which is made from New Zealand superfine merino wool. The company claims to keep the brand as eco-friendly as possible and is a certified B Corporation. In March 2018, the company started offering their footwear with eucalyptus tree fiber. In August 2018, a flip-flop collection made of bioplastic foam from sugar cane was released by Allbirds.\n\nIn October 2018, the company raised a $50M Series C, bringing its total valuation to $1.4B.\n\nAllbirds co-founder Tim Brown got the idea for the company while he was vice captain of the New Zealand football team. He had previously attended business school and used to make leather shoes for friends but was aware of how uncomfortable they were. In 2014, he received a research grant from the New Zealand wool industry to engineer a sneaker. He then launched his idea on Kickstarter, raising $119,000 in five days. After launching on Kickstarter, Brown teamed up with Joey Zwillinger, a biotech engineer and renewable materials expert. The co-founders began developing their process and officially launched Allbirds in March 2016.\n\nDuring their first year in business, the company raised $7.25 million from investors including [Maveron], Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Red Sea Ventures, Slow Ventures, Peterson Partners, Antipodean and Western Technology Investment.\n\nIn December 2017, Allbirds sued Steve Madden, alleging that the company's Traveler shoes look nearly identical to its wool runners.\n\nAs of 2017, the company had 50 employees in their San Francisco headquarters, 40 employees at the Nashville warehouse and 350 contractors in a factory in South Korea.\n\nBy October 2018, Allbirds sold a stake to investors at a valuation of $1.4 billion.\n\nAllbirds began with one product, the Wool Runner. In 2017, the company released a second shoe, the Lounger. The shoes are made from castor bean oil and superfine merino wool, with each strand 17.5 microns wide. This material allows the shoe to be machine washable.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Allbirds launched a shoe line for children named Smallbirds. The limited edition children shoes are $55 a pair and are an exact replica of its adult Wool Runner. Smallbirds are for children ages 2–4 and are available in three colors: natural grey, Kea red and NZ blue.\n\nIn March 2018, Allbirds began offering eucalyptus tree runners, making it the company's first footwear product made primarily without wool. Allbirds also offers a version of its Lounger shoe made from eucalyptus trees, in addition to wool. They also launched the Tree Skipper, a boat shoe made of the same material.\n\nIn August 2018, Allbirds released flip-flops made from SweetFoam (a foam derived from sugar cane, developed by the company in partnership with Braskem).\n\nIn November 2017, Allbirds and Outdoor Voices collaborated on a line of athleisure apparel which included two limited edition colors of the Allbirds wool runners.\n\nIn early 2018, five limited edition colors of Allbirds were released, available for purchase at pop-ups inside of five US and two Canadian Nordstrom locations, in addition to the Nordstrom website.\n\nIn May 2018, Shake Shack branded pairs of Allbirds tree runners were sold at Madison Square Park in New York City for one day.\n\nIn September 2018, Allbirds collaborated with Air New Zealand to create an eye mask for its business class passengers.\n\nAs of August 2018, Allbirds operated retail stores in New York City, San Francisco, and Toronto. The company is also planning to open stores in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. in 2018.\n\nIn October 2018, Allbirds launched in the United Kingdom with its first London store.\n\n"}

The purpose of ASFAR is to \"defend and advance the civil and human rights of young people through promoting the elimination and reform of laws that limit the freedom and self-determination of young people in the United States, and empowering young people to act on their own behalf in defense of their rights and freedoms\". ASFAR is associated with the youth rights movement, which advocates more freedom for young people and protection of their rights under law, in order to allow them the greatest degree of self-determination possible.\n\nASFAR, originally an email list organization, was founded in 1996 by Matt Walcoff and Matt Herman, two individuals who felt that age restrictions in the U.S. had gone too far. The small project grew into what could be called a legitimate organization. In 1999, ASFAR was incorporated in Missouri.\n\nWithin a year of its founding, ASFAR developed internal conflicts that would ultimately split the organization. Disputes over internal affairs and over the Declaration of Principles would lead to the creation of two factions. One group, which included the majority of the membership at that time, called for a detailed and radical declaration of principles and a high degree of membership involvement in the formation of policy. This faction took the name of the group literally and insisted the organization oppose all age restrictions as a matter of principle.\n\nThe other faction, led by Herman and Walcoff, called for a more traditional organization, led by a board of directors and with a smaller, more pragmatic set of policy positions. This latter group would leave to form the more visible and active National Youth Rights Association (NYRA).\n\nASFAR opposes a wide variety of laws that limit the freedom of young people, such as voting age limits, curfew laws, compulsory education, child labor laws, age of consent laws, minimum drinking ages, pornography age laws, child prostitution laws and minimum ages for firearm possession. They support a non-age-based alternative to every age-based law, and believe that the rights of all people to freedom and self-determination outweigh the cost of implementing non-age-based laws.\n\nThe animosity that led to the schism with NYRA has largely subsided, and ASFAR enjoys amicable and cordial relations with NYRA. While neither organization has gone on record as supporting formal reunification, neither organization has formally renounced the prospect.\n\nASFAR published an internet zine, \"Youth Truth\", that was nominated for the Utne Alternative Press Award for \"General Excellence -- Zine\" in 2006. \"Youth Truth\" was suspended in 2007 by order of its board of directors. In the January 2010 board meeting, the board of directors appointed Susan Wishnetsky to restart the zine. Meanwhile, ASFAR's opposition to the age of consent continues to attract members to ASFAR, as NYRA objects to taking a position on the issue. ASFAR is currently in the process of forming new positions on the age of consent, students' rights, the drinking age, and the treatment of young people by the media.\n\n"}
{"id": "16918156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16918156", "title": "Basque bowls", "text": "Basque bowls\n\nBasque bowls (), is one of the few Basque rural sports which do not originate in an activity related to rural or marine work. It has a number of other names too and is played in a \"bolatoki\" or \"bolaleku\" \"bowls place\" which often consists of a playing area in the open, an open sided structure with a low roof or a playing area located inside a colonnaded hallway.\n\nThe game has been more common in the southern parts of the Basque Country in the last few centuries, especially in Álava and Biscay and to a lesser degree in Gipuzkoa and Navarre but documents from the Bayonne archives from the 17th-century mention the games and there is also other evidence to show that the game was also played historically in the northern part of the Basque Country.\n\nThe main characteristic of the Basque variants of the game is the more prominent use of balls with finger-holes and hand-holes which distinguishes it from other regions in the area which prefer balls without.\n\n\nThey are all variants of dirt-track and lawn bowls and as such related to games such as bowls, skittles and bowling. There is a large number of different variations of the game (over 25 variants in Biscay and Álava alone), sometimes sharing their rules with varieties in other areas like Cantabria, Burgos or León. Some varieties are extremely localised and with specialised playing areas not found outside the area.\nThe main points of variation center around points such as:\n\nDue to societal changes, some variants are reduced to events at fiestas rather than everyday past-times. For example, of the over 400 playing areas that existed in Biscay in the last century, only some 100 remain. At the same time, organised competitions are also held these days among the provincial federations and clubs. Always keen to embrace new technologies, enthusiasts are also using the internet to attract new members and players.\n\nMany varieties are known only by the geographical affiliation: \"Arabar boloa\" (Álavan bowls), \"Burgosko bola\" (Burgos bowls), \"Gesaltzako bola\" (Gesaltza bowls), \"Palentziako bola\" (Palencia bowls) and so on.\n\nKnown as \"Aiarako bola jokoa\" and \"Aiararra\" in Basque, \"ayalés\" and \"remonte\" in Spanish. Two \"bolatoki\" in Aiara for this variant remain in popular use but other exist in an area between Gueñes, Artziniega, Tertanga and Ibarra.\n\nThe sunken playing area, called \"carrejo\" or \"boladera\" is 20–28 m long and 3.5–4.20 m wide and surrounded by slanting sides, giving the playing area the appearance of a large, sunken trough. Originally played on clay, many use a wooden floor now. The launching area is up to 5m long and the nine large pins are arranged in a 3x3 square at the far end. There is also a small pin (called \"bolinchín\", \"cuatro\", \"txikerra\" or \"chiquito\") which is worth four points. The balls have finger and hand-holes, are 28–30 cm in diameter and usually weigh between 8–14 kg but heavier ones have been used.\n\nThe player, using spin, launches the ball onto either the left or right long incline and to achieve a valid throw, has to knock over at least the small pin and one large pin. The ball the (ideally) rebounds from the back incline and knocks over more pins. Pins knocked over by other pins also count.\n\nCalled \"Arabar boloa\" or \"lautadakoa\" (the one from the \"lautada\") in Basque, \"juego de bolo alavés\" and \"bolo de la Llanada\" in Spanish. The playing area consists of three main parts, all of which are a step down from the surrounding areas:\n\n\nThe balls have no handles, weigh between 2.1-2.5 kg, have a diameter of 16–17 cm and have no finger or hand-holes. There are four pins arranged in a triangle with the point towards the players. The one closes to the \"parra\" is the \"cantón\", to the back and left is the \"carraca\", to the back and right the \"guarda\" and directly behind the \"cantón\" sits the \"medio\". The distance between the \"carraca\" and the \"guarda\" is about 2.4m.\n\nThe players must launch the ball onto the \"loma\", stay on it (otherwise a foul is declared which is called \"zula\") and at the very least knock over the \"cantón\" to score. The aim is to knock all four over but if the ball rebounds from the side panels and knocks over a pin, they do not count. Currently, there are over 1000 registered bowlers and more than one hundred \"bolatoki\" of this style remain predominantly in the central part of Álava. The most important competition is the annual Torneo Interpueblos.\n\nThe history museum of Baiona has a historic exhibit of a \"bederatzi txirlo jokoa\" or \"nine pin skittles\" with pins of almost a meter in height. \"Bolo jokoak\" are not commonly played in this part of the Basque Country anymore but the game is assumed to have been played along the lines of the Bearnese game called \"quilhas de nau\" and \"quilles de neuf\" in French.\n\nCalled \"Bermeoko bola jokoa\" in Basque and \"bolo de Bermeo\" in Spanish. The last \"bolatoki\" for this version disappeared in the 1940s and '50s. The playing area for this version is rectangular, 13.5 m long and 1.5 m wide. At the player's end there are two launch boards sunken into the ground, parallel to each other at either side of the playing area. As in many \"bola jokoak\" the balls are launched onto the wooden planks because it helps maintain the forward speed of a ball, whereas launching it onto a dirt floor would tend to slow them down. At the far end, woode planks were fixed to the side panels to create a semi-hexagon. This game uses 4 pins, three \"nagusiak\" or \"main ones\" and one \"bostekoa\" or \"one of five\". The \"nagusiak\" are arranged in a triangle following the line of the semi-hexagon. The \"bostekoa\" is placed in front of either of the \"nagusiak\", left or right depending on the direction of the game. The ball has two holes, one for the thumb and a larger one for the remaining four fingers. The game proceeds as follows:\n\n\nIf all \"nagusiak\" are knocked over, only 14 points are awarded however so with the \"bostekoa\" the maximum number of points is 19. The aim of the game is to reach 300 first.\n\nThe Basque name, \"Burgosko bola jokoa\" translates as \"bowls from Burgos\", \"bolo burgalés\" in Spanish. This variant arrived in the Basque Country late when some people from Burgos brought it to Basauri in 1980 and to Gasteiz in 1985. Since its spread to areas outside Burgos, championships have been held involving clubs from Burgos, Biscay and Álava.\n\nThe main characteristic of \"Burgosko bola\" is that it is played on two different levels, involving a \"goiko jokoa\" or \"high game\" (\"juego alto\" in Spanish) and a \"beheko jokoa\" \"low game\" or \"barruko jokoa\" \"inside game\" (\"juego bajo\" or \"juego interior\" in Spanish).\n\nThis is called \"Ea aldekoa\" in Basque and \"juego de Ea\" in Spanish. This version is played on a sunken dirt playing field about 23 m by 1.8 m. The bowls have finger and hand-holes and weigh 8 kg and must be launched onto a 4m long platform in the playing area for the throw to be valid. The aim is to knock down 10 pins at the other end, 9 large ones (45 cm tall) and a small one (half the size of the big ones) in front of the big ones either at the centre, left of right.\n\nThe big pins are arranged in groups of three (one behind each other) in three lines at the far end of the track. A player has to hit the small pin (worth five points) first for it to be a valid throw, the other pins are worth one point each. Unlike in other variants, pins knocked over by a ball rebounding from the side panels also count.\n\nThere are two \"bolatoki\" left for this variant, one in Bedaroa and one in Natxitua. The one in Bedaroa is played mainly during town festivals.\n\nOriginally from the Burgos area and called \"tres tablones\" in Spanish, this version was brought to the west of Biscay by migrants. This is a visually spectacular variant on a 30 m by 6 m playing field, balls weighing between 5–7 kg with a 28 cm diameter which are launched at nine slim, pointed 35–40 cm tall pins arranged in a square, one behind the other in groups of three. They are each worth one points except for the one at the center of the square which is worth two. The aim is to scatter the pins as far away from their original location as possible. There is also a smaller 20 cm tall pin called \"miko\" or \"cuatro\" (because it is worth four points). Depending on they type of game, each player has 2–4 balls per round and the \"miko\" is placed in two different positions behind the big pins.\n\nIn this variant, the ball and the central playing area are kept wet and the player launches the ball into the air and at the central row of pins using spin in an attempt to also catch the \"miko\" which is at the back and to the left or right of the central row. For a valid throw, the ball must pass a line in front of the pins in the air, touch down onto one of the platforms on which the pins stand and pass a line at the back on the ground to be a valid throw. Fouls are designated as follows:\n\nIn all these cases the throw is invalid and the player may not bowl again in this round.\n\nOnce a valid ball has come to rest past the line at the back, the player crosses over to the back area called \"cas de birle\" and is allowed to throw a second time from where the ball stopped but the \"miko\" is removed. Again, the throw has to be through the air until it touches down on a pin platform. There are usually also markers at the back indicating the lines of the pins.\n\nIt is a very popular game both in Biscay and Cantabria.\n\nCalled \"hiru txirlo común\" in Spanish), this is a variant of bola jokoa played in the Basque Country. The name \"kanaleko hiru txirlo\" literally translates as \"3 pins of the canal\" but it also goes by the name of \"hiru txirlo arrunta\" (common three pins). This game is still fairly widespread in the east of Biscay from Mendiola to Mutriku and parts of Gipuzkoa (the Deba valley), there are bolo federations for this variant at the cross-provincial level and annual leagues.\n\nThe game is played under a roof on a playing area about 25m long and 2.5m wide. In this variant the balls are 2.5 kg heavy, made of wood with finger and hand holes and are not entirely spherical. Each player has two of these. There are three 21 cm tall pins with a 5 cm diameter are arranged in a line one behind the other with 1m gaps between them. These have names in Basque:\n\nBetween the pins and the launching area there is a 19 m long, narrow elevated canal called \"kanala\", \"pista\" or \"ibilbidea\" (walkway), located on the right hand side of the playing area. The lower lying dirt floor on the left is called the \"kalea\" (street). The ball must be rolled onto a launching plate and towards the pins along the elevated \"pista\". The aim is to knock down the pins without the ball falling into the \"kalea\". This is the trickiest part of the game and various techniques are employed to keep the ball on track such as:\n\nWhen launched, the ball must hit the launch plate otherwise a \"ohol-hutsa\" is declared and the throw is invalid. If the ball stays on the canal but doesn't hit any pins, a \"gain-huts\" (top zero) is declared, if the middle one is left standing an \"erdikuts\" (middle zero) is declared. The maximum one can make is three per throw, either by knocking the pins over with the ball or by a pin knocking another pin. Pins knocked over by a ball rebounding from the sides do not count.\n\nBets are placed either by guessing the number of pins that will or will not get knocked over using the following phrases:\nor\n\nThis version (\"bolos a cachete\", \"smack bowling\" in Spanish) is played in the mining area of the Enkarterri today although \"bolatokiak\" also exist in Biscay, in the area from Barakaldo to Muzkiz. A \"bolatoki\" for this game is also called a \"carrejo\" and was formerly often played on threshing floors.\n\nThe ball in \"katxete\" weighs 3.5–4 kg and have not hand or finger-holes. The 4-6 pins weigh 1 kg, are about 9 cm tall and are oblate spheroids. They need to have this flattened shape because the \"tako\" (\"woodblock\") upon which they are placed isn't level but has an inclined surface, the end furthest away from the player being higher up. They are arranged in a V shape, with the point of the V pointing away from the player. Right in front of the \"tako\" is the \"ur putzua\" or \"water puddle\". The purpose of the puddle is that the player's helper (called \"armador\") can wet the pins and the \"tako\" before the shot.\n\nThe aim is to knock the pins across the lawn over one of two semicircles, called \"marrak\" (lines), delineating the edge of the \"bolatoki\". The first \"marra\" is 10m away from the \"tako\" and the second 18.5m. To score a point, the pins have to pass the first \"marra\", otherwise a \"txorra\" is declared and no points are scored. If a pin passes the second \"marra\", it is worth two points and a game usually is played to 200 or 300 points.\n\nThere are up to 20 \"bolatoki\" for this variant and there are federations at the provincial level and annual league games.\n\nCalled \"Leongo jokoa\" in Basque and \"juego leonés\" in Spanish and as the name suggests, this variant comes from the pronvince of León but is common throughout Spain today. In the Basque Country it is played roughly in the area between Basauri and Portugalete.\nThe minimum playing area for this game is 25–30 m long and 9–10 m wide, split into two main areas: the \"castro\" (castle) where the 10 pins are located and the rest of the playing area. There are nine large pins which are 55 cm tall and a smaller one called \"miche\" which is 30 cm tall. The nine large ones are arranged in a 3x3 square, the one at the centre being called \"medio\".\n\nThe wooden balls are the most extraordinary characteristic of this variant because they are hemispheres and weigh up to 1 kg. Around the \"castro\" are a number of lines:\n\nThere are two parts to a player's round. In the first, the player stands in the square launching area called \"mano\" at a distance of 6-22m from the \"castro\" to throw the ball through the air into the \"castro\". When it touches the ground (which is kept moist), it must neither stop there or rebound but spin onwards for the throw to be valid. At this stage scores are allocated as follows if the ball is valid and comes to rest inside the \"parada\":\nIf the throw is valid and comes to rest outside the \"parada\", scores are allocated as follows:\n\nThere are also special combinations of pins knocked over and path of the ball which can be worth up to 16 points (called \"ahorcada\"), for example if the ball touches down in the \"castro\", only knocks over the \"miche\" and then comes to rest inside the \"parada\".\n\nIn the second part, called \"birlaketa\" (\"birle\" in Spanish), the player can bowl a second time towards the \"castro\" from where the ball landed provided it landed outside the \"parada\" circle. At this stage, if only the \"miche\" is knocked over, no point is awarded.\n\nThis game is called also called \"Zornotza aldekoa\" or \"the one from the Zornotza area\", \"remonte con muna\" and \"juego de Zornotza\" in Spanish. This version was particularly common in Biscay roughly in the area between Zollo and Bernagoitia and is still fairly widespread, especially in the area of Amorebieta-Etxano where most \"bolatokiak\" are attached to rural churches. There are bolo federations at the provincial level and annual leagues for this variant.\n\nIt is played on a rectangular clay surface, 24–27 m long and 4.5–5 m wide. The sides of the playing area rises upwards but the most obvious characteristic of this variant is the \"muna\", a ridge that runs down the middle of the playing area. At the far end it is delineated by the \"topea\", a wooden anel. The aim is to knock down ten pins, 9 large ones (up to 52 cm tall) arranged in a 3x3 square and a small one called \"txakina\". The balls weigh 10–12 kg and have a hand and finger-hole.\n\nThe player stands in the launching area to throw the ball which must touch down in the \"ohola\" or landing area just past the launching area, consisting of a number of sunken boards. This area is about 3 m long and if the ball does not touch down here first, it is declared \"lur\" (ground) and invalid. The ball then travels down some 15m on the ground, sides or \"muna\" to reach the area of the pins.\n\nThe large pins are worth one point each except the one at the centre of the square which is worth two. The \"txakina\" is worth either six or ten points and can be placed just about anywhere within the playing area and the maximum number of points in a throw is 20. Other throws are calculated as follows for a valid ball:\n\nThere are other special throws which depend on the placement of the \"txakina\" apart from the above and some vary from area to area.\n\nThis version is common even today in Cantabria and Biscay in the area roughly between the river Asón and the river Ibaizabal and as far south as Burgos, called \"pasabolo de tablón\" in Spanish.\n\nThere are three parts to the playing field in this game. The first is the launching area, about 6m long, where the player takes a run to launch the ball. The ball weighs 5–7 kg and has finger and hand-holes. It the travels down a shallow groove about 8m long, the \"oholtzarra\" (\"cureño\" or \"tablón\" in Spanish). At the far end three light pins, weighing about 100g each (the lightest of all pins used in Basque bowling games) which are set in holes in the ground, one behind the other. Both the \"oholtzarra\" and the pin area are kept wet in this game to minimise friction. Not far behind the pins is a barrier (called \"paraboloa\") to stop the ball but behind the barrier the actually target area lies, the \"marren zelaia\" \"field of lines\" (\"campo de rayas\" in Spanish), 20m wide and 40m long. The lines are parallel to each other and at a distance of 5m and important for scoring.\n\nThe basic aim of the game is to hit the pins with enough force to propel them over the barrier and as far into the field as possible. Skill is needed to keep the ball in the groove and hit the pins head on, otherwise they tend to go sideways rather than forward. If a pin lands in the area up to the first line, it is worth 10 points and each additional line another 10 so the maximum score per bowl is 210 points if all land past the 6th line. In a game each player has eight balls and the highest scorer wins.\n\n\"Olazabalgo bolo jokoa\", the game from Olazabal, a borough of the town of Dima. The game also known as \"Olazabalgo zazpi boloen jokoa\" (called \"juego de siete bolos de Olazabal\" in Spanish) - \"the seven pin game from Olazabal\". There is only one known \"bolatoki\" for this variant. The rules and setup resembles those of \"munadun erremontea\" somewhat and it geographically played within the same area, suggesting it may well be a variant that developed from \"munadun erremontea\".\n\nThis dirt \"bolatoki\" is outdoors, set under trees in a park. The balls used have finger and hand-holes and usually weigh 5–6 kg. There are only six large pins (36 cm tall) and a small \"txirlo\" (26 cm tall). The playing area is rectangular, about 20m long and 4m wide. The main characteristic of the playing area is that the middle part has both an \"erdiko muna\" (central \"muna\") and sloping sides, effectively creating two parallel wide channels. The pins are set in a slightly diagonal line in groups of three, one at the other end of each \"channel\", the small \"txirlo\" sits in between them but there is no special platform for them as in other varieties. At the player's end there are two launching platforms, one in front of either channel.\n\nTo score, a player has to launch a ball onto the launching platform down either channel. For the throw to be valid, it also has to travel onto the \"muna\" or the left or right slope. It then knocks down pins (who in turn may knock down other pins) but also has to hit the barrier at the far end or a \"txorra\" is declared and the throw is invalid. All pins are worth only one point each.\n\nIn theory it is possible to score more than 4 points but this has not happened in living memory.\n\nThis variant is originally from the Merindades, in the north of Spain but nowadays is played in Burgos, the Basque Country, Madrid, Alicante and in some South America.\n\nThe bowling alley is divided into three differente areas: The launching area, pin area and \"Birle\" area. The bowling balls have finger and hand-holes, are 26–28 cm in diameter and usually weight between 6 and 8 kg. There are three boards (\"tablones\" or \"cureñas\") and three pins on each one, there is a small pin which is situated outside of the boards and is the most important one.\nThe game starts the bowling ball being thrown from the launchig area (\"cas\") through the air, trying to bring down as many pins as possible and the small pin (the \"mico\"). The first bounce of the bowling ball must be on the board, otherwise it will be discounted (a \"morra\"). Scoring is as follows: each pin knocked down is worth one point, the middle pin knocked over on its own is worth two points, and knocking over the small pin is worth four points, only if another pin has been knocked down.\n\nThis three pin game is also called \"Berrizko hiru txirlo\" or \"hiru txirlo de Berriz\" in Spanish.\n\nMost \"bolatoki\" for this variant are in the area around Berriz in Biscay, most notably the one attached to the small church (a type called baseliza in Basque) of San Lorenzo of Mendibil.\n\nThe playing area is about 18-20m long and 1.5-2.5m wide and consists of a slightly sunk dirt (or sand) area which uses the slope and (in most cases) a church wall as a border on one side. The wooden balls weight about 2 kg and there are only three 21 cm tall pins. These are arranged in a line, one behind each other, very close to the wall.\n\nThe main characteristic of this game is a triangular barrier called \"motie\" which prevents players from bowling directly at the pins. Instead, players launch the ball onto a launching platform, aiming for the incline opposite the wall and the pins, with the intentions of letting the ball curve around and hit the pins from the side.\n\nEach player bowls two balls and the pins are worth one point each but pins knocked over by balls rebounding off the back panel do not count.\n\nThis variant is called \"Zeanuriko bola jokoa' in Basque and \"juego de Zeanuri\" in Spanish and played around the area of Zeanuri in Biscay only.\n\nFour \"bolatoki\" for this variant remain, 19-26m in length and 2.5-3.5m in width with a launching platform at the player's end and an end panel at the far end called \"zubile\". Roughly half way down the playing are there is a small stake on the left slope called \"katxine\". There are four pins, three large ones (41 cm tall) and a small one (25 cm tall), arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle with the point towards the player, the three large pins on the side going off to the right and the small pin at the far left corner. All pins are worth one point each. The balls for this game have finger and hand-holes and weigh 7 kg.\n\nThere are different ways of playing this game. Players either place an amount of money before the game called the \"arrapea\" and then get to bowl three balls (if played in teams, then there are three balls per team). In the other version, the \"arrapea\" is placed and each player or team has six balls but only the best throw is counted.\n\nPlayers launch their balls onto the launching platform and most come off the left slope before hitting any pins but if the \"katxine\" is hit, the throw is invalid. Pins knocked over by a rebounding ball do not count but the ball must hit the \"zubile\" otherwise a \"txorra\" is declared and the throw is invalid. Scoring works as follows for valid balls:\n\nThe earliest historical records which mention \"bola jokoak\" are almost all records of writers complaining about the game as a sign of moral decay or administrative records of forbidding the play of such games on the streets. A law from Santander dating back to 1627 for example penalised the playing of bowls on the streets of the city, as did the council of Ulibarri-Jauregi 1632.\n\nProbably the first document to give us a limited insight into the actual gameplay comes from the 1726 dictionary of the \"Real Academia de la Lengua Española\" which gives a very brief outline of a game very similar to \"bolo palma\".\n\nUp until the end of the 19th century most neighbourhoods would have a playing area where the locals would play and bet the payment of their drinks (often txakoli or cider) on their bowling skills. Due to the suspicion of the Catholic church and the nobility such activities, many bowling courts were historically located near churches.\n\nThe first over-regional competition was organised by the council of Gasteiz in 1949 with players from all over Álava competing for 3 prizes of 500 pesetas and a trophy. Competitions at all levels have been held in various places since.\n\n\n\n"}

According to \"Utne Reader\", a bioneer is \"a biological pioneer, an ecological inventor who's got an elegant and often simple set of solutions for environmental conundrums.\" As coined by Ausubel, the term describes individuals and groups working in diverse disciplines who have crafted creative solutions to various environmental and socio-cultural problems rooted in shared core values, including whole systems, (anticipatory) thinking, a view of all life as interdependent, and sustainable mutual aid.\n\nThe greatest use of the term since its coinage has been in relation to the annual Bioneers conference founded by Ausubel and his wife Nina Simons and held annually in San Rafael, California, and its participants. However, in recent years the term or derivations has seen increasing use independent of the Bioneers organization, suggesting an increasing acceptance of the term in popular usage. For example, a 2005 article on the use and manufacture of biodiesel fuels in northern California was titled \"Bioneering Biodiesel.\" An April 2007 symposium and art exhibition at University of California, Irvine focused on food production, consumption, and distribution was called \"Bioneering: Hybrid Investigations of Food.\"\n\n\"Bioneer\" and its derivations have also been used in relationship to biotechnology. This usage of the term appears to come from independent coinages based on a portmanteau of \"biotechnology\" and \"engineering\" and/or \"pioneering\". The Cambridge, Massachusetts drug-screening company Bioneering Technologies describes itself as being focused on \"the fusion between biotechnology, engineering, and pioneering services (hence, Bioneering).\" Students in the Bachelor of Biotechnology Innovation program at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia called themselves \"bioneers\" \"as they regard themselves as pioneering a new era in biotechnology.\" The Korea-based international biotechnology firm Korea Biotech, Inc., founded in 1992, changed its name in 1996 to Bioneer Corporation.\nBioneer is also a term adopted by those who visit the Biomatrix website for self-improvement. This site and forum advocated the use of bodybuilding, training and technology to improve not only one's muscles (as would a bodybuilder) but also your other physical attributes such as speed, agility and intelligence.\n\nWhile Ausubel's coinage does not specifically refer to biotechnology, the second coinage of \"bioneer\" referring to biotechnology is clearly antithetical to the term as understood by Ausubel and those influenced by him and the Bioneers organization. In the book \"Nature's Operating Instructions: The True Biotechnologies\" (coedited with J. P. Harpignies), Ausubel has made a clear distinction between corporate biotech, including genetic engineering, which he decries, and what he has termed \"true biotechnologies\" based on biomimicry, natural design, and the restoration of natural capital.\n"}

{"id": "933649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=933649", "title": "Crimean Tatars", "text": "Crimean Tatars\n\nCrimean Tatars or Crimeans (Crimean Tatar: ; ; ; ) are a Turkic ethnic group that formed in the Crimean Peninsula during the 13th–17th centuries, primarily from Islamic Turkic tribes from the Asian steppes that invaded the Greek-settled land now known as Crimea, in Eastern Europe, beginning in the 10th century, with contributions from the pre-Cuman population of Crimea. Since 2014 the Crimean Tatars have been officially recognized as an indigenous people of Ukraine. The Crimean Tatars are also listed among the indigenous peoples of Russia.\n\nCrimean Tatars constituted the majority of Crimea's population from the time of its ethnogenesis until the mid-19th century, and the relative largest ethnic population until the end of the 19th century. Almost immediately after the retaking of Crimea from Axis forces, in May 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee ordered the removal of all of the Tatar population from Crimea, including the families of Crimean Tatars serving in the Soviet Army – in trains and boxcars to Central Asia, primarily to Uzbekistan. Starting in 1967, some were allowed to return to Crimea, and in 1989 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union condemned the removal of Crimean Tatars from their motherland as inhumane and lawless. Today, Crimean Tatars constitute approximately 12% of the population of Crimea. There remains a large diaspora of Crimean Tatars in Turkey and Uzbekistan.\n\nIn the latest Ukrainian census, 248,200 Ukrainian citizens identified themselves as Crimean Tatars with 98% (or about 243,400) of them living in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. An additional 1,800 citizens (or about 0.7% of those that identified themselves as Crimean Tatars) live in the city of Sevastopol, also on the Crimean peninsula, but outside the border of the autonomous republic.\n\nAbout 150,000 remain in exile in Central Asia, mainly in Uzbekistan. The official number of Crimean Tatars in Turkey is 150,000 with some Crimean Tatar activists estimating a figure as high as 6 million. The activists reached this number by taking one million Tatar immigrants to Turkey as a starting point and multiplying this number by the birth rate in the span of the last hundred years. Crimean Tatars in Turkey mostly live in Eskişehir Province, descendants of those who emigrated in the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. In the Dobruja region straddling Romania and Bulgaria, there are more than 27,000 Crimean Tatars: 24,000 on the Romanian side, and 3,000 on the Bulgarian side.\n\nThe Crimean Tatars are subdivided into three (or sometimes four) sub-ethnic groups:\n\n\nHistorians suggest that inhabitants of the mountainous parts of Crimea lying to the central and southern parts (the Tats), and those of the Southern coast of Crimea (the Yalıboyu) were the direct descendants of the Pontic Greeks, Armenians, Scythians, Ostrogoths (Crimean Goths) and Kipchaks along with the Cumans while the latest inhabitants of the northern steppe represent the descendants of the Nogai Horde of the Black Sea nominally subjects of the Crimean Khan. It is largely assumed that the Tatarization process that mostly took place in the 16th century brought a sense of cultural unity through the blending of the Greeks, Armenians, Italians and Ottoman Turks of the southern coast, Goths of the central mountains, and Turkic-speaking Kipchaks and Cumans of the steppe and forming of the Crimean Tatar ethnic group. However, the Cuman language is considered the direct ancestor of the current language of the Crimean Tatars with possible incorporations of the other languages like Crimean Gothic.\n\nAnother theory suggests Crimean Tatars trace their origins to the waves of ancient people, Scythians, Greeks, Goths, Italians and Armenians. When the Golden Horde invaded Crimea in the 1230s, they then mixed with populations which had settled in Eastern Europe, including Crimea since the seventh century: Tatars, but also Mongols and other Turkic groups (Khazars, Pechenegs, Cumans, and Kipchaks), as well as the ancient.\n\nThe Mongol conquest of the Kipchaks led to a merged society with the Mongol ruling class over a Kipchak speaking population which came to be known as Tatar and which eventually absorbed other ethnicities on the Crimean peninsula like Armenians, Italians, Greeks, and Goths to form the modern day Crimean Tatar people- up to the Soviet deportation, the Crimean Tatars could still differentiate among themselves between Tatar Kipchak Nogays and the \"Tat\" descendants of Tatarized Goths and other Turkified peoples.\n\nGoths, Gypsies, and Greeks were assumed to be some of the ancestors of the Tatars on the coast of Crimea, while there were \"mixed hill Tatars\" and finally \"Asiatic\" steppe Tatars. Italians and Greeks mixed with the coastal Crimean Tatars.\n\nToday, Crimean Tatars are often considered as the indigenous peoples of the Crimean peninsula.\n\nCrimea has experienced many migratory and conquering races in its history. The Turkic Kipchaks had followed the Goths, Huns, Sarmatians and Scythians in Crimea. The Mongols who invaded the Russian principalities under Batu Khan, conducted the Kipchaks of south Ukrainain plains into their forces in 1240s. This amalgam of Mongols and Kipchkaks which gradually converted to Islam became known as \"Tatars\". The Tatars of Crimea and the neighboring steppes continued their domination even with the decline of Mongol rule in 1300s. The liberation of Russia from the Golden Horde in 1480 too couldn't end their power and by this time the Tatar Giray dynasty had already established an independent khanate in Crimea and neighboring territory.\n\nThe Crimean Tatars emerged as a nation at the time of the Crimean Khanate, an Ottoman vassal state during the 15th to 18th centuries and one of the great centers of slave trade to the Ottoman Empire. The Turkic-speaking population of Crimea had mostly adopted Islam already in the 14th century, following the conversion of Ozbeg Khan of the Golden Horde. By the time of the first Russian invasion of Crimea in 1736, the Khan's archives and libraries were famous throughout the Islamic world, and under Khan Krym-Girei the city of Simferopol was endowed with piped water, sewerage and a theatre where Molière was performed in French, while the port of Gözleve stood comparison with Rotterdam and Bakhchysarai, the capital, was described as Europe's cleanest and greenest city.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 18th century, Crimean Tatars were known for frequent, at some periods almost annual, devastating raids into Ukraine and Russia. For a long time, until the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East which was the most important basis of its economy. One of the most important trading ports and slave markets was Kefe. Slaves and freedmen formed approximately 75% of the Crimean population.\n\nSome researchers estimate that altogether up to 3 million people were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate. In retaliation, the lands of Crimean Tatars were being raided by Zaporozhian Cossacks, armed Ukrainian horsemen, who defended the steppe frontier – Wild Fields – against Tatar slave raids and often attacked and plundered the lands of Ottoman Turks and Crimean Tatars. The Don Cossacks and Kalmyk Mongols also managed to raid Crimean Tatars' land. The last recorded major Crimean raid, before those in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) took place during the reign of Peter the Great (1682–1725). However, Cossack raids continued after that time; Ottoman Grand Vizier complained to the Russian consul about raids to Crimea and Özi in 1761. In 1769 one last major Tatar raid, which took place during the Russo-Turkish War, saw the capture of 20,000 slaves.\n\nThe Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, Russia violated the treaty and annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783. After the annexation, the wealthier Tatars, who had exported wheat, meat, fish and wine to other parts of the Black Sea, began to be expelled and to move to the Ottoman Empire. Further expulsions followed in 1812 for fear of the reliability of the Tatars in the face of Napoleon's advance. Particularly, the Crimean War of 1853–1856, the laws of 1860–63, the Tsarist policy and the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) caused an exodus of the Tatars; 12,000 boarded Allied ships in Sevastopol to escape the destruction of shelling, and were branded traitors by the Russian government. Of total Tatar population 300,000 of the Taurida Governorate about 200,000 Crimean Tatars emigrated. Many Crimean Tatars perished in the process of emigration, including those who drowned while crossing the Black Sea. Today the descendants of these Crimeans form the Crimean Tatar diaspora in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.\n\nIsmail Gasprali (1851–1914) was a renowned Crimean Tatar intellectual, influenced by the nationalist movements of the period, whose efforts laid the foundation for the modernization of Muslim culture and the emergence of the Crimean Tatar national identity. The bilingual Crimean Tatar-Russian newspaper \"Terciman-Perevodchik\" he published in 1883–1914, functioned as an educational tool through which a national consciousness and modern thinking emerged among the entire Turkic-speaking population of the Russian Empire. His New Method (Jadid) schools, numbering 350 across the peninsula, helped create a new Crimean Tatar elite. \nThe educated \"Crimean Tatars\" during this period refused the appellation of \"Tatars\" given to them by the Turks (which however in earlier times had also been used natively). They wished to be known simply as \"Turks\", and their language as \"Turkish\" (the Crimean Tatar language had indeed been substantially influenced by Ottoman Turkish).\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917 this new elite, which included Noman Çelebicihan and Cafer Seydamet proclaimed the first democratic republic in the Islamic world, named the Crimean People's Republic on 26 December 1917. However, this republic was short-lived and abolished by the Bolshevik uprising in January 1918.\n\nSoviet policies on the peninsula led to widespread starvation in 1921. More than 100,000 Tatars, Russians, Ukrainians and other inhabitants of the peninsula starved to death, and tens of thousands of Tatars fled to Turkey or Romania. Thousands more were deported or killed during the collectivization in 1928–29.\nThe Soviet government's \"collectivization\" policies led to a major nationwide famine in 1931–33. During Stalin's Great Purge, statesmen and intellectuals such as Veli Ibraimov and Bekir Çoban-zade (1893–1937), were imprisoned or executed on various charges.\n\nIn May 1944, the entire Crimean Tatar population of Crimea was exiled to Central Asia, mainly to Uzbekistan, on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Chairman of the USSR State Defense Committee. Although a great number of Crimean Tatar men served in the Red Army and took part in the partisan movement in Crimea during the war, the existence of the Tatar Legion in the Nazi army and the collaboration of Crimean Tatar religious and political leaders with Hitler during the German occupation of Crimea provided the Soviet leadership with justification for accusing the entire Crimean Tatar population of being Nazi collaborators. In actuality, much of this is Soviet revisionism as the persecution of \"suspect nations\" and most of the genocide of the Crimean Tatars preceded the war, while statements justifying it appear after the war – as the threat of war heightened Stalin’s perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical “fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.” (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003). Tatar historian Alan Fisher has said that between 1917 and 1933, 150,000 Tatars—about 50% of the population at the time—either were killed or forced out of Crimea. According to Yitzhak Arad, \"In January 1942 a company of Tatar volunteers was established in Simferopol under the command of \"Einsatzgruppe 11\". This company participated in anti-Jewish manhunts and murder actions in the rural regions.\"\n\nSome modern researchers argue that Crimea's geopolitical position fueled Soviet perceptions of Crimean Tatars as a potential threat. This belief is based in part on an analogy with numerous other cases of deportations of non-Russians from boundary territories, as well as the fact that other non-Russian populations, such as Greeks, Armenians and Bulgarians were also removed from Crimea.\n\nAll 240,000 Crimean Tatars were deported \"en masse\", in a form of collective punishment, on 17–18 May 1944 as \"special settlers\" to the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and other distant parts of the Soviet Union. This event is called Sürgün in the Crimean Tatar language; the few who escaped were shot on sight or drowned in scuttled barges, and within months half their number had died of cold, hunger, exhaustion and disease. Many of them were re-located to toil as forced labourers in the Soviet GULAG system.\n\nAlthough a 1967 Soviet decree removed the charges against Crimean Tatars, the Soviet government did nothing to facilitate their resettlement in Crimea and to make reparations for lost lives and confiscated property. Crimean Tatars, having a definite tradition of non-communist political dissent, succeeded in creating a truly independent network of activists, values and political experience. Crimean Tatars, led by the Crimean Tatar National Movement Organization, were not allowed to return to Crimea from exile until the beginning of the Perestroika in the mid-1980s.\n\nToday, more than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to their homeland, struggling to re-establish their lives and reclaim their national and cultural rights against many social and economic obstacles. In 1991, the Crimean Tatar leadership founded the Kurultai, or Parliament, to act as a representative body for the Crimean Tatars which could address grievances to the Ukrainian central government, the Crimean government, and international bodies. Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People is the executive body of the Kurultai.\n\nSince the 1990s till October 2013, the political leader of the Crimean Tatars and the chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People was former Soviet dissident Mustafa Abdülcemil Qırımoğlu. Since October 2013 the chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People is Refat Chubarov.\n\nFollowing the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, Russian authorities declared the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People to be an extremist organization, and banned it in 26 April 2016.\n\nFollowing news of Crimea's independence referendum organized with the help of Russia on 16 March 2014, the Kurultai leadership voiced concerns of renewed persecution, as commented by a U.S. official before the visit of a UN human rights team to the peninsula. At the same time, Rustam Minnikhanov, the president of Tatarstan was dispatched to Crimea to quell Crimean Tatars' concerns and to point out that \"in the 23 years of Ukraine's independence the Ukrainian leaders have been using Crimean Tatars as pawns in their political games without doing them any tangible favors\". The issue of Crimean Tatar persecution by Russia has since been raised regularly on an international level.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the day Crimea was annexed by Russia, and Crimean Tatar was declared one of the three official languages of Crimea. It was also announced that Crimean Tatars will be required to relinquish coastal lands on which they squatted since their return to Crimea in early 1990s and be given land elsewhere in Crimea. Crimea stated it needed the relinquished land for \"social purposes\", since part of this land is occupied by the Crimean Tatars without legal documents of ownership. The situation was caused by the inability of the USSR (and later Ukraine) to give back to the Tatars the land owned before deportation, once they or their descendants returned from Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan). As a consequence, Crimean Tatars settled as squatters, occupying land that was and is still not legally registered.\n\nSome Crimean Tatars fled to Mainland Ukraine due to the Crimean crisis - reportedly around 2000 by 23 March. \nOn 29 March 2014, an emergency meeting of the Crimean Tatars representative body, the Kurultai, voted in favor of seeking \"ethnic and territorial autonomy\" for Crimean Tatars using \"political and legal\" means. The meeting was attended by the Head of the Republic of Tatarstan and the chair of the Russian Council of Muftis. Decisions as to whether the Tatars will accept Russian passports or whether the autonomy sought would be within the Russian or Ukrainian state have been deferred pending further discussion.\n\nThe Mejlis works in emergency mode in Kiev.\n\nDuring occupation of Crimea by Russian Federation, Crimean Tatars are reportedly persecuted and driscriminated by Russian authorities, including cases of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances by Russian security forces and courts.\n\nOn June 12 2018, Ukraine lodged a memorandum consisting of 17,500 pages of text in 29 volumes to the UN's International Court of Justice about racial discrimination against Crimean Tatars by Russian authorities in occupied Crimea and state financing of terrorism by Russian Federation in Donbass.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of universities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in the third world and in countries with a colonial history, such as the UK, where development studies originated. Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the United Nations, World Bank, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), private sector development consultancy firms, corporate social responsibility (CSR) bodies and research centers.\n\nThroughout the world, a number of professional bodies for development studies have been founded:\n\nThe common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA). In the UK and Ireland, the Development Studies Association is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research.\n\nDevelopment issues include:\n\nThe emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the third world after decolonisation. In the immediate post-war period, development economics, a branch of economics, arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision. Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of politics and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject, encompassing a variety of social scientific fields. In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the inauguration speech of Harry S. Truman in 1949. In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said:\n\nMore than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people.\n\nBut development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries. More recently, the emergency of human security – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing precognitions of a relationship between security and development. Humans security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1098673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1098673", "title": "Elizabeth Montagu", "text": "Elizabeth Montagu\n\nElizabeth Montagu (2 October 1718 – 25 August 1800) was a British social reformer, patron of the arts, salonist, literary critic, and writer who helped organize and lead the Blue Stockings Society. Her parents were both from wealthy families with strong ties to the British peerage and intellectual life. She was sister to Sarah Scott, author of \"A Description of Millenium Hall and the Country Adjacent\". She married Edward Montagu, a man with extensive holdings, to become one of the richer women of her era. She devoted this fortune to fostering English and Scottish literature and to the relief of the poor.\n\nShe was born in Yorkshire to Matthew Robinson (1694–1778), of West Layton and Edgeley in Yorkshire, and Elizabeth daughter of Robert Drake, of Cambridge, by his wife Sarah Morris, daughter of Thomas Morris of Mount Morris, Monks Horton. Elizabeth was the eldest of their three daughters. Conyers Middleton, the prominent Cambridge don, was the second husband of her Drake grandmother Sarah Morris. Between 1720 and 1736 the family owned part of what is now National Trust property, Treasurer's House, in York. Elizabeth and her sister Sarah, the future novelist Sarah Scott, spent time as children on extended stays with Dr Middleton, as both parents were somewhat aloof. The two girls learned Latin, French, and Italian and studied literature. As a child, Elizabeth and Sarah, in particular, were very close, but grew apart after Sarah became sick with smallpox.\n\nWhile young, Elizabeth became a friend of Lady Margaret Harley, later the Duchess of Portland, the only surviving child of Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. Lady Margaret and Elizabeth corresponded weekly when apart and were inseparable when together. She spent time with Lady Margaret in London and met many of the celebrated figures of the 1730s, including the poet Edward Young and the religious thinker Gilbert West. In Lady Margaret's household, men and women spoke as equals and engaged in witty, learned banter. Mrs. Montagu later used this model of intellectual discourse in her salons. Visits to Lady Margaret became more important to Elizabeth when her mother inherited a country seat in Kent and made that her home, with the daughters.\n\nIn 1738, Montagu wrote to Harley explaining that she had no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not suppose it possible to love a man. In 1742 she married Edward Montagu, grandson of the Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in Northumberland. She was twenty-two and he was fifty years old. The marriage was advantageous, but it was apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, and she loved her child immensely. When he died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to consider religion more and more. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was growing increasingly devout.\n\nElizabeth kept a female companion with her most of the time. This person was not exactly a servant, but she would act in that role. She would be expected to carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott was in this function and says that there is good reason to suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper/possibly mistress, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.\n\nBeginning in 1750, she and Edward established a routine where they would winter in London in Mayfair and then, in the spring, go to Sandleford in Berkshire, which had been his since 1730. He would then go on to Northumberland and Yorkshire to manage his holdings, while she would occasionally accompany him to the family manor-house at East Denton Hall, a clean-lined mansion of 1622 on the West Road in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nShe was a shrewd businesswoman, despite affecting to patronise Northumbrian society for its practical conversation. Though acting as Lady Bountiful to her miners and their families, she was pleased at how cheap this could be. She was also glad to note that: \"Our pitmen are afraid of being turned off and that fear keeps an order and regularity amongst them that is very uncommon.\" Elizabeth enjoyed hearing the miners singing in the pit, but found, alas, that their dialect was \"dreadful to the auditors' nerves.\"\n\nHorace Walpole wrote to George Montagu in 1768: 'Our best sun is Newcastle coal.'\n\nIn London, Elizabeth began to be a celebrated hostess. She organized literary breakfasts with Gilbert West, George Lyttelton, and others. By 1760, these had turned to evening entertainments with large assemblies. Card playing and strong drink were forbidden from these convocations, which were now known as blue stocking events.\n\nBy 1770, her home on Hill Street had become the premiere salon in London. Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, and Horace Walpole were all in the circle. For writers, being introduced there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, Frances Burney, Anna Barbauld, Sarah Fielding, Hester Chapone, James Beattie, and Anna Williams. Samuel Johnson's hostess, Hester Thrale, was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician Messenger Monsey. Among the blue stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, but she was the woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse, and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of Samuel Richardson, both Fieldings (Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding), and Fanny Burney, and she was pleased to discover that Laurence Sterne was a distant relation. She was related to Laurence Sterne through the Botham family. Sterne entrusted her with the disposition of his papers upon his departure for France. He was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of Bishop Percy's \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.\"\n\nShe also held similar events at her residence in the centre house (#16) of the Royal Crescent, Bath.\n\nElizabeth was a bluestocking. Called the \"Queen of the Blues\", Elizabeth Montagu led and hosted the Blue Stockings Society of England from about 1750. It was a loose organization of privileged women with an interest in education, but it waned in popularity at the end of the 18th century. It gathered to discuss literature, and also invited educated men to participate. Talk of politics was prohibited; literature and the arts were the main subjects. Many of the bluestocking women supported each other in intellectual endeavors such as reading, art work, and writing. Many also published literature.\n\nElizabeth Montagu published two works in her lifetime. George Lyttleton in 1760 encouraged Elizabeth to write \"Dialogues of the Dead\", and she contributed three sections to the work anonymously. (Her authorship is testified elsewhere.) It consists of a series of conversations between the living and the illustrious dead, and works as a satire of 18th century vanity and manners. In 1769, she published \"An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespear\". In it, she proclaims Shakespeare to be the greatest English poet, and in fact the greatest poet of any nation. She also attacks Samuel Johnson's \"Preface to Shakespeare\" from 1765 for not having gone on to praise Shakespeare's plays enough. While Johnson had dealt with text, history, and the circumstances of editing, Montagu wrote instead about the characters, plots, and beauties of the verse in Shakespeare and saw in him a championing of all things inherently English. When the book was initially published anonymously, it was thought to be by Joseph Warton, but by 1777 her name appeared on the title page. Johnson, for his part, was estranged from Montagu at this point.\n\nIn the late 1760s, Edward Montagu fell ill, and Elizabeth took care of him, although she resented giving up her freedom. He died in 1775. In 1776, she adopted her nephew, the orphan of her brother. Matthew Robinson, the child, kept his family name, but he was named Elizabeth's heir. At that point, the coal and landholdings Montagu passed on to Elizabeth accounted for an income of £7,000 a year. She managed her wealth and estates well, and by her death her coal income was worth 10,000 pounds a year.\n\nIn 1777, she began work on Montagu House in Portman Square in London, moving in in 1781, on land leased for 99 years. She also expanded Sandleford Priory in the 1780s, and had Capability Brown design its garden and alter the park. She died in Montagu House in London on 25 August 1800 and left Sandleford and all of her money to Matthew Robinson, her nephew.\n\nElizabeth Montagu is author of two works published in her lifetime: three sections in George Lyttleton's \"Dialogues of the Dead\" (1760) and \"An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare\" (1769). In addition, two collections of Montagu's letter were published posthumously.\n\n\"Dialogues of the Dead\" was a series of critiques about eighteenth century society. In Dialogue 26, Montagu uses Hercules to engage in a discussion of virtue. In Dialogue 27, a character, Mrs. Mopish, cannot go the Elysian Fields because she is endlessly distracted by worldly influences. In Dialogue 28, a bookseller explains to Plutarch the difficulties of publishing in modern society.\n\n\"An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare\" defends Shakespeare against criticism by supporters of the French style of drama, particularly against the attacks of Voltaire. In \"Essay\" Montagu claims Shakespeare's success comes from his overall virtue and ability to engaging the audiences' emotion, not from strict adherence to the classical models of drama.\n\nMontagu was a copious writer of familial letters to her coterie and beyond. Her letters include discussions of health, domestic arraignments, travel plans, and reports of social events. About one-third of her correspondence focused on culture such as theater, opera, public spectacles, moral philosophy, and divinity. Of these topics, history was discussed more than twice as much as any other topic.\n\nHer most frequent correspondence on literature was with her sister, Sarah Scott, followed by her friends, Elizabeth Carter and Gilbert West. She and Scott were both avid readers of published letters throughout their lives, reading collections by Pope and Swift. This influenced the women's own letter writing. Their frequency of correspondence waxed and waned over the years depending on the circumstances of their lives; Montagu is recorded to have written Scott more frequently.\n\nSimilarly, Montagu is noted to have sent more letters to Elizabeth Carter than to have received them. Montagu was an ardent supporter of Carter despite her friend being of a lower class; Montagu respected Carter's skill and virtue. Montague felt comfortable enough to correspond with Carter about the responsibility of great wealth.\n\nGilbert West influenced Montagu's thinking about religion, history, and literature. He also affected her style of writing for a time. Based on his example, she began writing in a more formal syntax, but she eventually became irritated with the restrictions and reverted to her freer, more natural style.\n\nMontagu corresponded with George Lyttelton frequently about literature and history, a relationship which would later lead to Lyttleton including three of her works in his \"Dialogues of the Dead\". Their letters were known to have markedly different tones: hers were serious and intellectual, his responses tended toward flirtatious.\n\nMontagu maintained a close relationship with the elder statesman, William Pulteney, Lord Bath. Their relationship was purely emotional but described as a \"pseudo-courtship\".\n\nLady Margaret Harley was a lifelong friend of Montagu's. It was Lady Harley to whom Montagu vented her frustrations over the institution of marriage and her desire for a truly companionate marriage — if she must have one at all. Montagu also expressed to Lady Margaret that marriage should include financial incentive.\n\nA collection of Montagu's letters were first published 1809 by her nephew and heir, Matthew Montagu, under the title, \"The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, with Some of the Letters of her Correspondents.\" The selection of letters reflect a concern for Montagu's moral reputation. Another edition of her letters was released in 1906 by Matthew's granddaughter, Emily J. Climenson, and her friend, Reginald Blunt. This revised collection expanded on Montagu's view of the social world including fashion, politics, and nobility.\n\n\n"}

The organisation was acquired by the diversified financial group Macquarie Group Limited in 2017, creating one of Europe’s largest teams of dedicated green infrastructure investors, and now operates under the name Green Investment Group. It is structured as a public limited company and is owned by the Macquarie Group. It has offices in London and Edinburgh.\n\nAs a result of the Climate Change Act 2008, the United Kingdom became legally committed to significantly reducing its carbon emissions by 2050. More importantly, the Act committed the UK to generating a significantly higher percentage of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.\n\nA non-partisan, House of Commons committee on climate change was established to study and recommend ways of meeting the country's obligations. The committee reported that for a new, low-carbon business and government infrastructure to be established, the necessary investment would range between £200 billion and £1 trillion over the next two decades.\n\nThe committee further stated that since traditional sources of capital for investment in green infrastructure could not provide even half that amount by 2025, there would be a funding gap that needed to be covered by the state budget.\n\nIn 2009, two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects. The first, entitled \"Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank\" was published in March 2009 by Climate Change Capital and E3G. The second, entitled \"Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain\" was published by Policy Exchange in September 2009 and was written by Dieter Helm, James Wardlaw and Ben Caldecott. These proposals were then contained in the manifestos of each of the main political parties for the 2010 UK General Election.\n\nThe Fiscal year 2010 British government budget contained the first mention of a \"green investment bank\" scheme, earmarked with £2 billion. Chancellor Alistair Darling stated that the Labour government was committed \"to support offshore wind energy\" and other forms of alternative energy, which he also billed as \"crucial to guiding the country out of recession\".\n\nAfter the 2010 general election, the newly formed Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government defined its primary economic objective to be the drastic reduction of Britain's debt and yearly deficits. Accordingly, the government sought to create a financing scheme for the environmental investment needs of the country that would be funded mainly by the private sector, including the banks.\n\nIn June 2010 the Green Investment Bank Commission, established by George Osborne in opposition, after holding hearings recommended that the government created an eponymous banking entity within the year. Chancellor George Osborne remained sceptical after objections to the creation of such a bank were raised by the Treasury, since a Green Investment Bank would \"swell the state deficit\" as it would appear as a liability on the government's balance sheet.\n\nThe UK government's Spending Review of October 2010 that announced a raft of austerity measures to deal with the UK government deficit, also included an announcement about the creation of a Green Investment Bank. The government expected to obtain by early 2013 the European Commission's approval for state aid to the Bank, with investment in green projects estimated to begin by April 2012.\n\nThe plans for the environmental funding scheme were endorsed by Greenpeace, whose executive director urged the prime minister to \"get personally involved\", as well as by a number of similar organisations, such as Transform UK, whose director stated that \"the only cost the Treasury should consider is the cost of failure to unleash this institution's massive potential to re-power our economy.\" Environmentalists engaged in public demonstrations demanding a quicker implementation of the plans.\n\nHowever, non-government organisations and environmentalists criticised the scheme because it lacked ambition. The World Development Movement disputed that such a small scheme will attract the kind of investment needed to \"generate green jobs, green industry and a green economy in the UK\". An economic study commissioned by WDM and Platform recommended that, instead of creating a new \"banking scheme\", the government should \"transform the [already] owned Royal Bank of Scotland into a powerful green investment bank\", in the process also \"creating 50,000 green jobs\".\n\nIn May 2011, a former adviser to the government, Jonathon Porritt, who had been head of the Sustainable Development Commission, publicly criticised the Coalition's scrapping of a planned rise in aviation tax, its watering down of schemes that promote small-scale renewable electricity and its failure to promote a \"green investment bank\" with immediate borrowing powers. Mr Porritt claimed he examined 75 policies on which the government had committed itself, finding little or no progress in 55. The government responded that it remains \"committed to the environment\", but claimed that the economic recession had affected environmental policies.\n\nThe leader of the Green Party of England and Wales (and MP for Brighton Pavilion) Caroline Lucas, criticised the nomenclature of the GIB in January 2011, when she wrote that \"It's a bit rich to call [the GIB] a green investment bank if it can neither borrow nor lend\". Lucas argued that without these powers, \"it would be a fund – that is, a pot of money that, once used up, is gone forever.\".\n\nCriticism also centred on the location of the institution. Bloomberg claimed that \"Most of the 50- 70 jobs will initially be in London...\" and some questioned that the decision to locate many jobs in London, despite the announcement headline of Edinburgh being chosen as winner of the location contest, pointed to a \"bid to defuse Scottish independence... a blatant move to unite the capitals over Alex Salmond's key policy.\"\n\nOn 23 May 2011, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at a speech at Climate Change Capital stated that the Green Investment Bank \"will begin operating in April 2012\", adding that the bank's early targets would be \"offshore wind, waste and non-domestic energy efficiency\". Clegg added that legislation would \"ensure the independence of the institution.\"\n\nOn 24 May 2011, Business Secretary Vince Cable, in addressing the parliament, stated that the bank will become \"a key component\" of the transition to a \"low-carbon economy\", which will need \"significant investment over the coming decades.\" Cable also stated that the GIB will have an initial capitalisation of £3 billion, which \"the Government believes will leverage a further £15 billion of private investment\".\n\nThe same day, BIS, in a press release containing answers to \"frequently asked questions\" about the bank, outlined the planned finances of the GIB and its activation in \"three phases\":\n\nDr Cable unveiled on the same day his department's statement of vision for the bank. The document was cautiously positive about the prospects of private investment in the environment, in the UK.\n\nBIS appeared to indicate on 12 December 2011 that the 'Incubation' phase had progressed, with the announcement of a new team within the department: \"UK Green Investments\" (UKGI). It stated the team's role was to \"drive investment in the UK’s green infrastructure until the Green Investment Bank is formally established\". Initially the UKGI team consisted of six members: five men and one woman.\n\nState aid approval for the bank was granted by the EU Commission on 17 October 2012, allowing the bank to become fully established. The bank was subsequently formally launched in Edinburgh by Vince Cable on 28 November 2012.\n\nOn 25 May 2011, Vince Cable informed the House of Commons that BIS would appoint Sir Adrian Montague, CBE, chairman of private equity firm 3i, to lead a team of \"independent financial experts\" in setting up the UK Green Investment Bank before it started work the following year. Cable stated that the bank would be initially staffed by up to 100 people tasked with \"financing the Coalition's plans for a low-carbon economy\".\n\nOn 25 May 2012, Lord Smith of Kelvin was announced as the first Chair of the bank by Vince Cable. Shaun Kingsbury was the bank's chief executive from October 2012 to 2017.\n\nIn June 2015 the Business Secretary Sajid Javid put forward proposals to part-privatise the bank, with the stated aim of giving it full access to the capital markets.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, the bank was sold to Macquarie Group Limited for £2.3 billion.\n\n\n"}

They number about 2,000 persons, and their rugged rainforest terrain comprises about , some of which was unexplored until 2008. Their language belongs to the Sepik family.\n\nThey hunt birds, reptiles and mammals for food, adornment and trade with neighboring tribes. Having learned that fruit- and nectar-eating birds, such as fruit-doves and lorikeets, are vital to forest regeneration, the Hewa slash small gardens out of the dense jungle and allow about 20 – 25 years for the tilled yet unseeded land to be reforested naturally. Their language is not related to any outside the general area and their culture is unlike that of the other Southern Highlands tribes. They have some limited trade with those neighboring tribes, exchanging the Hewa's animal skins, spears and nose rings for shells and boars. They make paintings on flat sheets of bark but these paintings, done for magical purposes, are never traded or exhibited.\n\nThey are one of the few tribes in the fringe highland area never to have practised cannibalism, perhaps because their belief associates cannibalism with dangerous sorcerers. It is not uncommon for women accused of witchcraft to be killed. The Hewa have been extensively studied by anthropologists Lyle Steadman and William H. Thomas. The Hewa were also featured on the final episode of the Discovery Channel program \"Survivorman\" and in a later program called \"Beyond Survival\".\n\nThe Hewa were one of the last peoples in Papua New Guinea to come into contact with the outside world. Many Hewa people north of the Lagaip River were uncontacted until 1975, when the Officer in Charge at Kopiago braved arrow attacks and led what probably was Papua New Guinea's last \"first contact patrol\", bringing steel axeheads to an area where stone axeheads were the norm. Even south of the Lagaip, many Hewa families were first contacted by Steadman in the late 1960s. He found that the typical family (which averaged seven people) lived in relative isolation from other families, with their nearest neighbors living half a mile away through dense jungle. After darkness envelops their isolated realm, the families often stay awake for hours, the men telling myths and stories around a fire, and the women, gathered around a separate fire in their section of the house, often interrupting with well-timed quips and jests. Sometimes, historical tales are sung or chanted.\n\nIn recent decades, change has come to the region. Many Hewa wear Western clothes instead of the traditional grass skirts; though the majority still live in scattered households, many now live in villages and travel agencies fly tourists to newly constructed airstrips to visit them.\n"}

It comes from the sound of their greeting, which outsiders found comical. The alternative name \"Kalanga\" simply means people who were there before the current population.\n\nThe Holoholo are a matrilineal people.\nThey are descendants of Baguha people who fled from the Luba Empire when it was expanding eastward in the 18th century, settling around Kalemie where the Lukuga River leaves the lake.\nDuring the period of Luba dominance that followed the eastward expansion under Luba king Ilunga Sungu around 1800, \"bambudye\" secret societies were introduced among the Holoholo and other peoples, propagating oral traditions of the Luba royal family.\nThe Holoholo adopted and adapted the Luba genesis myth, in which they believed there was a mountain called Ilunga Sungu on the west side of the Lualaba towards the Luba heartland,\nThis refers to the location of the court of Ilunga Sungu at Katende.\n\nThe 1935 book \"Les peuplades du Congo belge\" shows the Holoholo living on both sides of the Lukuga.\nThey became middlemen in the Arab and African slave trade. With suppression of this trade the economy collapsed and disease and local warfare decimated the population. Today the economy is mostly agricultural based on sorghum, maize, peanuts, and beans.\nFish are caught with nets, dried and sold locally, the main source of cash in the area. Sorghum is used to make beer.\n\nThe Holoholo who live in Tanzania around Kungwe Mountain have a tradition that their ancestors came from the Congo side by means of a long island that continued Kungwe Mountain into the lake.\nThe lake level is highly variable, so it is conceivable that they crossed at a time when it was much lower than today, when part of the ridge separating the northern and southern basins of the lake would have been exposed.\n\nThousands of Holo-holo had settled along the Tanganyikan side of the lake by 1915, having sailed over in canoes. A census in 1948 counted 4,410 Holo-holo in Tanganyika.\n\nIn 1987 the Holoholo people had an estimated population of 12,500 in Tanzania. They traditionally lived in the Mahale Mountains on the east shore of the lake opposite Kalemie. However they were expelled from this area after 1979 to make way for the Mahale Mountains National Park created in 1985.\n\n"}

Učka.\n\nThe 2001 Croatian census lists only 48 Romanian language speakers in Istria County. In the 2011 Croatian census, Istria listed 49 Romanians and 6 Vlachs.\n\nThe inhabitants of villages and hamlets speak the Čakavian dialect which it is believed originated in Dalmatia. However, there is no known record to show that the Istro-Romanians came from Dalmatia. That there are traces of Istro-Romanian words in the Cakavian Istrian vocabulary and vice versa indicate only that over the centuries the two neighboring linguistically different groups assimilated through daily social contact and intermarriages, as happens with other peoples and their languages throughout the world.\n\nThe first historical record of Romanians in the Istrian region purportedly dates back to 940 A.D. when scholarly Roman Emperor Constantine VII recorded in \"De Administrando Imperio\"\" that there were Latin-language speakers in this area who called themselves Romans but who did not come from Rome. A later historical record of Romanians in Istria (not necessarily the \"Ćići\", and possibly the \"Morlacchi\" i.e. Vlachs) dates back to 1329, when Serbian chronicles mention that a Vlach population was living in the area, although there was an earlier mention from the 12th century of a leader in Istria called \"Radul\" which may have been a Romanian name.\n\nIn his monumental book, \"Historia antica, e moderna sacra, e profana, della città di Trieste\", published in his native town of Trieste in 1698, Fra Ireneo della Croce (1625–1713) wrote:\n\nHe mentions a people who, \"beside the Slavic idiom common for all the Karst area, speak also their own and particular language, which is similar to Wallachian and contains many different Latin words.\" He was referring to the language of the \"Ćići\", \"who call themselves in their language as Rumeri\", in his own time, were known to inhabit an extensive part of Istria up to Trieste and surrounding regions.\n\nSome linguists believe that the Istro-Romanians migrated to their present location about 600 years ago from Transylvania, after the Black Death depopulated Istria, as was told to generations of Istro-Romanians who handed down this story from parent to child by word of mouth. Some loan words also suggest that before reaching Istria, the Istro-Romanians lived for a period of time in Dalmatia near the Cetina river, but this is mere speculation as the loan words could easily have come from other Slavic peoples who likewise emigrated to Istria. Such loan words also exist in Daco-Romanian, the official language of Romania. Moreover, in modern Serbia, there are some Daco-Romanian speakers \"(see Romanians of Serbia)\", but the majority of the large population of Romanians there speak Aromunian (a.k.a. Macedo-Romanian), both being distinctly different languages from Istro-Romanian.\nMore importantly, the Transylvanian connection that is emphasized by linguists is alive in the memory of some of the Istrorumeni themselves who today distinguish themselves into two distinct groups - the \"Ćići\" surrounding the Mune and Žejane area in Ćićarija, and the \"Vlahi\" of the southern Šušnjevica region, this despite the fact that their language is identical except for a few local distinctions. Iosif Popovici entitled his book \"Dialectele române din Istria\" (Halle, 1909) - that is, \"\"The Dialects...\" not \"The Dialect...\"\" - indirectly suggesting there were several types of Istro-Romanian dialects in Istria.\n\nRomanian linguists are divided in their opinions: Prof. Dr. Iosif Popovici (1876–1928), who had travelled extensively in Istria, endorsed the theory that the Istro-Romanians were natives of Ţara Moţilor (Western Transylvania) who had migrated into Istria sometimes during the Middle Ages. (\"Dialectele române din Istria\", I, Halle a.d.S., 1914, p. 122 and following). This opinion was shared by Ovid Densusianu (1873–1938) (a Romanian folklorist, philologist, and poet who introduced trends of European modernism into Romanian literature - thus not a linguistics authority - who stated that Istro-Romanians were not native to Istria (\"Histoire de la langue roumaine\", I, p. 337): \"Un premier fait que nous devons mettre en evidence, c'est que l'istro-roumain n'a pu se développer à l'origine là où nous le trouvons aujourd'hui\".\n\nThe Serbian dialectologist and phonologist Pavle Ivić (1924–99), respected for his work toward the standardization of the Serbian language, speculated that at the beginning of the Middle Ages a sizable Roman population inhabited all of the Balkans, but his interests focused on the areas contained within the former Yugoslavia, whereas history shows that the Latin language influence reached considerably beyond that region. Besides, the Roman population to which he referred may not relate solely to the Istro-Romanians who migrated to Istria, but also the Istriot (Istro-Romance) speakers of Istria, as well as the Vegliot language (now extinguished) that was spoken in the nearby island of Krk (Veglia). Both of these languages evolved separately from Istro-Romanian.\n\nRegarding the Vegliot speakers, in the 15th century, a purportedly similar population of \"Rumeri\" from the near mainland, as noted by Frankopan (Frangipani) princes in their chronicles, settled in northernmost Krk (Veglia) island, villages Poljica and Dubašnica at actual Malinska. In the mid-19th century they were gradually assimilated, and only some of their toponyms and plant names persist; also their Paternoster, \"Cace nostru\", was noted there.\nWhen Istria was part of the Austrian Empire, the Istro-Rumanians were the majority of a small \"comune\" (Eng. community, county) near the Arsa River and mainly within the Arsa valley, as shown in the 1910 Austrian census. In 1922, after the union of Istria to Italy, the Italian government designated the existing town of Susnieviza (changing its name to ; today called Šušnjevica) for the Istro-Romanian community, and appointed , an Istro-Romanian professor who had studied in Romania, as their leader. They obtained a school in the Istro-Romanian language in the town of Valdarsa and reached a population of 3,000 in 1942. The population of modern Šušnjevica is now reduced to around 200 inhabitants.\n\nAfter World War II, most Istro-Romanians left their ancestral homes, as did the majority of inhabitants throughout the Istrian peninsula due to discrimination, violence and threats by the incoming Communist regime. A small number remained in Istria while others,the Giuliani-Dalmati Italians from the centuries old Venetian Republic rule, along with their Croat neighbors, emigrated to various countries of Europe, most notably Italy, the U.S.A., Canada, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Australia and other countries throughout the world (Istro-Romanians became adjusted to Italy, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Venezuela because of their Latin identity). Those who stayed under Yugoslav rule underwent forced assimilation as much as, if not more than, they had under the prior brief Italian rule of Fascist Italy. The Italian writer and historian Giuseppe Lazzarini believes that there are more than 5,000 Istro-Romanian descendants in Istria, even though the 1991 Census lists only 811 Istro-Romanians. As happened with past and recent changeovers in regimes which have disfavored this minority, most of them identify themselves with other ethnic groups instead of as Istro-Romanian. Lazzarini believes that the Istro-Romanians are the descendants of the Roman legionnaires (brought in by Augustus to eastern Istria to colonize the borders of Roman Empire) and Aromanian shepherds, who escaped the Ottoman invasions and moved to a plague depopulated Istria in the 15th century. Other historians and linguists, however, disagree with this theory inasmuch as the Aromanian and Istro-Romanian languages are very different and entirely distinguishable from each other.\n\nAlso significant is that unlike most other Romanian speakers, who are Eastern Orthodox, the Istro-Romanians were in the past and are today Roman Catholic, another characteristic of these people which suggests a different migratory pattern and historical evolution, like their Croat neighbors. In 1998, August Kovačec, a Croatian linguist, (see references below) published a detailed monograph on Istro-Romanians, their population, culture, glossary, grammar which was reflective only of the acknowledged speakers in Istria during the years in which the language was politically discouraged, not of the majority of native speakers who left Istria after World War II. This monomgram and his other texts, while exhaustive, are not the primary or authoritative source. Before and since his writings, Romanian, Italian and even Dalmatian linguists have published their own atlases, dictionaries and vocabularies on this nearly extinguished, but obsolete, language.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the main figures in the turn of the 20th century Catholic Catalan nationalism.\n\nJosep Torras strongly criticized the secularism displayed by the \"militant nationalism\" of Enric Prat de la Riba (1870–1917). In 1892 he wrote \"La tradició catalana\", where he emphasized Conservative Nationalism and warned against the erosion of Christian values. Exalting rural life, the family, religion, and the love of Catalan language, the land and the language took an almost mystical dimension in his point of view. He was convinced that the Catalan nation had to be Christian in order to establish itself as something enduring and meaningful in the future. His words \"Catalunya serà cristiana o no serà\" (Catalonia will be Christian or will not be) are engraved at the gate of Santa Maria de Montserrat abbey.\n\nTorras was very interested in the study of the seny, a virtue often considered a Catalan cultural symbol, and encouraged others, like Josep Abril i Virgili and Jaume Raventós, to do so. Based on good sense and wisdom, \"seny\" was perceived by Torras to originate in the traditional Catalan rural farm (\"casa pairal\" or \"masia\"). The life in the traditional non-urban setting with its frugality, hard work, and religious piety was the right ground for the development of the values and social norms embodied in the Catalan \"seny\".\n\nIn 1882 Torras became counselor to bishop of Barcelona J. M. Urquinaona. Specializing in conflict-solving among Catholics, he also was the censor of some newspapers that were compromised in certain inner troubles (\"procesos canónicos\") of the Spanish Church at the time.\n\nYears later, in 1888, Josep Torras, after analyzing the growing secularization of Spanish society, wrote the book \"El clero en la vida social moderna\" in Spanish. In his work he wrote straightforwardly about the often integrist or reactionary position of the Catholic Church in Spain, and sought to encourage the Spanish Catholic clergy to adapt to the spirit of the times and to focus on moderation and personal spiritual discipline, advice that went largely unheeded at the time.\n\nTorras was promoted to become archbishop of Burgos in 1906 and Valencia in 1913, but he declined because he did not want to put a distance between himself and the mission he was committed to in the heart of Catalonia.\n\nEven though most of his works have been published in compilations under the title \"Obres completes\", his abundant correspondence, crucial for the understanding of certain issues surrounding Catalan nationalism, remains for the most part unpublished.\n\n\n"}

As a result, only a few speak any Arabic, typically limited to a few basic words. The majority, especially among younger generations, speak Spanish as first language.\n\nCarlos Slim, formerly the richest man in the world, is an example of Lebanese Mexican success in Mexican society.\n\nLebanese immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1892, the first Lebanese arrived in Mexico from Beirut in French ships to Mexican ports such as Puerto Progreso, Veracruz and Tampico. At that time, Lebanon was not an independent nation; the territory was held by the Ottoman Empire and later became a French protectorate. Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They settled in significant numbers in Yucatán, Veracruz, Puebla, Mexico City and the northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara). \n\nAlthough Lebanese people made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity. During the 1948 Israel-Lebanon war and the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico, first arriving in Veracruz.\n\nAnother concentration of Lebanese-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the US–Mexican border, especially in the cities of Mexicali and Tijuana across from San Diego with a large Lebanese-American community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico.\n\nOne Lebanese cultural tradition in Mexico itself is to place colored ribbons to the image of St. Charbel to ask some favor or some miracle and to give thanks. The tradition arose in the Candelaria Church in Merced in the historic center of Mexico City.\n\nThe immigration of Lebanese to Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, including introducing kibbeh and tabbouleh, and even creating recipes such as \"tacos árabes\". By 1765, dates, which originated in North Africa and the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards. The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine.\n\nThe majority of Lebanese-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Melkite Catholic. The Lebanese initially practiced Catholicism independently from other Mexicans, but learned to speak Spanish; Lebanese-Mexican children quickly joined the country's religious activities.\n\nA few Lebanese Muslims settled in Mexico. They were responsible for the opening of the first mosque in Mexico, built in the city of Torreon, in Coahuila, and named Suraya.\n\n\n"}

He is remembered as the conductor of the Utah Symphony Orchestra for over 30 years.\n\nAbravanel was born in Salonika, Rumelia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire (modern Thessaloniki, Greece). He came from an illustrious Sephardic Jewish family, which was expelled from Spain in 1492 (see Isaac Abrabanel). Abravanel's ancestors settled in Salonika in 1517, and his parents were both born there. In 1909, the Abravanel family moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where the father, Edouard de Abravanel, was a successful pharmacist.\n\nFor several years, the Abravanels lived in the same house as Ernest Ansermet, the conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. The young Abravanel played four-hand piano arrangements with Ansermet, began to compose, and met composers such as Darius Milhaud and Igor Stravinsky. He was passionate about music and knew he wanted a career as a musician. He became the pianist for the municipal theatre and music critic for the city's daily newspaper.\n\nMaurice's father, however, insisted on a career in medicine and sent him to the University of Zürich, where he was miserable at having to dissect corpses. He wrote to his father that he would rather be second percussionist in an orchestra than a doctor, and his father finally relented.\n\nAbravanel lived in Germany from 1922 to 1933, heavily involving himself in the music scene there. He lived in Paris from 1933 to 1936, serving as music director of Balanchine's Paris Ballet, then conducting for two years in Australia. In 1936 Abravanel accepted a post at New York's Metropolitan Opera, becoming at age 33 the youngest conductor the Met had ever hired. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. In 1947 he was hired as music director of the Utah Symphony, and over the next 30 years raised the ensemble to international prominence, leading the symphony in live radio broadcasts and releasing more than 100 commercial recordings.\n\nAbravanel was known as \"Maurice de Abravanel\" until 1938. He married singer Friedel Schako in 1933 and the couple moved to Paris that year when the Nazis came to power. The marriage ended in divorce in 1940, after Schako eloped with the conductor Otto Klemperer: the pair \"went careering around the country...leaving a trail of unpaid bills.\" In 1947, Abravanel married Lucy Menasse Carasso; they remained married until her death. He married his third wife, Carolyn Firmage, in 1987. He died in 1993 in Salt Lake City, Utah, at the age of 90.\n\nIn 1922, during the depths of the depression of the Weimar Republic, Abravanel, then age 19, moved to Berlin. Despite the difficult economic situation, Berlin supported three opera houses, which staged performances every night of the year. Wilhelm Furtwängler, Bruno Walter, Richard Strauss and Otto Klemperer were all conducting opera in Berlin at that time.\n\nAbravanel became a student of the composer Kurt Weill (3 years his senior), who had to accept up to 46 students to make ends meet. Abravanel later commented that Weill was \"a lousy teacher\", but became his close friend and enthusiastic supporter. After a year of study, Abravanel landed a job as an accompanist at the opera in Neustrelitz, just north of Berlin. At the time, this was a good career path towards becoming a conductor because the accompanist rehearsed and coached the singers and would sometimes be called on to substitute when the conductor was unable to conduct at short notice.\n\nIn 1924, the theatre in Neustrelitz burned down, and the four conductors found work elsewhere. The members of the orchestra asked Abravanel if he would conduct performances at the castle. He conducted orchestra concerts twice a week at the castle with no rehearsal. He even received some pay.\n\nIn 1925, Abravanel received a position as choral director in Zwickau, in Saxony. He spent two years there, conducting the operetta repertoire. Because of his success in Zwickau, he was given a position as regular conductor at a better theatre in Altenburg.\n\nAfter two years in Altenburg, Abravanel was appointed conductor at his first major opera house in Kassel. In 1931, the director of the Berlin State Opera saw him conduct a performance of Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". He asked him to come to Berlin and conduct a performance at the Berlin State Opera. The orchestra was impressed and applauded Abravanel. This was important because at that time the orchestra decided whether a guest conductor would be asked to return. Abravanel became a regular guest conductor.\n\nBecause of the rise of Adolf Hitler, prominent Jewish musicians were being forced to leave Germany. Feeling this danger, Abravanel chose to relocate to Paris along with Kurt Weill in 1933.\n\nIn Paris, he worked with Bruno Walter. Walter was a friend of and authority on the music of Gustav Mahler. Walter recommended Abravanel as a guest conductor at the Paris Opera, and he was able to cast, rehearse, and conduct Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" there. He also had the opportunity to conduct the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris, the regular conductor of which was Pierre Monteux. He also met George Balanchine in Paris and conducted his ballets, as well as conducting the works of his old teacher and friend, Kurt Weill. Weill and Balanchine collaborated on a ballet, \"The Seven Deadly Sins\", which had its premiere in Paris. Abravanel was the conductor.\n\nWeill left Paris for London, and then New York (1935), and the Abravanels left Paris for Australia (1934). Maurice had been offered a chance to direct both the Melbourne and the Sydney opera. After a six-week journey through the Suez Canal and across the Indian Ocean, he arrived to be acclaimed as the \"eminent continental conductor.\"\n\nHe conducted a 13-week season in Melbourne and a two-month season in Sydney with Verdi's \"Aida\" as the opener in both cities and a balanced selection of the standard repertoire, including Puccini, Wagner and Bizet.\n\nIn mid-spring of 1936, he received an offer from the Metropolitan Opera in New York to come and conduct the German and French repertoire. At age 33, Abravanel became the youngest contracted conductor in the history of the Met. He was offered a three-year contract, only two years of which were fulfilled, due to internal politics at the Met. For the next several years, Abravanel filled several temporary conducting stints on and around Broadway, and tried to emphasize Weill's music wherever possible.\n\nIn 1946 the community orchestra known as the Utah State Symphony Orchestra began advertising for a conductor, and Abravanel applied, stating that he wanted to build a permanent orchestra of his own. He was selected from a field of 40 applicants for the position, receiving a one-year contract. In accepting the Utah offer he had to reject a lucrative contract from Radio City Music Hall, and he ended up working without pay several times during the orchestra's darkest days. The one-year contract became a 32-year career. During that time Abravanel built the orchestra from a part-time community orchestra into a well-respected, professional ensemble with recording contracts with Vanguard, Vox, Angel, and CBS. He lobbied for years for a permanent home for the orchestra, and realized this dream when Salt Lake's Symphony Hall opened in September 1979, shortly after he retired for health reasons.\n\nIn addition to becoming known as a major interpreter of classical composers, Abravanel championed contemporary music, recording the music of Crawford Gates and Leroy Robertson among others.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1980, Abravanel also directed the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, where young musicians gathered for summer music camps. He taught conducting at Tanglewood, where he was appointed artist-in-residence for life. In his later years he received various honors: The American Symphony Orchestra League gave him its Gold Baton in 1981; President Bush presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 1991; and in 1993 Salt Lake City renamed its Symphony Hall Abravanel Hall.\n\nAbravanel is remembered for making classic recordings of the Berlioz Requiem, several orchestral works by Edgar Varèse, and Vaughan Williams.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the crime boss of Reynosa, Tamaulipas.\n\nNicknamed \"El Gringo\" in reference to his U.S. nationality, Villarreal was identified by authorities as a Gulf Cartel leader in 2010, when he allegedly commanded cells that fought Los Zetas drug cartel in northeastern Mexico. By 2011, he served as the regional kingpin in Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas and ordered several kidnappings and killings in the South Texas border area from Mexico. Throughout 2011 and 2012, Mexican media outlets reported on two occasions that Villarreal had been killed in armed confrontations with rival drug traffickers and Mexican law enforcement officers. By then, rival factions within the Gulf Cartel were fighting amongst each other for the control of the Tamaulipas and the cartel.\n\nAlthough not officially confirmed, Stratfor intelligence agency reported that Villarreal was killed in a three-hour gunfight that left at least three dozen dead in Reynosa, Tamaulipas on 10 March 2013. The shootout was caused by an attempt by Mario Ramírez Treviño, another high-ranking drug lord of the Gulf Cartel, to remove his rivals and become the undisputed leader of the cartel.\n\nMiguel Villarreal earned his nickname \"El Gringo\" for being a U.S. citizen. He was identified as a high-ranking leader of the Gulf Cartel by the Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in July 2010. According to the government report, Villarreal operated as the second-in-command in the Gulf Cartel. He led armed confrontations against the cartel's rival group Los Zetas in Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and its neighboring states in northern Mexico. They were united during the late 1990s and led by Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, but they separated in early 2010 and went to war with each other following several rivalries and leadership voids caused by Cárdenas Guillén's arrest and extradition.\n\nBy early 2011, Villarreal was the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in the border city of Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas, just across the international border from Roma, Texas. Reportedly, Villarreal had ordered his henchman in South Texas to carryout several kidnappings in the Rio Grande Valley and take their victims to Mexico after a cocaine shipment was stolen in 2011. He was also accused of ordering several murders in the Texas-Mexico border area. The modus operandi of Villarreal on U.S. soil was similar to that of the imprisoned Zetas drug lord Jaime González Durán (\"El Hummer\"), who conducted kidnappings of rival cartel members in South Texas in 2008. Also in 2011, an internal power struggle within the Gulf Cartel broke loose when the drug lord Samuel Flores Borrego was killed by his own men. Villarreal later became a key player in the cartel's internal strife in the first quarter of 2013.\n\nAlthough none of the allegations have been confirmed, Villarreal had been reported dead several times by media outlets and civilians. In October 2011, he was reported dead by a Texan media outlet in Valle Hermoso, Tamaulipas following the Gulf Cartel's internal power struggle that broke out in September 2011. A Mexican media outlet claimed that Villarreal was killed during a shootout between drug traffickers and the Mexican Armed Forces in Reynosa, Tamaulipas on 14 August 2012. According to official reports by the Mexican Army, four alleged drug traffickers were killed, but they did not comment nor confirmed any of the rumors surrounding Villarreal's death. They did state, however, that he was working as the Gulf Cartel's \"jefe de plaza\" (crime boss) in Reynosa.\n\nVillarreal was allegedly responsible for setting up several car bombs in Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Victoria, and Monterrey in 2012. He was also behind a car theft operation in Reynosa on 9 March 2013, when gunmen working for him stole 18 vehicles from 6 car dealerships.\n\nOn the night of 10 March 2013, rival factions within the Gulf Cartel clashed when gunmen loyal to Villareal and henchmen of Mario \"Pelón\" Ramírez, another high-ranking Gulf Cartel leader, battled in a three-hour gunfight in Reynosa, paralyzing the avenues and streets of the city while the Mexican Armed Forces missed most of the fighting. When the melee ended, the Mexican government confirmed two civilian deaths, but unofficial reports suggested that about 40 Gulf Cartel gunmen were killed; the number may be higher because the cartel members reportedly carried away the corpses of their fallen comrades in their vehicles. In the shootout, unofficial reports claimed that Villarreal's ally, Jesús García Román (\"El Puma\"), was killed. Other reports stated that high-ranking Gulf Cartel leader Sergio Ortegón Silva (\"Comandante Cortez\"), who led the faction known as Los Ceros (The Zeros), confronted Villarreal and his forces.\n\nRamírez Treviño and Villarreal vied for the control of the drug trade operations in Reynosa, but the former had taken the overall command of the Gulf Cartel and committed himself to kill anyone that he considered his enemy, which included Villarreal. Ramírez Treviño ordered his men to \"erase everything and [kill] everyone that had ties with El Gringo,\" thereby creating a single structure among the cartel's commanders. Ramírez Treviño was planning, with the help of the Sinaloa Cartel, to oust Villarreal for failing to stay low-profile in Reynosa, and because he considered Villarreal a \"bloodthirsty\" leader. In addition, Ramírez Treviño distrusted him because Villarreal had ties with Ramírez Treviño's rival Juan Mejía González (\"El R1\"). Stratfor global intelligence agency indicated that the infighting between both men might have occurred after Villarreal allegedly betrayed the Gulf Cartel and started working with Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (\"El Lazca\"), the former leader of the rival Los Zetas cartel. Intelligence reports indicated that Ramírez Treviño ordered his men to kill more than 60 people associated with Villarreal in Miguel Alemán and Camargo, Tamaulipas throughout March 2013 to reunify the Gulf Cartel under his power and faction.\n\nAfter several prolonged battles for the control of Reynosa, Ramírez Treviño became the top leader of the Gulf Cartel in 2013, a position he had been vying since the drug lords Costilla Sánchez and Cárdenas Guillén were arrested in late 2012. Although the information was not officially confirmed, Stratfor intelligence agency had suggested that Villarreal and several of his top associates were killed in the infighting on 10 March 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "35044291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35044291", "title": "Multicommunicating", "text": "Multicommunicating\n\nMulticommunicating is the practice of engaging in more than one conversation at a time. It is defined as, \"engaging in two or more overlapping, synchronous conversations\". The term multicommunicating was coined by Turner, Reinsch and Tinsley, who propose that simultaneous conversations can be conducted using an ever increasing array of media, including face-to-face, phone and email tools for communication. Multicommunicating evolves with the rapid development of ICT. It has become more and more prevalent in recent years and it has received attention from academic fields. Up to now, the majority of academic research focuses on its professional implications and outlines a number of key factors shaping the act of multicommunicating. For instance, the flexibility of communication tempo, the compartmentalization of conversations, and the topics and intensity of interactions are all contributing factors toward a person's choice of engaging in multicommunicating as well as his or her ultimate success with the practice.\n\nThe reason why multicommunicating is possible from a physiological and cognitive perspective is because humans, or presence allocators, are typically able to think faster than they are able to talk or type. Nonetheless, most neuroscience studies imply that we are not truly cognitively capable of multitasking; we are just able to switch between tasks. This means that those of us who are most adept at apparent multitasking, or multicommunicating, are essentially very quick at juggling our attention(s) between messages.\n\nNotably, many people engage in multiple conversations as a direct response to the requests of others. Employees frequently believe that multicommunicating increases their productivity and work efficiency, however in-depth interviews about the practice of multicommunicating have often revealed some mixed results. Research has also shown that the most commonly used combinations for multicommunicating are the telephone and email, followed by the telephone and text-based messaging (text message, instant message, etc.).\n\nAs a concept, multicommunicating primarily builds off Hall's work on polychronicity, Goffman's theory of the presentation of self, and Daft and Lengel's notion of media richness; Multicommunicating is also similar in nature to the notion of multitasking. However, where multicommunicating departs from all of these previous concepts is that it refers specifically to managing multiple conversations, people and media – not just tasks – at the same time. Stephen, Cho and Ballard elucidate this distinction in a 2011 paper which compares dovetailing (sequential communication) with mutlicommunication (simultaneous interactions). In addition, multicommunicating often occurs unbeknown to one's communication partners.\n\nMulticommunicating is closely related to Hall's 1959 work on polychronicity; in fact, multicommunicating was initially called 'polychronic communication' in one of Turner and Reinsch' first scholarly presentations of the concept to the wider academic community. In his 1959 book \"The Silent Language\" Hall coined the term polychronicity and in subsequent works developed the argument that polychronicity is a measure of a culture's preference toward engaging in several activities at a time. An important conceptual transition then occurred in the late 90's, when Bluedron became one of the first scholars to adapt the term polychronicity from the cultural context and to apply it to the workplace.\n\nGoffman's theory of the presentation of self, which suggests that people engage in a world of multistage dramas, also plays an informing role in the construction of multicommunicating. The notion that we tailor our behavior to suit our environmental contexts and situations is indeed, true in conversations, too. Nonetheless, where multicommunicating differentiates itself from Goffman's theory of the presentation of self is that a 'presence allocator' picks up their appropriate behavior cues from the interaction and the medium itself as opposed to the 'actor', who picks up his or her cues for appropriate behavior from their physical environment.\n\nDaft and Lengel's research on media richness theory or, how employees choose which technologies to use in the workplace, is another important concept for multicommunicating. Similar to McLuhan's notion of 'the medium is the message', Daft and Lengel argue that different media have varying qualities that make them more or less suited for certain interactions. For example, a relatively complex interaction, such as an important conversation with a new business partner, will likely be carried out with as rich a medium as possible. This rich medium would be a communication technology, like Skype or even a face-to-face conversation, which would allow for maximum information and submersion in the interaction. Conversely, a more casual and routine conversation, such as the making of lunch plans with a co-worker, could easily be carried out over a less contextually rich medium like an office chat or a text message.\n\nOrganizational norms shape the frequency and usage of multicommunication within an organization. In this sense, the practice of multicommunicating is a type of multiple media practices, also known as multimedia, because people often use more than one media when engaging in multiple conversations. Media Ecology theory centers on the principles that there is a strong connection between media, technology and communication, and how media and communication processes influence human perception, feeling, understanding and value, and usually all three are used when engaged in multiple conversations in a technology enriched workplace..\n\nMulticommunicating takes the medium selection concept from media richness theory and suggests that some of the same characteristics that contribute to making medium choices may also contribute to the reasons a person might multicommunicate. For example, if a conversation is not very complicated or equivocal, a person might be more likely to engage in multiple conversations. A conversation that is more complicated might make it hard for multicommunicating to take place.\n\nClosely connected to media richness theory is also the notion of Channel Expansion Theory, which suggests that as an individual becomes more familiar with a specific technology, his or her perception of its capabilities and richness expands. Thus, somebody who is very comfortable with a certain chat site may perceive it to be richer in contextual nature than somebody who is only familiar with its most basic functionalities. This contributes to our understanding of multicommunicating in the sense that a persons' experience with various media may make them more adept at picking up contextually rich conversation signals as well as more prepared for handling certain communication technologies. However, even though channel expansion theory implies there are positive effects associated with the familiarity of a technology, this does not necessarily suggest that as a person's perception of media richness increases, the process of multicommunicating becomes simplified.\n\nThe difference between multicommunicating and multitasking can be confusing since both of the terms talk about people participating in two events at the same time. Scholars in the field of communication have made clear definition of the relationship between these two phenomena. They believe that multitasking has broader scope than multicommunicating which is one complex form of multitasking. Multitasking refers to a user engaging in multitasking behavior when s/he performs more than one unrelated task concurrently, which simply emphasizes task independence and performance concurrency. Multicommunicating, however, involves people participating in two simultaneous conversations, which not only requires adequate attention on both tasks, but also coordination between the two.\n\nIn addition to multicommunicating, multitasking also includes electronic multitasking, invisible whispering, and social multitasking. None of these subcategories are separated from others. They are overlapping with other categories more or less.\n\nResearch suggests that there are two characteristics which help to determine a person's choice of communication media when engaging in multicommunicating: compartmentalization and flexibility of tempo.\n\nCompartmentalization refers to the ability and ease of cross-conversations. For instance, an online chat allows one to relatively freely move from one conversation to another. In this case, the ability to hide conversations from the multiple communication partners is an important factor of compartmentalization, too.\n\nFlexibility of tempo refers to the amount of time a person has to respond to a certain message. Face-to-face communication often allows for less flexibility of tempo than does a text message.\n\nMost typically, users choose to combine media technologies such as the telephone (described as non-flexible in tempo and partially compartmentalized) with those such as electronic text (described as high in both flexibility and compartmentalization capabilities). Of course, sometimes presence allocators do not have a choice about one or more of the media they engage with. However, specific combinations of communication media may contribute strongly toward the success or, lack thereof, one has with multicommunicating.\n\nTo multicommunicate or not to multicommunicate – what is it that makes an multicommunicating episode successful? Several factors, including intensity, topic of conversation, equivocality, and the presence allocator themselves may help to determine the outcomes of an episode of multicommunicating.\n\nIntensity of communication is one of the key factors in multicommunicating because it helps to predict the amount of attention and importance a specific conversation holds. Typically, conversation intensity increases with more, simultaneous conversations, a faster pace of conversion, a broader range of topics, and a wider mix of social roles. Overly high intensity has sometimes been reported as a factor for unsuccessful multicommunicating.\n\nThe topics or themes of episodes of multicommunicating are another key factor determining overall success. Put simply, the more alike the themes of the simultaneous conversations, the more congruent an experience and easier a time the presence allocator has in information processing and conversation-switching. Similarly, the more divergent the topics or themes of conversation, the bigger the cognitive strain on the presence allocator and the higher the chance for confusion or conversation mix-ups.\n\nThe notion of equivocality is closely related to topic or theme of communication and is another key factor, which may help to determine the success of multicommunicating. Equivocality refers to the possibility for misinterpretation and studies suggest that the higher the potential for equivocality in a conversation, the more likely an individual is to pick a medium of communication that is rich in contextual cues, or that has high media-richness. The possibility for equivocality extends to episodes of multicommunicating, too, and could potentially be compounded if one has to switch their attention between media – or does not engage in rich-media conversations when necessary.\n\nThere are limits to our working memory that in turn restrict our cognitive information processing capabilities. Performance deteriorates when these limits are exceeded. Because of these limits, performing two tasks at the same time or rapidly switching between two tasks results in decreased task performance in terms of accuracy and response time. These problems can be partially alleviated (but not eliminated) by practice and physical compatibility of the tasks being performed, but they increase with task complexity.\n\nOverall, research advocates that presence allocators have the most successful experiences with multicommunicating episodes when engaged in multiple conversations with contextually appropriate media around similar topics. Likewise, the frequent reports of unsuccessful multicommunicating episodes include a sense of high intensity, equivocality and theme confusion. In those cases, information overload can occur to the point where a conversation slows down, becomes confounded or altogether stops.\n\nWhile the study of multicommunicating is still in its emergent stages, it appears to be increasingly relevant to a fast-paced, multitasking society. Some implications of multicommunicating and suggestions for further studies include:\n\nMost people indicate that they multicommunicate in order to become more efficient. However, this goal of efficiency has received some mixed results. Despite the notion that getting several things done at once makes us more productive, research has indicated that polychronicity is negatively correlated with deadlines. More specifically, when it comes to communication and multiple conversations many people reveal a breaking point, at which they can no longer juggle synchronous messages. Significant numbers of research subjects also indicate that they prefer to stay away from multicommunicating altogether when it comes to important conversations which require strong attention.\n\nSeveral scholars also hypothesized that perceived communication workload can influence people engaging in multicommunicating. Since perceived heavy workload gives people a sense of loss of time, which may result to people compensating for the effect of being overloaded by multicommunicating. However, as revealed by related research results, perceived communication overload did not predict meeting multitasking behaviors.\n\nBy employing the social exchange theory, which views social behavior as \"an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige\" where \"persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them\", Carmeno and Webster examine the relational outcomes of multicommunicating from the following aspects: Partners-VS Focal-Initiated Conversation, Conversation Leveraging, Multicommunicating Performance, Focal Individual Accessibility, Partner's Polychronic Communication Orientation, Awareness and Media Fit. In their research, they suggest that Multicommunicating has the potential to build up or damage our workplace relationships. And the incivility perceived in multicommunicating may lead to mistrust in working places.\n\nStaying “connected has become a societal norm and a personal habit in our society, especially with the development of new information communication technologies (ICTs). Bayer, Campbell & Ling explain how individuals internalize and activate social connectedness during daily life. The model outlined typed of connection cues, factors, that moderate sensitivity to connection norms, and activation paths for connection habits. But what does it really mean to stay “connected”? Does it mean that our physical presence also determines our social presence? The research done by Turner & Foss” suggests that there are four types of presences when we engage in multiple conversations: budgeted, entitled, competitive and invitational. \n\n\nEach presence involves the control of our audience and technology, the choices we make, and how we interact. \n\nIs there a way to measure our social presence? In her paper “Toward a more robust theory and measure of social presence” Biocca, Harms & Burgoon contribute to the understanding of social behavior in mediated environments, which allows researchers to predict and measure differences among interfaces and guide the design of new social environments and interfaces\n\nMulticommunicating is especially present in team collaborations. In order to be more effective in their workplace, teams would use different platforms for their communication practices. There are a number of communication platforms such as Slack that include multiple Social Media Channels (social networking platforms and instant messaging). The media capabilities of these platforms, including integrations for diverse information and communication technologies, enable affordances for both highly adaptable and centralized team communication practices. A recent research shows that team communication platforms (also known as TCPs) enable affordances for multicommunication and attention allocation including flexible scaling of media modality and synchronicity. \n\nAnother important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others.\n\nIn organizational settings, research suggests that individual's decisions to use informational communication technology are influenced by what they observe other members do in the organization, which is positive related to their multicommunicating behaviors. The perception of what others think about multicommunicating is also another significant predictor on this behaviors. Often, people hide the fact that they are multicommunicating from their conversational partners because they report an underlying perception of rudeness or partiality of conversational investment associated with multicommunicating. However, if people perceive that multicommunicating is acceptable in the organizations, they will not feel embarrassed and will engage in this kind of behaviors more often.\n\nDepending on the organizational culture, multicommunicating can become particularly crucial and bear negative effects in a professional or office setting. Conversely, research suggests that employees who follow organizational communication norms receive higher performance ratings than those who don't. therefore, if multicommunicating were considered an organizational 'norm', its practice could also bring positive feedback.\n\nWhile multicommunicating can be a controversial topic in research and practice, it is an increasingly common organizational realty. Further research into cognitive abilities, organizational settings and expanding virtual work opportunities, as well as technology will likely carry significant findings for our personal and professional lives.\n\nMulticimmunication can change the ways in which teams work and interact within the organization.\n\nAn important factor to consider with multicommunicating is the organizational context and the perception of others. In their research Stephens and Davis (2009) talk about the social influences on electronic multitasking in organizational meetings. ICTs have infiltrated meetings and allowed a new range of communicative behaviors to emerge. The observation of organizational norms and the perception of others’ thoughts concerning the use of ICTs for multitasking during a meeting explain a considerable amount of variance in how individuals use ICTs to communicate electronically in meetings. \n\nRelating to this point, Belanger and Watson (2006) made a study exploring how virtual team members structure their use of multiple media to attain strategic goals. In today’s work environment, individuals working in teams must learn to manage their time for communication and coordination, and to add to this complexity teams can range from completely virtual environments to face-to-face and all the technologies that are involved. Cardon and Dai (2014) did a study that examines the nature of mobile phone use in meetings among Chinese professionals. Using mobile phones in meetings is a form of multicommunicaion, but the etiquette associated with mobile phone use differ across cultures. Multicommunicating via mobile phones in meetings is mostly client-based and relationship-based, and it changes among cultures and across generations.\n\n\nCopresence. \"Organization Science\" (22) 1481-1499.\n"}

His shrine was located on the Velian Hill, supposedly since the founding of Rome, until the 1st century BC.\n\nDuring preliminary marriage rites, Roman brides are supposed to have straddled the phallus of Mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse, according to Church Fathers who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of virginity. The Christian apologist Arnobius says that Roman matrons were taken for a ride (\"inequitare\") on Tutunus's \"awful phallus\" with its \"immense shameful parts\", but other sources specify that it is brides who learned through the ritual not to be embarrassed by sex: \"Tutinus, upon whose shameful lap sit brides, so that the god seems to sample their shame before the fact.\" The 2nd-century grammarian Festus is the only classical Latin source to take note of the god, and the characterization of the rite by Christian sources is likely to be hostile or biased.\n\nUnlike Priapus, who is depicted in human form with an outsized erection, Mutunus seems to have been embodied purely by the phallus, like the \"fascinus\" or the mysterious begetter of Servius Tullius. The god's name is related to two infrequently recorded slang words for penis in Latin, \"mūtō\" (or \"muttō\") and \"mūtōnium\". \"Mutto\" was also used as a \"cognomen\", the third of the three elements of a Roman man's name. Lucilius offers the earliest recorded instance of both forms: \"at laeva lacrimas muttoni absterget amica\" (\"A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's tears — his left hand, that is\"), and the derivative \"mūtōnium\". \"Mūtōnium\" may have replaced the earlier form, as it appears later among the graffiti of Pompeii. Horace has a dialogue with his \"muttō\": \"What do you want? Surely you're not demanding a grand consul's granddaughter as a cunt?\" Both Lucilius and Horace thus personify the \"muttō\". \"Mūtūniātus\", used by Martial and in the \"Corpus Priapeorum\", describes a \"well-endowed\" male.\n\nBoth parts of the name \"Mūtūnus Tūtūnus\" are reduplicative, \"Tītīnus\" perhaps from \"tītus\", another slang word for \"penis.\"\n\nThe shrine of Mutunus Tutunus on the Velia has not been located. According to Festus, it was destroyed to make a private bath for the \"pontifex\" and Augustan supporter Domitius Calvinus, even though it was revered as among the most ancient landmarks.\n\nThis uprooting raises the question of why Calvinus was permitted to displace such a venerable shrine. The Church Fathers associate Mutunus with groupings of other deities that are assumed to be based on the lost theological works of Varro. Through examining these connections, Robert Palmer concluded that the old cult of Mutunus was merged with that of Father Liber, who was variously identified with or shared attributes with Jupiter, Bacchus, and Lampsacene Priapus. Palmer further conjectured that it was Mutunus, in the form of Liber, to whom Julius Caesar made sacrifice on the day of his assassination, receiving the ill omens that the conspirator Decimus Brutus urged him to ignore. Caesar had previously celebrated his victory at the Battle of Munda on the Liberalia, or festival of Liber held March 17, and he visited the house of the \"pontifex\" Calvinus on the Ides of March, near the archaic shrine of Mutunus-Liber. In Palmer's view, the evident ill favor of the god gave Augustus license to reform the cult during his program of religious revivalism that often disguised radical innovations. The god was then Hellenized as Bacchus Lyaeus.\n\nPalmer concurred with numismatists who regard a denarius minted by Quintus Titius, moneyer \"ca.\" 90–88 BC, as picturing an aged and bearded Mutunus on its obverse. The winged diadem is a reference to the Priapus of Lampsacus and to the winged phallus as a common motif in Roman decorative arts, which can also serve as an apotropaic charm against the evil eye. Another issue by Titius pictures an ivy-crowned Bacchus, with both denarii having a virtually identical Pegasus on the reverse. Michael Crawford finds \"no good grounds\" for identifying this figure as Mutunus, but Palmer points to the shared iconography of the Bacchus–Liber–Priapus figure and the associative etymology of the \"gens\" name Titius. A \"titus\" (\"penis\") with wings was a visual pun, since the word also referred to a type of bird. Varro seems to have associated \"Titinus\" with the Titii, in an etymological collocation that included Titus Tatius, the royal Sabine contemporary of Romulus; the Curia Titia; or the \"tribus\" of the Titienses, one of the three original tribes of Rome.\n"}

He was re-elected as chairman of the Libertarian National Committee at the Libertarian National Convention in 2016 and again in 2018.\n\nHe was a deputy public defender in the state of Colorado. He is also a businessman with experience in computer consulting and sales.\n\nSarwark formerly resided in Denver, with his wife and three children, where he served as vice chair of the Colorado Libertarian Party.  Before that, he lived in Maryland, where he served as chair of the Libertarian Party of Maryland.\n\nHe and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, his hometown, in 2014. Sarwark is vice president of his family's used-car dealership.\n\nSarwark faced criticism in August 2017 when he attacked the Ludwig von Mises Institute and Tom Woods on Twitter for reviving Murray Rothbard's strategy to rally the populist and anti-establishment Right behind paleolibertarianism, an anarcho-capitalist movement aimed at preserving traditionally Western, European-American culture. Sarwark also criticized Woods and the Mises Institute for failing to dissociate from and denounce the support of far-right individuals, especially neo-Nazis, after a fatal white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn March 2018, the \"Free Thought Project\" published an article stating that they received a tip that Nicholas Sarwark's name appeared in a list of Stratfor's clients published by Wikileaks in 2011. It was confirmed that the address listed was one of Sarwark's family owned businesses and insinuated this proved that Sarwark had a relationship with Stratfor either as a client or informant. Sarwark stated that \"The Excel spreadsheet is a list of gift memberships to Stratfor’s email newsletter. My brother-in-law bought me a one-year gift subscription for Christmas in 2008. I did not renew after it expired,\" which some Libertarians felt was not truthful. Reporting by the Libertarian Vindicator showed that Sarwark's statement lined up with Stratfor's statement in 2011 that what was acquired in the hack was a list of subscribers and not clients and an article by \"The Atlantic\" stated that Stratfor's appearance as a \"shadow CIA\" was good marketing and is not an accurate label.\n\n\n"}

By the 2010 census, that number had dropped to 47. Oroks also live on the island of Hokkaido in Japan, but the number of speakers is uncertain, and certainly small.\n\nThere are two dialects of Orok: northern (east Sakhalin) and southern (poronaysky). The variety of the language spoken on the island of Hokkaido belongs to the southern dialect.\n\nOrok is used conversationally in everyday situations by the members of the older generation. It is also the language of oral folk literature. Oroks also speak Russian.\n\nAn alphabetic script, based on Cyrillic, was introduced in 2007. A primer has been published, and the language is taught in one school on the island of Sakhalin.\n\nOrok is a Tungusic language that is spoken in areas of Sakhalin, Russia and Hokkaido, Japan. Its language code is 'oaa'. Orok is also known as Ulta, Ujlta, Uilta, and Sprache der Oroken. Currently it can be classified as a moribund or critically endangered language. The 2010 census reported 47 Orok people who are able to speak Orok competently. Furthermore, in a paper by Yoshiko Yamada in 2010, it is stated that there are 10 active speakers, 16 conditionally bilingual speakers, and 24 passive speakers who can understand with the help of Russian. The article states that \"It is\nhighly probable that the number has since decreased further.\"\n\nThe language of Orok is classified as a Tungusic language.

While they are called the Oroks by their neighbors in the Sakhalin such as the Ainu, Nivkh, Japanese, and the Russians, these people prefer \"uil'ta~ul'ta\". The word \"Uilta\" may come from the word \"ulaa\" which means 'domestic reindeer'. This makes sense as the main occupation of the Orok people is reindeer herding.\n\nIn efforts to preserve the Orok language and educate, many researchers have come up with dictionaries and lexical documentations. In 2008, the first Uilta primer was published to set a writing system and to educated local speakers of Uilta.\n\nThe Orok/Uilta people mainly are located in the north-eastern part of Sakhalin. Orok has two dialects: Northern (east Sakhalin) and Southern (poronaysky). The geographic distribution determines which dialect is spoken.

{"id": "16702710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16702710", "title": "Peak copper", "text": "Peak copper\n\nPeak copper is the point in time at which the maximum global copper production rate is reached. Since copper is a finite resource, at some point in the future new production from mining will diminish, and at some earlier time production will reach a maximum. When this will occur is a matter of dispute. Unlike fossil fuels, copper is scrapped and reused and it has been estimated that at least 80% of all copper ever mined is still available (having been repeatedly recycled). Copper is among the most important industrial metals, valued for its heat and electrical conductivities and malleability. Copper is used in electrical power cables, data cables, electrical equipment, cooling and refrigeration tubing, heat exchangers, brass casing small arms ammunition, water pipes, and jewellery.\n\nCopper has been used at least 10,000 years. More than 97% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900. The increased demand for copper due to the growing Indian and Chinese economies since 2006 has led to increased prices and an increase in copper theft.\n\nConcern about the copper supply is not new. In 1924 geologist and copper-mining expert Ira Joralemon warned:\n\nTotal world production is about 18 million metric tons per year. Copper demand is increasing by more than 575,000 tons annually and accelerating. Based on 2006 figures for per capita consumption, Tom Graedel and colleagues at Yale University calculate that by 2100 global demand for copper will outstrip the amount extractable from the ground. China accounted for more than 22% of world copper demand in 2008, and is nearly 40% in 2014.\n\nFor some purposes, other metals can substitute, aluminium wire was substituted in many applications, but improper design resulted in fire hazards. The safety issues have since been solved by use of larger sizes of aluminium wire (#8AWG and up), and properly designed aluminium wiring is still being installed in place of copper. For example, the Airbus A380 uses aluminum wire in place of copper wire for electrical power transmission.\n\nGlobally, economic copper resources are being depleted with the equivalent production of three world-class copper mines being consumed annually. Environmental analyst Lester Brown suggested in 2008 that copper might run out within 25 years based on what he considered a reasonable extrapolation of 2% growth per year.\n\nFifty-six new copper discoveries have been made during the three decades 1975–2005. World discoveries of new copper deposits are said to have peaked in 1996. However, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), remaining world copper reserves have more than doubled since then, from 310 million metric tons in 1996 to 690 million metric tons in 2013.\n\nAs shown in the table below, the three chief national producers of copper, respectively, in 2002, were Chile, Indonesia, and the United States. In 2013, they were Chile, China, and Peru. Twenty-one of the 28 largest copper mines in the world are not amenable to expansion. Many large copper mines will be exhausted between 2010 and 2015.\n\nCopper is a fairly common element, with an estimated concentration of 50–70 ppm (0.005–0.007 percent) in earth's crust (1 kg of copper per 15–20 tons of crustal rock). A concentration of 60 ppm would multiply out to 1.66 quadrillion tonnes over the 2.77e22 kg mass of the crust, or over 90 million years' worth at the 2013 production rate of 18.3 MT per year. However, most of it cannot be extracted profitably at the current level of technology and the current market value. At the present time, copper deposits are considered potentially profitable if they are located sufficiently close to the surface and they contain at least 0.3–0.5 percent copper.\n\nThe USGS reported a current total reserve base of copper in potentially recoverable ores of 1.6 billion tonnes as of 2005, of which 950 million tonnes were considered economically recoverable. A 2013 global assessment identified \"455 known deposits (with well-defined identified resources) that contain about 1.8 billion metric tons of copper\", and predicted \"a mean of 812 undiscovered deposits within the uppermost kilometer of the earth's surface\" containing another 3.1 billion metric tons of copper \"which represents about 180 times 2012 global copper production from all types of copper deposits.\"\n\nIn the US, more copper is recovered and put back into service from recycled material than is derived from newly-mined ore. Copper's recycle value is so great that premium-grade scrap normally has at least 95% of the value of primary metal from newly mined ore.\n\n, recycled copper provided 35% of total worldwide copper usage.\n\nBased on discovery rates and existing geologic surveys, researchers estimated in 2006 that 1.6 billion metric tons of copper could be brought into use. This figure relied on the broadest possible definition of available copper as well as a lack of energy constraints and environmental concerns.\n\nThe US Geological Survey estimated that, as of 2013, there remained 3.5 billion metric tons of undiscovered copper resources worldwide in porphyry and sediment-hosted type deposits, two types which currently provide 80% of mined copper production. This was in addition to 2.1 billion metric tons of identified resources. Combined identified and estimated undiscovered copper resources were 5.6 billion metric tons, 306 times the 2013 global production of newly mined copper of 18.3 million metric tons.\n\nDeep-sea nodules are estimated to contain 700 million tonnes of copper.\n\nChile is the world's largest copper producer, and in 2007 accounted for 37% of the world's primary copper production. One researcher wrongfully claimed that Chilean copper production would begin to decline irreversibly in 2008. This was contradicted by the Chilean Copper Commission, which projected that, based on planned expansion projects, Chilean copper production will continue to increase through at least 2012.\n\nIn Zaire, copper production fell 90% from 1976 (502,000 tons) to wartime 1993 (50,000 tons). Resumption depends on political factors.\n\nThe international price of copper struck a first peak level on 6 March 2008, on the London Metal Exchange (LME), surging 5.8% over the previous trading day to 4.02 per pound. The previous record was set on 12 May 2006, at US$3.98/lb. The price increased rapidly in early-2008, rising 23% in February 2008, then declined 40% before December 2008, and reached US$1.30 by year's end. In February 2011 the price peaked at US$4.58/lb but then fell to US$3.18/lb during 2013.\n\nJulian Simon was a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a professor of business and economics. In his book \"The Ultimate Resource 2\" (first printed in 1981 and reprinted in 1998), he extensively criticizes the notion of \"peak resources\", and uses copper as one example. He argues that, even though \"peak copper\" has been a persistent scare since the early 20th century, \"known reserves\" grew at a rate that outpaced demand, and the price of copper was not rising but falling over the long run. For example, even though world production of copper in 1950 was only one-eighth of what it was in early-2000s, known reserves were also much lower at the time – around 100 million metric tons – making it appear that the world would run out of copper in 40 to 50 years at most.\n\nSimon's own explanation for this development is that the very notion of known reserves is deeply flawed, as it does not take into account changes in mining profitability. As richer mines are exhausted, developers turn their attention to poorer sources of the element and eventually develop cheap methods of extracting it, raising known reserves. Thus, for example, copper was so abundant 5000 years ago, occurring in pure form as well as in highly concentrated copper ores, that prehistoric peoples were able to collect and process it with very basic technology. As of the early 21st century, copper is commonly mined from ores that contain 0.3% to 0.6% copper by weight. Yet, despite the material being far less widespread, the cost of, for example, a copper pot was vastly lower in the late 20th century than 5000 years ago.\n\nSimon essentially states that not all viable copper has been discovered and that not all technological advancements in mining and refining have occurred, so statements that the point of peak copper has been or will be reached must be false. Simon supports his argument by showing that copper supplies have increased and prices have fallen. Simon's thesis of peak resources is not based on current scientific analysis or geological measurements, but the analysis of historical trends and the assumption that they can and will continue.\n\n\n"}

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.\n\nIn time with the release of the Universal House of Justice's release of its statement \"The Promise of World Peace\", it also sent a letter of all national assemblies to specify goals for the community for the International Year of Peace. These goals included sponsoring activities about the theme of peace which is a priority of the religion: to engage the attention of people to relevant topics related to peace (often related matters of justice and development) and the unity of humanity.\n\nThe Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through activities such as spiritual education of children, a youth empowerment program, study circles, and devotional gatherings. For most of these activities, material developed by the Ruhi Institute is used. Initiatives of social action include activities in areas like health, sanitation, education, gender equality, arts and media, agriculture, and the environment. Educational projects include schools, which range from village tutorial schools to large secondary schools, and some universities.\n\nIn November 1986, the Baha'i department of statistics released the following summary of projects accomplished:\n\nIn April 2018, the Bahá'í Office of Social and Economic Development released the following conservative estimates, based on provided by national Bahá’í institutions.\n\n\n\nSome larger scale examples are:\n\n\n\n"}

People typically spend more overall when one of two things is true: when people \"actually are\" richer, objectively, or when people \"perceive themselves\" to be richer—for example, the assessed value of their home increases, or a stock they own goes up in price.\n\nDemand for some goods (called inferior goods) decreases with increasing wealth. For example, consider consumption of cheap fast food versus steak. As someone becomes wealthier, their demand for cheap fast food is likely to decrease, and their demand for more expensive steak may increase.\n\nConsumption may be tied to relative wealth. Particularly when supply is highly inelastic—or in the case of monopoly—one's ability to purchase a good may be highly related to one's relative wealth in the economy. Consider for example\nthe cost of real estate in a city with high average wealth (for example New York or London), in comparison to a city\nwith a low average wealth. Supply is fairly inelastic, so if a helicopter drop (or gold rush) were to suddenly\ncreate large amounts of wealth in the low wealth city, those who did not receive this new wealth would rapidly find\nthemselves crowded out of such markets, and materially worse off in terms of their ability to consume/purchase real estate\n(despite having participated in a weak Pareto improvement). In such situations, one cannot dismiss the relative effect of\nwealth on demand and supply, and cannot assume that these are static (see also General equilibrium).\n\nHowever, according to David Backus the wealth effect is not observable in economic data, at least in regard to increases or decreases in home or stock equity. For example, while the stock market boom in the late 1990s (q.v. dot-com bubble) increased the wealth of Americans, it did not produce a significant change in consumption, and after the crash, consumption did not decrease.\n\nEconomist Dean Baker disagrees and says that “housing wealth effect” is well-known and is a standard part of economic theory and modeling, and that economists expect households to consume based on their wealth. He cites approvingly research done by Carroll and Zhou that estimates that households increase their annual consumption by 6 cents for every additional dollar of home equity.\n\n"}

Because of her struggle against the ruling classes and against gender discrimination, feudalism and martial laws of Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan, she earned the title of \"JeeJee\" (mother) of the Sindhi people. She was one of the leading founders of Sindhiani Tahreek, Women’s Action Forum, Sindhi Adabi Sangat and Sindhi Haree Committee. She was fluent in Sindhi, Urdu, Seraiki, Balochi, Persian, Arabic and Gujrati.\n\n\nShe wrote many songs and poetry which became popular among the nationalists in Sindh and Balochistan.
