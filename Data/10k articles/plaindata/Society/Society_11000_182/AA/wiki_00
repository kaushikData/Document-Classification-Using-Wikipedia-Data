Before the game, the Naval Academy's superintendent told Harvard that the Navy team would not play against a racially integrated team. Harvard's one black player, Lucien Alexis Jr. of New Orleans, left of his own accord after Harvard's athletic director told Harvard's coach to send him home. Harvard's players, supported by their coach, had voted to forfeit the game rather than play without him. The game went on as scheduled. Both Harvard's and the Naval Academy's administrations were criticized for their actions.\n\nOn April 3, 1941, the Harvard lacrosse team's 18 players arrived at Annapolis, Maryland, to play the Naval Academy in a scheduled intercollegiate match. That day, the Naval Academy's superintendent, Rear Admiral Russell Willson discovered that Harvard's team included one black player, Lucien Alexis Jr. He informed Harvard's coach, Dick Snibbe, and athletic director, William J. Bingham, that Navy's squad would not play against a racially integrated team.\n\nAngry at the Naval Academy's stance, Snibbe and Alexis' teammates elected to forfeit the game and return to Harvard. Bingham intervened and ordered the Harvard coach to send Alexis home and play the game. Learning of Bingham's directive, Alexis voluntarily decided to depart and told his teammates that it was his idea. The game was played as scheduled the next day and Navy won 12-0.\n\nHarvard's student newspaper, \"The Harvard Crimson\", learned of the incident and sharply criticized Bingham and Harvard's administration. The newspaper said of the incident:\n\nIn response Bingham said: \"We were guests of the Naval Academy and had no choice in the matter. Had the game been played at Cambridge, I would have insisted that he be allowed to participate.\"\n\nNewspapers in Boston and New York City picked up the story and criticized Harvard's and the Naval Academy's administrations for their actions. The Harvard Council for Democracy in Education complained to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt about USNA's actions in the incident. The Harvard Corporation told Bingham and the Harvard Athletic Association to inform all future sports competitors that the school would not tolerate further racial discrimination against its student athletes.\n\nOne week after the incident, Alexis and the rest of Harvard's lacrosse team traveled to West Point, New York, to play a game against the United States Military Academy. In contrast to the reception the Navy had given Harvard's team, at West Point a cordon of cheering cadets, led by black cadets attending the academy, welcomed Alexis and his team.\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin counts this incident among several that pressured President Roosevelt, in June 1941, to sign Executive Order 8802 that prohibited racial discrimination in the defense industry.\n\nIn 1949 Wesley A. Brown was the first black student to graduate from the Naval Academy. On May 10, 2008, a dedication ceremony was held on the Naval Academy campus for its newest building, the Wesley Brown Field House, named for him. Brown participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, Naval Academy Superintendent Vice Adm. Jeffrey L. Fowler, and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. Also present were almost one thousand guests.\n\nLucien Victor Alexis (1887-1981), Harvard '17, was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the US Army and later became the principal of the only black high school in New Orleans. His son Lucien Victor Alexis, Jr. graduated from Harvard in turn and went into the service in World War II. After his return, he got a degree from Harvard Business School. He later served as head of a New Orleans business college for black students, segregated by state law. He married and had children. He died in 1975. His daughter Lurita Alexis Doan became an entrepreneur, owning her own business from 1990 to 2005, and approved as the first woman and second African American to serve as Administrator of the General Services Administration (2006 to 2008), during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\n\n"}

In the municipality of Medveđa, Albanians are second largest ethnic group (after Serbs), and their participation in this municipality was 32% in 1981 census, 28.67% in 1991 and 26.17% in 2002. The region of Bujanovac and Preševo is widely known as the Preševo Valley (Serbian: Прешевска Долина, \"Preševska Dolina\", Albanian: \"Lugina e Preshevës\").\n\nThere is a small community of Albanians in the Pešter region of Sandžak living in villages such as Boroštica, Doliće and Ugao. For the past two generations these villages have become partly \"bosniakicised\", due to intermarriage with the surrounding Bosniak population. As such and also due to the Yugoslav wars and thereafter, they have opted to declare themselves in censuses as \"Muslims\" and \"Bosniaks\" instead of as Albanians to avoid problems. Elders in these villages are still fluent in Albanian.\n\nIn 1992, the Albanian representatives in the municipalities Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac organized a referendum in which they voted for the joining of these municipalities to the self-declared assembly of the Republic of Kosova. However, no major events happened until the end of the 1990s.\n\nFollowing the breakup of Yugoslavia, and nearby Kosovo War which lasted until 1999, between 1999 and 2001, an ethnic Albanian paramilitary separatist organization, the UÇPMB, raised an armed insurgency in the Preševo Valley, in the region mostly inhabited by Albanians, with a goal to occupy these three municipalities from Serbia and join them to (future independent) Kosovo.\n\nUnlike in the case of Kosovo, western countries condemned the attacks and described it as the \"extremism\" and use of \"illegal terrorist actions\" by the group. Following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, the new Serbian government suppressed the violence by 2001 and defeated the separatists. NATO troops also helped the Serbian government by ensuring that the rebels do not import the conflicts back into Kosovo, and even supported Serbia's military suppression of Albanians in their country, as an act to restore the relations with Serbia after 1999 bombing. This has left a dark chapter on Albania's relations with NATO, although Albania later joined the organization.\n\nSince then, the Albanian Coalition from Preševo Valley has gained representation in the National Assembly of Serbia where it holds two seats. In 2009, Serbia opened a military base Cepotina 5 kilometers south of Bujanovac, to further stabilize the area.\n\nOn 7 March 2017, the President of Albania Bujar Nishani made a historical visit to the municipalities of Preševo and Bujanovac, in which Albanians form the ethnic majority.\n\nEducation in Albanian is provided for primary and secondary schools. There may be some university-level courses provided in Albanian, in the capital of Serbia, Belgrade, but students mainly do their university degree in the University of Prishtina in the Republic of Kosovo, in Macedonia, or in Albanian Universities.\n\nThe main religion of Albanians in this region is Islam. Prior to the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans, the population of the Preševo Valley was mostly Roman Catholic. There are still Catholic churches in the Karadak villages, located in Kosovo today.\n\nAn estimate of 50,000–70,000 Albanians live in Serbia, a majority of whom live in the municipalities of Preševo (), Bujanovac (), and part of the municipality of Medveđa (). According to the results of the 2002 census, there were 61,467 ethnic Albanian citizens. Most Albanians boycotted the 2011 census, which resulted in only 5,809 Albanians being recorded as living in Serbia.\n\nAlso, Belgrade has a minor Albanian community. In the census of 1981, 8,212 Albanians were registered. In 1991 there lived only 4,985 Albanians in Belgrade. After the Kosovo War, this number decreased to 1,492, and according to the latest census (2011), the number is 1,252.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The foundation chose Myrdal because it thought that as a non-American, he could offer a more unbiased opinion. Myrdal's volume, at nearly 1,500 pages, painstakingly detailed what he saw as obstacles to full participation in American society that American Negroes faced as of the 1940s. Ralph Bunche served as Gunnar Myrdal's main researcher and writer at the start of the project in the Fall of 1938.\n\nIt sold over 100,000 copies and went through 25 printings before going into its second edition in 1965. It was enormously influential in how racial issues were viewed in the United States, and it was cited in the landmark \"Brown v. Board of Education\" case \"in general\". The book was generally positive in its outlook on the future of race relations in America, taking the view that democracy would triumph over racism. In many ways it laid the groundwork for future policies of racial integration and affirmative action.\n\nMyrdal believed he saw a vicious cycle in which whites oppressed Negroes, and then pointed to Negroes' poor performance as reason for the oppression. The way out of this cycle, he argued, was to either cure whites of the prejudice he believed existed, or to improve the circumstances of Negroes, which would then disprove whites' preconceived notions. Myrdal called this process the \"principle of cumulation\".\n\nIn \"Black-White Relations: The American Dilemma\", economist Junfu Zhang gives this description of Myrdal's work:\n\nMyrdal, writing before the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, alleged that northern whites were generally ignorant of the situation facing Negro citizens, and noted that \"to get publicity is of the highest strategic importance to the Negro people\". This proved, given the pivotal role played by the press in the movement, to be strikingly prescient.\n\nAt the center of Myrdal's work in \"An American Dilemma\" was his postulate that political and social interaction in the United States is shaped by an \"American Creed\". This creed emphasizes the ideals of individualism, civil liberties, and equality of opportunity. Myrdal claims that it is the \"American Creed\" that keeps the diverse melting pot of the United States together. It is the common belief in this creed that endows all people—whites, negroes, rich, poor, male, female, and immigrants alike—with a common cause and allows for them to co-exist as one nation.\n\n\n"}

Many of the Baloch have been settled in the region before the formation of Pakistan and the UAE, forming part of the local Bedoon community. The Balochistan region lies on the Iranian plateau, located across the Persian Gulf.

{"id": "3075671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3075671", "title": "Bisexual chic", "text": "Bisexual chic\n\nBisexual chic is a phrase used to describe the public acknowledgment of bisexuality or increased public interest or acceptance of bisexuality. Another usage describes a faddish attention towards bisexuality. Bisexual chic is often accompanied by celebrities publicly revealing their bisexuality.\n\nIn the United States, the 1920s was a decade of social experimentation, particularly with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that people would behave in any manner to satisfy sexual desire. With the well-publicized image that sexual acts were a part of lesbian women and relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.\n\nThe phrase itself came into wide usage in the 1970s, on the tail end of the hippie movement, which extolled free love. During the glam rock and disco era, there was a media-generated fascination with bisexuality in the club scene and among musicians such as Elton John, David Bowie and Patti Smith; in fact, in 1980, \"Time\" magazine referred to Bowie's persona Ziggy Stardust as \"the orange-haired founder of bisexual chic.\" At the same time, bisexual groups formed in several large US cities, heralding the birth of the modern bisexual civil rights and liberation movements.\n\nThe phrase can be used to imply someone is only pretending to be bisexual because it’s fashionable at the moment. Alternatively, it can be used to assert that someone is free of taboos, experimental, in touch with both masculine and feminine aspects of themselves, and therefore potentially a better lover or even a better person.\n\nThough the terminology is attributed to the 1970s, a bisexual trend occurred in the 1920s. In \"Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life\", Marjorie Garber argues \"the twenties has been linked to the popularization of Freud (or \"Freudianism\"), the advent of World War I, and a general predilection for the daring and unconventional: bobbed hair, short skirts, the rejection of Prohibition and Victorian strictures.\" Examples of this include drag balls, and the success of artists such as Ernest Hemingway, D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, and Marlene Dietrich. Looking back from the 70s, writer Elaine Showalter accused Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group of bisexual chic when she warned Woolf and her friends of indulging \"the fashion of bisexuality.\"\n\nAfter a strain of social movements centred on LGBT rights like the Stone Wall Riots in 1969, from 1970s onwards, awareness of bisexuality was on the rise and non-conforming sexual behaviors were seen as an act of social defiance. In 1972, the hit musical film \"Cabaret\" featured a love triangle with a man and woman fighting for the same (male) lover. The author who inspired it, Christopher Isherwood, was among the first openly homosexual celebrities. Other prominent cultural representations of the 1970s include \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)\". In the 90s, under the influences of the contemporary hipster subculture, which symbolizes the resistance against mainstream lifestyle and encourages unconventionalities, more and more people started to speculate about their own identity as well as sexuality.\n\nThe phenomenon of bisexual chic can also be attributed to the growing number celebrities disclosing their bisexual identity. For example, in 1995, the lead vocalist of punk rock band Green Day Billie Joe Armstrong came out as bisexual in an interview with The Advocate. In the media, Madonna's music videos for \"Justify My Love\" and \"Erotica\" and her book \"Sex\" featured same-sex eroticism. Openly bisexual comedian Sandra Bernhard was featured as a bisexual on the popular television sitcom Roseanne amidst the trend. To illustrate the trend, Roseanne later found herself kissed by another woman and was \"consoled\" by Bernhard's character, bringing bisexuality to Middle America. (\"See Also: Lesbian kiss episodes\") The 1992 film \"Basic Instinct\" featured a glamorous bisexual murderess played by Sharon Stone. Mainstream singer Janet Jackson recorded a cover version of Rod Stewart's \"Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)\" in which she sings to a woman with whom she is about to engage in a \"ménage à trois\", saying, \"\"This is just between me... and you... and you...\".\"\n\nIn the 21st century, bisexuality (or manifestations thereof) was alluded to in the films \"Kissing Jessica Stein\", \"Y tu mamá también\", \"Mulholland Drive\", \"Alexander\", \"Kinsey\", and \"Brokeback Mountain\", in the television series \"The O.C.\" in the US and \"Torchwood\" in the UK and in Lady Gaga's music videos for \"LoveGame\" and \"Telephone\". In the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Madonna kissed Britney Spears and then Christina Aguilera; many news and tabloid outsources referred to it as \"lesbian chic\". The 2008 hit song \"I Kissed a Girl\" by Katy Perry had bicurious lyrics. According to surveys by the CDC in the USA, a larger number of female college and high school students in America are experimenting with other women than ever before and, in a surprising twist, actually report being encouraged to do so by pop culture for the first time.\n\nDespite the visibility and acceptance of bisexuality brought by the effects of bisexual chic, this phenomenon has been criticised for its \"trendy\" property rather than a genuine act of advocating bisexual equality. The idea of bisexuality being chic is also detrimental to the bisexual movement as \"faux bisexuality\" gives bad credits to bisexual people that their sexuality is only a form of art, not a real sexual orientation.\n\nIt also misleads people who are bi-curious, which means questioning their attraction to both sexes and possibly end up being monosexual, to identify with being bisexual.\n\n"}
{"id": "1097544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1097544", "title": "Bumiputera (Brunei)", "text": "Bumiputera (Brunei)\n\nThe Bumiputera or Bumiputra (from the Sanskrit word 'Bhumiputra' (भूमिपुत्र), which roughly translated means 'sons of the soil') also referred as Melayu Jati (\"Indigenous Malays\") in Brunei is the term used to refer to a member of majority Malay ethnic group and members of certain native groups as outlined below.\n\nThe Brunei Constitution defines a Bumiputera as a member of the following ethnic groups:\nBruneian Malay,\nTutong,\nBelait,\nDusun,\nMurut,\nKedayan, and\nBisaya.\n\nOther indigenous peoples (e.g. Iban, Kelabit and Penan) are not defined as being Bumiputera by the Brunei constitution, nor are citizens who are of ethnic-Chinese, Indians or of Caucasian ancestry. Race is patrilineally defined in Brunei, so, for example, a half-Chinese man with an ethnic Dusun father is considered to be Bumiputera.\n\nThis is different from the definition in Malaysia where a larger number of races and ethnic groups are considered as Bumiputra. The Malaysian Constitution does not actually provide a definition of the term, which has led to some controversy concerning its relation to the indigenous groups in that country. See Bumiputera (Malaysia). Constitutional references to Bumiputeras can be found in Section 160 (2) of the Constitution of Brunei Darassalam.\n\nBeing accorded the status of Bumiputera in Brunei (as in Malaysia) carries with it certain benefits and opportunities which other ethnic groups in the country may not have access to. There are a number of affirmative action items targeting the Bumiputeras in Brunei. Under special legislation they have extended land rights and are given special privileges for employment opportunities in the Royal Brunei Armed Forces and Brunei Shell Petroleum.\n\nThe justification for these special privileges and affirmative action schemes is that Bumiputeras face disadvantages due to the success of other groups in society, for example the Chinese. One case of such disadvantage can be seen in the demise of the construction industry in Brunei. The building sector is a major employer of Bumiputeras and forms the lifeblood of many Bumiputera families. As such, they are the group in society most affected by the global economic crisis. In the past, government policies in relation to economic recovery has been directly focussed on improving the position of Bumiputeras. During the Asian Economic Crisis of the late 1990s, Brunei's Economic Council developed an Action Plan to increase economic activity and thereby bring about some form of relief. A major part of that plan was to actively encourage and subsidise investment in Bumiputera-owned businesses.\n\nThe term Bumiputera often connotes those people of Malay-speaking ethnic groups who belong to the Islamic faith. Indeed, it has become advantageous for Bruneians to convert to Islam to truly qualify for Bumiputera status. There are some concerns that members of indigenous groups who technically fall under the Bumiputera category, but do not belong to the Islamic faith, may be under official pressure to convert to maintain their rights and privileges. In the 1970s, many indigenous people converted to Islam for this reason. The Bruneian government bans many religious activities not related to Islam, while at the same time benefitting those who participate in activities conducted by Muslim groups. This increases disadvantages to indigenous Bumiputeras who are not Muslims.\n\nWhereas the delineation between Bumiputeras and other groups in Malaysia has been the cause of much conflict and unrest of late, it does not appear to have had the same consequences in Bruneian society. This may be because affirmative action strategies are not so prevalent or obvious in Bruneian society. A lack of opposition to the Bumiputera concept in Brunei may also be because as an autocratic sultanate, the country does not experience a great deal of political diversity. This is in contrast to the situation in Malaysia, where protests against Bumiputera privileges in Malaysia are often backed by opposition parties to raise dissatisfaction with the government.\n\n"}

Echols credits Cell 16's work for \"helping establishing the theoretical foundation for lesbian separatism. In \"No More Fun and Games\", the organization's radical feminist periodical, Cell Members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to \"separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation\" and advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be \"nothing more than a personal solution.\"\n\nIn the Summer of 1968, Dunbar placed an ad in a Boston, Massachusetts underground newspaper calling for a \"Female Liberation Front.\" The original membership also included Hillary Langhorst, Sandy Bernard, Dana Densmore, the daughter of Donna Allen, Betsy Warrior, Ellen O'Donnell, Jayne West, Mary Anne Weathers, Maureen Maynes, Gail Murray, and Abby Rockefeller.

After ranking in the top five highest violent crime cities for most of the previous three decades, in 2009 Atlanta ranked 31st, and in 2015, 24/7 Wall Street ranked it 19th. While various news sources report rankings by crime rate, FBI strongly cautions against this, because this is a misuse of bare statistics, since it ignores various important factors, such as population density, degree of urbanization, composition of population, economic conditions, etc. \n\nDuring the 1970s, like with many large cities within the United States, Atlanta's population began to decline. By 1990, the population was 394,017, down almost 20% from its population in 1970, which was 496,973. In addition, the city center and surrounding areas began to go through an urban decay, and crime spiked significantly throughout the 1980s. Along with many other major cities in the United States, Atlanta was hard hit by the crack epidemic of most of the 1980s to early 1990s. In 1994, Atlanta was ranked the most dangerous city in the country by the Morgan Quitno Press.\n\nIn 1997, drug-related crime in metro Atlanta increased slightly, in part due to Atlanta becoming an important distribution center for cocaine, and other related drugs imported from Mexico. These increases were mostly seen in Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Cobb, and Clayton counties. Many law enforcement agencies in the area have joined forces together with the Atlanta Police Department in an effort to decrease the overall crime in metro Atlanta.\n\nIn addition, due to large amounts of revitalization projects in the city core, crime continued to fall, even amidst the hard economic times of the late-2000s/early 2010s.\n\nThe city is served by the Atlanta Police Department. In 2013, the APD had 2,000 officers, but the number of officers has decreased since that time. Mayor Kasim Reed has identified an increase in the number of officers to 2,000 as a goal for the city. Although city data shows that APD attrition rates have improved from the 2000s to 2013, morale issues within the police department has persisted due to officer dissatisfaction with salaries. About 45 percent of officers hired between 2005 and 2013 left the force by 2017. Atlanta is divided into six police patrol zones.\n\nThe Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), which operates rail, bus, and parking lots in the city and surrounding area, has its own police force. Overall crime rates in are about 30 per every 100,000 system daily riders, which is identical to the crime figure for the Washington, D.C. area's WMATA, higher than crime figure for the Boston area's MBTA, and lower than the crime figure for the San Francisco area's BART. Homicides within the MARTA system have varied. In the fiscal year ending in 2017, for example, there were four homicides investigated by MARTA police, but there were no homicides in the MARTA system in any of the previous last four fiscal years. Total crimes in the MARTA system have declined from fiscal year 2013.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2016, overall crime in Atlanta declined 27 percent, \"with sharp declines in burglaries (9,102 in 2009 to 4,377 in 2016), robberies (2,622 to 1,914) and aggravated assaults (2,602 to 2,179).\"\n\nConsistent with national trends, the murder rate in Atlanta peaked in 1990 and have declined since. From 2000 to 2010, murders in the city declined by nearly 50 percent. The years 2009 and 2012 had the lowest numbers of homicides in Atlanta than any year dating back to 1963, but there has been an increase in murders in the city beginning in 2013. The number of murders in Atlanta was 80 in 2009, 92 in 2010, 88 in 2011, 85 in 2012, 82 in 2013, 93 in 2014, 95 in 2015, and 111 in 2016. A significant number of murders have remained unsolved; as of February 2017, 51 of the 111 homicides from 2016 remain unsolved. \n\nAn analysis of FBI Uniform Crime Report data for 2015, conducted by the economic analysis website 24/7 Wall Street, showed a murder rate in Atlanta of about 20.2 per 100,000 people, making it the 18th highest murder rate among U.S. cities. A October 2016 \"FiveThirtyEight\" analysis of preliminary 2016 data, taken from official police information and local reports, found that among U.S. cities with populations of over a quarter-million people, Atlanta had the tenth-highest murder rate, at 23.9 per 100,000 residents.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said that 17% of 2014 homicides in the county were gang-related. In Atlanta, guns were involved in 82% of homicide cases. In July 2016, in an attempt to combat an increase in homicide, the city began Operation Whiplash, with additional police officers and other resources assigned to 33 \"challenging and crime-ridden\" neighborhoods in the city.\n\nStreet gangs of various levels of sophistication have had a presence in the city since the late 1970's. In 2015, Atlanta police were tracking about 192 gangs, more than double the number identified six years earlier. The supervisor of the FBI's Atlanta Safe Streets Gang Task Force said in 2016 that more than half of violent crime in the city was involved gang members. In addition to violent crime, drug dealing, and carjacking, some Atlanta gangs committ identity theft and credit card fraud.\n\nAtlanta is now a major transportation hub when it comes to trafficking young girls from Mexico and is one of the fourteen U.S. cities with the highest levels of sex trafficking of children.\n\nIn the year of 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta.\n\nSince Atlanta has “the same ready access to commercial air and ground routes that draws businesses and travelers to Atlanta also entices criminals engaged in human trafficking”. There are numerous events and conventions in Atlanta that bring many people to the city which also exemplifies the issue.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6343", "title": "Czech language", "text": "Czech language\n\nCzech (; \"čeština\" ), historically also Bohemian (; \"lingua Bohemica\" in Latin), is a West Slavic language of the Czech–Slovak group. Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree. Like other Slavic languages, Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German.\n\nThe Czech–Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech–Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of Prague, but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\n\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten monophthongs, three diphthongs and 25 consonants (divided into \"hard\", \"neutral\" and \"soft\" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is not known to occur as a phoneme in any other language, represented by the grapheme \"ř\". Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model.\n\nCzech is a member of the West Slavic sub-branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. This branch includes Polish, Kashubian, Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak. Slovak is the closest language genetic neighbor of Czech, followed by Polish and Silesian.\n\nThe West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe. Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more-restricted distinction between \"hard\" and \"soft\" consonants (see Phonology below).\n\nThe term \"Old Czech\" is applied to the period predating the 16th century, with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as \"early Old Czech\", but the term \"Medieval Czech\" is also used.\n\nAround the 7th century, the Slavic expansion reached Central Europe, settling on the eastern fringes of the Frankish Empire. The West Slavic polity of Great Moravia formed by the 9th century. The Christianization of Bohemia took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the Czech-Slovak group within West Slavic began around that time, marked among other things by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant (/ɣ/) and consistent stress on the first syllable.\n\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the late 13th and early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete Bible translation also dates to this period. Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were produced outside the university as well.\n\nLiterary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the Bohemian Reformation. Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography, advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners (particularly in religion) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.\n\nThere was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century. In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the Trnava region.\n\nThe publication of the Kralice Bible between 1579 and 1593 (the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries.\n\nIn 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the Bohemian Revolt (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the Habsburgs in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the Thirty Years' War had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.\n\nThe modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century. By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty. Changes include the morphological shift of \"í\" to \"ej\" and \"é\" to \"í\" (although \"é\" survives for some uses) and the merging of \"í\" and the former \"ejí\". Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/ which survives in Slovak.\n\nWith the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century, Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the Counter-Reformation (the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages). Czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts, advocating the return of the language to high culture. This period is known as the Czech National Revival (or Renaissance).\n\nDuring the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovský released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled \"Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der böhmischen Sprache\" (\"Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language\"). Dobrovský had intended his book to be descriptive, and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovský's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival. Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably, \"í\" in place of the former \"j\" and \"j\" in place of \"g\"), the use of \"t\" (rather than \"ti\") to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late borrowing from German). These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak. Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.\n\nAdherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech (a widespread, informal register), such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined. This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language.\n\nIn 2005 and 2007, Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic. A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech, the third-highest in the European Union (behind Greece and Hungary).\n\nCzech, the official language of the Czech Republic (a member of the European Union since 2004), is one of the EU's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia. Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages. The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic (98.77 percent), Slovakia (24.86 percent), Portugal (1.93 percent), Poland (0.98 percent) and Germany (0.47 percent).\n\nCzech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities. Since it is a recognised minority language in Slovakia, Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so.\n\nImmigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914. Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools, and is taught at Czech heritage centers. Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas, Nebraska and Wisconsin. In the 2000 United States Census, Czech was reported as the most-common language spoken at home (besides English) in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas. With the exception of Spanish (the non-English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide), Czech was the most-common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota. As of 2009, 70,500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language (49th place nationwide, behind Turkish and ahead of Swedish).\n\nThe modern written standard is directly based on the standardization during the Czech National Revival in the 1830s, significantly influenced by Josef Jungmann's Czech–German dictionary published during 1834–1839. Jungmann used vocabulary of the Bible of Kralice (1579–1613) period and of the language used by his contemporaries. He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms.\n\nStandard Czech contains ten basic vowel phonemes, and three more found only in loanwords. They are , their long counterparts , and three diphthongs, . The latter two diphthongs and the long are exclusive to loanwords. Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed. Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable, except for enclitics (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as most varieties of English).\n\nVoiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word before a pause, and in consonant clusters voicing assimilation occurs, which matches voicing to the following consonant. The unvoiced counterpart of /ɦ/ is /x/. \n\nCzech consonants are categorized as \"hard\", \"neutral\" or \"soft\":\n\n\nThis distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns, which is based on the category of a noun's ending consonant. Hard consonants may not be followed by \"i\" or \"í\" in writing, or soft ones by \"y\" or \"ý\" (except in loanwords such as \"kilogram\"). Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as \"strong\", and soft ones as \"weak\".\n\nThe phoneme represented by the letter \"ř\" (capital \"Ř\") is often considered unique to Czech, but in fact it also occurs in Irish Gaelic in front of a slender vowel, as in the word \"Éire\", the Irish name of Ireland. It represents the raised alveolar non-sonorant trill (IPA: ), a sound somewhere between Czech's \"r\" and \"ž\" (example: ), and is present in \"Dvořák\". In unvoiced environments, /r̝/ is realized as its voiceless allophone [r̝̊]. \n\nThe consonants can be syllabic, acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel. \"Strč prst skrz krk\" (\"Stick [your] finger through [your] throat\") is a well-known Czech tongue twister using only syllabic consonants.\n\nConsonants<br>\nVowels<br>\n\nSlavic grammar is fusional; its nouns, verbs, and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions, and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited. \nSlavic inflection is complex and pervasive, inflecting for case, gender and number in nouns and tense, aspect, mood, person and subject number and gender in verbs.\n\nParts of speech include adjectives, adverbs, numbers, interrogative words, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections. Adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking the final \"ý\" or \"í\" of the base form and replacing it with \"e\", \"ě\", or \"o\". Negative statements are formed by adding the affix \"ne-\" to the verb of a clause, with one exception: \"je\" (he, she or it is) becomes \"není\".\n\nBecause Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence (instead of relying on word order, as English does), its word order is flexible. As a pro-drop language, in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb. Enclitics (primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit. The first slot must contain a subject and object, a main form of a verb, an adverb or a conjunction (except for the light conjunctions \"a\", \"and\", \"i\", \"and even\" or \"ale\", \"but\").\n\nCzech syntax has a subject–verb–object sentence structure. In practice, however, word order is flexible and used for topicalization and focus. Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce the passive voice. For example, to change \"Peter killed\nPaul\" to \"Paul was killed by Peter\" the order of subject and object is inverted: \"Petr zabil Pavla\" (\"Peter killed Paul\") becomes \"Paul, Peter killed\" (\"Pavla zabil Petr\"). \"Pavla\" is in the accusative case, the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb.\nA word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question:\nIn portions of Bohemia (including Prague), questions such as \"Jí pes bagetu?\" without an interrogative word (such as \"co\", \"what\" or \"kdo\", \"who\") are intoned in a slow rise from low to high, quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase.\n\nIn modern Czech syntax, adjectives precede nouns, with few exceptions. Relative clauses are introduced by relativizers such as the adjective \"který\", analogous to the English relative pronouns \"which\", \"that\", \"who\" and \"whom\". As with other adjectives, it is declined into the appropriate case (see Declension below) to match its associated noun, person and number. Relative clauses follow the noun they modify, and the following is a glossed example:\nEnglish: I want to visit the university that John attends.\n\nIn Czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases. Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence. A nominative–accusative language, Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case. The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement. The remaining cases (instrumental, locative, vocative and dative) indicate semantic relationships, such as secondary objects, movement or position (dative case) and accompaniment (instrumental case). An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it describes. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number: \n\nSome Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently, grouping the nominative and accusative (and the dative and locative) together because those declension patterns are often identical; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages, such as Latin or Russian. This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.\n\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, \"od\" (from, away from) and \"z\" (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; \"na\" means \"onto\" or \"for\" with the accusative case, but \"on\" with the locative.\n\nExamples of declension patterns (using prepositions) for a few nouns with adjectives follow. Only one plural example is given, since plural declension patterns are similar across genders.\n\nThis is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:\n\n\"English:\" I carried the box into the house with my friend.\n\nCzech distinguishes three genders—masculine, feminine, and neuter—and the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in \"-a\", \"-e\", or consonant; neuter nouns in \"-o\", \"-e\", or \"-í\", and masculine nouns in a consonant. Adjectives agree in gender and animacy (for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural) with the nouns they modify. The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension, but other effects include past-tense verb endings: for example, \"dělal\" (he did, or made); \"dělala\" (she did, or made) and \"dělalo\" (it did, or made).\n\nNouns are also inflected for number, distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The Czech koruna is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.\nNumerical words decline for case and, for numbers one and two, for gender. Numbers one through five are shown below as examples, and have some of the most exceptions among Czech numbers. The number one has declension patterns identical to those of the demonstrative pronoun, \"to\".\nAlthough Czech's grammatical numbers are singular and plural, several residuals of dual forms remain. Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: \"ruka\" (hand)—\"ruce\" (nominative); \"noha\" (leg)—\"nohama\" (instrumental), \"nohou\" (genitive/locative); \"oko\" (eye)—\"oči\", and \"ucho\" (ear)—\"uši\". While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs. These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in \"mezi čtyřma očima\" (face to face, lit. \"among four eyes\"). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, \"nohy\" (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.\n\nCzech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories. Verbs agree with their subjects in person (first, second or third) and number (singular or plural), and are conjugated for tense (past, present or future). For example, the conjugated verb \"mluvíme\" (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive \"mluvit\" by its ending, \"-íme\".\n\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects: perfective and imperfective. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs—for example, \"koupit\" (perfective) and \"kupovat\" (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing. This is distinct from past and present tense, and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses. Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.\n\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective \"psát\" (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective \"napsat\" (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are \"na-\", \"o-\", \"po-\", \"s-\", \"u-\", \"vy-\", \"z-\" and \"za-\". In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs \"koupit\" (to buy) and \"prodat\" (to sell) have the imperfective forms \"kupovat\" and \"prodávat\". Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb \"jít\" (to go) has the iterative form \"chodit\" (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form \"chodívat\" (to go regularly).\n\nMany verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of being—\"být\" (to be), \"chtít\" (to want), \"moct\" (to be able to), \"ležet\" (to lie down, to be lying down)—have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of change—for example, \"otěhotnět\" (to become pregnant) and \"nadchnout se\" (to become enthusiastic)—have no imperfective aspect.\n\nAlthough Czech's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English, the language uses past tense to represent the English present perfect and past perfect; \"ona běžela\" could mean \"she ran\", \"she has run\" or \"she had run\".\n\nIn some contexts, Czech's perfective present (which differs from the English present perfect) implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action. As a result, the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity. The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future; instead, the future form of \"být\" (as shown in the table at left) is placed before the infinitive (for example, \"budu jíst\"—\"I will eat\").\n\nThis conjugation is not followed by \"být\" itself, so future-oriented expressions involving nouns, adjectives, or prepositions (rather than verbs) omit \"být\". \"I will be happy\" is translated as \"Budu šťastný\" (not \"Budu být šťastný\").\n\nThe infinitive form ends in \"t\" (archaically, \"ti\"). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, \"můžu tě slyšet\"—\"I can \"hear\" you\"). Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: \"-Ø/-i/-ej\" for second-person singular, \"-te/-ete/-ejte\" for second-person plural and \"-me/-eme/-ejme\" for first-person plural. The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \"I would\" or \"I wish\".\nMost Czech verbs fail into one of five classes, which determine their conjugation patterns. The future tense of \"být\" would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings. Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below:\n\nCzech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, \"i\" and \"y\" have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: \"ch\", which follows \"h\" in the alphabet. As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters \"q\", \"w\" and \"x\" appear only in foreign words. The háček (ˇ) is used with certain letters to form new characters: \"š\", \"ž\", and \"č\", as well as \"ň\", \"ě\", \"ř\", \"ť\", and \"ď\" (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (ʼ, an abbreviated háček) because of their height. The character \"ó\" exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.\n\nUnlike most European languages, Czech distinguishes vowel length; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or, occasionally with \"ů\", a ring. Long \"u\" is usually written \"ú\" at the beginning of a word or morpheme (\"úroda\", \"neúrodný\") and \"ů\" elsewhere, except for loanwords (\"skútr\") or onomatopoeia (\"bú\"). Long vowels and \"ě\" are not considered separate letters in the alphabetical order.\n\nCzech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), only the first word is capitalized (\"Pražský hrad\", Prague Castle).\n\nThe main vernacular of Bohemia is \"Common Czech\", based on the dialect of the Prague region.\nOther Bohemian dialects have become marginalized, while Moravian dialects remain more widespread, with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s.\n\nThe main Czech vernacular, spoken primarily in and around Prague but also throughout the country, is known as Common Czech (\"obecná čeština\"). This is an academic distinction; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular (or incorrect) Czech. Compared to standard Czech, Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution.\n\nCommon Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century. It is usually defined as an interdialect used in common speech in Bohemia and western parts of Moravia (by about two thirds of all inhabitants of the Czech Republic). Common Czech is not codified, but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard. \nSince the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of media influence.\nStandard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media.\n\nCommon Czech is characterized by quite regular differences from the standard morphology and phonology. These variations are more or less common among all Common Czech speakers:\n\nExample of declension (with the comparison with the standard Czech):\n\n\"mladý člověk – young man/person, mladí lidé – young people, mladý stát – young state, mladá žena – young woman, mladé zvíře – young animal\"\n\nApart from the Common Czech vernacular, there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialects, mostly in marginal rural areas. Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century, and by the early 1990s regional dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech.\n\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects:\n\nBohemian dialects use a slightly different set of vowel phonemes to standard Czech. The phoneme /ɛː/ is peripheral and is replaced by /iː/, and a second native diphthong /eɪ̯/ occurs, usually in places where standard Czech has /iː/.\n\nThe Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian (\"moravština\"). In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, \"Bohemian-Moravian-Slovak\" was a language citizens could register as speaking (with German, Polish and several others). Of the Czech dialects, only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office. As of 2011, 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were diglossal (speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages).\n\nBeginning in the sixteenth century, some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak; the southeastern Moravian dialects, in particular, are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages, using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak.\n\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects:\n\nIn a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology, Břetislav Koudela used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects:\n\nCzech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages. Since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers, probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa.\n\nIn phonetic differences, Czech is characterized by a glottal stop before initial vowels and Slovak by its less-frequent use of long vowels than Czech; however, Slovak has long forms of the consonants \"r\" and \"l\" when they function as vowels. Phonemic differences between the two languages are generally consistent, typical of two dialects of a language. Grammatically, although Czech (unlike Slovak) has a fully productive vocative case, both languages share a common syntax.\n\nOne study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation; Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, \"Praha\" becomes \"Praze\" in Czech and \"Prahe\" in Slovak). The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech.\n\nThe similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves \"Czechoslavs\" (\"Čechoslované\"), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and (to a lesser extent) Hungarians and other Slavs. During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), although \"Czechoslovak\" was designated as the republic's official language, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II), literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech, due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, \"Czechoslovak\" has referred to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.\n\nCzech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic, Baltic and other Indo-European roots. Although most verbs have Balto-Slavic origins, pronouns, prepositions and some verbs have wider, Indo-European roots. Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words (\"hřbitov\", \"graveyard\" and \"listina\", \"list\").\n\nMost Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods. Earlier loanwords, primarily from German, Greek and Latin, arrived before the Czech National Revival. More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French, and also from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian. Many Russian loanwords, principally animal names and naval terms, also exist in Czech.\n\nAlthough older German loanwords were colloquial, recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture. During the nineteenth century, words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots; \"music\" is \"muzyka\" in Polish and \"музыка\" (\"muzyka\") in Russian, but in Czech it is \"hudba\". Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languages—for example, \"robot\" (from \"robota\", \"labor\") and \"polka\" (from \"polka\", \"Polish woman\" or from \"půlka\" \"half\").\n\nAccording to Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\nCzech: \"Všichni lidé se rodí svobodní a sobě rovní co do důstojnosti a práv. Jsou nadáni rozumem a svědomím a mají spolu jednat v duchu bratrství.\"\n\nEnglish: \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\n\n\n\n"}

This country has few villages, and nearly every family lives in a self-contained compound on a hillside. The urban concentrations are grouped around administrative centers.\n\nOver half of the adult population is literate, but no more than 5% have received secondary education.\n\nThe indigenous population largely consists of three ethnic groups. The Hutus, who comprise the majority of the population (85%), are farmers of Bantu origin. The Tutsis (14% before the Genocide, probably less than 10% now) are a pastoral people who arrived in the area in the 15th century. Until 1959, they formed the dominant caste under a feudal system based on cattleholding.\n\nThe Twa (pygmies) (1%) and Jabiyans are thought to be the remnants of the earliest settlers of the region.\n\nIn 1950, Rwanda had a very narrow population pyramid, with less than 250,000 males and females between 0-10 years old. The graph only gets narrower as it goes up with virtually no-one living past 50 years of age. In 2017, we see the population of Rwanda increase dramatically from 1950 with about 750,000 people between 0-20 years old, the graph remains very narrow in the older ages section but has improved from 1950. By 2050, it is predicted that more people will be living longer and the structure will broaden overall. By 2100, it is predicted that there will be more people aged between 30-60 than between 0-20 as previous years have shown.\n\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to only 2,072,000 in 1950.

{"id": "55908572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55908572", "title": "Domestic violence in the United Kingdom", "text": "Domestic violence in the United Kingdom\n\nDomestic violence in the United Kingdom is a criminal offence; the law says that domestic violence or abuse can be physical, psychological, sexual, financial or emotional.\n\nThe first known use of the term domestic violence in a modern context, meaning violence in the home, was in an address to the Parliament of the United Kingdom by Jack Ashley in 1973. The term previously referred primarily to civil unrest, violence from within a country as opposed to violence perpetrated by a foreign power.\n\nThe Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 (c 28) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is concerned with criminal justice and concentrates upon legal protection and assistance to victims of crime, particularly domestic violence. It also expands the provision for trials without a jury, brings in new rules for trials for causing the death of a child or vulnerable adult, and permits bailiffs to use force to enter homes. \n\nIn 2017 it was reported that the Office for National Statistics's research findings suggested that over 10% of 16-19 year-old women are affected by the issue each year.\n\nGovernment plans to cut funding for women's refuges could make it harder for women and children to escape domestic violence. 2,000 women a year could be affected. 60% of referrals to refuges were turned away in 2016-17 and funding cuts could make the situation worse. Other vulnerable groups will have to compete for funding with refuges against domestic violence and women fleeing domestic violence may be subject to a postcode lottery over whether they can escape or not. Womef fleeing domestic violence are frequently put into grossly unsuitable housing, housing where a toilet leaks and housing overrun with mice are examples. This creates a risk that women will return to the abuser. Other very vulnerable women fleeing domestic abuse are forced to sleep rough.\n\nChanges to legal aid meant 3234 victims had to face their abuser in court without legal support during the first 9 months of 2017, this contrasts with 1309 victims in the first 9 months of 2012. Katie Ghose of Women’s Aid said, “We know that the cross-examination of victims in the family courts by their abusive former partner is far too common. (...) It is a matter of urgency that the government prioritises the implementation of the ban on this abhorrent practice, be it through the courts bill or the domestic violence and abuse bill. Survivors must be able to safely access justice in both the criminal and family courts in their escape from domestic abuse.”\n\n65% of Local Authorities have cut real terms funding for women's refuges in England, Wales and Scotland since 2010. The government plans to make victims of domestic abuse compete with other vulnerable groups for funding for temporary housing. Women fleeing domestic violence will not be eligible for housing benefit; instead there will be limited funding to provide for domestic violence victims, drug addicts, former offenders and homeless people.\n\nWomen's assets are taken into account in deciding if they qualify for legal aid. Frequently women cannot access their assets because the assets are controlled by the abuser. This prevents women getting protection from the courts. Mark Groves of the National Centre for Domestic Violence said, \"While many people think Legal Aid is free, it is not, you have to pay a means-tested contribution. Economic abuse victims who don't control their money may not have this [and] those who have fled the family home may not have the right documentation. If you own a house, you have to put down a cash deposit equal to the equity in that house, which could be hundreds of thousands.\"\n\nSome men have repeatedly killed female partners. In the case of Theodore Johnson, convicted of murder in January 2018 and eventually jailed for a minimum of 30 years, he was found guilty of manslaughter on two previous occasions because of his mental health. Such cases are seen as evidence that violence by men against women is not treated seriously by the authorities.\n\nImmigrants are especially vulnerable to domestic violence. Since 2012 under the hostile environment policy immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse are increasinly deported. \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"The refusal rate for applications under the domestic violence rule rose from 12% in 2012 to 30% in 2016, the last year for which full-year data was available. The figures show that 1,325 people were refused out of a total of 5,820 applications made between 2012 and 2016.\" Abuse victims may be deported based on what the abuser states without their case being heard.\n\nSome people accused of domestic violence intimidate their victims into not appearing in court, then the case against them is dropped. A report, from the police and Northumbria crime commissioner, Dame Vera Baird QC, monitored over 220 cases. It suggests cases where the complainant fails to appear are too easily dismissed and criminal justice services need more resources.\n\nIn Scotland there is an initiative to reduce domestic violence called the 'Equally Safe Strategy'. This involves early intervention in domestic abuse cases affecting women, girls and children. The Caledonian Programme dealing with men convicted of crimes involving domestic abuse will be extpanded to help reduce re-offending and the 'Rape Crisis Sexual Violence Prevention Programme' will also be introduced in more schools. A rape and sexual abuse support service in England and Wales is also receiving a boost.\n\nMost refuges do not have disabled access though disabled women are more likely to experience domestic abuse than able bodied women. One in ten refuge places is accessible to domestic violence victims with physical disabilities. Out of 131 councils 20 had no accessible places at all. 16.8% of women with chronic sickness or disability suffer domestic abuse compared to 6.3% of able bodied women. Domestic abuse can incvolve physical, sexual or emotional abuse, also not providing care from people with long lasting sickness or disability. Council funding for women's refuges overall fell by 6% over the five years to 2018 data from 144 out of 210 UK councils contacted reveals. The largest reduction in spending on domestic violence refuges was from Southampton City Council, which cut spending by 65% since 2013/4.\n"}

{"id": "7447280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7447280", "title": "Heterosociality", "text": "Heterosociality\n\nIn sociology, heterosociality describes social relations with persons of the opposite sex or a preference for such relations, often excluding relationships of a romantic and sexual nature. The opposite of heterosociality is homosociality.\n\nAt an institutional level, the spread of heterosociality, epitomized by the entrance of women into public life/space, is closely associated with the progress of modernization.\n\nThe term \"heterosocial\" can refer to either:\n\nWhether the term can be applied to groups of three or more people has been disputed. One possible argument is that such a group is homosocial if composed of people of a single sex, and bisocial if composed of people of both sexes, since in the latter case each member will be interacting with people of both sexes. On the other hand, \"Collins English Dictionary\" defines heterosocial as \"relating to or denoting mixed-sex social relationships\", without specification of whether it applies to relationships between two people or among larger groups, suggesting that the term can describe social interactions involving people of both sexes more generally.\n\nThe pervasiveness of heterosociality in contemporary life can lead to the obscuring of its social construction as a late development in Western history. Writing of early society, Freud considered that there was \"an unmistakable tendency to keep the sexes apart. Women live with women, men with men\". Durkheim associated sexual totemism, binding men and women into two separate totemic corporations, with such a social division of the sexes. Even in the twentieth century, rules of etiquette in some traditional villages dictated that men and women do not greet each other when passing in public.\n\nUrbanization and modernization have seen a gradual erosion of the barriers to male/female socialising, not without significant culture wars along the way over each particular new arena. Thus for example part of the hostility to the Elizabethan theatre lay in the fact that men and women freely intermingled in its audience; while dance halls and cabarets later offered similarly controversial new areas for heterosocial interaction, as too did amusement parks.\n\nIn the 21st century, the challenge presented to traditional societies by the way the discourse of modernity encourages heterosociality over an older homosociality continues to be a live issue.\n\nThe 20th century opening up of the public sphere to women—work, politics, culture, education—both fuelled, and was fed by, the feminist movement; but the increase in heterosociality which accompanied it was seen as double-edged by many feminists. On the one hand, it served to undercut older feminist homosocial bonds and support systems; on the other, it split the new feminist movement, as calls for separatist feminism challenged heterosociality, let alone heterosexuality, in ways many found unacceptable.\n\nPost-feminism has generally accepted heterosociality, along with a new strategy of gender mainstreaming, but not without reservations as to the exploitative aspects of (for example) raunch culture within the new 21st century public gender regime.\n\nAcquiring heterosocial competence is a key adolescent task. Other-sex friendships, even more than romances, can play a key role in this process.\n\nDifferent societies and different subcultures place varying restrictions upon adolescent heterosocial roles and opportunities. American teen culture in particular has been seen as aggressively promoting heterosociality over homosociality.\n\nThe advancement of culture was seen by Henry James as linked to heterosociality. Similarly, Kenneth Clark saw the flourishing of 18th-century French culture as rooted in the heterosociality of the salon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25008725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25008725", "title": "Human trafficking in Germany", "text": "Human trafficking in Germany\n\nGermany is a European source, point of transit, organization and destination country for women, children, and men subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor.\n\nThe Government of Germany complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but has not implemented European Union recommendations to reduce sexual slavery. The government made substantial progress in addressing forced labor. Available statistics indicate the majority of convicted labor and sex trafficking offenders were not required to serve time in prison, raising concerns that punishments were inadequate to deter traffickers.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 1\" in 2017.\n\nNinety percent of identified victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation came from Europe, including 28 percent from Germany, 20 percent from Romania, and 18 percent from Bulgaria. Non-European victims originated in Nigeria, other parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Almost one-quarter of identified trafficking victims were children. The majority of identified sex trafficking victims have been exploited in bars, brothels, and apartments – approximately one third of identified sex trafficking victims reported that they had agreed initially to engage in prostitution. Victims of forced labor have been identified in hotels, domestic service, construction sites, and restaurants. Police estimate that gangs brought around 1,000 Chinese people to Germany over the past decade and forced them to work in restaurants under exploitative conditions. Members of ethnic minorities, such as Roma, as well as foreign unaccompanied minors who arrived in Germany, were particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.\n\nMost convicted traffickers are not required to serve time in prison, however, the Government of Germany made some progress regarding the conviction of sex and labor trafficking offenders. Germany prohibits all forms of trafficking; trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation is criminalized in Section 232 of its Penal Code, and forced labor is criminalized under Section 233. Prescribed punishments in these statutes range from six months’ to 10 years’ imprisonment.\n\nIt is common practice for judges in Germany to suspend prison sentences of two years or less for all crimes, including trafficking. Authorities prosecuted 173 persons for sex trafficking in 2008, the last year for which statistics were available. Of those, 138 were convicted, including seven juveniles, up from 123 convictions for sex trafficking in 2007. Of the 131 adults convicted, 92 – or 70 percent – received either a fine or a suspended sentence. Prison sentences for the remainder ranged from two to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nAuthorities prosecuted 25 persons for labor trafficking in 2008; 16 were convicted, including seven juveniles, up from eight labor trafficking convictions in 2007. Of the nine adult labor trafficking offenders, one received a sentence of between three and five years imprisonment and the remaining eight received suspended sentences or fines. Police boosted efforts against labor trafficking in 2008—more than 1,300 police officers and customs officials took part in raids in several cities. There were no reports of trafficking-related complicity of government officials during the reporting period. The government, in partnership with NGOs, provided a range of specialized anti-trafficking training to judges, prosecutors, and police. The federal criminal police counter-trafficking office coordinated international trafficking cases and promoted partnership with other countries by offering training programs for foreign law enforcement.\n\nThe German government provided economical means with a value of €500,000 for victim protection during the reporting period. The Federal Family Ministry used the funds to capitalize an umbrella organization representing 39 NGOs and counseling centers that provided or facilitated shelter, medical and psychological care, legal assistance, and other services for victims. The majority of these NGOs focused on adult, female victims; however, a number of NGOs, in cooperation with local governmental youth welfare services, also attended to child victims. Some of these NGOs also made their services available to male victims. The government continued to distribute formal guidelines on victim identification techniques to police, counseling centers, prosecutors and judges. According to the federal police, authorities pro-actively identified 38 percent of all victims registered by the government in 2008. Authorities registered 676 sex trafficking victims and 96 forced labor victims in 2008, down from 689 sex trafficking victims and 101 forced labor victims identified in 2007. Formal victim referral mechanisms existed in 12 out of 16 German states. The government publicly encourages victims to cooperate in anti-trafficking investigations; however, police and NGOs reported that victims were often reluctant to assist law enforcement officials due to fear of retribution from traffickers. The government provided legal alternatives to foreign victims’ deportation to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. Trafficking victims were provided a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to cooperate with investigators.\n\nVictims who agreed to act as witnesses were only provided temporary residence permits for the duration of trial proceedings, and in very rare circumstances long-term residence permits, such as when the victim faced severe threats in the country of origin.\n\nThe government reportedly did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. The governmental German Institute for Human Rights in July 2009 began a $800,000 project to assist trafficking victims in claiming their financial rights in German courts, as some victims had made claims for financial compensation.\n\nThe government made some progress in trafficking prevention activities during the reporting period. The government sustained funding for NGOs that produced public awareness campaigns in Germany and abroad through websites, postcards, telephone hotlines, pamphlets, and speaking engagements.\n\nThe government did not take measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts or focus public awareness on potential clients in some of Germany’s best known red light districts, such as the one in Hamburg. A Berlin NGO, funded largely by the Berlin Senate, operated a trafficking awareness website directed at clients of the sex trade. The German Federal Police published an annual report containing statistics about its anti-trafficking activities. The Labor Ministry commissioned a study in 2009 to assess the extent of and government response to labor trafficking. The Federal Family Ministry, which has the responsibility for implementing the national anti-trafficking action plan, chaired a federal-state interagency working group on female sex trafficking. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributed approximately $297,000 toward anti-trafficking projects in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Mekong region. The government sustained a partnership with ECPAT to promote awareness of the child sex tourism problem; there were no reports of new prosecutions for child sex tourism by German citizens abroad during the reporting period. The government provided trafficking awareness training to commanders of German military units prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions; the training focused on how the commanders could sensitize subordinates to human trafficking.\n\n"}
{"id": "46843136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46843136", "title": "Ijigban community", "text": "Ijigban community\n\nThe Ijigban is one of the twenty-two districts found in Idoma land today. It occupies a land stretching from the southernmost part of Idoma to the fringes of Igbo land particularly, the Abakaliki Division. They fall within borderline of the Idoma ethnic group and the Ezza/Izze in the Northern part of Igbo land. The 2006 census figures numbered the Ijigban people to about 22,360. The people lived on a long bounded Northwest by the Igumale; Ulayi in the West; Utonkon in the North; Ekele and Igede to the Northeast and the Ezza/Izze Igbo in the south. The district is however located at the southernmost part of Ado local government area, and consisted of seven clans namely (according to seniority). Okpe, Ipole, Ehaje, Ogongo, Adegemi, Onogwu and Ai-Okpan, that collectively made up of two political wards.\n\nThe traditions of origin of the Ijigban, like the traditions of origins of many Nigerian, including the Idoma peoples as a whole is highly problematic. The word \"Origins\" in the strict anthropological sense refers to the emergence of a species of either plant or animal as distinct from another species\". Traditions of origin in the context of Ijigban here are stories which people use to explain where their ancestors came from. As well as how they arrived at the place they presently occupy. Although traditions of origins often time yield towards the Hamitic hypothesis. The case of the Ijigban people of the southern Ado is quite unique, given evidence under available sources. In this wise, we shall adopt a comprehensive approaches to examine the various versions of the Ijigban’s traditions of origin.\n\nThe origin of this people forms a complex aspect of their pre-colonial historical information. Some of the earlier sources including the colonial once are mostly inadequate and contradicting. For instance, in attempt to trace this people’s origin, A.G. Armstrong asserted that the people of Ijigban, Ekele and Ulayi traced their traditions of origins to the Ngor in Ogoja province and are closely related. He therefore quoted Simey \"that the Igumale, Ulayi, Agila and Ijigban are closely related, and all entered the area at about the same time and there are definite boundaries between these clans based on hunting right\". His description of the people by name referred to as \"Ijigbam-Ishieke\" was not only contradicting but also has generated derogatory pitfall because, while the Ijigban people are one section of the original Idoma, the same could not be true about the Ishieke people of the Abakaliki. So how come \"Ijigbam-Ishieke\"? In another dimension, the Agila and the Ijigban (including Igumale, Ulayi and Utonkon alike) did not come to this present abode at the same time as claimed by Simey and supported by A.G. Armstrong. Reason been that while Agila traced the traditional of origin to \"western origins\" C. 165-1775, the Ijigban alongside Igumale attributed theirs to \"Eastern origins\" C. 1535–1745. For instance, according to E.O Erim, \"The modern Agila district in Idomaland recalled that their ancestor Ago, who moved out from areas south of Idah C. 1625 – 1655, was of Bini extraction. He was the son of an unnamed Oba of Benin\". The point we are trying to put across here, is that while Ijigban, Igumale claimed Apa as their traditional home land, the people of Agila may ignore that. At this juncture, R.G. Armstrong account could be say to be devoid of empirical historical fact.\n\nR. G. Armstrong for one reason failed to understand that Ijigban who begot the seven sons that made up seven clans of Ijigban district today is begotten by Ogene, and Ogene a son of great Edor who traced his ancestral homeland to Apa 1 that is presently occupied by the Tiv. On the other hand, the Ishieke (as earlier observed) is a sub-clan of Izzi – Igbo who for all historical evidence have nothing to do with Idoma traditions of origins. If the Ijigban people are different from Izzi sub-clan (Ishieke) Igbo, where then was the origins of \"Ijigbam-Ishieke\"? From this above evidence (or called it myth), it is possible that the nomenclature ‘Ijigbam-Ishieke’ came as a result of the colonial \"pacification\" of the area, just like the early travelers and colonial officers referred to the whole Idoma as \"Akpoto\". Nonetheless, ignoring this biasness, his (R.G Armstrong) work is still a valuable source of information.\n\nHowever, according to one informant, Chief Oriri Otseje (the District Head and Custodian of Ijigban History), As a result of the last war fought in Apa 1, (What Ochefu referred to as horse war), sacked heroes such as Ago, Ale and Edor, and that these leaders on the basis of hunting rights, founded their various settlements.\n\nAnother informant said that the traditions of origin of the Ijigban could be traced to Apa. Although, no particular historical period was given but that they migrated from Apa and they settled at various places including Izzekatton (or Izzekato) near Iyala in Cross-River for many years. Problems developed in Izzekatton as a result of Izze several attacks. He finally concludes thus; We met the Izze arrived after our ancestors. Soon, the Izze started menacing us (our ancestors) destroying their crops and domestic animals. Menace lasted for some years. The Izze killed several of our people. When the Izze overpowered my ancestor, the latter fled to another settlement called Iyede. He notes Iyede to be the present day Nyimegu where Izzegodo live today in North East part of Abakaliki. Resulting from push and pull factors, especially lacked of water and continuous Ezza disturbances, the Ijigban in a process of hunting found a stream where they later migrated to, because of the availability of water. He referred to this settlement as Ole-Efuu (native home). At Ole-Efuu, an Englishman whose name was not disclosed, demanded that Agbo who was then their king should crossed the stream and settled in present-day Ijigban District where his subjects in an earnest joined him.\n\nErim O. Erim also acknowledges these facts when he expresses that within the period C. 1685-1805, various invasion were made on Apa 1. He further agrees that; the Tiv whose demand for land and food always seemed to be insatiable. It is thus clear that it was the Tiv invasion which forced several Idoma groups to abandon their Apa 1 homeland and migrated to the south. At the south, there were the challenges of refugees as a result of \"severe famine\" in the present day Igumale. Though Ale during this famine had already established an extensive corn-farm (igu) and shortly, the corn got finished thereby forcing out other refugees to migrated further south looking for protection and safety. Also agreed with elder Onoja Agbo’s oral account, \"that the Ijigban migrated from Izzekatto and Iyede due to unending problems\", Erim established that; between C. 1685–1805 of the last phase of the eastern origins, five kindred’s came north moving away from unrest in Abakaliki region… fights for land between the various inhabitants of that country.\n\nNote that the essence of this comparism account is to arrive at acceptable empirical historical evidence. From the above explanation also, the traditions of origin and migration of this people (Ijigban) could be seen as gradual process unlike the first version of Armstrong that \"the people of Ijigban, Ekele and Ulayi came from Ngor in Ogoga province and are closely related\". Indeed, according to intensive socio-political and economic interactions between the Ijigban and the Ishieke people in the pre-colonial period prior to colonial advent would have promoted a group like \"Ijigbam-Ishieke\". Added to the ongoing, Ochefu noted that the Ijigban (but spelled Ijigbam in his work), Agila, recognize \"Apa\" as their ancestral homeland from where they migrated to their present location. From every indication, by the middle of the eighteenth century, these proto-Idoma (of which Ijigban is included) groups, which claimed \"eastern origins\" had been pushed by a variety of factors into their second and from their second into a third homeland, of what could be regarded as modern settlement. And by 1800, the southern Portions (which Ijigban is a part) of modern Idomaland had already been settled. On the departure, the Ijigbam among other six Idoma kindred’s, adopted the Black monkey totem (iho) as part of indication of royal kindreds in Apa1. As noted earlier, the major cause of this migration was the invasion of the Tiv who were in process of incorporating the whole of Apa 1 into their homeland. Coincidentally, the expansion of the Keana Confederacy and troubles in Abakaliki to the south added to the pressures on the Idoma, inducing them to move.\n\nSettlement is a major component of rural land use and created in space for the purpose of living as well as a basis for man’s economic and political activities geared towards growth and development. By this, we mean that settlements are man’s first step towards self-adaptation to his envirionment33. Human settlement patterns involve physical and socio-economic or cultural factors. These two sets of factors determine the stable nature of interaction among the people and outside the district.\n\nThe settlement patterns and development of Ijigban District is based on their respective clans (Ipo-opu). But firstly, what is Ijigban district today could be traced to advent of colonial administration and the arrival of Captain John A.D.O. (Administrator Divisional Officer) at Okpoga Native Authority on 23 March, 192134. Consequently, the Okpoga Native Authority was moved to Otukpo on 7 February 1924, later Idoma Native Authority where the twenty-two (Including Ijigban) districts in Idomaland were recognised.\n\nHowever, the Ijigban’s seven sons made up of the seven clans (Ipo-Opu) whose settlements are separated from each other respectively. These seven clans are according to seniority; Okpe clan who settled in the north-east of Ijigban and have boundaries with Ogogo (North), Ai-Okpan (East) and Onogwu and part of Ehaje in the centre; The Ipole live at the entrance (i.e. south west) and have – boundaries with Adegemi and part of Ogogo-Ole-Ogaba-Ede; Ehaje settled in the center stretching to the South and Ogogo at the North Adegemi is in between Ipole and Ogogo; Onogwu in south east respectively. Each of these clans (Ipo-Opu) further developed an out skirt settlements. For instance, Odumuke is an out skirt of Ipole, just like Anmeka is for Ehaje etc.\n\nIn Ijigban, the compound (Ododa-Ole) layouts shows that the majority of the houses face inwards onto one or more court-yards. Each compound may be occupied by members of an extended family or by a man, his wife and siblings. One or more junior men may assert their independence by settling up their compounds.\n\nHowever, streets are not named or numbered in Ijigban, and visitors to the town often have to rely on elaborate description of the location of houses. Having said all these generally, the settlement pattern is naturally lineal in most cases quite unlike Igumale and Agila, and clustered to one another with motorable road at the middle. Not until the 1990s, most of the houses were thatched roof characterized with local mud’s with distinctive style of compound. Each clan has its own playground (Ofu) where dances, festival gatherings and meetings are held and paths lead from this playground (Ofu) to the various compounds that make up the quarter, that is the clan. In each of these clans, the name of the group is usually quite literally \"the sons of… (ai). The clan (Ipoopu) here means\" those of one playground or council ground.\nAmong the factors that led to the gradual development process of Ijigban district was economic. Markets were organized often four to five days interval where household items, out of surpluses and demand were exchanged. Agricultural practices such as communal and cooperative farming (Igbe-Opiatoha) among Age-set associations facilitated the development. As opined by Gordon Childe and popularized by Erim; …invention of agriculture automatically brought about surplus food which enabled groups of people to divorce themselves from food production and devote attention to other occupations. This situation created extensive division of labour… it was from this occupational specialization that political integration emerged.\n\nWith the conducive atmosphere and availability of food, settlement was encouraged, men and women encouraged to engaged on activities that geared toward development. The inter and intra marriages also played vital role in the developmental process. Settlement due to the above factors become complex, in addition to emergence of schools in the area. Before the civil war, schools at the elementary level mostly class 4 and 6 prevailed through efforts of some indigenes. One informant stated that;… We used our money to buy schools (that is 3 pounds) and teachers… we housed and fed them…He maintained that first school in the district was the initiative of Chief Agbo, located at Abizzen (present Ipole). He acknowledged the Chief (Oche) as hardworking man, who before colonial advent had transverse across borders. He was also the tax-collector during the colonial period and was a member of Idoma council of Chiefs (1929–1933 where he was known as Agboonma) representing Ijigban district. Other initiators of schools in this area were Eji Oduma (for Odumuke School, Oriri Otseje (for Anmeka School) The later Catholic school as also established at Anmeka by Basel Otseje after his arrival from the popular Burma war (that is the Second World War 1939-1945) although collapsed due to the prevailing Oriri’s school. It is important to note that all the first phase of the developmental plans and achievements were destroyed during the Nigerian civil war (1967–1970).\n\nThe development of Ijigban district which would be described as second phase, came on board probably two years after the civil war. Period coincided will the installation of Chief Oriri Otseje on 26 April 1972. However, since the 1970s, gradual development were remarkable including two primary schools, bore-hole of various capacity as well as the propose electricity. Attempt of building a secondary school since the 1980s failed, except that of recent Universal Basic Education (UBE) programme which can be found in its embryonic stage at the moment.\n\nFinally the advent of modern networking and the expansion of subsistence economy coincided with its monetization and introduction of new modern communications like road and networking services, contributed to the growth and development of the Ijigban district. The settlement pattern did not only which not only ensures proximity to work place but subsequently reduces the amount of energy spent on conquering distance since the community travels primarily on foot to farm and market as the case may be.\n\nFrom the preceding, the chapter has examined the location of Ijigban and also accounted for the physical geographical features. It has traced the origin of the people through different accounts. It has sought to amended the nomenclature \"Ijigbam-Ishieke\" by foreigners (especially Simey and R.G. Armstrong). Whatever the case may be, settlement pattern and how it has led to gradual development of the district has also be noted. It has held that the development of the district came in two phases: Before and after the Nigerian civil war (1967–1970).\n\nIn determining and ascertaining the general extent of linguistic diversity of a locality in any given socio-linguistic survey, one is often confronted with the methodological problem of accurate identification, isolation, classification and enumeration of the various languages, dialects and sublets concerned.\nThis difficulty is compounded by the lack of clear distinction between the concepts of 'language' and 'ethnicity'. Over the years, linguists have increasingly reasoned with P. K. Bleambo's position that language and ethnicity are neither coincidental nor coterminous 46. This suggests in essence that some ethnic groups and their indigenes should be considered more as dialect clusters of the language of some larger ethno-cultural groups. The case of the Ijigban is evident enough in this regard.\n\nStudies in historical and comparative linguistics have empirically shown that Ijigban for all intents and purposes is a linguistic and not an ethnic appellation. The Ijigban predominantly speaks the Abize’s language – a subsidiary of the Idoma tongue.\n\nThe ijigban consists of seven clans namely\nEach clan is traditionally governed by the clan’s head regarded as \"Ejira\".\nThe ijigban as a community is headed by the district head regarded as the \"oche' ijigban\" who is often regarded as the custodian of the ijigban tradition\n\nThe ijigban community celebrates three yearly cultural festivals namely\nThe cultural practice by the ijigban community varies from clan to clan. While the people of Ipole, Ehaje, Onogwu, Okpe, Adegimi, and Ai’okpan warship unaroko as the idole of their fore-fathers, the Ogongo people idoled Arikwu.\n\nHon Chief Aboh Edeh became the first elected chairman of Ado LGC from Ijigban Origin. Notable Personalities from Ijigban are Hon. Agbo Aboh (frontline graduate and the first executive chairman of Ado from Ijigban origin), Hon. Emmanuel Oketa (Late) (once a powerful political block and mobilizer), Engr Simon Oketa, Hon. (Dr.) Francis Ottah Agbo, Hon. Barr Alexander Oketa. Other notable persons are Patrick Onumah, Sunday Orinya, Evang. Sunday Onah, Amos Odega, Hon A. P Oketa and numerous others.\n\n"}
{"id": "2210287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210287", "title": "Indo-Guyanese", "text": "Indo-Guyanese\n\nIndo-Guyanese or Indian-Guyanese, are Guyanese people with heritage from the Indian subcontinent (including modern-day Bangladesh and Pakistan). Linguistically, they are historical speakers of North Indian Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi and Bhojpuri, however some Indian immigrants also historically spoke South Indian Dravidian languages such as Tamil. As immigrants, Indo-Guyanese people originated from different parts of India and they have traditionally been known as \"Indians\" in Guyana. Indo-Guyanese are the largest ethnic group in Guyana identified by the official census, making up 39.8% of the population in 2012.\n\nOn May 5, 1838, the year of finalized abolition slave emancipation in the British West Indies and the beginning of the indentured labor system, 396 Indian immigrants popularly known as the 'Gladstone Coolies' landed in British Guiana (now Guyana) from Calcutta (now Kolkata). This was the beginning of the indenture system which was to continue for over three-quarters of a century and whose essential features were very reminiscent of slavery. Within a decade Indian immigration was largely responsible for changing the fortunes of the sugar industry, the mainstay of the economy, from the predicted 'ruin' to prosperity.\n\nUp to the early 1860s recruits in North India were drawn from in and around Calcutta and from the Chota Nagpur plateau, a sub-division of the Bengal Presidency about two to three hundred miles from Calcutta . Recruiting operations were pushed further north-westwards and the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (Modern Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar became the main suppliers of colonial labor.\n\nThe importation of labor from the Indian subcontinent was part of a continuing search by Guianese planters for a labor force that was docile, reliable and amenable to discipline under harsh, tropical conditions. Emancipation had conferred on the Guianese laborers both physical and occupational mobility. The majority of Indian immigrants were drawn from small villages in North India with smaller batches coming from the Tamil and Telugu districts of South India. They were recruited, very often on spurious promises, by professional recruiters, largely assisted by paid local agents called \"Arkatis\" in North India and \"Maistris\" in South India.\n\nThis system of recruitment by local agents formed the backbone of all recruiting operations from the inception of the system to its cessation in 1917. Intimidation, coercion, and deception were very often used to recruit Indian laborers. Women, in particular, were very vulnerable. When laborers were difficult to enlist, the recruiters resorted to such illegal practices as kidnapping and forced detention. Many recruited to be shipped off the Caribbean, were falsely advised on where they were heading. Names of places would be altered, to fit a higher meaning. For example, recruiters told migrants, heading to Dutch Suriname they were heading to Sri-Ram, instead of Suriname, taking into account, Ram in the Hindu religion means, a religious place where good triumphs evil.\n\nWith a need for labor, after the slave emancipation within British territory in 1834, the recruited Indian immigrants set sail for Guiana and other British West Indian territories. Upon arrival, the newly transplanted indentured servants were forced to adapt to extreme tropical conditions, along with their new working contract working conditions. Between 1835 and 1918, 341,600 indentured laborers from India were imported into British Guiana.\n\nWith the increase of Indians laborers, hostility and fear of being undermined derived from the existing working class of newly free slaves in British Guiana. Treatment of the newly arrived immigrants was horrendous, and they were pushed into isolated communities.\n\nThe indentured servants were required to sign a contract, the terms binding their service to a plantation for five years, while earning a fixed daily wage. Once this five-year period had passed, they would have another five years of industrial residence in Guiana, then they were entitled to free repatriation. At the end of the contract, laborers either returned to India or stayed in British Guiana. Those who stayed received land and money to create their own businesses.\n\nThe prospect of sexual relations with Indian women was at first unappealing to the original mostly male Chinese migrants to Guyana even though there was a lack of Chinese women.The prospect of sexual relations with Chinese men was not only unappealing but frowned upon by Indians. Economic circumstances and lack of opportunity for Indian women to find Indian partners gave the women no choice. Eventually their attitude changed and Indian women and Chinese men established sexual relationships with each other as happened in Mauritius. Chinese men had to marry women of other ethnicities due to the lack of Chinese women migrating to British Guiana. Creole sexual relationships and marriages with Chinese and Indians were rare, however, more common was Indian women and Chinese men establishing sexual relations with each other and some Chinese men took their Indian wives back with them to China.\n\nOver time, although there were more Creole marriages with Chinese, there was a growth of Indian marriages with Chinese. In 1891, Dr. Comins reported that \"[i]t is not an uncommon thing to find a cooly woman living with a Chinaman as his wife, and in one or two instances the woman has accompanied her reputed husband to China\", with six Indian women marrying Chinese men in 1892 as reported by The Immigration Report for 1892.\n\nOn plantations white European managers took advantage of and used indentured Indian woman for sex. In addition, English, Portuguese, and Chinese men were also in sexual relationships with Indian women as noted by Attorney General W.F. Haynes Smith, while Creole women were abhorred or ignored by Indian men.\n\nThe low ratio of Indian women to Indian men, along with the factor of Portuguese, white overseers and managers, and Chinese men having sexual relations with Indian women, aggravated the problem of rivalry for Indian women between Indian men, and drove up the value of Indian women. The deficit in Indian women compared to men was caused by the recruitment quota ratio of 100 men to 40 women; most of the women were young and single. The shortage of Indian women for Indian men was aggravated when Indian women were taken by Africans and European overseers, leading to high amounts of wife murders against Indian woman by Indian men.\n\nThe Guyanese-Indian journalist Gaiutra Bahadur wrote about the experiences of Indian women. Sex was utilized as a potent instrument by a few Indian women such as when they obtained favors from overseers by having sex with them, and the women could either have been \"imperiled\" or \"empowered\" when forming sexual relations with overseers.\n\nSexual abuse, horrible living standards, and tough work were all things Indian women had to contend with.\n\nUnlike the African slaves, the East Indian indentured workers were permitted to retain some of their cultural traditions. But the process of assimilation has made the culture of the modern Indo-Guyanese more homogeneous than that of their immigrant ancestors.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1917 over 500 ship voyages with 238,909 indentured Indian immigrants came to Guyana; while just 75,898 of them or their children returned. The vast majority came from the Hindustani (or Hindi) speaking areas of North India. The most popular dialect spoken was Bhojpuri (spoken in east Uttar Pradesh and west Bihar), followed by Awadhi (spoken in central Uttar Pradesh). 62% of the immigrants came from districts that are now part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh; 21% from districts that are now part of Bihar state; 6% were from pre-partitioned Bengal; 3% from what are today Orissa and Jharkhand states; 3% from what is today Tamil Nadu state; 3% from Central India, 1% from pre-partitioned Punjab - and the remaining 1% from the rest of India.\n\nThe religious breakdown was 85% Hindu, 15% Muslims.\n\nIndenture documents show Hindu by caste: 11% were Brahmin, Bhumihar, Chatri, Rajput and Thakur castes; 1% were of the merchant or writer castes; 30% were of the medium agricultural castes; 9% were of the artisan castes; 2% were of the petty trading castes; 2% were of fishermen and boatmen castes; 25% were from menial or dalit castes; 3% were Hindus who were Madrasis; 2% were Hill Coolies or Tribals. The only acknowledgment the colonial government and the plantation managers gave to caste differences was their distrust of the Brahmins as potential leaders.\n\nEast Indian workers were housed together and placed in work gangs without consideration of caste, and no solidified caste groups survived the early colonial period. \n\nGuyanese Hindus continue to observe holidays such as Phagwah also known outside the country as Holi (burning of Holika) and Diwali (festival of lights) among others while Muslims celebrate the holidays Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Through British influence, celebrating holidays such as Christmas and Easter, is common regardless of religious beliefs. In Guyana, Indian Arrival Day is celebrated on May 5 commemorating the first arrival of indentured servants from India to the country, on May 5, 1838. On this day, the workers arrived to work in sugar plantations.\n\nAmong Hindus and Muslims, arranged, comparatively early marriages were common in rural areas until the modern period (early 1960s) but are rare now. Middle-class Indians had greater freedom in choosing a spouse, especially if the woman was a professional. As in most parts of the western world marriage now occurs later, and the family unit is smaller than in the past. Indo Guyanese families are patriarchal with an extended system, where family members assist each other, like many other groups in Guyana. For individuals who are Hindu, wedding ceremonies are now performed with the bride and groom dressed in traditional Indian clothing, as an expression of their culture. If it can be afforded there is usually a Hindu wedding ceremony and also a western or \"regular\" wedding reception, or a small Hindu ceremony and a much larger \"reception\" so friends from the larger community can attend.\n\nWith the blending of cultures in the Caribbean Indo Caribbean dishes became one of the dominant notes throughout most of the English Caribbean, with dishes such as curry and roti, dal puri. Dishes that survived the colonial period include gulab jamun, parasad, kheer known as \"sweet rice\", and seven curry, and other dishes associated with religious functions. In Guyana, among the Indo-Guyanese people, it is popular to eat fried vegetables such as okra or \"okro\", pumpkin, bitter melon or \"karela\", long beans or \"bora\", and eggplant known as \"baigan\" or \"balanjay.\" \n\nThe Indo-Guyanese community has always had great admiration for Bollywood, the Hindi film industry. Bollywood movies and songs have had a huge impact upon the Guyanese pop culture since the early 1950s. Many Bollywood stars have visited and performed in Guyana like megastars Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla, and Preity Zinta, also very popular singers such as Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, Shreya Ghoshal, Udit Narayan, Sunidhi Chauhan, and Kumar Sanu have had very successful shows in Guyana.In 1980, Lata Mangeshkar, one of the most beloved singers in Guyana, was greeted with crowds of fans and was presented with the key of the city of Georgetown, Guyana on her visit. Indian soap operas have recently grown in popularity in Guyana. The most popular genres of music among Indo-Guyanese people include Chutney music, Soca music, Indian music, and Chutney soca. Popular music artists include Sundar Popo, Terry Gajraj, Rakesh Yankaran, and most definitely Babla & Kanchan. Indian instrumental influence can be seen in Guyana through the use of the tabla, harmonium, dholak, dhantal, and tassa drums.\n\nIndo-Guyanese women have always been a great asset to beauty pageants in Guyana. Most notable Miss Guyana is Shakira Baksh, the 1967 Miss Guyana, who went on to become a runner-up at the Miss World 1967 pageant and later married popular British actor Michael Caine. Rafieya Husain, Miss Guyana World 2014, won the ‘Beauty With a Purpose Title’, received the Miss World Caribbean, and became a contestant in the Final 10 at the Miss World 2014 pageant. Alana Seebarran, Miss India Guyana, won the Miss India Worldwide 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bieber went on to work at Yale Medical College, New York University, and starting in 1953 at the New York Medical College, where he taught a course in psychoanalysis. Bieber was, along with Lionel Ovesey and Charles Socarides, one of the most influential American psychoanalysts who attempted to convert gay men to heterosexuality. Bieber's 1962 book \"\" was a counter reaction to the 1948 Kinsey Report on male sexual behavior. It remained the leading study on homosexuality until homosexuality was removed from DSM-III in 1973.\n\nIn 1970, Bieber attended a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco that was protested by gay activists. According to Socarides, Bieber, who felt he had \"been working all these years to help these people\", \"took this very hard.\" In 1973, the same year the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, Bieber told an interviewer that \"a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim.\" When Alan P. Bell, Martin S. Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith's study \"Sexual Preference\" was published in 1981, Bieber declared that its findings were \"totally disparate\" with his experience from psychiatric consultation.\n\nBieber arranged a partial translation into English of a paper by the Hungarian pediatrician S. Lindner, who had reported a systematic study of sucking. Sigmund Freud had used Lindner's observation that sensual sucking seems to absorb the attention completely and leads to either sleep or an orgasm-like response to develop his theory of infantile sexuality. Bieber pointed out what he saw as inaccuracies in Freud's use of this paper.\n\nBieber died in Manhattan in 1991.\n\n\"Homosexuality\" offered a view of homosexuality as an illness that has since been discredited. The book has been criticized for examining homosexuals already in analytic treatment as opposed to non-patient heterosexuals. It has been suggested that the study informed stereotypes later promulgated by the media. For example, in 1964 \"Life\" magazine featured an article on homosexuals and smothering mothers directly inspired by this study. Despite its discrediting, \"Homosexuality\" continued to be read and taught in psychopathology courses in universities in the 1980s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "434937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=434937", "title": "King of Italy", "text": "King of Italy\n\nKing of Italy (Latin: \"Rex Italiae\"; Italian: \"Re d'Italia\") was the title given to the ruler of the Kingdom of Italy after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The first to take the title was Odoacer, a \"barbarian\" military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\n\nA Kingdom of Italy was restored from 1805 to 1814 with Napoleon as its only king, centered in Northern Italy. It was not until the Italian unification in the 1860s that a Kingdom of Italy covering the entire peninsula was restored. From 1861 the House of Savoy held the title of \"King of Italy\" until the last king, Umberto II, was exiled in 1946 when Italy became a republic.\n\nAfter the deposition of the last Western Emperor in 476, Heruli leader Odoacer was appointed \"Dux Italiae\" (\"Duke of Italy\") by the reigning Byzantine Emperor Zeno. Later, the Germanic \"foederati,\" the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, proclaimed Odoacer \"Rex Italiae\" (\"King of Italy\"). In 493, the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great killed Odoacer, and set up a new dynasty of kings of Italy. Ostrogothic rule ended when Italy was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in 552.\n\nIn 568, the Lombards entered the peninsula and ventured to recreate a barbarian kingdom in opposition to the Empire, establishing their authority over much of Italy, except the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchies of Rome, Venetia, Naples and the southernmost portions. In the 8th century, estrangement between the Italians and the Byzantines allowed the Lombards to capture the remaining Roman enclaves in northern Italy. However, in 774, they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who deposed their king and took up the title \"king of the Lombards\". After the death of Charles the Fat in 887, Italy fell into instability and a number of kings attempted to establish themselves as independent Italian monarchs. During this period, known as the Feudal Anarchy (888–962), the title \"Rex Italicorum\" (\"King of the Italians\" or \"King of the Italics\") was introduced. After the breakup of the Frankish empire, Otto I added Italy to the Holy Roman Empire and continued the use of the title \"Rex Italicorum\". The last to use this title was Henry II (1004-1024). Subsequent emperors used the title \"King of Italy\" until Charles V. At first they were crowned in Pavia, later Milan, and Charles was crowned in Bologna.\n\nIn 1805, Napoleon I was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at the Milan Cathedral. The next year, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II abdicated his imperial title. From the deposition of Napoleon I (1814) until the Italian Unification (1861), there was no Italian monarch claiming the overarching title. The \"Risorgimento\" successfully established a dynasty, the House of Savoy, over the whole peninsula, uniting the kingdoms of Sardinia and the Two Sicilies to form the modern Kingdom of Italy. The monarchy was superseded by the Italian Republic, after a constitutional referendum was held on 2 June 1946, after World War II. The Italian monarchy formally ended on 12 June of that year, and Umberto II left the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 887, Italy fell into instability, with many rulers claiming the kingship simultaneously:\n\n\n\n\nIn 896, Arnulf and Ratold lost control of Italy, which was divided between Berengar and Lambert:\n\n\nIn 951 Otto I of Germany invaded Italy and was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy. In 952, Berengar and Adalbert became his vassals but remained Kings until being deposed by Otto.\n\nRoger II used the title \"King of Sicily and Italy\" until at least 1135; later he used only the title \"King of Sicily, Apulia and Calabria\". Although his realm included the southern Italian mainland, he never exerted any control over the official Kingdom of Italy, and none of his successors claimed the title King of Italy.\n\nCharles V was the last emperor to be crowned king of Italy, or to use the title. The Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. However, the empire continued to include some territory in northern Italy, including Tyrol, until its dissolution in 1806.\n\nThis title is present on Italian laws proclaimed by Napoleon I:\n\n[Name]\", by the Grace of God and the Constitutions, Emperor of the French and King of Italy\".\n\nUp until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1946, full title of the Kings of Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946) was:\n\n[Name], \"by the Grace of God and the will of the Nation, King of Italy, King of Sardinia, Cyprus, Jerusalem, Armenia, Duke of Savoy, count of Maurienne, Marquis (of the Holy Roman Empire) in Italy; Prince of Piedmont, Carignano, Oneglia, Poirino, Trino; Prince and Perpetual Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire; Prince of Carmagnola, Montmellian with Arbin and Francin, Prince bailiff of the Duchy of Aosta, Prince of Chieri, Dronero, Crescentino, Riva di Chieri and Banna, Busca, Bene, Bra, Duke of Genoa, Monferrat, Aosta, Duke of Chablais, Genevois, Duke of Piacenza, Marquis of Saluzzo (Saluces), Ivrea, Susa, of Maro, Oristano, Cesana, Savona, Tarantasia, Borgomanero and Cureggio, Caselle, Rivoli, Pianezza, Govone, Salussola, Racconigi over Tegerone, Migliabruna and Motturone, Cavallermaggiore, Marene, Modane and Lanslebourg, Livorno Ferraris, Santhià, Agliè, Centallo and Demonte, Desana, Ghemme, Vigone, Count of Barge, Villafranca, Ginevra, Nizza, Tenda, Romont, Asti, Alessandria, of Goceano, Novara, Tortona, Bobbio, Soissons, Sant'Antioco, Pollenzo, Roccabruna, Tricerro, Bairo, Ozegna, delle Apertole, Baron of Vaud and of Faucigni, Lord of Vercelli, Pinerolo, of Lomellina, of Valle Sesia, of the Marquisate of Ceva, Overlord of Monaco, Roccabruna and eleven-twelfths of Menton, Noble Patrician of Venice, Patrician of Ferrara.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1986639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986639", "title": "Languages of Azerbaijan", "text": "Languages of Azerbaijan\n\nAlthough there are several languages native to the territory, Azerbaijani is the official language and the medium of communication of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe primary and official language of Azerbaijan is Azerbaijani, Azeri, a Turkic language closely related to and partially mutually intelligible with Modern Turkish. Together with Turkish, Turkmen and Gagauz, Azerbaijani is a member of Oghuz branch of southwestern group Turkic language family. Although Azerbaijani is used in the Republic of Azerbaijan, South Russia (Dagestan) and Northern Iran, the dialects are different. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is recognized as an official medium of instruction in Dagestan and in the Republic of Azerbaijan, however, it is not an official language in Northern Iran where the number of Azerbaijanis exceed the ones in the Republic of Azerbaijan itself. The Azerbaijani language spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan is quite different than the one spoken in North Azerbaijan and instead of promoting the use of language, the Iranian government has discouraged and even banned it for several decades.\n\nAccording to the 2009 census of the country it is spoken as a native language by 92.5% of the population whereas Russian and English play significant roles as languages of education and communication. More than half of Azerbaijani speakers are monolingual. The large Armenian-speaking population of Nagorno-Karabakh is no longer under government control. Lezgian, Talysh, Avar, Georgian, Budukh, Juhuri, Khinalug, Kryts, Jek, Rutul, Tsakhur, Tat, and Udi are all spoken by minorities.\nAll these (with the exception of Armenian, Lezgian, Talysh, Avar, and Georgian, which have much larger number of speakers outside Azerbaijan, but nevertheless are steadily declining within Azerbaijan) above-mentioned languages are endangered languages which are threatened with extinction, as they are spoken by few (less than 10,000) or very few (less than 1,000) people and their usage is steadily declining with emigration and modernisation.\n\nAn entire issue of the \"International Journal of the Sociology of Language\", edited by Jala Garibova, was devoted to the matter of languages and language choices in Azerbaijan, vol. 198 in 2009.\n\nAzerbaijan has not ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages to which it became signatory in 1992, under the Popular Front. In 2001, the then President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev issued a statement whereby \"the Republic of Azerbaijan is not in the power to guarantee the implementation of the Charter regulations until its territory occupied by the Republic of Armenia is liberated\".\n\nThe medieval author Ibn al-Nadim, in his book \"Al-Fihrist\" mentions that all the Median and Persian lands of antiquity (including what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan) spoke one language. There, he quotes the great scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa:\n\nHe then reports that Dari is the official language of the royal courts, and is from Khorasan and Balkh and eastern Iran; Parsi is the language of the Zoroastrian Moobeds, and is from Fars; Khuzi is the unofficial language of royalty and is from Khuzestan; and Seryani originates from Mesopotamia.\n\nThis has also been reported by reputed medieval historians such as Al-Tabari, Ibn Hawqal, Istakhri, Moqaddasi, Yaghubi, Masudi, and Mostowfi Qazvini as well. Al-Khwarizmi also mentions this in Chapter 6, Vol. 6, of his book \"Mafatih-ol-Olum\".\n\nEtymological studies also further indicate that current dialects spoken from Baku through Khalkhal to Semnan, all originated from a common source. In other words, the people of ancient Azerbaijan spoke the same language spoken by the Medes. (See Columbia University's distinguished professor Ehsan Yarshater's report in: \"Majjaleh-ye Daaneshkadehye Adabiyaat\", 5, No 1-2, p35-37)\n\nThe medieval historian Yaqut al-Hamawi also used the phrase \"Al-ajam-ol-Azariyah\" (\"The Azeri Iranian\") in his books \"Mo'ajjem ol-Odabaa\" and \"Mo'jem ol Baladaan\". In other sources such as \"Surat-ol-Arz\" by Ebne Hoghel, \"Ahsan ol-Taqaaseem\" by Moqaddasi, and \"Masaalik va Mamaalik\" by Istakhri, the people of Azerbaijan are recorded as having spoken Iranian languages. Obviously, this was before the Turkic cultural arrival. And Tabari in 235 A.H. also mentions that poets in Maragheh recited poetry in Pahlavi. Some Azerbaijani poets however, such as Qatran Tabrizi (d465 A.H.), used the word \"Persian\" and \"Pahlavi\" interchangeably to describe their native language.\n\nThe historian Hamdollah Mostowfi even goes as far as describing variants of \"Pahlavi\" spoken in different areas of Azerbaijan. In his book \"Tarikh Gozideh\", he describes eight poets from Azerbaijan, calling them \"Ahl-ol She'r Men-al-Ajam\" (Iranian poets), all Persian=speaking. By now, of course, Dari and Pahlavi had merged into one, as successive dynasties moved from east to west, bringing with them the Dari version of the Iranian language.\n\nSuffice it to say that the number of records and documents from Azerbaijan in the Pahlavi language are so numerous that there is little doubt that this was indeed the native tongue of Azerbaijan before the arrival of the Turks. Many words in the current Azeri vocabulary are in fact of Pahlavi origin. (See studies in \"Nashriyeh Adabiyaat\" of Tabriz University, by Dr Mahyar Navabi, 5, 6. Also see \"Farhang e Kamaleddin Teflisi\" and \"Ajayeb ol-Makhluqaat\" by \"Najibeddin Hamadani\", and the books \"Majmal-ol-Tavarikh wa al-qasas\" and \"Iskandar-Nameh e Qadeem\" for lists of words.)\n\nIt is agreed that the current Turkic form of the Azeri language supplanted and replaced Pahlavi in Azerbaijan before the Safavid dynasty, perhaps starting with the arrival of Seljukian Turks, and following a gradual course. But some historians report Pahlavi being spoken in Tabriz as late as the 17th century. (See \"Rowdhat ul-Jinan\" by Hafez Hosein Tabrizi (d997 A.H.), and \"Risaleh ye Anarjani\" written in 985 AH). Even the Ottoman Turkish explorer Evliya Celebi (1611-1682), mentions this in his Seyahatname. He also reports that the elite and learned people of Nakhichevan and Maragheh spoke Pahlavi, during his tours of the region.\n\nThe first appearance of using Azerbaijani is closely connected with the first appearance of Turkish tribes in the early first millennium. With the settlement of Turkish tribes not only the economy but also culture and language used for communication were influenced by them. The evolvement of the Azerbaijani language as a means of communication has had a long way covering centuries. Just studying Kitabi-Dede Gorgud (\"Kitabi-Dede Korkut, The Book of Dede Korkut\") is enough to say Azerbaijani has at least 1300 years of history as a medium of communication in the territory of now the Republic of Azerbaijan, Eastern Turkey, Southeastern Georgia, Northwestern Iran, Eastern Armenia and Southern Russia. Some sources point out that the written literary examples of the use of language date back 13th century. The Azerbaijani language has two main periods of development - the ancient period covering 13th to 18th centuries, whereas the present day period starting from about the late 18th century and lasts up to the present day.\n\nThe ancient period covers not only the main development stage of the language but also covers renaissance literature of Azerbaijan. During the ancient period, the government and the army were ruled by the Safavids, Aggoyunlus, Qaraqoyunlus, and Djelairids which overlaps with the high literary development period of the territory and the country and the use of the language is characterized by extra-linguistic properties.\n\nAzerbaijani has been influenced by many cultures throughout the history due to being occupied by different countries. The firmest and the longest of these external influences are Persian, Arabic, Russian. Due to being occupied and settled by the above-mentioned countries, the Azerbaijani language has also been used in harmony with their languages, allowing it to borrow an excessive amount of words from their culture and in return lend words as well. This could be the reason why, regardless of being independent for almost three decades, the influence of other languages is still remarkably strong, espiecally after being 70 years under Soviet occupation, Russian language is still widely used in the country.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5008670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5008670", "title": "Lavvu", "text": "Lavvu\n\nLavvu (or , , , , , , , and ) is a temporary dwelling used by the Sami people of northern Scandinavia. It has a design similar to a Native American tipi but is less vertical and more stable in high winds. It enables the indigenous cultures of the treeless plains of northern Scandinavia and the high arctic of Eurasia to follow their reindeer herds. It is still used as a temporary shelter by the Sami, and increasingly by other people for camping. It should not be confused with the goahti, another type of Sami dwelling, or the Finnish laavu.\n\nThere are several historical references that describe the lavvu structure (also called a \"kota\", or a variation on this name) used by the Sami. These structures have the following in common:\n\n\nNo historical record has come to light that describes the Sami using a single-pole structure claimed to be a lavvu, or any other Scandinavian variant name for the structure. The definition and description of this structure has been fairly consistent since the 17th century and possibly many centuries earlier.\n\nThe goahti, also used by the Sami, has a different pole configuration. While trees suitable to make lavvu poles are quite easy to find and often left at the site for later use, the four curved poles of the goahti have to be carried.\n\nThe traditional lavvu consists of two types of wooden poles: 1) three or more \"forked poles\" and; 2) several \"straight poles\". The \"forked poles\" have a two-stem fork at the top end. These three poles are interlocked so that they form a tripod. Upon this assembly of the forked poles, the \"straight poles\" are laid in a circular fashion. Reindeer hides were used as a cover until the mid-19th century when large amounts of inexpensive manufactured British textiles were made available to the Sami.\n\nThe traditional lavvus are still in use, but for ease of transportation modern designs have replaced the wooden poles with aluminum ones and heavier textiles with lighter fabrics. In addition, instead of an open fire an oven can be used. This reduces the smoke but produces less light making it quite dark inside. A lavvu of this type is easier to carry and is a common alternative to the tents often used for camping.\n\nVery large lavvus also exist with enough room for dozens of people. These are typically used for large families.\n\nThe lavvu has been – and still is – a strong symbol for the Sami as a cultural haven. The lavvu played a prominent role in two events during the 20th century as more than just a shelter. The first was at the end of World War II during the winter of 1944/45 when the German troops retreated westward across northern Norway, burning most of the housing in Finnmark and eastern Troms counties before the Russian Red Army. Because of this destruction, many Sami lived in lavvus for many years afterward because of the lack of housing and unemployment from this period. Some of these Sami are still alive today who were born in these lavvus and have fond memories of them.\nThe second event was when the lavvu was used during the Alta controversy in Norway from 1979 to 1981. A lavvu was set up in front of the Storting (Norwegian Parliament Building) which became an international focal point as several Sami went on a hunger strike to protest the proposed dam project that would have destroyed reindeer grazing grounds of the Sami herders in the area and inundated the Sami village of Máze. This lavvu became center stage in the political fight for Sami indigenous rights. The irony was not missed when the Oslo police bulldozed the lavvu during the protest. This conflict gave birth to the \"Sami Rights Committee\" which addressed Sami legal rights within Norway, resulting in the \"Sami Act of 1987\". This in turn became the foundation for the Sámediggi (Sami Parliament of Norway), a democratically elected body for the Sami in Norway in 1989, and the Finnmark Act of 2005.\n\nThe strong symbolism of the lavvu has also been shown in its pictorial form as the coat-of-arms for the municipality of Guovdageaidnu (Kautokeino) and in the physical shape of the Sámediggi building, whose shape was inspired by the lavvu.\n\nSince the late 1990s there have been a few European companies that claim to offer a \"lavvu\", but with a very different construction. This \"lavvu\" has a single pole which supports the tent in the middle of the structure, and is maintained and supported by stakes to the ground, often with guy-wires ropes to expand the cover outward giving its fullness. This pole and rope structure is closer in construction to a bell tent or conical tent which has been in use since the 1850s, and possibly much earlier. The bell/conical tent is different from the lavvu in three major ways:\n\n1) \"The tent is pitched by means of a single pole…\" in the center of the tent which is essential for support of the structure;\n\n2) stakes are used and are essential to provide support and fullness to the tent as without them the structure would collapse; and,\n\n3) guy-wires or ropes are often needed to provide fullness to the structure, depending on the size of the tent.\n\nNo historical records have been found that described the Sami using this single-pole construction. Only since the 1990s have these tent manufactures mentioned this type of single-pole structure to be a lavvu. The placing of the word \"lavvu\" on a single-pole tent structure different from the historical tent described as being used by the Sami, may be an example of cultural appropriation.\n\nInside the living quarters of the lavvu, there is a fireplace in the middle used for heating and to keep mosquitoes away. The smoke escapes through the smoke hole in the top of the lavvu that is usually left open. Occasionally a rough blanket is wrapped round the smoke hole to make the opening smaller, but not to the point where smoke would be prevented from escaping. In order to prevent smoke from building up inside, proper air circulation is maintained by leaving an opening between the ground and the cover, or leaving the door slightly open. Keeping the fire hot enough to let the heated smoke rise through the smoke hole is necessary.\n\nTraditionally, there was a smaller door in the back of the lavvu, opposite the front door, called the \"bear door\". This was used for ceremonial purposes, such as removing the dead (not appropriate out of the front door) and similar functions. Few lavvus today have this door for such purposes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4198464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4198464", "title": "Manual scavenging", "text": "Manual scavenging\n\nManual scavenging is a term used mainly in India for the manual removal of untreated human excreta from bucket toilets or pit latrines by hand with buckets and shovels. It has been officially prohibited by law in 1993 due to it being regarded as a dehumanizing practice (if not done in a safe manner). It involves moving the excreta, using brooms and tin plates, into baskets, which the workers carry to disposal locations sometimes several kilometers away. The workers, called scavengers (or more appropriately \"sanitation workers\"), rarely have any personal protective equipment. The term is mainly used in the Indian context only. \n\nThe employment of manual scavengers to empty a certain type of dry toilet that requires manual daily emptying was prohibited in India in 1993. The law was extended and clarified to include insanitary latrines, ditches and pits in 2013.\n\nAccording to Socio Economic Caste Census 2011, 180,657 households are engaged in manual scavenging for a livelihood. The 2011 Census of India found 794,000 cases of manual scavenging across India. The state of Maharashtra, with 63,713, tops the list with the largest number of households working as manual scavengers, followed by the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura and Karnataka. \n\nSimilar occupations existed and still exist in other countries, usually known by other terms and given different degrees of government protection.\nManual scavenging refers to the unsafe and manual removal of raw (fresh and untreated) human excreta from buckets or other containers that are used as toilets or from the pits of simple pit latrines. The safe and controlled emptying of pit latrines, on the other hand, is one component of fecal sludge management.\n\nThe official definition of a manual scavenger in Indian law from 1993 is as follows:\n“Manual scavenger” means a person engaged or employed, at the commencement of this Act or at any time thereafter, by an individual or a local authority or an agency or a contractor, for manually cleaning, carrying, disposing of, or otherwise handling in any manner, human excreta in an insanitary latrine or in an open drain or pit into which the human excreta from the insanitary latrines is disposed of, or railway track or in such other spaces or premises, as the Central Government or a State Government may notify, before the excreta fully decomposes in such manner as may be prescribed, and the expression “manual scavenging” shall be construed accordingly.\n\nNot all forms of dry toilets involve \"manual scavenging\" to empty them, but only those that require unsafe handling of raw excreta. If on the other hand the excreta is already treated or pre-treated in the dry toilet itself, as is the case for composting toilets and urine-diverting dry toilets for example, then emptying these types of toilets is not classified as \"manual scavenging\". Container-based sanitation is another system that does not require manual scavenging to function even though it does involve the emptying of excreta from containers.\n\nAlso, emptying the pits of twin-pit pour-flush toilets is not classified as manual scavenging in India, as the excreta is already partly treated and degraded in those pits.\n\nThe International Labour Organization describes three forms of manual scavenging in India:\nManual cleaning of railway lines of excreta dropped from toilets of trains is another form of manual scavenging in India.\n\nManual scavenging still survives in parts of India without proper sewage systems or safe fecal sludge management practices. It is thought to be most prevalent in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Some municipalities in India still run public toilets using simple pit latrines.\n\nAn estimate in 2018 put the number of \"sanitation workers\" in India at 5 million, and 50% of them being women.\n\nThe biggest violator of this law in India is the Indian Railways where many train carriages have toilets dropping the excreta from trains on the tracks and who employ scavengers to clean the tracks manually. The situation is largely improving with the introduction of biotoilets attached to the toilet chute. The railways has set a target of 2022 to attach biotoilets in all the coaches.\n\nManual scavenging is traditionally a role determined by the outlawed caste system in India for members of the Dalit caste, usually from the Balmiki (or Valminki) or Hela subcaste.\n\nIn March 2014, the Supreme Court of India declared that there were 96 lakhs (9.6 million) dry latrines being manually emptied but the exact number of manual scavengers is disputed – official figures put it at less than 700,000.\n\nManual scavenging is done with basic tools like thin boards and either buckets or baskets lined with sacking and carried on the head. Due to the nature of the job, many of the workers have related health problems.\n\nIn the late 1950s, freedom fighter G. S. Lakshman Iyer banned manual scavenging when he was the chairman of Gobichettipalayam Municipality, which became the first local body to ban it officially. Sanitation is a State subject as per entry 6 of the Constitution. Under this, in February 2013 Delhi announced that they are banning manual scavenging, making them the first state in India to do so. District magistrates are responsible for ensuring that there are no manual scavengers working in their district. Within 3 years time municipalities, railways and cantonments must make sufficient sanitary latrines available. The government of the state of Maharashtra has planned to abolish the menace of manual scavenging completely from the state soon. But by using Article 252 of the constitution which empowers Parliament to legislate for two or more States by consent and adoption of such legislation by any other State, the Government of India has enacted various laws . The continuance of such discriminatory practice is violation of ILO’s Convention 111 (Discrimination in Employment and Occupation)\n\nThe United Nations human rights chief welcomed in 2013 the movement in India to eradicate manual scavenging.\n\nAfter six states passed resolutions requesting the Central Government to frame a law, The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, drafted by the Ministry of Urban Development under the Narasimha Rao government, was passed by Parliament in 1993.\n\nThe Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993 punishes the employment of scavengers or the construction of dry (non-flush) latrines with imprisonment for up to one year and/or a fine of Rs 2,000. No convictions were obtained under the law during the 20 years it was in force.\n\nGovernment has passed the new legislation in September 2013 and issued Government notification for the same. In December, 2013 Government has also formulated Rules-2013 called as \"The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Rules 2013\" or \"M.S. Rules 2013\". The details about Act and Rules are available on the website of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, GOI.\n\nFurther, the hearing on 27 March 2014 was held on Manual Scavenging of writ petition number 583 of 2003, and supreme Court has issued final orders and case is disposed of with various directions to the Government.\n\nThe broad objectives of the act are to eliminate unsanitary latrines, prohibit the employment of manual scavengers and the hazardous manual cleaning of sewer and septic tanks, and to maintain a survey of manual scavengers and their rehabilitation.\n\nIn India in 1970s, Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak introduced his \"Sulabh\" concept for building and managing public toilets in India, which has introduced hygienic and well-managed public toilet system. Activist Bezwada Wilson founded a group in 1994, Safai Karmachari Andolan, to campaign for the demolition of then newly illegal 'dry latrines' (pit latrines) and the abolition of manual scavenging. Despite the efforts of Wilson and other activists, the practice persists two decades later. In July 2008 \"MissionSanitation\" was a fashion show held by the United Nations as part of its International Year of Sanitation. On the runway were 36 previous workers, called scavengers, and top models to help bring awareness of the issue of manual scavenging.\n\nThe Movement for Scavenger Community (MSC) is an NGO founded in 2009 by Vimal Kumar with young people, social activists, and like-minded people from the scavenger community. MSC is committed to working towards the social and economic empowerment of the scavenger community through the medium of education.\n\nThere is evidence of the existence of toilets with a water seal in the civilisations of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. These cities had toilets which were connected to an underground drainage system lined with burnt clay bricks. In later stages, manual scavenging became a caste-based occupation, with the vast majority of workers involved being women.\n\nThe practice of manual scavenging in India dates back to ancient times. According to the contents of sacred scriptures and other literature, scavenging by some specific castes of India has existed since the beginning of civilization. One of the fifteen duties of slaves enumerated in \"Naradiya Samhita\" was of manual scavenging. This continues during the Buddhist and Mauraya period also. Jahangir built a public toilet at Alwar, 120 km away from Delhi, for 100 families in 1556 AD. Not much documentary evidence exists about its maintenance. Scholars have suggested that the Mughal women with purdah required enclosed toilets that needed to be scavenged. It is pointed out that the \"bhangis\" (Chuhra) share some of the clan names with Rajputs, and propose that the \"bhangis\" are descendants of those captured in wars.There are many legends about the origin of \"bhangis\", who have traditionally served as manual scavengers. One of them, associated with Lal Begi bhangis, describes the origin of bhangis from Mehtar.\n\nMunicipal records from 1870 show that the British organized municipalities in India which built roads, parks, public toilets etc. The British administrators organized systems for removing the fecal sludge and employed bhangis.\n\nManual scavenging also took place in Europe but not specifically linked to a caste-based occupation and not called \"manual scavenging\": In European history the terms \"nightsoil collectors\" or \"nightmen\" and gong farmers were used. The contemporary term for safe nightsoil collection is fecal sludge management. Towns with sanitation systems based on pail closets (bucket toilets in outhouses) relied on frequent emptying, performed by workers driving \"honeywagons\", a precursor to the vacuum truck now used to pump out septage from septic tanks. The municipal emptying of pail toilets continued in Australia into the second half of the twentieth century; these were known as dunnies and the workers were dunnymen.\n\nIn Haiti, this type of occupation is called bayakou. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35532743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35532743", "title": "Med people", "text": "Med people\n\nThe Med are an ethnic community found in the coastal areas of Balochistan, Pakistan, mainly in the regions of Makran and Las Bela, and the Makran region of Sistan and Baluchestan Province of Iran.\n\nThere are different theories as to the origin of the Med community. According to their own tribal traditions, the Med originate from Gandava in the Kacchi region of Balochistan. It is likely that the Med are one of the earliest settlers of the Makran coast, and this is reinforced by the fact that the Med are mentioned in the chronicle of ancient Sindh, the Chachnama, as one of the tribes that inhabited coastal Balochistan. The Med now speak Balochi, and consider themselves as Baloch. However, in both Makran and Las Bela, they are seen as distinct by both the Sindhi and Baloch. The Mohana tribe of Sindh and southern Punjab claim to be of Med origin.\n\nIn Lasbela District they are found mainly in the cities of Miani and Ormara, and villages in between these towns, while in Makran they are found in the cities of Gwadar and Sonmiani, and the villages in between. The Med are divided into four clans, the Chilmarzai, who claim descent from Numrio tribe of Sindh, the Jalalzai and Gazbur, who claim Baloch ancestry and then finally the Olmari who claim Pashtun ancestry. This suggests that the Med community is of diverse origin, absorbing different groups which migrated to Makran. In recent time the Med have absorbed groups of African ancestry such as the Siddi. Meds are Muslims and like many other Makran communities, they are also divided along sectarian lines. Many Gwadar Med belong to the Zikri sect while the vast majority of Meds are Sunni Hanafis. Along coastal Balochistan, fishing is entirely in the hands of the Med, with an individual fishing boat owned by a particular lineages. The Med also form an important element within the Baloch population of Karachi.\n\nIn Iran, the Med settlements cling to the coastline of Makran region of the province of Sistan and Baluchestan. They are largely engaged in fishing, but some of their settlements on the banks of the various seasonal streams also engage in agriculture. The Med have vague traditions of having originated in Sindh, but now considers themselves and looked by others as Baloch. Like other Iranian Baloch, the Med are Sunni, as distinct from the majority in Iran, who are Shia.\n\n"}
{"id": "15559875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15559875", "title": "Nudity and protest", "text": "Nudity and protest\n\nNudity is sometimes used as a tactic during a protest to attract public attention to a cause, and sometimes promotion of public nudity is itself the objective of a nude protest. The use of the tactic goes back to well published photos of nude protests by \"svobodniki\" in Canada in 1903. The tactic has been used by other groups later in the century, especially after the 1960s. Like public nudity in general, cultural and legal acceptance of nudity as a tactic in protest also varies around the world. Some opponents of any public nudity claim that it is indecent especially when it can be viewed by children; while others argue that it is a legitimate form of expression covered by the right to free speech.\n\nEven in places where public nudity is tolerated, it is still unexpected enough that its use by activists as a deliberate tactic is often successful in attracting publicity from the media.\n\nSome nude activism is not to promote a particular cause, but rather to promote public nudity itself, or to change community perceptions of the naked human body, or as an expression of a personal desire to be nude in public.\n\nAnimal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have used nudity to draw attention to their causes. \"(See below.)\" For example, the Lettuce Ladies, young women dressed in bikinis which appear to be made of lettuce, had gathered in city centers to hand out leaflets about veganism. Every year the Running of the Nudes campaign sees PETA activists run naked through Pamplona, Spain in a parody of the annual Running of the Bulls tradition. Supermodels such as Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell have posed naked on billboards with the slogan \"I'd rather go naked than wear fur\" emblazoned across their chests.\n\nOn 29 June 2016, Cambridge academic, Victoria Bateman walked into a meeting at the Faculty of Economics while naked in protest against the results of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016. She had written on her breasts and stomach \"Brexit leaves Britain naked\".\n\nWomen in the Amuru district of Uganda have protested about their loss of land for farming. They have protested naked at least twice on this matter, on 9 April 2012 and of 14 April 2015. The protestors' land is under threat of being acquired by government as a game reserve, which may possibly be in turn handed over for sugar cane plantations.\n\nSeveral groups and individuals have used nudity in anti-war demonstrations. Some groups include: Breasts Not Bombs and Artists for Peace/Artists Against War, which later became the Work Less Party of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada. The latter is known for its Naked Bike Rides which Conrad Schmidt later evolved into World Naked Bike Ride.\n\nGroups also started to use nudity to protest the Iraq War. Groups using their bodies to form words and symbols to convey their message included Baring Witness, US-based/founded by Donna Sheehan, which inspired other groups on all seven continents to stage similar events, including Bare Witness, based in the UK.\n\nIn Africa, women have used stripping naked on purpose as a curse, both historically, and in modern times. The idea is that women give life and they can take it away. The curse initiates an extreme form of ostracism, which anthropologist Terisa Turner has likened to \"social execution\". The curse extends to foreign men as well, and is believed to cause impotence, madness or other similar harm. The threat has been used successfully in mass protests against the petroleum industry in Nigeria, by Leymah Gbowee and Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace during the Second Liberian Civil War, and against President Laurent Gbagbo of the Ivory Coast. In 2002 in Nigeria, members of the Niger Delta Women for Justice occupied a platform for oil extraction run by ChevronTexaco in order to protest against negative consequences of oil extraction and missing labor rights. When the military arrived to remove the protestors, the women threatened the soldiers to naked curse them. The soldiers did not touch the women.\n\nA group of about 16 women bared their buttocks and stormed into the offices of the African National Congress (ANC) in Tshwane. The women were protesting against the outcome of an ANC Tshwane branch general meeting. The women claimed bouncers, armed with pangas and firearms, stormed the meeting and stopped them from participating in the voting process to elect the new branch committee.\n\nIn November, 2011, a transgender woman from Morristown, Tennessee was arrested and jailed for 21 days by Tennessee police for indecent exposure after removing her top in the parking lot of her local DMV after they refused to alter the gender designation on her driver's license from male to female. This was despite the fact that the U.S. federal government Social Security office already had done so. As it is legal for a man to go topless in public and since the Tennessee Department of Public Safety refused to recognise her as female, Ms Jones decided to protest her treatment by going topless, stating \"if I was a male, I had the right to, when I stepped out the door, take off my shirt... It's not right for the state to ask me to be both male and female. A choice needs to be made. They cannot hold me to both standards.\"\n\nIn June 2017 more than 100 women stripped naked in front of the president's palace, Casa Rosada, in Buenos Aires, Argentina to protest against violence against women.\n\nOn 8 February 2017 artist Rick Gibson walked naked in front of the Vancouver Law Courts in the middle of winter to protest Canada's ban of genetic engineering of the human genome. He walked nude in downtown Vancouver for 11 minutes, 45.75 seconds in a light rain and a temperature of 7 degrees Celsius.\n\nNot all people who engage in public nudity see themselves as nudists or naturists or belong to traditional naturist or nudist organizations. Several activists, such as Vincent Bethell, claim that associations with naturism or nudism are unnecessary. Others will point out that many people who participate in events such as clothing-optional bike rides or visit clothing-optional beaches do so casually and without association or formal affiliation to groups or movements. Activist Daniel Johnson believes that labels and affiliations overly complicate a relatively simple phenomenon, alienate others from a fear of over-commitment or undesirable stereotypes, and thus get in the way of integrating nudity into everyday life.\n\nWorld Naked Bike Ride (WNBR) is an international clothing-optional bike ride in which participants plan, meet and ride together \"en masse\" on human-powered transport (the vast majority on bicycles, and fewer on skateboards, rollerblades, roller skates) to \"protest oil dependency and celebrate the power and individuality of our bodies\". This represents one of the few events that combine elements that could be described as pro nudity and pro cycling (as well as environmental).\n\nMany of the political rides have their roots from Critical Mass and are often described or categorized as a form of political protest, street theatre, party-on-wheels, streaking, public nudity and clothing-optional recreation and thus attracts a wide range of participants. Since 1996 Critical Tits has been hosting a \"raucous topless bicycle joyride\" on Friday afternoon at the annual Burning Man festival in Nevada.\n\nThe Spanish movement, Manifestación Ciclonudista Mundial has had rides predating WNBR (since 2001) and has since spread to other countries in Europe.\n\nThe protest group FEMEN (founded in 2008 in Ukraine) regularly stages topless protests against sex tourists, international marriage agencies, sexism and other social ills. These protests received worldwide press coverage in 2009. Since late 2011 FEMEN operations became not limited to Ukraine and they have demonstrated in other European countries including non-Ukrainian protesters. FEMEN justifies its provocative methods stating \"If we staged simple protests with banners, then our claims would not have been noticed\". FEMEN receives small financial backing by individuals. In January 2012, three members of the group staged a topless protest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In October 2013 FEMEN had its largest membership in France (30 FEMEN France local activists in January 2013). In October 2012 the organization claimed it had about 40 activists in Ukraine, and another 100 who had joined their protests abroad.\n\nThe abovementioned groups use nudity to protest issues other than the right to be naked. There are also groups and individuals who protest for the right to be naked.\n\nThere is a group led by Avril X called UrbaNudismo that has led several casual nudity excursions in high visibility public urban environments in Brazil as well as some Western European countries.\n\nAPNEL is the French nudity rights group.\n\nNaktiv.net is a generic Naked Activities site.\n\nIn 1969, in Denmark, 300 individuals participated in a massive naked \"wade-in\" at a Danish beach. The event helped push forward dramatic reformation in public policy. It is now possible and allowed to be naked at any public beach in Denmark with only two major exceptions: Holmsland Klit and Hennestrand. The remaining 4,700 kilometers of Danish coast are clothing-optional.\n\n\n\nRobbert Broekstra (now deceased) was involved in a group called \"Friends of Nature\". They would often go for naked excursions on public lands, sometimes in urban areas, often taking pictures. He was also involved in INIC (International Naturist Information Center). He authored the book \"Robbert Broekstra's Nude World\" and his group appeared in \"Naked Travels 1\", by Charles MacFarland.\n\n\nThe Freedom to be Yourself campaign (TFTBY or FTBY) was founded in 1998 by Vincent Bethell. The group, according to Vincent Bethell is about \"the right to be naked in public\". Supporters of the TFTBY organized several grassroots naked protests in public in London; there have also been protests in Brighton, Bristol, Birmingham, Coventry, and some in the United States.\n\nTerri Sue Webb is an activist living in Bend, Oregon, who was one of few activists in the United States active in The Freedom to be Yourself (TFTBY or FTBY) campaign. She has been imprisoned and released multiple times for public nudity. On several occasions she has remained fully nude while incarcerated, often resulting in a much longer jail sentence. There has been quite a bit of media coverage of her activities. Daniel Johnson went nude with her in public on two occasions in 2001 and 2002.\n\nVincent Bethell made legal history in January 2001 by being the first defendant to stand trial naked in a UK court. The trial was at Southwark Crown Court London. Vincent was naked throughout this court case, furthermore he was found unanimously not guilty. Stephen Gough, also known as \"Steve Gough\" and \"the naked rambler\", is an activist from Eastleigh, Hampshire, famous for walking the length of Great Britain from Land's End to John o' Groats in 2003–2004 and again in 2005-2006 (that year accompanied by his girlfriend Melanie Roberts), with nothing on except boots, socks, rucksack and sometimes a hat. He has been arrested several times and put in prison in the course of his rambles. In his last walk he was only arrested twice in England, and released almost immediately, but due to the different legal system and laws in Scotland, he was arrested many more times after crossing the border and spent time in HMP Edinburgh, then moved to HMP Barlinnie Glasgow in June 2008.\n\nRichard Collins has been cycling naked through his home town of Cambridge, England for some time. He has been organizing several protests on the TFTBY Stop Segregation discussion group (no longer in existence). Richard has been arrested numerous times and released, although he was convicted of an offence under section 5, Public Order Act 1986, in Bournemouth, England, on 13 June after his nude cycling attracted complaints approximately 12-months earlier. Richard says: \"My outings are NOT protests as such but 'activities'. Simply me having fun! And exercising my right to nude freedom!\"\n\nThe topfreedom movement has challenged the law in a number of countries, especially in North America and in Europe, on sex equality grounds arguing that the present public indecency laws discriminate against women. The movement advocates equal rights for women to be topfree in the same circumstances that a man is permitted to be bare-chested.\n\nThe Topfree Equal Rights Association (TERA) is a Canadian organization which endeavors to assist women who are having legal troubles exercising their rights to be topfree. Their website states that they serve both Canada and the United States. The organization also aims to inform and educate the public about topfreedom, and to change laws against topfreedom in North American jurisdictions. GoTopless goes further and organizes demonstrations to protest against the legal and public attitude to the inequality. In Sweden, Bara Bröst is active in advancing topfreedom, as is Topless Front in Denmark. In France, the feminist collective Les TumulTueuses has moved beyond seeking equality with men as indicated by their slogan: \"My body if I want, when I want, like it is\" (\"Mon corps si je veux, quand je veux, tel qu'il est\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In many cases, this approach provides electronic documents that become the catalyst to rebuild after natural or man-made spur rural community development and stimulate or create a new microeconomy.\n\nOne goal of online land planning is the effective use of the internet to support information sharing and decision making from remote locations such as the home. The use of the Internet, coupled with software technology such as geographic information systems (GIS), allows municipalities and other public and private organizations to compile base information, exchange information, present solutions to land planning issues, and receive feedback vis the internet. Benefits for land development companies and real estate industry organizations like the Urban Land Institute include easier access to efficient digital planning technologies, along with the opportunity for immediate participation and feedback.\n\nWorldwide, local and regional governments have created their own websites with access to map-centric and entreprise GIS databases that provide operational and public-service resources.\n\n"}
{"id": "738199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738199", "title": "Opposition research", "text": "Opposition research\n\nIn the politics of the United States, opposition research (also called oppo research) is the practice of collecting information on a political opponent or other adversary that can be used to discredit or otherwise weaken them. The information can include biographical, legal, criminal, medical, educational, or financial history or activities, as well as prior media coverage, or the voting record of a politician. Opposition research can also entail using \"trackers\" to follow an individual and record their activities or political speeches.\n\nThe research is usually conducted in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election; however political parties maintain long-term databases that can cover several decades. The practice is both a tactical maneuver and a cost-saving measure. The term is frequently used to refer not just to the collection of information but also how it is utilized, as a component of negative campaigning.\n\nIn the 1st century BC, Cicero is said to have gathered information that was damaging to opponents and using it in attacks against them. He accused one political opponent, Catiline, of murdering one wife to make room for another. He attacked Mark Antony in speeches known as the \"Philippicae\", eventually prompting Antony to chop off his head and right hand and display them at the Roman Forum.\n\nOpposition research also has its origins in military planning, as evident in such ancient texts as \"The Art of War\", published in the 5th century BC by Sun Tzu. This manual for warriors describes the necessity for understanding an opponent's weaknesses, for using spies, and for striking in moments of weakness.\n\nIn 18th century England, opposition research took the form of scandalmongering pamphlet wars between the Whig and Tory parties. Writers such as Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, and Henry Fielding participated, often writing under assumed names. This tradition of robust attack was replicated later in the American colonies, when writers such as Thomas Paine or Benjamin Franklin conducted opposition research and published their results.\n\nThe first appearance of the phrase \"opposition research\" in the \"New York Times\" occurred on December 17, 1971, in an article that describes the infiltration of the Edmund Muskie presidential campaign by a female Republican volunteer: \"...an article appeared in a Washington newspaper describing the 'opposition research' program at Republican headquarters...\"\n\nOpposition research became systematized in the 1970s when Ken Khachigian, in the Nixon Administration suggested that the GOP keep files on individuals as insurance against future races, rather than \"scramble\" in an \"ad hoc\" fashion race by race.\n\nOpposition research differs immensely depending on the size and funding of a campaign, the ethics of the candidate, and the era in which it is conducted. Information gathering can be classified into three main categories: open-source research enabled by the Freedom of Information Act, covert operations or \"tradecraft, \" and maintenance of human systems of informants. Increasingly, data-mining of electronic records is used. Information is then stored for future use, and disseminated in a variety of ways. A local election sometimes has a staff member dedicated to reading through all of the opponents' public statements and their voting records; others initiate whisper campaigns that employ techniques of disinformation or \"black ops\" to deliberately mislead the public by advancing a pre-determined \"narrative\" that will present the opponent in a negative light.\n\nAnother technique is to infiltrate the opposition's operations and position a paid informant there. \"Gray propaganda\" techniques are often used to release damaging information to news media outlets without its source being identified properly, a technique inherited from disinformation tactics employed by intelligence agencies such as the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.\n\nFile-sharing between operatives of political parties is quite common. In the 2008 presidential election, a dossier of opposition research against Republican Vice-Presidential nominee Sarah Palin was posted in its entirety on a political blog site, Politico.com. The file was compiled by the staff of her opponent in the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, Tony Knowles.\n\n\"Oppo dumps\" are used by political campaigns to systematically supply files of damaging information to press outlets, including matters of the public record, video footage from party archives and private collections, as well as private intelligence gathered by operatives. Many prime time television and radio news commentaries rely on this supply of party-generated material because it is free, and therefore more cost-effective than paying investigative reporters.\n\nCandidates and incumbents who benefit from opposition research often choose to remain uninformed about their campaign's operations and tactics, to insure plausible deniability should criminal charges be brought against researchers.\n\nYet another technique is to position information or personnel within media outlets. Often the information is video footage gathered in campaign-funded \"tracker programs\" wherein videographers use candidates' itineraries to track them and record as many remarks as possible, since anything they say can and will be used against them, as was the case in former Senator George Allen's \"macaca moment.\" In the 2006 election cycle, a Virginia senator, George Allen, was unseated because of videotape of the senator calling a videographer/opposition researcher as \"macaca\" or monkey. The name was considered to be an ethnic slur, and Allen's campaign could not overcome the damage when the incident was broadcast widely in mainstream media and on the internet.\n\nA 2005 analysis of digital media strategies published by the American Academy of Political Science took the view that new technologies enable \"political elites\" to use database and Internet technologies to do opposition research more easily, but they use data-mining techniques that outrage privacy advocates and surreptitious technologies that few Internet users understand. Data becomes \"richer\" about political actors, policy options, and the diversity of actors and opinion in the public sphere, but citizenship is \"thinner\" by virtue of \"the ease in which people can become politically expressive without being substantively engaged.\"\n\nFacebook photos became a tool of opposition researchers in California's 32nd congressional district special election, 2009 to replace Hilda Solis. Front-runner Democrat Gil Cedillo sent out mailers targeting 26-year-old Emanuel Pleitez, grouping Pleitez's Facebook photos to suggest that he parties to excess with alcohol, and fraternizes with gangs. The text of the mailer suggested Pleitez, posing with a Latino stage actress and using a Latino voter registration drive hand sign, was \"flashing gang signs\".\n\nIn 2006, the campaign manager of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Cathy Cox, Morton Brilliant, resigned after Cox's opponent, Lt. Gov, Mark Taylor, revealed Cox's campaign had added information from an opposition research dossier to a Wikipedia page on Taylor. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales confirmed that the material had come from an IP address affiliated with the Cox campaign. Citing an Associated Press analysis, CNN reported that Wikipedia being used as a \"popular tool\" for opposition researchers became so widespread a problem that Wikipedia altered its submission guidelines and set up alerts so that its operators know when Capitol Hill staffers alter Wikipedia content. However, anyone who wanted to could simply bypass this by using an IP address not associated with Capitol Hill.\n\nOpposition research is a necessary component of \"grassroots\" activist groups. Research on corporate or political opponents may enable activist groups to target neighborhoods from which to increase their numbers, to refine their focus or \"target,\" to pinpoint the target's vulnerabilities, to reveal hidden sources of funding or little-known connections, to investigate scare tactics, and to augment a legislative initiative.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2008, the blog Talking Points Memo pioneered \"collaborative citizen-reporting projects\" based on groups of volunteers examining public documents that shed light on the George W. Bush administration's U.S. attorneys firings controversy. Other organizations such as the Sunlight Foundation encouraged citizen examination of such public domain records as Mitt Romney's financial disclosure statements and Bill Clinton's income statements.\n\nPolitical strategies for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing too much information in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents' opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports. \"To eliminate some of these potential issues your campaign should take the time to review the wording of your campaign finance reports,\" advises one strategist writing for \"The Hill\":\n\nInstead of reporting that you spent $3,000 on a 'background check and public records search on Congressman X,' list the expenditure as 'issue research' or simply 'research'... One bonus financial filing tip: warn your candidate about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for 'strategy meetings.' Eating at Ruth's Chris or Morton's Steak House on your campaign's dime just looks bad. The press may poke a little fun at your candidate's expense; your donors may feel their donation in being misspent and may never give again. \n\nCongressional and presidential opposition research is often conducted by or funded by a political party, lobbying group, political action committee (PAC), or a 527 group that coalesces around a certain issue. In the U.S., both the Republican and Democratic parties employ full-time \"Directors of Research\" and maintain databases on opponents. In recent years the task of opposition research has been privatized in many areas. Full-time companies with permanent staff specializing in media productions or \"grassroots\" operations have replaced volunteers and campaign officials. Political media consultants may also opt for astroturfing techniques, which simulate wide popular appeal for a candidate's platform.\n\nOpponents of Andrew Jackson in the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections unearthed his marriage records to imply that he was an adulterer for marrying Rachel Robards before she was legally divorced from her first husband. Jackson had married her in 1791 on the strength of a statement from her husband that he had divorced her; Jackson had two wedding ceremonies, the not-recognizable one of 1791 and the legally corrective one of 1794. His political opponents used this information decades later against him, and he fought many duels over his wife's honor. Rachel Robards died before Jackson took office in his first term; he maintained that the stress of the opposition had killed her.\n\nIn 1858, William Herndon, the law partner of Abraham Lincoln, did research in the Illinois State Library to collect \"all the ammunition Mr. Lincoln saw fit to gather\" to prepare for the run against Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 presidential race.\n\nIn preparation for Ronald Reagan’s debate with President Jimmy Carter in the presidential race 1980, Reagan’s campaign staff acquired under mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including information on Carter’s strategy, which staffers David Stockman and David Gergen had used to prepare Reagan. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a special investigation, based on the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Carter’s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan’s campaign director William J. Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency. James Baker attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign documents found in the “Afghanistan” files of Reagan aide David Gergen indicated they came from three White House offices: the National Security Council, Vice President Walter Mondale and Domestic Adviser Stuart Eizenstat. Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS interview that the book had been taken by columnist George Will, but Will denied it, calling Carter \"a recidivist liar.\"\n\nLee Atwater is considered to be the \"father\" of modern aggressive \"oppo\" techniques. Atwater honed his style working in his native South Carolina for Senator Strom Thurmond and to elect Congressman (later Governor) Carroll Campbell. From his posts on the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, Atwater encouraged and helped direct what was then the advanced oppo work of the Republican National Committee against Democrats Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. During the 1988 presidential campaign, dozens of RNC researchers worked three shifts around the clock to feed the then-burgeoning 24-hour news cycle. The now-infamous “Willie Horton” TV ads crafted by Floyd Brown helped turn voters away from Dukakis and towards the Republican, although Atwater and Bush were protected by plausible deniability because Brown's ads were independently funded and produced. Academic research into the Bush archives decades later revealed that a Bush staffer, Candice Strother, had released a dossier of information on Willie Horton to Elizabeth Fediay, of the non-profit group that contracted for the ad. (The Horton story had been completely public for an entire year, part of news coverage that won a Pulitzer Prize for the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune newspaper.) Willie Horton was an African-American convicted murderer released on a weekend furlough during Governor Dukakis’s tenure, who escaped and committed a brutal rape in Maryland, also stabbing his victim's husband. Atwater is also credited with originating \"push polls\" and \"whisper campaigns\" that use disinformation strategies to alienate voters from opponents. A biography of Atwater, quotes him as saying in an interview toward the end of his life that he regretted some of his less ethical techniques.\n\nIn the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans reported that they spent $6 million on a \"state of the art (opposition research) war machine\" to investigate Bill Clinton, who was running against George H. W. Bush. In the same election, the Clinton campaign paid more than $100,000 to a private investigator to look into allegations about Clinton's womanizing, investigating more than two dozen women.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, longtime opposition researcher and Nixon loyalist Roger Stone was recruited by former Secretary of State James Baker to oversee the recount of the disputed Presidential election in Miami-Dade County in 2000. Stone is credited with organizing the street demonstrations and eventual shut-down of the recount in that pivotal county.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential race, Chris Lehane, a Democratic opposition researcher attracted notoriety and built a reputation not for deploying his skills against Republican opponents, but for using them against other Democrats in the primary races. Working for retired Army general Wesley Clark, Lehane sought to establish a media \"narrative\" that Howard Dean was hypocritical and dishonest, based on surveys of his administrative archive as governor of Vermont.\n\nA protege of Atwater's, Karl Rove, is considered to be the \"architect\" of George W. Bush's election to the governor's office in Texas, and to the presidency in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the \"John McCain has a black love child\" whisper campaign in South Carolina. Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, \"Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?\" The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of Bob Jones University to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. The Bush camp knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain was the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, opposition researchers for Barack Obama unearthed the fact that John Edwards had paid $400 for haircuts at campaign expense, and supplied Politico's Ben Smith with the tip, according to a memoir later published by campaign manager David Plouffe. Though the Democratic National Committee continues to fund a research department, after the 2008 presidential election, the New York Times reported that \"The legacy of the Democratic National Committee itself is hardly clear going forward. Mr. Obama effectively subsumed all the responsibilities in his campaign: fundraising, voter turn-out and opposition research.\n\n\nIn 1916, after President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis for the Supreme Court, \"concerned\" citizens seeking to block his confirmation offered information that Brandeis was a \"radical Zionist,\" even though he was not a practicing Jew. Brandeis aggressively outmaneuvered his detractors by mounting his own opposition research efforts, including a carefully constructed chart that exposed the social and financial connections of the group, mostly from Boston's Back Bay, and including Harvard president Lawrence Lowell, as well as a group headed by former President William Howard Taft and a host of American Bar Association past presidents. Brandeis sent the chart to Walter Lippman at the \"New Republic\" who penned an editorial condemning \"the most homogeneous, self-centered, and self-complacent community in the United States.\" Brandeis was confirmed after four months of hearings, in a Senate vote of 47–22.\n\nRonald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987, prompting a Senate floor speech from Democratic Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, which later became known as the \"Robert Bork's America\" speech:\n\nKennedy's speech prompted a rapid-response opposition research effort from Democrats, but the White House waited two and a half months to respond. The Senate Judiciary Committee, under the direction of Delaware senator and presidential hopeful Joseph Biden, commissioned a report in response to the materials Reagan's staff had released in support of Bork's nomination. Prepared by a panel of lawyers, including two Duke University law professors, the 78-page became known as \"The Biden Report.\" The report detailed Bork's record, and analyzed the pattern of his rulings, and deeming him to be a conservative \"activist\" rather than an impartial jurist Ultimately, Bork's embattled nomination failed, and Anthony Kennedy (no relation to Ted) was later confirmed to fill the position. The fierce research-based opposition to Bork's nomination attracted significant media attention, even though a Gallup Poll on the eve of the confirmation vote showed that very few Americans could name the nominee in question, much less recall his rulings. A new verb was later coined; \"to bork\" a candidate or nominee by mounting such voluminous research and vocal opposition that the person in question would be forced to withdraw.\n\nAfter President George W. Bush nominated Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court, the \"Boston Globe\" reported that Republican conservative advocacy groups were conducting opposition research against her: \"Groups are circulating lists of questions they want members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask Miers at her confirmation hearings. The activists' thinly veiled hope is that Miers will reveal ignorance of the law and give senators a reason to oppose her.\" Miers later withdrew her name from consideration for the court.\n\nOn July 7, 2005, soon after the resignation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Democratic National Committee gathered and circulated information on the \"anti-civil rights\" and \"anti-immigrant\" rulings of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., by then nominated by President George W. Bush to replace her. Upon inspection, the documents were revealed to have been amended by Devorah Adler, research director for the DNC. Alito's \"record\" had been pointedly altered to present him in a negative light. While the incident was not unusual, it received publicity in prominent places because it drew attention to the \"meta-data\" that is often unwittingly stored in documents that are altered and forwarded electronically.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, after Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced his intent to retire from the court, the \"New York Times\" reported that Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, had noted that conservatives were \"focusing opposition research efforts on 17 women, whom they have divided into two tiers based on their perceived chances.\"\n\nSeven aides to members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives pleaded guilty on January 7, 2010, to illegal use of state resources for campaign activities, including opposition research against the political opponents of incumbent officeholders during 2007. These seven were Democrats; a total of 25 indictments have been handed down to a mix of Democrats and Republican politicians.\n\nDuring Lamar Alexander's 2002 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Alexander's campaign staff received an anonymous mailing of a photograph of opponent Bob Clement obviously serving as a board member of a failed bank whose owners had been imprisoned for bank fraud. When the Alexander campaign raised the issue of Clement's financial ties with the convicted felons, Clement denied any connection. When the Alexander campaign produced the photograph as evidence, Clement claimed his role was only an informal advisory one.\n\nIn early July 2009 Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that she would be resigning as governor, partly due to complications from opposition research and ethics inquiries after her inclusion on the 2008 GOP presidential race ballot as John McCain's running mate. At a later news conference Palin told reporters, \"Obviously conditions had changed so drastically on August 29, the day I was tapped to be VP,\" she said. \"The opposition research and the games that began there — which I think is the new normal in Alaska politics, until I hand the reins over to Sean Parnell — have been so distracting.\"\n\nIn the Pennsylvania state legislature in July 2009, former state House Democratic Campaign Committee Chair, Rep. Stephen Stetler found himself amidst an investigation when he rejected a plan that would have shifted the job of opposition research from employees on the state payroll to private firms. Attorney General Tom Corbett alleged that millions in public funds were paid to state employees who did such research on the 2006 and 2004 campaigns of Democrats in the state. Stetler left the House after 2006 to become the state's revenue secretary. A former aide, Dan Wiedemer testified before grand jurors that the suggestion to remove politically motivated research from the hands of public employees \"was more or less shot down.\" Though Stetler has not been charged, 12 former House members and members of their staff were charged with diverting public funds for political campaign work. Stetler was among those subpoenaed, said Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell. The hearing will be held before President Judge Richard Lewis in September.\n\nAustralia\n\nIn October 2011, a media storm erupted in Australia over the leaking of 'dirt files' compiled by the Liberal National Party and further revelations that a former Australian Labor Party operative had been engaged to help compile the dossiers.\n\nDespite protestations that key party personnel had no knowledge of the dossiers it was later revealed a Liberal National Party opposition research strategist had been compiling the files as part of a SWOT analysis at previous elections which formed the basis of negative attack messaging for a 'rapid response unit'.\n\nIn January 2017, the African National Congress (ANC) was exposed when Sihle Bolani filed an affidavit in the Johannesburg High Court, demanding payment for her part in project War Room. The War Room's mandate was to “disempower DA and EFF campaigns” and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the ANC’s hand.\n\nThe practice of using tips from opposition research sources was examined in 1994 by Howard Kurtz, media analyst for \"The Washington Post\". Kurtz surveyed the major networks, \"Newsweek\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and other influential media outlets, and found varying levels of use of oppo research information on David Hale as a witness in the Whitewater controversy. At this time, Brown confirmed that he had been the source of four mainstream media stories that had received attention from the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" because they bore striking resemblance to the opposition research being disseminated by Citizens United.\n\n\"Far from being detached observers, reporters constantly call oppo staffs looking for tidbits and sometimes trading information,\" wrote three reporters, Matthew Cooper, Gloria Borger, and Michael Barone, for \"U.S. News & World Report\" in 1992.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, Roger Stone, a political consultant in the employ of New York state senator Joseph Bruno, was forced to resign after leaving threatening phone messages on the answering machine of the 85-year-old father of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, alleging that Spitzer's campaign finances were conducted improperly. In November of that same year, Stone sent a letter to the FBI detailing Spitzer's sexual preferences with prostitutes and sexual props, right down to his black calf-length socks. Stone was considered to be an authoritative source because he frequented the same prostitutes as a client himself. A subsequent Justice Department investigation produced evidence that ultimately led to Spitzer's resignation as governor. Joseph Bruno, Stone's client, has been a longtime political enemy of Eliot Spitzer.\n\nThe television show \"House of Cards\" depicts many examples of opposition research, particularly the character of Doug Stamper, the loyal adviser to Francis \"Frank\" Underwood, who regularly engages in the practice with little morality and few ethics.\n"}

{"id": "298978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298978", "title": "Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913", "text": "Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913\n\nThe Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act, commonly referred to as the Cat and Mouse Act, was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under Herbert Henry Asquith's Liberal government in 1913. Some members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, commonly referred to as suffragettes) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women's suffrage. In protest at being imprisoned some of the suffragettes undertook hunger strikes. The hunger strikers were then force-fed by the prison staff leading to a public outcry. The act was a response to the outcry that allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health. They then had a predetermined period of time in which to recover after which they were rearrested and taken back to prison to serve out the rest of their sentence. Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release. One effect of the act was to make hunger strikes technically legal. The nickname of the Act came about because of the domestic cat's habit of playing with its prey, allowing it to temporarily escape a number of times, before killing it.\n\nAfter the act was introduced force-feeding was no longer used to combat hunger strikes. Instead, suffragettes on hunger strike were kept in prison until they became extremely weak, at which point they would be released to recover. This allowed the government to claim that any harm (or even death) which resulted from the starvation was entirely the fault of the suffragette. During the recovery period, any wrongdoing on the part of the suffragette would see them put straight back in prison.\n\nTo attain the goal of suffrage on the same basis as men, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, known colloquially as the suffragettes) engaged in acts of protest such as the breaking of windows, arson, and the \"technical assault\" (without causing harm) of police officers. Many WSPU members were jailed for these offences. In response to what the organisation viewed as brutal punishment and harsh treatment by the government at the time, imprisoned WSPU members embarked on a sustained campaign of hunger strikes. Some women were freed on taking this action, but this rendered the policy of imprisonment of suffragettes futile. The prison authorities then turned to a policy of force feeding hunger-strikers by nasogastric tube. Repeated uses of this process often caused sickness, which served the WSPU's aims of demonstrating the government's harsh treatment of the prisoners.\n\nFaced with growing public disquiet over the tactic of force feeding, and the determination of the jailed suffragettes to continue their hunger strikes, the government rushed the Act through Parliament. The effect of the Act was to permit the release of prisoners for them to recuperate from the effects of a hunger strike whilst leaving the police free to re-imprison offenders once they had recovered. The intention of the Act was to counter the tactic of hunger strikes and the damaging consequences for the government's support among (male) voters by the force feeding of women prisoners but, if anything, it reduced support for the Liberal government.\n\nIn a book called \"Suffrage and the Pankhursts\", Jane Marcus argues that forcible feeding was the main image of the women's suffrage movement in the public imagination. Women wrote about how the experience made them feel in letters, diaries, speeches and suffrage publications, including \"Votes for Women\" and \"The Suffragette\". One of the force-fed suffragettes, Lady Constance Lytton, wrote a book that suggested that working-class women were more likely to be forcibly fed in prison than upper-class women. In general, the medical procedure of force feeding was described as a physical and mental violation that caused pain, suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, anguish and rage.\n\nViolet Bland also wrote in \"Votes for Women\" about her experiences of being force-fed, explaining how, \"they twisted my neck, jerked my head back, closing my throat, held all the time as in a vice,\" while they tried to force feed her. She wrote how the guards were always six or seven to one and that, \"there was really no possibility of the victim doing much in the way of protesting excepting verbally, to express one’s horror of it; therefore no excuse for the brutality shown on several occasions.\" At the end of what she describes as her assault, when she didn't get up from her chair quickly enough because of her \"helpless and breathless condition,\" they snatched the chair from under her, throwing her to the floor. She wrote that she had no doubt the attacks were made with the intention of breaking the hunger-strikers down.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the Act was very soon evident as the authorities experienced much more difficulty than anticipated in re-arresting the released hunger-strikers. Many of them eluded arrest with the help of a network of suffragette sympathisers and an all-women team of bodyguards, who employed tactics of misdirection, subterfuge and occasionally direct confrontation with the police. The inability of the government to lay its hands on high-profile suffragettes transformed what had been intended as a discreet device to control suffragette hunger-strikers into a public scandal.\n\nThis act was aimed at suppressing the power of the organisation by demoralising the activists, but turned out to be counter-productive as it undermined the moral authority of the government. The Act was viewed as violating basic human rights, not only of the suffragettes but of other prisoners. The Act's nickname of \"Cat and Mouse Act\", referring to the way the government seemed to play with prisoners as a cat may with a captured mouse, underlined how the cruelty of repeated releases and re-imprisonments turned the suffragettes from targets of scorn to objects of sympathy.\n\nThe Asquith government's implementation of the Act caused the militant WSPU and the suffragettes to perceive Asquith as the enemy — an enemy to be vanquished in what the organisation saw as an all-out war. A related effect of this law was to increase support for the Labour Party, many of whose early founders supported votes for women. For example, philosopher Bertrand Russell left the Liberal Party, and wrote pamphlets denouncing the Act and the Liberals for making in his view an illiberal and anti-constitutional law. So the controversy helped to accelerate the decline in the Liberals' electoral position, as segments of the middle class began to defect to Labour.\n\nThe Act also handed the WSPU an issue on which to campaign and rail against other parts of the British establishment - in particular the Anglican Church. During 1913 the WSPU directly targeted The Bishop of Winchester, Edward Talbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, the Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, and the Bishops of Croydon, Lewes, Islington and Stepney. Each one was picketed by deputations at their official residences until granted an audience, during which the Church leaders were asked to protest against forcible feeding. Norah Dacre Fox led many of the deputations on behalf of the WSPU, which were widely reported in \"The Suffragette\". At one point the Bishop of London was persuaded to visit Holloway personally in connection with allegations of women prisoners being poisoned during force feeding. The Bishop made several visits to the prison, but this came to nothing, and his public statements that he could find no evidence of ill treatment during force feeding – indeed, he believed that force feeding was carried out \"in the kindest possible spirit\" – was seen by the WSPU as collusion with the government and prison authorities. If the WSPU had been hoping to win support from the Church for their wider cause by pressing on the issue of forcible feeding, they were disappointed. The Church chose not to be drawn into a battle between the WSPU and the authorities, and maintained the party line that militancy was a precursor to forcible feeding and militancy was against the will of God, therefore the Church could not act against forcible feeding.\n\nResearch indicates that the Act did little to deter the activities of the suffragettes. Their militant actions only ceased with the outbreak of war and their support for the war effort. However, the start of the war in August 1914, and the ending of all suffragette activities for the duration of the war, meant that the full potential impact of the Cat and Mouse Act will never be known.\n\n\n"}

This array was deployed in March 2004 to continuously monitor the MOC and ocean heat transport that are primarily associated with the Thermohaline Circulation across the basin at 26°N. The RAPID-MOCHA array is planned to be continued through 2014 to provide a decade or longer continuous time series.\n\nThe continuous observations are measured by an array of instruments along 26°N. This monitoring array directly measures the transport of the Gulf Stream in the Florida Strait using an undersea cable and a moored array measures bottom pressure and water column density (including temperature and salinity) at the western and eastern boundary and on either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Absolute transports including barotropic circulation are monitored using precision bottom pressure gauges. \"Dynamic height\" moorings are used to estimate the spatially average geostropic velocity profile and associated transports over relatively wide mooring separations. The dynamic height moorings requires measurements on both sides of the current field only, rather both the horizontal and vertical structure of the current field to be sufficiently well resolved to estimate transports. The basin-wide MOC strength and vertical structure are estimated via Ekman transports by satellite scatterometer measurements and the geotrophic and direct current observations.\n\nRAPID-MOCHA is funded by the National Environmental Research Council (NERC) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\nKanzow and colleagues (2007) demonstrated the effective of the array and reported that the sum of the transports into the North Atlantic from March 2004 to March 2005 varies with root-mean-square value of only 3.4 Sv (where 1 Sv = a flow of ocean water of 10 cubic meters per second) as compared to expected measurement errors of 2.7 Sv. In another study also utilizing observations from March 2004 to March 2005, Cunningham et al. (2007) reported a year-long average MOC of 18.7 ± 5.6 Sv with a large variability ranging from 4.4 to 35.3 Sv within the course of a year.\n\nJohns et al. (2009) concluded that the meridional heat transport was highly correlated with changes in the strength of the MOC with the circulation accounting for nearly 90% of the total heat transport and the remainder contained in a quasi-stationary gyre pattern with little net contribution by mesoscale eddies. The average annual mean meridional heat transport from 2004-2007 was reported by Johns et al. (2009) to be 1.33 ± 0.14 petawatts (PW).\n\n"}

Officers of the club assumed governmental titles: governor, lieutenant governor, three councilors, sheriff, coroner, secretary. Among its 28 founding members were James Logan, Philip Syng, and Joseph Wharton; the first Governor was Thomas Stretch (born Staffordshire, England, 1695), who held the office for 34 years. Other early members included Samuel Howell, Thomas Wharton Jr., Tench Francis Jr., William Bradford, Samuel Nicholas, Clement Biddle, William Bingham, Mayor Anthony Morris, Thomas Mifflin, and Samuel Morris, second governor for 46 years. In 1737, membership was limited to twenty-five. After the American Revolution, in 1782, the club changed its name to \"State in Schuylkill\", but retained its rules and organization.\n\nThe club claims to be the oldest in the world. The Beefsteak Club of London antedates it, but was suspended for a while.\n\nIn 1747, the members decided to build a clubhouse, dubbed The Castle, at the foot of the Schuylkill River falls near Fairmount, now part of Philadelphia. It used some of the nearby walnut trees for timber.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Samuel Morris, the club's governor, was the captain of the First City Troop, which many other members joined. The club also changed its name to the \"State in Schuylkill.\"\n\nWhile Philadelphia was the young nation's new capital, President George Washington, an honorary member, was a frequent visitor to the clubhouse, as on June 14, 1787. On July 21, 1825, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette visited the Castle and was elected a member.\n\nWhen the Fairmount Dam was constructed in 1822, spoiling the fishing at the Falls, the Castle was moved downriver to Rambo's Rock, opposite Bartram's Garden and below Gray's Ferry.\n\nOn April 27, 1844, the club was incorporated under the name Schuylkill Fishing Company.\n\nWhen the fish in the Schuylkill were poisoned by sewage, the club was forced to move again. In 1887, the club bought the Clock House, on the Delaware River at Eddington near Cornwells Heights, two miles above Andalusia. Over the winter of 1887-1888, the Castle and Kitchen were re-erected on this new site, where the Company remained until 1944.\n\nIn 1944, the former estate of William B. Chamberlain, Devon House on the Delaware River near Andalusia, Pennsylvania, was conveyed to the State in Schuylkill. The Company moved all of its possessions, including the Castle and Kitchen, to this new site.\nInside the State House, portraits of the Governors lined the north wall of the entry hall and part of its south side. There were interesting ones of Governors Thomas Stretch and Samuel Morris, and several of the nineteenth century successors, as well as likenesses in oil of all nine Governors who served between 1896 and 1970. The door onto the porch was flanked by a piano and by a tall case clock made by Peter Stretch about 1740, father of the Schuylkill Fishing Company's first Governor, Thomas Stretch, which had been donated by Governor William Fisher Lewis.\n\nThe State in Schuylkill was assigned the place of honor in the Grand Centennial Torchlight Procession held July 3, 1876, celebrating the centennial of the Nation's founding. The Company was to have served as the personal escort of President Ulysses S. Grant, but since he was unable to attend it escorted the Governor of Pennsylvania and Mayor of Philadelphia throughout the city, passing Independence Hall at midnight amidst the ringing of bells, firing of salutes, and cheers of a large crowd.\n\nOn October 13, 1947, 125 years after its founding, members of the Schuylkill Fishing Company dedicated a memorial at the original clubhouse site on West River Drive (now Martin Luther King Drive) in Fairmount Park. The memorial was of gray stone, inset with a tablet of pink marble bearing the inscription:\n\nDuring the 1950s, when the Schuylkill Expressway was under construction, the Park Commission moved the monument about 200 yards west of the Girard Avenue Bridge (Martin Luther King Drive near Sweet Briar Drive) between West River Drive and the Expressway, some 125 yards from the actual spot where the Castle had stood.\n\nOn the frigid winter night of December 21–22, 1980, the State House, its caretaker's wing, and virtually all of its contents were destroyed in a fire. The separate Castle and Kitchen structures were not harmed. A new state House was built on the site in 1981-82.\n\nThe Club designated May 1 as the \"opening day\" of the sporting season and claimed to have received its rights for fishing and fowling on the river directly from Chief Tammany in 1732. There are 13 appointed fishing days in each year, at equal periods between May 1 and October 1, when the company assembles at the castle and a citizen, designated \"Caterer,\" assisted by the apprentices, prepares the golden perch in the ancient pans and old manner. Each club member serves as an apprentice at some time, and must learn to hold three perch in a long-handled frying pan over the blazing wood fire until one side is done to a tum, then, with a quick twist of his wrist, toss the fish up the old chimney, catching them as they fall on the uncooked side. The perch are served to the company assembled about the ancient table, on one of William Penn's platters presented to the club by his son John who was a member while Governor.\n\nThe club maintained a rather ambiguous claim to state sovereignty throughout its early history. During Prohibition in the United States, it claimed that it was unaffected, and continued to openly manufacture and drink alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe club is reputed to have been the origin of Fish House Punch, an alcoholic drink consisting mainly of rum.\n\nThe first mention of Fish House Punch — though not yet by that name — may be in the notes of William Black, the secretary of an embassy of Virginia Commissioners who visited Philadelphia in 1744. He recounted being met by local poobahs on the bank of the Schuylkill, where they were greeted “very kindly and welcomed . . . into their Province with a Bowl of fine Lemon Punch big enough to have Swimmed half a dozen of young Geese.\"\n\nThe Punch is traditionally made in a large bowl also used as a baptismal font for the citizens' infant sons; “its an ample space . . . . . would indeed admit of total immersion”, as one citizen noted. I doubt that there was Punch in it at the time — it was far too precious for such usage, and far too potent.\n\nAccording to legend, on a visit to the Castle George Washington drank so much of the potent Fish House Punch, he subsequently couldn’t bring himself to make an entry in his diary for three days. It was said to be Washington's favorite.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1345575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1345575", "title": "Setos", "text": "Setos\n\nSetos (, \"setoq\", ) are an indigenous ethnic and linguistic minority in south-eastern Estonia and north-western Russia. Setos are mostly Seto-speaking Orthodox Christians of Estonian nationality. The Seto language (like Finnish and Estonian) belongs to the Finnic group of the Uralic languages. The Setos seek greater recognition, rather than having their language considered a dialect of Estonian. Along with Orthodox Christianity, vernacular traditional folk religion is widely practiced and supported by Setos.\n\nThere are approximately 15,000 Setos around the world. The bulk of Setos, however, are found in the Setomaa region, which is divided between south-eastern Estonia (Põlva and Võro counties) and north-western Russian Federation (Pechorsky District of Pskov Oblast). Setos are an officially protected ethnic minority of Pskov Oblast.\n\nThe culture of Setos blossomed in the early 20th century when many national societies of Setos were organized. In 1905 the number of Setos reached its maximum. After the proclamation of independence of Estonia its authorities adopted a policy of Estonification of its population, which eventually led to virtual disappearance of Setos as a distinctive linguistic entity of Estonia. In Russia, due to the influence of Estonian language schools, high rates of mixed marriages, and emigration to Estonia, the number of Setos drastically decreased as well.\n\nPrior to A.D. 600 the whole of Setomaa was within the vast northern Finnic lands of the indigenous Uralic peoples. After A.D. 600 Slavic tribes migrated northeast, into Uralic lands. During this migration north the Slavic and Finnic tribes interbred in the southern habitation areas of the indigenous Finnics. \n\nThe first significant event that separated Setos from Estonians was forced conversion of the latter into Catholicism in the 13th century, while Setos who lived in Novgorod Land remained pagans. In the 15th century Setos were converted into Orthodox Christianity but kept their vernacular beliefs. Later elements of Catholic culture were brought to the Setos by Estonian colonists, while in Estonia itself they nearly disappeared after the Lutheran reformation in Estonia.\n\nIn 1920, with the peace treaty of Tartu, the area Setomaa (Setoland) was ceded to the newly created Republic of Estonia and it was included into Petseri County. As a result of World War II, the Republic of Estonia was forcibly annexed to the Soviet Union. And on August 15, 1944 the border between the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was revised by Moscow authorities to what it is now. The issue became topical as the Republic of Estonia was restored in the borders of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 and a national border was established soon afterwards. The establishment of the border brought about the division of Setomaa between two countries for the first time in history.\n\nThe Seto Congress, a body comprising representatives of Seto villages and organisations, is regularly convened every three years and elects a permanent Council of Elders. \n\nThe Society for Seto Congress was a member of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages. The Setomaa federation of municipalities in Estonia (\"Setomaa Valdade Liit\", comprising the communes of Mikitämäe, Värska, Meremäe and Misso) publishes the newspaper \"Setomaa\", partly in the Seto language, partly in Estonian.\n\nAlso, every year the Seto choose a steward of King Peko (\"sootska\" or \"ülebtsootska\") for the so-called Kingdom of Setomaa at the annual celebration of the Day of the Kingdom (\"Seto Kuningriigi päiv\"), a local festival that rotates among the bigger Seto villages. The office is largely ceremonial and has been held by local activists, politicians, entrepreneurs and scholars. The tradition was initiated by Paul Hagu, an ethnic Seto and a researcher of Seto folk songs and traditional vocal polyphony (Leelo) at the University of Tartu.\n\n\n\n"}

While whaling is banned in most parts of the world, some of the Native peoples of North America, including the Eskimo and Iñupiat peoples in Alaska, continue to hunt the Bowhead whale. Aboriginal whaling is valued for its contribution to food stocks (subsistence economy) and to cultural survival, although the days of commercial whaling in the United States and in Canada are over.\n\nThe bowhead whale is of great cultural significance to the Iñupiat in Utqiagvik, Alaska, who say that one cannot live without the other. According to the Iñupiat, the whale is the center of their diet, culture, and spirit. This makes them dependent on the complex system of sharing and celebrating the whale, and leads them to pray to any killed bowhead whale in thanks for the life it has given to them.\n\nFor the Iñupiat, subsistence hunting and fishing are important and viable economic strategies, which provide food and raw materials for the whole group. When hunters bring whales back to the community, about 65–70 people drag the whale onto the ice, where they work all day to harvest the meat. They work non-stop to prevent the whale's body heat from melting the ice too much. Afterwards, the captain and crew of the hunt invite the community to a celebratory meal. Once the captain has taken what he needs, he gives the rest of the whale away to his community and any others who need the food. However, despite its necessity, the interest in subsistence hunting has reduced among the youth in the tribes. Reasons for this decline include a lack of training, a lack of equipment, changing dietary preferences, a lack of interest, an increasing dependence upon wage employment, and interest in other activities (for example, basketball, hockey, and baseball).\n\nSubsistence hunters take pride in what they do, because they see themselves as strong providers for their family and community. People within the Inuit community describe active hunters as follows \"1) active hunters are always sharing meat with other people, 2) active hunters are always ready to go out hunting at a moment's notice, 3) active hunters travel at any time of year and not just during the spring, and 4) active hunters know more about travelling in cold weather and on the sea ice.\" On the way to the hunt, they travel by snowmobile across the ice until they find a safe campsite, which can sometimes take all day. The campsite must be near landlocked ice, so the hunters can move to the safety of solid ice in an emergency. Once on the hunt, they kill with harpoons and dart guns while sitting in their umiak (made from seal hide and part of a caribou).\n\nMost nutrition from the whale's meat and organs. According to the Iñupiat people, the whale's \"maktak\", the thick black skin and attached oily blubber, contains body-warming energy and vitamin C. The whale's bones are used to frame sod \"iglus\" (igloo), and the elastic baleen is woven into baskets. The liver membrane is used for drums.\n\nThe problem of food security creates a need for laws on hunting in Alaska. Under the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Association (FAO), food security is defined as the ability for an individual to \"have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\"\n\nUnder this definition, Alaskans would be able to hunt the bowhead whale despite conservation efforts, which creates a need for official regulation. Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971, which removed \"all aboriginal titles, if any, and claims of aboriginal title in Alaska based on use and occupancy, including submerged land underneath all water areas, both inland and offshore, and including any aboriginal hunting or fishing rights that may exist\". The act also titled Natives with \"44 million acres of Alaska and extinguished remaining claims with a $1 billion payment.\" Natives received compensation under this act, but it did not protect subsistence hunting. This led natives to look for exceptions in other laws, such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA).\n\nIn 1980, The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was adapted to include subsidence hunting and fishing rights. This act gives up its rights to lands and fishing rights and gives them to native Americans, Eskimos, or Aleuts for subsistence use. \"ANILCA provides that Alaska may obtain subsistence jurisdiction of federal lands upon passage of a law providing for a similar subsistence priority for rural residents\". The ANILCA also granted permanent protection to 104 million acres of federal land, including more than 40 million acres of parkland. Under ANILCA, Natives are allowed to substance hunt on seven new and expanded parks.\n\nANILCA governs subsistence for \"rural residents\", on federal lands, whereas state law governs subsistence for \"all Alaskans\", on state and private lands (including Native-owned ANCSA lands). Since both state and federal governments take care of Alaska's subsistence hunting laws, dual management between state and federal agencies is needed. This is currently guided by an Interim Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).\n\nPermits are required to practise subsistence hunting in state of Alaska. The above laws allow for any resident of Alaska to apply for these permits. Because of this, many of the laws made for subsistence hunting fall in line with Alaska's normal hunting laws. A person under the age of sixteen must have completed a Basic Hunter Education course or be with someone over the age of sixteen who has. One can also be with an adult born no later than January 1, 1986. Permit applications must be submitted between November 1st and December 15th or they will be is discarded. Game for use as food in customary and traditional Alaska Native religious ceremonies may be hunted out of season and more than the allowed limits.\n\nPermits are awarded to those who score highest on the application questions. Each application is scored on five questions, and permits for each hunt are given starting at the highest overall score and working downward until all permits have been given. Hunters may also apply for multiple permits (as separate applications), but can hold only one permit for each species of animal they wish to hunt. Permits cannot be transferred to another person, unless they are \"active duty military personnel deployed to a combat zone who are unable to use their Tier II permit [who] may transfer their permit to a substitute hunter who is a resident of Alaska.\"\n\nWhile hunting, one must carry the required permits, valid hunting licenses and, if appropriate, big game locking tags. At the end of the season all permits must be returned, regardless of use.\n\nThe Inuit have hunted whales long before European whaling ships showed up in the 1700s. from the 1940s they were forced to stop, but resumed in the 1990s. Only a few licenses are available each year. The hunt is monitored and co-managed by Nunavik Marine Regional Wildlife Board, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board, and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\n"}

This agreement continued after independence. The military and the government of Pakistan imposed a cash rent on the farm land, which the peasants tried to resist. There has been a dispute between the military who own the land and the peasants, which has led to military action, imprisoning and killing various members of AMP.\n\nThe Chairman, Younis Iqbal, and others were arrested in 2001. At the time of their arrest, another faction was brought forward, supported by the Peoples' Rights Movement and the Labour Party Pakistan.\n\nApril 13, 2018. (PCP) Pakistan Christian Congress PCC Founder President Dr. Nazir S Bhatti have expressed grave concern on Agents of Pakistan Military Intelligence MI, Inter Services Intelligence ISI and Punjab police raids of Christian and Muslim farmers effected by the land acquisition by Pakistan Army to built Garrison City of Okara in Punjab province of Pakistan decades ago.\n\nThe Association formed by effected farmers by the name of Anjuman-e-Muzareen AMP Chairman Younas Iqbal was arrested recently from court compound where he came for hearing. \nThe Christian and Muslim leaders of AMP are facing cases against them under terrorism on protesting for their due rights when Okara Army wanted to change tenant’s agreement signed on acquiring land. ==\n\nIt is surprising to note that Pakistan Army have built many new Garrison Cities after 1965 in provinces of Punjab, Sindh, KP and Balochistan while not a new single city is built for general public when population have risen to two hundred million. \n\nIn an urgent application to PPP leaders for immediate support by AMP reads as “We had a good relation with you, your leaders always stood by our side in our ups and downs of Muzareen. We always appreciated and remembered the great efforts of Madam Bainazir Bhutto who always fought for the rights of the lands of peasants. The reason for writing this application to you is that its time for us again to stand against the illegal act of Okara Military Farm. Today, the agencies and Okara police arrested Younas Iqbal (Chairman, Anjuman-e-Muzareen, Punjab AMP) when he went to anti-terrorist court, Sahiwal. So, we would like to request to Mr Bilawal Bhutto (Chairman Pakistan People Party) Shery Rehman (Senate Opposition Leader), Qamar Zaman Qaira (President Pakistan People Party) Chaudhary Manzoor Ahmad (General Secretary Pakistan People Party) and Napoleon Qayyum Minority Leader Pakistan Peoples Party, Human Rights activist to stand with us against this illegal act of Okara Military Farm so that we could continue our movement and fight for the rights of the Okara peasants. It would be very helpful for us if you speak about AMP. On 16th of March around at 8:30pm the AMP leadership and workers were making arrangement for the 17th March event a large number contingent of police raided the village Chak 10-4/L Antoniabad, District Okara They entered forcibly to the David Rehmat’s house (Secretary General, AMP) and Ulfat Dildar (Finance Secretary AMP, Okara). They wanted to arrest David Rehmat and Ulfat Dildar but arrested few activists and force them to postpone the event. Police used tear gas shells and aerial firing. Many were injured during the firing. The leader, activists and workers reacted strongly and police left the village. However, situation is still very tense and police is continually harassing the people of AMP requesting full solidarity, moral and legal help for AMP's struggle for peasant rights” \nDr. Nazir S Bhatti have appealed COAS General Bajwa to intervene to solve this long-standing issue of farmers and to withdraw cases against AMP leaders.\n\nWATCH BBC URDU REPORT ON PEASANT’S MOVEMENT OF OKARA\n\nThe following information is provided by the Chairman of Anjuman-e-Muzareen Punjab (AMP) and it is mainly oral without documentary proof.\n\nThe Military Dairy Farm Okara comprises six military farms. These farms cover an area of 18 chaks numbered as 3/4-L, 4/4-L, 5-A/4-L, 6/4-L, 8/4-L, 9/4-L, 10/4-L, 11/4-L, 12/4-L, 13/4-L, 17/4-L, 18/4-L, 20/4-L, 24/4-L, 25/4-L, 26/4-L, 44/3-R, and 45/3-R. In the early 20th century, land of the farm had been given to the ancestors of the peasants for cultivation and Abadkarai (habition) by the Government of British India. At that time, much of this region was infertile that could not be used for farming. The tenants were given the land with the promise that the peasants would be granted permanent ownership of the land once they succeeded in making it productive. The ancestors of the peasants succeeded in making the land fertile after much hardship, but the promise of ownership rights was not fulfilled.\n\nDue to the environment created before the First World War, the Government of British India planned to set up several farms to meet the needs of military personnel. One of these farms named Military Dairy Farm Okara was set up in 1913. The government did not disturb the possession of the ancestors and they continued their tenancies under Military Farm Management. The land had been given on lease of 20 year which had expired in 1933 and it had never renewed.\n\nThe total land of military Dairy Farm Okara was 17013 acres out of which 5000 acres were in direct cultivation of the management while 12013 acres land was in possession of the tenants. Out of 12013 acre land 1000 acres land was spread over in the Chak # 26/4-L and 24/4-L. In these Chaks, 80% land had been possessed and cultivated by ancestors of Christian peasants.\n\nAfter the partition of the sub-continents, in 1958, the land went waterlogged and could not be cultivated therefore, the peasants had to move around for earning their livelihood. In 1998, when the land returned to normal, the peasants came back and began farming. In 2000, the Military forcefully possessed the land for the purpose of Military Training Camp. The tenants did not want to leave the possession but Military vacant the land. However, the Military had not built any training camp but used that land for agricultural purpose.\n\nThe ancestors of the tenants occupied the under the valid authorities as sub-tenants of the former lessee. On setting up of the Military farm, they were allowed to continue at tenants but this condition had not been applied to their descendants. The other Military Farms are in possession of the tenants on which they are cultivating.\n\nThe Provincial Government had introduced many Abadkari Schemes during the last several years in which proprietary rights had been given to the tenants at a nominal rates. But with the tenants of the Chak # 24/4-L and 26/4-L had left without land.\n\nOver 500 peasants had been earning their daily bread from that land. But after the possession of the Military, their lives turned to morning. They all were poor and unskilled people who knew only cultivation. They had no source of income to pursue the matter in the court. On the other hand, the military is the most powerful institution of the country and even the government had never dared to stand before the military.\n\nThe 500 peasants get together for their hereditary rights and after a struggle of 9 years; they managed to submit an application to the Board of Revenue Punjab in May 2009 on behalf of Rasheed Masih son of Barkat Masih. But the application had not been entertained properly due to the significant status of the Military.\n\nMunawar Bibi who is president of the AMP, Dr. Chanan Pehalwan, senior Supreme Council member AMP and AMP chairman Younis Iqbal Founder of AMP are leading this movement. In Revenue Board’s documents they have their names as the ones plowing the land till 80’s. Later on they\n\nOn 1 July 2010 about 500 Christians and 200 muslims would enter the land and occupy it. Then we will give them legal help if any criminal case filed against them. Along with that a civil lawsuit for stay order will be filed. However, full consensus hasn’t yet developed whether they should go for the stay order or they should wait until the other party takes any legal action. One major reason is that our party hasn’t been able to get the agreement between Military Farms administration according to which the land was transferred to the Okara Cantonment Army — 40 Division and Engineering Corps. According to them the purpose of this transfer was for war practices of the army but they gave it to contractors for cultivation.\n\nSpoke person Younis Iqbal\n\nFounder of AMP.\n\n\nAnjuman muzareen Punjab\n"}

The story takes place in the world of the Giver. Each book has a different protagonist, but is set in the same futuristic era.\n\n\"The Giver\" is a 1993 American children's novel (generally young adult or older) set in a society that is at first presented as a utopian society but gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy, Jonas, through the twelfth and thirteenth years of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to \"Sameness,\" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness in case the memories that others lack are ever needed to aid decisions. Jonas learns the truth about his Utopian society and struggles with its weight.

It is set in the same future time period and treats some of the same themes.\n\nThe central character, Kira, who has a deformed leg, is orphaned and must learn to survive in a society that normally leaves the weak or disabled exposed to die in the fields. Kira's father was apparently mauled by the Beasts at the Field. Kira's mother had died recently from an illness.\n\nSince she is an orphan, Kira needs a reason for the Council of Edifice to keep her in the village, rather than send her to the Field, which is certain death at the hands of The Beast. Kira's mother used to do embroidery for the Council and taught Kira some of her talents. Kira's gift for embroidery convinces the Council to keep her around to mend and update a beautiful robe, which shows the history of their society. In the course of the book, she begins to learn the art of dyeing thread different colors from except for blue, which nobody in her community knows how to make. But only Annabella knows, Kira's mentor. She also learns more about the truth of her village and the terrible secrets it holds.

{"id": "14778811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14778811", "title": "Webcam model", "text": "Webcam model\n\nA webcam model (colloquial gender-neutral: camodel; female: camgirl; male: camboy) is a video performer who is streamed upon the Internet with a live webcam broadcast. A webcam model often performs erotic acts online, such as stripping, in exchange for money, goods, or attention. They may also sell videos of their performances. Since many webcam models operate from their homes, they are free to choose the amount of sexual content for their broadcasts. While most display nudity and sexually provocative behavior, some choose to remain mostly clothed and merely talk about various topics while still soliciting payment as tips from their fans.\n\nIn 1996 an American college student and conceptual artist, Jenny Ringley, created a website called \"JenniCam.\" Her web camera was located in her dorm room and automatically photographed her every few minutes. The camera captured Ringley doing almost everything – brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, doing stripteases – and then broadcast its images live over the Internet. Later in 1998 she divided her website's access into free and paying. Also in 1998, a commercial site called AmandaCam was launched. Amanda's site, like Ringley's, had multiple cameras around her house which allowed people to look in on her. However Amanda made an important early discovery that would influence the camming industry for decades to come – that a website's popularity could be greatly increased by enabling viewers to chat with a performer while online. Within her \"members section\", Amanda made it a point to chat with her viewers for over three hours a day. Since the early days of live webcasts by Ringley and Amanda, the phenomenon of \"camming\" has grown to become a multibillion-dollar industry which has an average of at least 12,500 cam models online at any given time and more than 240,000 viewers at any given time.\n\nA camming website acts as a middleman and talent aggregator by hosting hundreds of independent models, and verifies that all are at least 18 years old. Camming websites typically fall into two main categories, dependent upon whether their video chat rooms are free or private. In private chat rooms, viewers pay by the minute for a private show. However, in free chat rooms payment is voluntary and is in the form of tips, thus providing the model with an income at a minimal cost for the multiple viewers of her chat room's video stream.\n\n\"Tips\" are electronic tokens that viewers can buy from a camming website, and then give to the models during live performances to show appreciation. Tokens can also be used buy access to private shows, operate a Teledildonic device that a model may be wearing, or used to buy videos and souvenirs from a model. The website provides the transactional platform and then collects and distributes a percentage of the tips to the models. For public chat rooms, the model's portion of a tip is a little less than half.\n\nMany of the industry’s top webcam models are said to make six figures a year.\n\nPerformances can be highly interactive in both public and private video chat rooms. Customers and performers are able to communicate with each other by using keyboard, speech, and two-way cameras. Within public chat rooms the audience can see tips and viewer comments as scrolling text which appears next to the real-time video stream. Camgirls will frequently read and respond to the scrolling viewer comments. The chatter is constant, and is often led by a small band of regular fans. However this is not the first time that \"conversational interaction\" had become a boon for the erotic entertainment industry. The Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre strip club is credited with the invention of the lap dance when during 1977 their new stage, New York Live, pioneered customer-contact shows with strippers that came off the stage and sat in the laps of customers for tips. Enabled with this new revenue stream for strippers, the strip club industry went through a period of extreme growth during the 1980s. And in the early 20th century sociologist Paul Cressey noted that within the hundreds of taxi-dance halls of America, \"the traffic in romance and in feminine society\" would become available when taxi dancers would offer their companionship and \"the illusion of romance\" for ten cents a dance. \n\nMuch of the success of camming owes to its ability to move beyond the borders of erotic video performance, and into the everyday social lives of camming customers, or \"fans\" as they are known. Webcam performers are often highly entrepreneurial, and use mainstream social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, and Tumblr to build and maintain relationships with their customers. Some fans communicate multiple times a day with models through social media. \n\nUnlike traditional pornography, the interactive nature of the camming medium titillates with the promise of \"virtual friendship\". Princeton University sociologist and author of \"The Purchase of Intimacy\", Viviana Zelizer, states of camming: \"They’re defining a new kind of intimacy. It’s not traditional sex work, not a relationship, but something in between.\" Cam models perform not just sex work, but also perform through their hosting duties, conveying authenticity, creating and animating fantasies, and managing relationships over time.\n\nWithin \"Cam Girlz\", a documentary film about the industry, the male fans often say that they come to camming sites as a way to fulfill emotional needs. The film's director, Sean Dunne, states of the fans, \"They said it’s not like a strip club -- it’s like a community, and you feel it when you’re in these chat rooms. It’s a community and entertainment that goes very far beyond sexuality.\"\n\nHowever Dr. Kari Lerum of the University of Washington suggests that men are more open and vulnerable in cam rooms than in strip clubs, and can become very invested in relationships which only exist on the screen.\n\nThe term webcam is a clipped compound used to combine the terms video camera and World Wide Web. \n\nWhen webcam models create their live webcasts, they perform the activity known as \"camming\".\n\nA third-party hosting website which transmits multiple webcam models' video-streams is known as a \"camming site\".\n\nWebcam models mostly perform individually in separate video chat rooms, which are frequently referred to as \"rooms\".\n\nThe term \"camwhore\" was first used in print in November 2001; however, the label is considered derogatory and pejorative.\n\nAs of 2016, the money generated by camming sites was upwards of $2 billion annually. The pornography business as a whole is estimated to be about $5 billion. According to the web traffic analysis service Compete.com, LiveJasmin generates more than 9 million unique viewers a month. Similar webcam model hosting sites such as Chaturbate, CAM4 and MyFreeCams.com boast 4.1 million, 3.7 million and 2 million unique monthly visitors, respectively. The decentralized business model of camming has upended the pornography industry in multiple ways. Camming revenue has been severely cutting into the profits of the pornographic movie business, which has also been eroded for a number of years due to piracy and the distribution of free sexual content upon the Internet. Additionally, the pornographic film industry used to be male-dominated except for the performers. But since camming only requires a video camera, broadband service, and computer, there has now been a power reversal and it is the \"female\" webcam performers who propel the industry while at home. Todd Blatt, who once produced pornographic movies in California and has several Ferraris to show for it, declared: \"If you’re the middle guy who has been eating off this industry for 20 years, it’s a big change. The girls don’t need anybody.\"\n\nThe new revolution that the decentralized camming industry had brought, has also challenged many cultural stereotypes concerning both the camgirls and their customers. Ethnography researcher Dr. Theresa Senft herself became a camgirl for a year while doing four years of research for her 2008 book entitled, \"Camgirls: Celebrity and Community in the Age of Social Networks\". Senft has described herself as \"the first academic camgirl\" while becoming a “camgirl writing about camgirls.” And Anna Katzen, a camgirl who has a postgraduate degree from Harvard, stated during an interview, \n\nWebcam models typically make use of third-party websites to stream their real-time video performances upon the Internet. Some of these sites charge viewers a fixed fee per minute, although many allow free access for unregistered visitors. These Internet hosting websites, known as \"camming sites\", take care of the technical work – broadcast their video feed, payment processing, provide an intuitive interface, advertising – so that the cam model only has to focus on the actual shows for her video chat room. Most cam models are independent contractors for camming sites, and are not employees.\n\nBy presenting hundreds of different models via individual chat rooms, a camming site becomes a talent aggregator and middleman – but only in the sense that Apple is the middleman for bands selling music on iTunes. Though a camming website may carry many hundreds of models, they frequently provide an interface for the viewer to easily switch between the most-visited models' rooms, and that interface occasionally resembles the multiple channel selection of cable television.\n\nCamming sites typically supply each webcam model with an individual \"profile webpage\" where the performer can describe themselves, and more importantly create a \"virtual store\" where they can sell items like videos, photos, personal clothing, and memberships to their fan club. The profile page's virtual store creates a stream of passive income, meaning that even if a camgirl is not online and performing, she can still generate money while fans come to the ever-present profile page to purchase its wares. One of the most popular items are homemade videos that cam models make of themselves. While most these videos are sexual in nature, they often include elements of comedy, fashion, and a narration of their lifestyles. The affordability and ease of new video recording technology has spawned new variations and genres of pornography since individual women as well as industry players can now create its content. A profile page might also sell contact information like a personal phone number, a spot on her Snapchat contact list, or the ability to send her private messages through a camming site's \"friends list\". The profile page may also suggest tip amounts for real-time performance requests like a sexy dance, a song request, removal of clothing, a spanking, or the spin on a game wheel. All prices on a profile page are listed in quantities of \"tips\", which are electronic tokens that the viewer can buy in bunches from the cam site to be later given to various models during performance, or in later purchases upon the profile page.\n\nThe camming site keeps a percentage of the tips, but the amount varies. Big earners can get a bigger chunk of their tips. Commissions earned by webcam models vary widely by website, but are usually based on a percentage of gross sales although sometimes they are in the form of a flat fee. They may also earn money through advertising or earn commissions by convincing customers to sign up for membership at adult pornographic paysites. Many sites also encourage viewers to purchase items from online wish lists. Some webcam models cater to particular fetishes, such as a fascination with feet and might earn additional money by selling worn socks to patrons.\nCamming sites specify rules and restrictions for their cam models, which in turn tend to give the camming site a distinct style and format. For example, one major free-access site, which only allows female models, fosters an environment where the camgirls are not necessarily obligated to do masturbation shows, or even display nudity. Consequently, some of that site's models create a more relaxed \"hangout atmosphere\" within their rooms that occasionally resembles a talk show. And conversely another major cam site, which additionally allows men and couples to perform, tends to be more sexual and show-oriented. Other cam site rules might prohibit working in a public place so that the model does not get a public indecency arrest, the way that Kendra Sunderland was charged after her 2014 performance inside the Oregon State University Library. Models who violate a camming site's rules may be subjected to a temporary or permanent ban from the cam site.\n\nCam studios allow models to rent facilities outside of their home. These businesses can supply models with video equipment, Internet service, computer, lighting, and furniture. One example was the pornographic film company Kink.com, which rented individual cam studios in the San Francisco Armory by the hour, from 2013 until the building was sold in 2018.\n\nWithin some studios the cam models can work by the percentage of business that they bring in, instead of renting studio time. The cam models do not have to pay to join this type of studio, but they are also not guaranteed a salary. These models can typically choose to charge customers between $1 and $15 per minute, and then the studio keeps half of the gross while the model gets the rest.\n\nAnother workplace option is called a \"camgirl mansion\", which is a place that provides equipment and broadcast rooms where multiple camgirls can live and share expenses, but without a studio owner. \n\nVarious support websites supply general information about business strategies, upcoming conferences, tips for performance, and reviews of studio equipment. Support sites also give advice about how to protect privacy, discourage piracy, avoid Internet security lapses, and how to prevent financial scams.\n\nConferences and industry trade shows can also aid cam models by allowing cam models to network and meet others in the profession on a personal level.\n\nLawrence Walters, a Florida lawyer who is an expert in obscenity law, said that there was nothing inherently illegal about web model camming shows, as long as the models were over 18 and performed at home or in a model's studio.\n\nA sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, notes an interesting paradox in British law which tends to focus on the uploading of pornographic recordings, but does not deal with erotic performance when streamed upon the Internet through camming. For instance, the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 ban certain acts from being depicted and uploaded by pornography producers in the United Kingdom, and the Digital Economy Act 2017 seeks to restrict minors’ access to pornographic material online. And yet both laws will have no effect if the performances are \"streamed\" as opposed to being \"recorded\". Stuart states of the legal conundrum in England, \"Performing an explicitly pornographic act via a webcam carries no repercussions, but if the same show is recorded and uploaded, the performer can be liable to a fine.\" \n\nIn December 2017 the American FCC voted to do away with Net Neutrality rules, which previously insured that Internet service providers treat all data on the Internet as the same, and to not charge differently by user. But without the Net Neutrality rules, Internet service providers could dramatically increase costs for companies that need significant bandwidth – like CD Baby, Spotify, and Netflix. CD Baby is an online music store specializing in the sale of CDs and music downloads from independent musicians to consumers. Like camming's hosting sites, CD Baby is an aggregator of independent performers' digital media in the same way that camming sites enable cam models to sell their videos for tips. Since the free-access business model of the camming industry also relies on large bandwidth, these possible new costs could eventually be passed on to camming hosting sites, as well as to the cam models themselves. A politically alert camgirl, Melonie, states: \"How many camgirls and webcam customers are going to be able to afford a $200+ monthly bill from their ISP for a high bandwidth connection capable of HD video streaming? How many camgirls are going to be able to continue to devote time to create webcam host programming if the payout percentage is reduced from 30% to 15%?\" \n\nIn October 2014 a 19-year-old Oregon State University student, Kendra Sunderland, had been working as a camgirl before she made an hour-long video for MyFreeCams.com of herself at the Oregon State University Library, in which she stripped and masturbated on camera for a live audience. She was then charged with public indecency after the show was recorded by someone who was watching MyFreeCams.com online, and then posted it on other sites. Sunderland faced fines up to $6,250 and one year of jail. She pleaded guilty, paid $1,000, and avoided jail. The incident generated headlines around the country and landed Sunderland reported deals with Playboy, and a contract with Penthouse's parent company Friend Finder Networks purportedly worth six figures. The incident greatly increased Sunderland's popularity, and she has continued to do camming and speak positively of it as a career.\n\nIn Arizona during 2015 a fan took his appreciation of camgirls to an illegal level when he was indicted for spending $476,000 on a company credit card, which he used for tips on camming websites. He spent more than $100,000 on MyFreeCams.com alone, and sent $26,800 to one cam model in particular to pay for her college tuition bill, and new tires for her car. According to the indictment he also purchased flowers, chocolates, electronic equipment, shoes, a TV, a handbag, laptop computer, and an iPod for some of his favorite camgirls.\n\nWebcam models have occasionally been the targets of cyber-stalkers and blackmailers. Sex work researcher, Rachel Stuart, reported that while doing her PhD research she encountered webcam models who were concerned about viewers filming and sharing their performances on porn sites, or acquiring personal information which could be used to stalk or blackmail them. In 2013 the New York Times interviewed a woman who prefers to conceal her real identity while working as a camgirl. She revealed that she had been cyber-stalked by a heavy tipper who started making threats and demands about what outfits she should wear. A short while later she found out that her real name and address had been posted on the Internet along with her cam name. When she complained to the police, they said that they could do nothing, because \"putting real information on the Internet is not illegal.\" She later found out that the same individual had also threatened and outed several other camgirls.\n\nA \"New York Times\" report described the story of Justin Berry, a 13-year-old boy who, after hooking up his webcam and listing himself on an online forum in order to make friends, was propositioned by older men to strip and masturbate on camera. CNN referred to him as \"in the language of cyberspace... a cam-whore\". He started his own paysite, prostituted himself, sold video recordings of his encounters with Mexican prostitutes, and helped hire other underage models. He made several hundred thousand dollars over five years before turning all information over to prosecutors in exchange for immunity.\n\nIn one case, sex traffickers who operated illegal brothels forced an indentured victim to have sex in webcam shows.\n\n"}
