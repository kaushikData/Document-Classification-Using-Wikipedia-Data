{"id": "5945565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5945565", "title": "Afrikaner nationalism", "text": "Afrikaner nationalism\n\nAfrikaner nationalism is a political ideology that was born in the late nineteenth century among Afrikaners in South Africa. It was strongly influenced by anti-British sentiments that grew strong among the Afrikaners, especially because of the Boer Wars.\n\nAccording to historian T. Dunbar Moodie, Afrikaner nationalism could be described as a kind of civil religion that combined the history of the Afrikaners, the formalised language (Afrikaans) and Afrikaner Calvinism as key symbols. A major proponent of the ideology was the secret \"Broederbond\" organisation and the National Party that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994. Other organisations aligned with Afrikaner nationalist ideology were the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations (\"Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge\", FAK), the Institute for Christian National Education and the White Workers' Protection Association.\n\nOne of the first champions of Afrikaner nationalism was ordained minister Stephen Du Toit of the Dutch Reformed Church, who was also one of the founding members of the \"Broederbond\" as well as the publisher of \"Die Afrikaanse Patriot\" newspaper. In his writings, Du Toit put forward the notion that Afrikaners were a distinct nationality with a fatherland (South Africa) and their own language (Afrikaans) and that the \"volk's\" destiny was to rule South Africa.\n\nReligion, especially Afrikaner Calvinism, played an instrumental role in the development of Afrikaner nationalism and consequently the apartheid ideology. The Dutch Reformed Churches of South Africa were involved throughout the 18th century in a constant battle against modernism and modernity. They aligned with the conservative views of Abraham Kuyper, who emphasised God's authority over separate spheres of creation. These spheres, for example historical nations, had to be preserved and protected from liberalism and revolutionary ideologies. Kuyper also rejected the Enlightenment with its emphasis on human rationality and individuality and thought that it had led to the ideals of equality, fraternity and freedom of the French Revolution. In his view, all these ideas challenged God's authority. Afrikaner theologians worked from this foundation and defined a number of political, economic and cultural spheres that had their separate, independent destinies. The Afrikaner history was also reinterpreted through a Christian-nationalistic ideology. Already Paul Kruger, president of Transvaal and a founding member of the \"Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika\" or 'Dopper Church', referred to it as \"sacred history\" with \"volk\" as the chosen people, where the Great Trek was seen as the Exodus from the British rule in Cape to the Promised Land of the Boer Republics.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s many intellectuals partook in the theoretical formulation of Afrikaner nationalism. Nicolaas Johannes Diederichs, who later became South Africa's president, formulated Afrikaner nationalistic ideology in his book \"Nationalism as a Worldview and Its Relationship to Internationalism\" through Kuyperian theology. According to Diederichs, God created nations and these nations had a God-ordained right to exist as separate entities. Therefore, Afrikaners could refuse a \"British-designed\" South Africa in which they would co-exist with other ethnic groups as a minority. Geoffrey Cronje developed these ideas further and argued, that as long as the Afrikaner existed as a minority in a racially and culturally different environment, they could not allow the black majority to develop economically or politically, since this would lead to black domination. He acknowledged this as unjust and unchristian, and as a solution offered total segregation, that is apartheid, between the blacks and the whites.\n\nThe Afrikaner nationalist intelligentsia, along with the National Party and the \"Broederbond\", ended up formulating a radical nationalistic policy which rejected British hegemony in economics and politics as well as ethnic \"mengelmoes\" (\"mess\") induced by the transportation of black migrant workers around the country. Their solution was a drastic reordering of the South African demographic map with a dominant Afrikaner Republic not influenced by British imperialism. However, because of the opposition of the urban middle class they did not propose a return to conservative, pre-modern Boer pastoralism.\n\nInitially during the 19th century, the position of the Dutch Reformed Church on the nationalist issue was more pragmatic than ideological and, for example, in South Africa, racial segregation was accepted as a harmonious way of administering heterogeneous community. The economic depression in 1905–09 changed this attitude when a new group of \"poor whites\", mostly Afrikaners, emerged. By 1939 the racial segregation had been made into a church dogma: \n\nThe Afrikaner state as a Christian civilisation thus had a divine right to stay separate and rule the surrounding \"heathen\" nations.\n\nAfrikaner nationalism and Nazism had common roots in religio-nationalism and Pan Germanism and therefore the racist elements of the former were easily assimilated into the earlier. For example, Afrikaner criticism of the capitalistic system inter-war period was quite anti-Semitic. Many Afrikaner nationalists also viewed a Nazi German style strong government as necessary to protect the \"volk\". Just before, and during World War II, these sentiments led to the appearance of a number of pro-Nazi Afrikaner nationalistic organisations, such as the \"Ossewabrandwag\" and its paramilitary wing \"Stormjaers\".\n\nJ. B. M. Hertzog led the National Party to the 1915 and 1920 elections under the slogan \"South Africa first\" to create a South Africa independent from the British influence. In the 1924 elections he defeated the South African Party led by Jan Smuts, after Smuts had used force to end the Rand Revolt of white miners in 1922, and stayed in power for 15 years in a coalition government with the Labour Party. During his reign, he steadily promoted Afrikaner nationalism while deepening the racial segregation in the country.\n\nDuring the 1930s a group of \"Broederbond\" members shaped the Afrikaner nationalistic ideology, by trying to create a common \"Christian-nationalistic\" identity for all white, Afrikaans speaking South Africans as well as introducing the idea of \"Volkskapitalisme\" (people's capitalism) that tried to take control from the \"British\" or \"Jewish\" foreign economic system and to adapt it to Afrikaner's national character. \"Volkskapitalisme\" strived to improve the economic conditions of the Afrikaners who in general at the time were less well-off than the English-speaking whites in South Africa. In practice the program consisted of utilising the Afrikaner capital into new and existing Afrikaner businesses. Although \"volkskapitalisme \"managed to develop some Afrikaner businesses, such as Sanlam and Volkskas into corporate giants that still have a central role in South African economy, in the end the economic benefits for the majority of the poor Afrikaners were slim.\n\nDespite the efforts of the \"Broederbond\" activists to \"Afrikanerise\" South Africa, the uptake of this new Christian-nationalistic Afrikaner identity was slow and unenthusiastic. According to electoral studies, the majority of the target group (white, Afrikaans speaking South Africans) did not vote for the Afrikaner nationalistic National Party until the early 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s Afrikaner nationalists constructed an \"imagined community\" of the Afrikaner with maps and narratives of its heroic past, moral purpose and a place among other nations. These ideas were spread through new emerging Afrikaner print media, such as the Christian-nationalistic journal \"Koers\" (Direction) and a more popularised \"Inspan\", magazines such as \"Huisgenoot\", books published by the \"Burger Boekhandel\" publishing house and the newspapers \"Die Burger\", \"Transvaler\" and \"Volksblad\". The usage of Afrikaans instead of Dutch was aggressively promoted throughout the 1920s especially in white schools. The Bible was translated into Afrikaans by J. D. du Toit, E. E. van Rooyen, J. D. Kestell, H. C. M. Fourie, and BB Keet in 1933.\n\nThe South African opposition during the World War II of the country's involvement in the war against Nazi Germany led to the National Party's rise to power in the 1948 elections, to the implementation of the apartheid politics in the country and finally to the culmination of Afrikaner nationalistic mobilisation in 1961 when the country resigned from the British Commonwealth and became a republic. The National Party government implemented, alongside apartheid, a program of social conservatism. Pornography, gambling, and other such vices were banned because they were thought to be elements contrary to the \"Afrikaner way of life\". Even adultery and attempted adultery were banned (by the Immorality Amendment Act, Act No 23 of 1957).\n\nDuring the 1960s a split emerged in the Afrikaner electorate over the issue of how to preserve a distinct identity in a multi-ethnic society: one faction insisted on preserving the national identity through strict isolation, while others thought that such barriers needed to be relaxed. As a sign of this, in the 1970 election a radical splinter group from the National Party, Herstigte Nasionale Party, got 3.59% of the vote compared to the National Party's 54.86%. The gulf widened further during the 1980s partly because of the international pressure against apartheid.\n\nOne notable Afrikaner nationalist organisation was the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), a political and former paramilitary group. The group had the support of an estimated 5–7 percent of white South Africans in 1988. The organisation was beset by personal and militant scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s that led to diminished support. This organisation was however never able to garner substantial Afrikaner support, which was held by the National Party until its dissolution.\n\nIn the 1990s the National Party acknowledged the failure of its ethnic project and under the leadership of F. W. De Klerk dismantled the political system set up from 1948. After apartheid, Afrikaner nationalism has lost most of its support.\n\nAlthough it has mostly disappeared from publicity, Afrikaner nationalism is kept alive through such political initiatives as the \"Cyber Republic of the Boer Nation\", which claims to be \"the only white indigenous tribe in Southern Africa\" and has tried to appeal to the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations for the protection of cultural, linguistic and religious rights of people around the world. Also some marginal right wing political parties, such as the Herstigte Nasionale Party, still declare their goal to be the \"unashamed promotion of Afrikaner nationalism\".\n\nFront National (South Africa); a political party in South Africa has also emerged in the post-apartheid years harbouring Afrikaner Nationalism. The party is linked to \"South Africa Today\" a media outlet that reports about South African farm attacks and other things that affect white South Africans.\n\nThe tradition of Christian-national education is continued by the Movement for Christian-National Education () which educates the youth of the Boere-Afrikaner \"volk\" in the Afrikaner Calvinist tradition, Boer culture and history as well as in Afrikaans language. \n\nThe Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging had been largely inactive in South Africa since the demise of apartheid, although in 2008, the organisation was reactivated and is actively seeking an Afrikaner secessionist state within South Africa. On 3 April 2010, Eugene Terre'Blanche, leader of the AWB, was murdered on his farm.\n\nThe Suidlanders is a survivalist Afrikaner group.\n\n\n\n"}

They are a physically diverse group formed after years of assimilation of Austroasiatic, Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman and Tai populations. The total population of native Assamese speakers in Assam is nearly 13 million which makes up 48.8% of the population of Assam according to the \"Language census of 2001\". Though there is a political dispute over the definition of Assamese people in Assam, in general; the people belonging to the state of Assam along with belonging to an indigenous community of Assam and speaking the Assamese language or any other language of Assam as his/her first language are referred as Assamese people. \n\nThe indigenous Assamese people traditionally include ethnic groups like Assamese Brahmins (including Ganaks), Koch Rajbongshis, Ahoms, Deoris, Sonowal–Kacharis, Rabhas, Hajongs, Bodo, Mishings, Assamese Kayasthas, Kalitas,[Chutiya people|Chutias]], , Keot(Kaibarta), Baro-Bhuyan, Mech Kacharis, Thengal–Kacharis, Tiwas, Sarania Kacharis, Nath, Kumar, Hira, Tai-Phake, Tai-Aiton, Tai-Khamyangs, Tai-Khamti, Tai-Turung, other Tai groups, Moran, Motok, Doms/Nadiyals, Assamese Muslims (particularly Goria, Moria, Deshi communities), Assamese Sikhs, Assamese Christians speaking Assamese or any other tribal dialect of Assam as their mother tongue and indigenous ethnic groups of other neighbouring North-East states.\n\nThough there is a political dispute over the definition of Assamese people, in general; the people belonging to the state of Assam are referred as Assamese people. The lack of a definition has put stumbling blocks in implementing \"clause 6\" of the Assam Accord, an agreement signed by the activists of the Assam Movement and the Government of India in 1985. Since a legal definition is important to provide \"constitutional, legislative and cultural\" safeguards to the Assamese people, the Government of Assam had formed a ministerial committee to finalize the definition in March 2007. To address the \"clause 6\" issue, AASU had announced a definition on April 10, 2000 which was based on residency with a temporal limit: \"All those whose names appeared in the 1951 National Register of Citizens and their progenies should be considered as Assamese. \" Difficulty in definition is rooted in the heterogeneous nature of inhabitants of the Assam State.\n\nAccording to 2011 census, Out of (13,257,272) Assamese people, majority of (10,013,013) or (75.52%) Assamese people are Hindus, largest minority of (2,830,072) or (21.34%) Assamese people are Muslims, and very few (414,187) or (3.14%) Assamese people are Christians and Sikhs by religion.\n\nThe first usage of the English word \"Assamese\" is noted in colonial times; based on same principle as Sinhalese, Nepalese and Canarese, derived from the Anglicised word \"Assam\" with the suffix -ese, meaning \"of Assam.\" In contrast, Western Assam from early to pre–colonial times was known as \"'Kamarupa\" (instead of Asama) and considered a politically, socially and culturally separate unit from the rest of the state.In the 16th century, the Ahom kingdom was known as the \"Kingdom of Acham\" to the Mughals; and later, to the British. In 1682, the eastern Kamrup was annexed by Ahom kingdom and the expanded kingdom continued to be called as the \"Kingdom of Assam\" by Europeans till 1821, when the Ahom kingdom became part of the Burmese Empire.\n\nAfter Assam became part of British India, the newly constituted province came to be known by its new anglicised name Assam after its largest constituent, and the name \"Assamese / Asamiya\" came to be associated with the Assamese language which was erstwhile known as Kamrupi.\n\nAccording to Yasmin Saikia, \"the group that now identifies as Tai–Ahom were historically seen as the Assamese people. However, the term ethnic Assamese is now associated by the Indian government at Delhi with the Assamese speaking Indo–Aryan, Tibeto-Burman and Austric groups (\"comprising all religious beliefs\") of Assam. The Tai-Ahom people were a dominant minority during the Ahom Rule.\n\nIllegal immigrants from Bangladesh has been a key issue in Assam. Most of the immigrants settle in Assam due to economic reasons and their population is estimated to be between 7-8 million. The issue of illegal influx has a 30-year-old history, starting with the anti-foreigner agitation that began in 1979 under the leadership of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU). In 1985, after hundreds of people died in course of independent India’s biggest mass uprising, the AASU and other agitation groups signed an agreement with the Centre called the Assam Accord. It fixed 25 March 1971 as the cut-off date for detection and expulsion of illegal migrants, meaning anyone found entering India after this date were to be detected and sent back. In the three decades that followed, a few thousand illegal Bangladeshi migrants have been expelled by successive state governments, which included the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), a party that was formed with the mandate of freeing Assam of illegal aliens. Many of these ‘expelled’ people are believed to have come back.\n\nAccording to an Assam government white paper, between 1985 and 2012, 2,442 illegal immigrants from Bangladesh had been expelled from the state. The central home ministry said in 2004 that it estimated a total of five million illegal immigrants in Assam.Shri Indrajit Gupta, the then Home Minister of India stated in the Parliament on 6 May, 1997 that there were 10 million illegal migrants residing in India.\n\n\n \n"}

On the morning of August 17, 1795, at the Knip plantation of slave master Caspar Lodewijk van Uytrecht at Bandabou, Curaçao, Tula led an uprising of 40 to 50 people. The enslaved met on the square of the plantation and informed van Uytrecht they would no longer be his slaves. He told them to present their complaints to the lieutenant governor at Fort Amsterdam. They left and went from Knip to Lagun, where they freed 22 slaves from jail.\n\nFrom Lagun, the liberators went to the sugar plantation of Saint Kruis, where they were joined by more rebels under Bastian Karpata. Tula then led the liberated people from farm to farm, freeing more people.\n\nThe slave owners had now retreated to the city, leaving their plantations unprotected. At the same time, a confederate French slave, Louis Mercier, led another group of freed slaves to Saint Kruis, where he took the commandant, van der Grijp, and ten of his mixed race soldiers as prisoners. Mercier also attacked Knip, where he freed more slaves and took some weapons. He then rejoined Tula, locating him by following the trail of destruction Tula had left behind.\n\nVan Uytrecht in the meantime had sent his son on horseback with a note to the governor, and at 7 p.m., the council met to prepare a defense of the colony. Governor Johannes de Veer ordered Commander Wierts of the navy ship \"Medea\", which was in port at the time, to defend Fort Amsterdam. Sixty-seven men, both white and black, under the command of Lieutenant R.G. Plegher were sent against the rebels. They went by boat to Boca San Michiel from Willemstad, and from there on foot to Portomari, where Tula and his followers were camping. When the Dutch military arrived there on August 19, they attacked Tula's group, but were defeated.\n\nAt the plantation of Fontein, Pedro Wakao killed the Dutch slaver, Sabel, who became the first white victim of the rebellion. Wakao also found more weapons at Fontein.\n\nThe governor was notified of Plegher's defeat, and the rebellion was now considered a serious threat to the white community. The governor and the slavers had raised a force of 60 well-armed horsemen under the command of Captain Baron van Westerholt to renew the attack. Westerholt had orders to offer leniency to the rebels if they would surrender. Among this party was Jacobus Schink, a Franciscan priest who served as negotiator and attempted to prevent bloodshed.\n\nTula was aware of the revolution that had resulted in freedom for the enslaved in Haiti. Tula argued that, since the Netherlands were now captured by the French, they should get their freedom as well. The three demands of Tula were: an end to collective punishment, an end to labor on Sunday, and the freedom to buy clothes and goods from others than their own masters. There were two attempts at negotiating with the enslaved. The first one was carried out by Father Schink. When Father Schink spoke with Tula, he refused to accept anything less than freedom. Schink reported back to Baron Westerholt, and the latter decided to get more reinforcements and attack. He attempted a last negotiation, but when he was turned down by the rebels, he ordered that any slave with a weapon be shot. In the ensuing fight, the rebels were defeated. Ten to twenty of them were killed, and the rest escaped.\n\nThe rebels began a guerrilla campaign, poisoning wells and stealing food. On September 19, Tula and Karpata were betrayed by a slave. They were taken prisoner, and the war was effectively over. (Louis Mercier had already been caught at Knip.) After Tula was captured, he was publicly tortured to death on October 3, 1795, almost seven weeks after the revolt began. Karpata, Louis Mercier and Pedro Wakao were also executed. In addition, many slaves had been massacred in the earlier repression. After the revolt had been crushed the white Curaçao government formulated rules that provided some rights to slaves on the island.\n\nAt the height of the insurrection, there were probably 1,000 rebels. August 17 is celebrated in Curaçao to commemorate the beginning of the liberation struggle. When the race based system of slavery was finally abolished on the island in 1863, there were approximately 5500 slaves.\n\nThere is a monument to Tula and the rebels on the south coast of Curaçao, near the Holiday Beach Hotel. This is the site where Tula was executed. The Tula Museum was named after the rebel leader.\n\nThe revolt was dramatized in the 2013 Dutch film \"\", directed by Jeroen Leinders and starring Obi Abili as Tula alongside Jeroen Krabbé and Danny Glover.\n\n"}

{"id": "2903631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903631", "title": "Fingallian", "text": "Fingallian\n\nFingallian or the Fingal dialect is an extinct variety of English formerly spoken in Fingal, Ireland. It is thought to have been an offshoot of Middle English, which was brought to Ireland during the Norman invasion, and was extinct by the mid-19th century. Although little is known of Fingallian, it is thought to have been similar to the Forth and Bargy dialect of County Wexford.\n\nThe surviving literature of Fingallian consists of two satirical or humorous poems, the short \"Fingallian Dance\" and the much longer \"Purgatorium Hibernicum\". Both poems are anonymous and are thought to be humorous parodies of Fingallian by non-native speakers, so their value from a linguistic point of view may be limited.\n\nFingallian was spoken in the region of Fingal, traditionally the part of County Dublin north of the River Tolka, and now a separate county. It was spoken in the area near the northern border. The name \"Fingal\" is from the Irish \"Fine Gall\", or \"territory of foreigners\", probably a reference to a Norse settlement in the area. Linguist Alf Sommerfelt proposed the idea of a Norse influence on the Fingallian dialect, though later scholars have found no evidence of such a connection.\n\nLike the Forth and Bargy dialect of County Wexford, Fingallian is thought to have derived from Middle English, which was introduced by \"Old English\" settlers after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Middle English was well established in southeastern Ireland until the 14th century, when the area was re-Gaelicized and English was displaced. As such, the Yola and Fingal dialects would have been the only attested relicts of this original English variety in Ireland.\n\nThe poem most likely to have been composed by a native speaker of Fingallian is \"The Fingallian Dance,\" a brief, three-stanza poem written between about 1650 and 1660. It is a mildly indecent poem about a man going to see dancers at a bullring (bull fighting was practised in 17th century Ireland). Although the poem is likely to have been standardised when written down, it gives a flavour of Fingallian, particularly forms like \"fat\" for \"what\" or \"fen\" for \"when\". Other words that need explanation are \"ame\" 'them' and \"plack-keet\", 'part of a petticoat'.\n\nThe \"Purgatoriam Hibernicum\" is a humorous and bawdy burlesque or travesty on the Roman poet Virgil's \"Aeneid\". It exists in three versions: the original manuscript (\"Purgatoriam Hibernicum\"), another manuscript entitled \"The Fingallian Travesty: the Sixt Book of Virgill's Aenoeids a la mode de Fingaule\" (1670–5), and a printed version called \"The Irish Hudibras\" or \"The Fingallian Burlesque\" (1689).\n\nVirgil's prince Aeneas and his noble lover Dido are transformed into a bumbling young Fingallian called 'Prince' Nees and a coarse ex-nun Dydy. The names of all the characters are converted into mock 'Irish' forms and the places mentioned in Virgil's text become places in Fingal. Part of the humour for the Anglo-Irish readers of the poem is that Nees and Dydy converse with each other in broad Fingallian. Although the intention is supposedly to mock their speech, it is rendered with such vitality and wit that the effect is actually to give the reader an appreciation of its richness. \n\nThe short extract below provides a good example of Fingallian. In it Nees encounters Dydy again and seeing her look pale and unwell realises that he may have been responsible for giving her the 'flame' or venereal disease. A few features need explanation: 'V' is used instead of 'W' in Fingallian; 'suggam' is a kind of straw rope'; Ful dea ro is derived from Irish \"fuil Dé, a rogha\" 'God's blood, my sweetheart':\nNees continues with an attempt to sweet talk Dydys and asks her for a 'pogue', but his fears are justified and Dydy is having none of it. She tells him that if he think he can have another 'bout' with her, he can think again – after he has \"play'd the vagge\" (been a wag) with her and given her the \"bagge\" (rejected her) she will \"vatch de vales\" ('watch the walls', be on guard) and foil his plan:\n\nThen Dydy goes on her way in high dudgeon.\n\nIn John Dunton's \"Letters from Ireland\" (1698) he writes that in Fingal \"they have a sort of jargon speech peculiar to themselves, and understand not one word of Irish, and are as little understood by the English\". Dunton gives a sample of the language; a lamentation that a mother made over the grave of her son, who was a keen fisher and hunter. Note that \"a roon\" and \"moorneeng\" are from the Irish \"a rúin\" \"(secret) love\" (vocative) and \"múirnín\" \"love\" (lit. \"little trust\"):\n<poem>\n\nRibbeen a roon\nRibbeen moorneeng\nThoo ware good for loand stroand and mounteen\nFor rig a tool and roast a whiteen\nReddy tha taakle\nGather tha baarnacks\nDrink a grote at Nauny Hapennys\n</poem>\n\nThis is roughly translated as:\n<poem>\nRobin my love\nRobin my dear\nThou were good for land, strand and mountain\nGood with a tool and [at] roast[ing] a Whiting\nReady the tackle\nGather the bannocks\nDrink a groat at Nanny Halfpenny's [alehouse]\n</poem>\n\nAlthough Fingallian is no longer spoken, a large number of dialect words unique to Fingal have survived, especially in traditional Fingal towns and villages such as Swords (now a very large suburb of Dublin), Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Garristown, Oldtown, Balrothery, Portrane and Naul. Major sources for these include glossaries in an article in the folklore Journal \"Béaloideas\" by J. J. Hogan and Patrick O'Neill and a book on Fingal lore entitled \"Fair Fingall\" by Patrick Archer.\n\nExamples from Archer's Glossary include:\n\n\nExamples from Hogan and O'Neill's Glossary include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The guest worker programmes were largely created because of the labour imbalance and as a result of political pressure from the USA.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, West Germany signed bilateral recruitment agreements with a number of countries: Italy (22 November 1955), Spain (29 March 1960), Greece (30 March 1960), Turkey (30 October 1961), Morocco (21 June 1963), Portugal (17 March 1964), Tunisia (18 October 1965), and Yugoslavia (12 October 1968). These agreements allowed the recruitment of guest workers to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.\n\nThere were several justifications for these arrangements. Firstly, during the 1950s, Germany experienced a so-called Wirtschaftswunder or \"economic miracle\" and needed laborers. The labour shortage was made more acute after the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, which drastically reduced the large-scale flow of East German workers. Secondly, West Germany justified these programs as a form of developmental aid. It was expected that guest workers would learn useful skills which could help them build their own countries after returning home.\n\nThe first guest workers were recruited from European nations. However, Turkey pressured West Germany to admit its citizens as guest workers. Theodor Blank, Secretary of State for Employment, opposed such agreements. He held the opinion that the cultural gap between Germany and Turkey would be too large and also held the opinion that Germany didn't need any more laborers because there were enough unemployed people living in the poorer regions of Germany who could fill these vacancies. The United States, however, put some political pressure on Germany, wanting to stabilize and create goodwill from a potential ally. West Germany and Turkey reached an agreement in 1961.\n\nAfter 1961 Turkish citizens (largely from rural areas) soon became the largest group of guest workers in West Germany. The expectation at the time on the part of both the West German and Turkish governments was that working in Germany would be only \"temporary.\" The migrants, mostly male, were allowed to work in Germany for a period of one or two years before returning to their home country in order to make room for other migrants. Some migrants did return, after having built up savings for their return.\n\nUntil very recently, Germany was not perceived as a country of immigration (\"kein Einwanderungsland\") by both the majority of its political leaders and the majority of its population. When the country's political leaders realized that many of the persons from certain countries living in Germany were jobless, some calculations were done and according to those calculations, paying unemployed foreigners for leaving the country was cheaper in the long run than paying unemployment benefits. A \"Gesetz zur Förderung der Rückkehrbereitsschaft\" (\"law to advance the willingness to return home\") was passed. The government started paying jobless people from a number of countries, such as Turks, Moroccans and Tunisians, a so-called \"Rückkehrprämie\" (\"repatriation grant\") or \"Rückkehrhilfe\" (\"repatriation help\") if they returned home. A person returning home received 10,500 Deutsche Mark and an additional 1,500 Deutsche Mark for his spouse and also 1,500 Deutsche Mark for each of his children if they returned to the country of his origin.\n\nThe agreement with Turkey ended in 1973 but few workers returned because there were few good jobs in Turkey. Instead they brought in wives and family members and settled in ethnic enclaves.\n\nIn 2013 it was revealed that ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl had plans to halve the Turkish population of Germany in the 1980s.\n\nBy 2010 there were about 4 million people of Turkish descent in Germany. The generation born in Germany attended German schools, but some had a poor command of either German or Turkish, and thus had either low-skilled jobs or were unemployed. Most are Muslims and are presently reluctant to become German citizens.\n\nGermany used the jus sanguinis principle in its nationality or citizenship law which determined the right to citizenship based on a person's German ancestry, and not by place of birth. According children born in Germany of a guest worker were not automatically entitled to citizenship; but were granted the \"Aufenthaltsberechtigung\" (\"right to reside\") and might choose to apply for German citizenship later in their lives, which was granted to persons who had lived in Germany for at least 15 years and fulfilled a number of other preconditions (they must work for their living, they should not have a criminal record and other preconditions). Today, children of foreigners born on German soil are granted German citizenship automatically if the parent has been in Germany for at least eight years as a legal immigrant. As a rule those children may also have the citizenship of the parents' home country. Those between 18 and 23 years of age must choose to keep either German citizenship or their ancestral citizenship.\nThe governments of the German States have begun campaigns to persuade immigrants to acquire German citizenship. \n\nThose who hold German citizenship have a number of advantages. For example, only those holding German citizenship may vote in certain elections. Also there are some jobs that may only be performed by German citizens. As a rule these are jobs which require a high identification with the government. Only those holding German citizenship are be allowed to become a schoolteacher, a police officer, or a soldier. Most jobs however do not require German citizenship. Those who do not hold German citizenship, but instead just a \"right to reside\", however, still receive many of the benefits. They may attend schools, receive medical insurance, be paid children's benefits, receive welfare and housing assistance.\n\nIn many cases guest workers integrated neatly into German society - Dietrich Tränhardt researched this topic in relation to Spanish guest workers. While many Spanish that came to Germany were illiterate peasants, their offspring were academically successful (see: Academic achievement among different groups in Germany) and do well in the job market. Spanish \"Gastarbeiter\" werealso very likely to marry Germans, which could be considered an indicator of assimilation. According to a study in 2000, 81.2% of all Spanish or partly Spanish children in Germany were from a Spanish-German family.\n\nThere were some, and still are, tensions in German society, because Muslim immigrants feel they have been religiously discriminated against. For example, while the Christian churches are allowed to collect church tax in Germany, Muslim mosques are not able to do so as they are not as yet organised in a corporative association (which is sometimes criticised as forcing Christian organisation-style on non-Christians). While German universities have educated Jewish, Catholic and Protestant clerics and religious teachers, in the past none of the German universities have offered education for Muslim teachers and clerics. However, today such university courses exist.\n\nMuslims were often also not pleased that the Christian cross is a common item to be found in German classrooms, something that used to be relatively common. The fact that most schools offer Catholic and Protestant religious education and ethics but no Islamic religious education has also been criticised (especially because religious education is compulsory, replaceable by ethics). Students are allowed to wear a normal headscarf in school, however in 2010 a Muslim student sued a Gymnasium headmaster, because she was not allowed to wear a Khimar in school.\n\nAfter the division of Germany into East and West in 1949, East Germany faced an acute labour shortage, mainly because of East Germans fleeing into the western zones occupied by the Allies; in 1963 the GDR (German Democratic Republic) signed its first guest-worker contract with Poland. In contrast to the guest-workers in West Germany, the guest-workers that arrived in East Germany came mainly from socialist and communist countries allied with the Soviets and the SED used its guest-worker program to build international solidarity among fellow communist governments.\nThe guest workers in East Germany came mainly from the Eastern Bloc, Vietnam, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique, and Cuba. Residency was typically limited to only 3 years. The conditions East German Gastarbeiter had to live in were much harsher than the living-conditions of the Gastarbeiter in Western Germany, these mainly being single-sex dormitories. In addition, contact between guest-workers and East German citizens was extremely limited; \"Gastarbeiter\" were usually restricted to their dormitory or an area of the city which Germans were not allowed to enter - furthermore sexual relations with a German led to deportation. Female Vertragsarbeiter were not allowed to become pregnant during their stay. If they did, they were forced to have an abortion.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification in 1990, the population of guest-workers still remaining in the former East Germany faced deportation, premature discontinuation of residence and work permits as well as open discrimination in the workplace. Out of the 100,000 guest-workers remaining in East Germany after reunification, about 75% left because of the rising tide of xenophobia in former East German territories. Vietnamese were not considered legal immigrants and lived in \"grey area\". Many started selling goods at the roadside. Ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall most Vietnamese were granted the right to reside however and many started opening little shops.\n\nAfter the reunification Germany offered the guest workers USD$2,000 and a ticket home if they left. The country of Vietnam did not accept the ones back who refused to take the money, Germany considered them \"illegal immigrants\" after 1994. In 1995 Germany paid 140 million $ to the Vietnamese government and made a contract about repatriation which stated that repatriation could be forced if necessary. By 2004 11,000 former Vietnamese guest workers had been repatriated, of which 8,000 against their will.\n\nThe children of the Vietnamese Gastarbeiter caused what has been called the \"Vietnamese miracle\". As shown by a study while in the Berlin districts of Lichtenberg and Marzahn, where those of Vietnamese descent account for only 2 percent of the general population, but make up 17 percent of the university preparatory school population of those districts. According to the headmaster of the Barnim Gymnasium, for a university preparatory school (Gymnasium) that has a focus on the natural sciences, 30 percent of the school's freshmen come from Vietnamese families.\n\nToday, the term \"Gastarbeiter\" is no longer accurate, as the former guest worker communities, insofar as they have not returned to their countries of origins, have become permanent residents or citizens, and therefore are in no meaningful sense \"guests\". However, despite the fact that many of the former \"guest workers\" have now become German citizens, the term Ausländer or \"foreigner\" is still colloquially applied to them as well as to their naturalised children and grandchildren. A new word has been used by politicians for several years: \"Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund\" (German term for: people with an immigration background). The term was thought to be politically correct because it includes both immigrants and those who, being naturalized, cannot be referred to as immigrants—who are colloquially (and not by necessity xenophobically) called \"naturalized immigrants\" or \"immigrants with a German passport\". It also applies to German-born descendants of people who immigrated after 1949. To emphasize their Germanness, they are also with quite a frequency called \"fellowcitizens\", which may result in calling \"our Turkish fellow citizens\" also those who are foreigners still, or even such Turks in Turkey who never had any contact to Germany.\n\nGastarbeiter, as a historical term however, referring to the guest worker programme and situation of the 1960s, is neutral and remains the most correct designation. In literary theory, some German migrant writers (e.g. Rafik Schami) use the terminology of \"guest\" and \"host\" provocatively.\n\nThe term \"Gastarbeiter\" lives on in Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Slovene languages, generally meaning \"expatriate\" (mostly referring to a second generation from the former Yugoslavia or Bulgaria born or living abroad). The South Slavic spelling reflects the local pronunciation of \"gastarbajter\" (in Cyrillic: гастарбаjтер or гастарбайтер). In Belgrade's jargon, it is commonly shortened to \"gastos\" (гастос), and in Zagreb's to \"gastić\".\n\nIn modern Russia, the transliterated term gastarbeiter (гастарбайтер) is used to denote workers from former Soviet republics coming to Russia (mainly Moscow and Saint Petersburg) in search of work. These workers come primarily from Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, and Tajikistan. Also for a guest worker from outside Europe, from China, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia. In contrast to such words as \"gastrolle\" (гастроль, сoncert tour), \"gast professor\" (invited to read the course at another university), which came to Russian from German, the word \"gastarbeiter\" is not neutral in modern Russian and has a negative connotation.\n\n\nSons of Gastarbeiter:\n\n\n"}

The object of the Society is to raise the standards of photography by organising meetings, lectures, excursions, competitions; encouraging beginners and advanced alike by the exchange of ideas and to affiliate with foreign clubs and societies. All classes of photography shall be included.\n\nIn 1940 a camera club was formed by a group of Gibraltarians who held their meetings at the now defunct Calpe Institute. This club was never firmly established and more often than not it was closed due to lack of support from both local photographers and those from the Services. The problem was very likely due to the fact that no photographer in Gibraltar had the experience of organising and running successfully a club of this nature.\n\nIn 1960, after having run for some months with a very small membership, the club closed, never to re-open. Its assets, about £30, were placed in a suspended account and held by the Committee of the Calpe Institute. Any hopes of re-forming the club were dashed by the closing of the Calpe Institute itself.\n\nDuring most of this time, the United Services Camera Club based at the Command Education Centre, ran successfully under various names, though with a small membership. The Club was not open to local civilians. This Club was closed in July 1964 by the Command Education Officer as a result of poor administration in the Club’s affairs, and re-opened in October 1964.\n\nIn October 1964, a Sergeant K Lloyd of the Middlesex Regiment and member of the United Services Camera Club, and local photographer Mr Albert Pizzarello put on an exhibition at the John Mackintosh Hall with a view of generating interest in the formation of a Service/civilian club. The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a provisional programme arranged.\n\nIn January 1965, the first Annual General Meeting took place and the following officers appointed :\n\nChairman :                                - Wing Commander P A Rumbold Scott, RAF\n\nSecretary & A/Chairman          - A A Hammon, Esq\n\nTreasurer & A/Secretary          - Staff Sergeant C P Berry, RAOC\n\nSyllabus Secretary                    - A J Pizzarello, Esq\n\nHouse Member                        - A Perera, Esq\n\nCommittee Members                - T Adamberry, Esq\n\n- M M Bonilla, Esq\n\n- Sgt K Lloyd was co-opted to the Committee.\n\nThe Chairman due to his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer, RAF North Front, was frequently away from Gibraltar and so his duties were in the main carried out by Mr Hammon. As a result, S/Sgt Berry usually carried out the task of Secretary as well as that of Treasurer. Lectures, initial organisation and instruction were generally carried out by Messrs Berry and Pizzarello.\n\nLater that year the Committee decided to change the name of the Club to that of The Gibraltar Photographic Society. An application for affiliation to The Photographic Alliance of Great Britain was accepted. The aims of the Society were as follows :\n\n(a) To stimulate and promote amateur photographic activity within Gibraltar\n\n(b) To provide a congenial club atmosphere where enthusiasts can meet others similarly inclined.\n\n(c) To instruct, guide and assist novices in basic theoretical and practical photographic work\n\n(d) To cater for the intermediate and advanced amateur photographer by means of lectures, demonstrations, visual aids, instruction and discussion\n\n(e) To work in close liaison with the Photographic Alliance of Great Britain, to   promote the advancement of, and maintain a high standard of amateur photography in Gibraltar.\n\nSubscriptions were set at 5 shillings (25p) a month for full members and 2 shillings and 6 pence (12½p) for those under the age of 18. Meetings were held on Wednesdays at fortnightly intervals, with a short recess during the Summer. Several local professional photographers were elected to Honorary Membership, and Lady Lathbury, the Governor’s wife, accepted to become patroness of the Society.\n\nBy February 1966, the membership of the Society stood at around 40, with the average attendance at meetings between 20 and 25. Initially, novices were placed into groups with an intermediate or advanced worker nominated as group leader whose duty was to instruct the novices. Printing was carried out in the group leader’s own darkroom or at the John Mackintosh Hall. This system worked but with great difficulty, and was eventually abandoned. Competitions for black and white prints were held about once a month, and based on set themes. Entries were limited to 4 prints per person, and the print size restricted to 9 x 7 inches. It was not till 1974 that the first slides competition was held. This was just a one-off event. It was not till 1977 that regular slides competitions were incorporated into the annual programme, whilst the first colour prints competitions were not introduced till 1979. Initially, beginners had to compete in the same group as everybody else, but in 1973 they were provided with their own set of competitions.\n\nSince its founding, the Society has held an annual exhibition. At first this consisted of black and white prints, but in 1977 two other sections were added : a colour prints section and one for beginners. The addition of a slides section had to wait till 1986. The size and popularity of the exhibition grew to such an extent that since 1982 two exhibition rooms have been required for it. Problems with the judging of the annual exhibition resulted in the Society getting in touch with the Royal Photographic Society in 1982 with a view of their providing an adjudicator. This they did and have continued to do so up to the present, resulting in our forging very close links with this world-renowned organisation.\n\nIn 1968 the Society only had one challenge trophy in its possession : The Society Challenge Cup, which was presented to the winner of the competitions held during the year. By 1980 the total had increased to 11 as the number of competitions and the number of sections in the annual exhibition increased. In 1985, the late Alex Perera presented a trophy he had made himself for the award of the title of Photographer of the Year to the person obtaining the highest aggregate of points in competitions during the course of the year. Today the total number of challenge trophies is 20!\n\nThe logo of the Society was designed by Mr A Harper in 1977 and the proof drawing made by Mr A Ryman MBE. Also in that year the Society made its first application for funds from the Government Cultural Grants Committee and succeeded in obtaining the sum of £90. Thanks to subsequent grants from this Committee, the Society has been able to purchase much needed equipment, and more recently for the purchase of books to help establish a good reference library. Also in 1977 first contacts were made with the Malta Photographic Society. This was the first of many such contacts with other clubs and societies, especially from U.K., with the view of exchanging ideas and holding competitions. In 1986 the Society became members of the Southern Photographic Federation of Great Britain, and through them affiliated to the Photographic Alliance of  Great Britain. As members of the SPF the Society has competed every year in their league competitions. Contacts with Spanish clubs in La Linea and Algeciras were established in 1984, and a few competitions and exhibitions have been held with them since then.\n\nIn 1981 the Society held its first basic course on photography, aimed at members who were beginners, but also opened to the general public. These successful courses have been kept up to the present.\n\nIn 1976 a need was felt for updating and extending the statute of the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983  with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 with respect to the use of the darkroom and equipment. In 1990 further changes were made with respect to the use of the Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.\n\nThe 150th anniversary of the invention of photography was marked in1989 by the Society holding a special exhibition. For this exhibition copy prints of early historical photographs were purchased from the RPS, and exhibited together with hundreds of old and personal photographs loaned by members of the public, depicting family photos and old views of Gibraltar. The exhibition was a great success.\n\nFirst enquiries on the acquisition of premises were made in 1985, and at the end of that year, during the opening of a special exhibition marking the 20th anniversary of the Society, the then Minister for Education Mr G Mascarenhas announced that we were being offered premises at Wellington Front.  These premises were officially handed over in January 1986, and works on refurbishing them commenced in April. By March 1987 the bulk of the works were over in the main hall, and the first Annual General Meeting held there that month. Works still continued in refurbishing the rest of the premises, and in fitting out a darkroom. The darkroom at John Mackintosh Hall was demolished in December 1989, and it was not till August 1990 that the one at Wellington Front became operational. The official opening of the premises was held on 26 November 1990, and carried out by H.E. the Governor Sir Derek Reffell. This coincided with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Society. The acquisition of  the premises resulted in the Society being able to extend its activities without restrictions, and in the acquisition of the type of equipment which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.\n\nAt present the Society is self-sufficient in terms of darkroom, audio-visual and studio facilities. The Society has also embraced the advent of digital imaging without any reservations; in all competitions digitally processed and manipulated images are accepted on a par with traditionally processed ones. With the help of awards from the Government Cultural Grants Committee, the Society has purchased three computers, two printers, two slides/negative scanner, a flat-bed scanner and a digital projector. In the programme of events for the year, a significant amount of time is dedicated to learning how to use imaging programmes, and the hardware.\n\nThe Society has premises which will shortly be refurbished in Summer 2015 at Wellington Front, their mailing address :\n\nWellington Front, PO Box 1422, Gibraltar.\n\nThe society hold a yearly exhibition, dates of the exhibition can be obtained from the society´s website \n\nThe society holds a series of competitions throughout the year in two categories, Beginners and Advance with the photographer who has mosts points at the end of the year is presented with a trophy as \"Beginner of the Year\" and \"Photographer of the Year\"\n\nAny person who has an interest in photography can become a member of the society for a very small fee. More information about becoming a member can be obtained from the Society´s Secretary.\n\n"}

This was the first wide exposure of the NSA, which had for decades prevented public knowledge of its abilities and activities. The revelations led the U.S. Senate Church Committee to introduce successful legislation intended to stop the NSA spying on American citizens.\n\nIn December 2005 Russ Tice helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional wiretaps on American citizens. He later acknowledged that he was one of the sources that were used in \"The New York Times\" reporting on the wiretap activity in December 2005. After speaking publicly about the need for legislation to protect whistleblowers, Tice received national attention as the first NSA-whistleblower in May 2005 before William Binney, Thomas Andrews Drake, Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, and Edward Snowden came forward.\n\nMark Klein is a former AT&T technician who leaked knowledge of his company's cooperation with the NSA in installing network hardware to covertly monitor, capture, and process American telecommunications en masse. The subsequent media coverage became a major story in May 2006.\n\nIn recognition of his actions, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) picked Klein as one of the winners of its 2008 Pioneer Awards.\n\nFor over 22 years Mark Klein worked for AT&T. Starting with the company as a Communications Technician in New York, where he remained from November 1981 until March 1991, he later continued in that capacity in California until 1998. From January 1998 to October 2003, Klein worked as a Computer Network Associate in San Francisco. From October 2003 to May 2004 he returned to the role of Communications Technician, after which he retired in May 2004.\n\nWilliam Binney is a former highly placed intelligence official with the NSA turned whistleblower who resigned on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency. He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and was the subject of FBI investigations, including a raid on his home in 2007. He came forward with NSA colleagues J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, in cooperation with House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staffer Diane Roark.\n\nThomas Tamm is a former attorney in the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) during the period in 2004 when senior Justice officials fought against the widening scope of warrantless NSA surveillance that consisted of eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to \"The New York Times\", making the initial disclosure regarding the issue.\n\nThomas Andrews Drake is a former senior executive at the NSA, a decorated United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Navy (USN) veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that Drake \"mishandled\" documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project.

In modern India, the Persianized Mughal era term Hindustani has slowly fallen out of use, as many North Indian ethnic groups moved closer to regional identities.\n\nTraditionally, the Hindustani identity is primarily linguistic, with Hindustanis being those who have the historical Hindustani language (Hindi/Urdu) or, in a broader sense, a variety of Hindi as their primary language, mainly residing in the present-day Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bihar.

It grew after the incorporation of Abkhazia into the Russian Empire in the middle of the 19th century. Most of the Jews left or were evacuated from Abkhazia as a result of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict of 1992–1993.\n\nA Russian garrison was installed in Sukhumi in the 1840s, as its fortress was part of the Black Sea defence line, and Jews from many regions of Georgia, particularly from Kulashi, settled in the town. As the 1897 census results indicate, there were also many Ashkenazi Jews in Sukhumi. A synagogue was built in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\nIn Soviet times, the Jewish population of Abkhazia increased greatly, but the Sukhumi Jewish community remained the largest in Abkhazia. According to the 1926 census, there were about 1,100 Jews in Abkhazia, most of them Ashkenazi (702) or Georgian (215). The Jewish community of Sukhumi was officially recognised by Soviet authorities in 1945, at the very end of World War II. Abkhazian Jews suffered like the other Jews of the Soviet Union during the massive anti-Jewish campaign in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Sukhumi synagogue was razed in October, 1951 (according to the official version, its territory was needed for urban development). The Jewish population increased to about 3,500 in 1959, but many of them emigrated to Israel and elsewhere in the 1970s.\n\nAs the Soviet Union was disintegrating in the late 1980s, ethnic tensions began to grow in Abkhazia and the number of Jewish emigrants increased greatly. There were still many Jews in Abkhazia at the outbreak of the Georgian-Abkhaz War in August, 1992. All of the Jews who wished to flee the fledgling republic were evacuated by the Jewish Agency and settled in Israel. Most of the few who remained were Ashkenazi. Those who remained had to endure the capture of Sukhumi by Abkhaz separatists and their allies.\n\nAs of 2009, there are about 150 Jews in Abkhazia, nearly all of them Ashkenazi. The community maintains a synagogue in Sukhumi. The majority of them are elderly, with their average age being 72 in 2004.\n\nRivka Cohen, Israel's ambassador to Georgia, visited Abkhazia in July, 2004.\n\n"}

She was a prominent suffragette during the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom, and is notable for having endured more than 200 force-feedings in prison while on hunger strike. After emigrating to the United States, she was again arrested on nine occasions – this time for birth control advocacy.\n\nKatherina Maria Schafer was born in Rietberg in Westphalia, Germany, on 12 March 1871. Her mother died of tuberculosis when the child was two, leaving Marion with her father. Four years later, when Marion was six, her step-mother also died of tuberculosis. Her father, whose name is not known, abused Marion and hated that she had red hair. When Marion was fifteen, she was sent by her father to live with her aunt in England. \n\nIn England, she became an actress and took the name \"Kitty Marion\". She worked her way up from chorus to named parts and was briefly the temporary stand-in for the lead before she fell out with her employer. She then tried to find work in the music halls but found that employers expected sexual favours in exchange for the best work.\n\nMarion joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908. She became a prominent activist in the women's suffrage movement and often engaged in protests, which sometimes turned violent. Marion was known as 'a prolific bomber and arsonist for the suffragettes'. She was arrested numerous times in England for her activism.\n\nMarion and Clara Elizabeth Giveen planned a reprisal after the death of Emily Davison at the Derby. On 13 June 1913, the two of them set alight to the Hurst Park Grandstand. Giveen was given three years in jail for arson but released under the Cat and Mouse Act after going on hunger strike. Marion was also released but she had been force-fed 232 times during her imprisonment. \n\nIn 1914 Marion suffered some persecution for being German. Ada Wright together with Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Lady Constance Lytton and Rose Lamartine Yates raised the money to pay her fare to emigrate to the United States, to avoid the anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom. \n\nIn the U.S., she worked with Margaret Sanger in publishing the \"Birth Control Review\". Marion sold the \"Review\" at per copy in Times Square, Grand Central Station, and Coney Island. Standing on street corners, she endured heckling, death threats, physical abuse, and police harassment. Over the course of ten years, Marion was arrested nine times for her birth control advocacy.

{"id": "55506228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55506228", "title": "Lumbwa people", "text": "Lumbwa people\n\nThe Lumbwa (also Lumbua, Umpua, Humba and Wakwavi) were a pastoralist community inhabiting southern and northern portions of Kenya and Tanzania respectively. The term Lumbwa was used in reference to sections of the Maa-speaking Loikop communities from at least the mid-19th century but also and commonly to the Kalenjin speaking Kipsgis community for much of the late 19th to mid 20th century.\n\nThe journals, letters and published articles of the first three missionaries of the Church Missionary Society in East Africa; i.e. Johann Ludwig Krapf, Johannes Rebmann and Jakob Erhardt written during the 1840s and 1850s contain the earliest references to the Lumbwa though certain Meru traditions point to even earlier use of the term in reference to an East African pastoralist community.\n\nKrapf arrived at the East African coast in December 1843 and made his first foray into the hinterland in January 1844, whereupon he immediately came across reports of the nearby \"Okooafee\" and their southern neighbors the \"Quapee\". Within a year he had worked out that these two groups were in fact the same people at which time he began referring to them as Wakuafi in his writings. In 1852 he learned that the Wakuafi referred to themselves by the name Iloikop. At this time, the Swahili name Wakuafi was used to represent all Iloikop peoples though it later narrowed to represent only the non-Maasai sections of Iloikop. It is suggested that the term Humba (or Lumbwa) was likewise a Bantu word used by Bantu of the interior in reference to the same group of pastoralists. \n\nThe accounts of missionaries and explorers in the 1870's and 80's generally concurred with the writings of the early missionaries though distinctions between Maasai, Wakwavi and Lumbwa begin appearing in the writings. \n\nIn his early accounts, Thomas Wakefield wrote of the \"poor Wakwavi...having long since been robbed of their cattle by the Maasai, were compelled to turn their attention to agricultural pursuits\" and in the same account gives a distinction between Wakwavi and Kipsigis stating that \"the Wakwavi of Ndara Serian\" continued to raid Lumbwa (Kipsigis) for cattle. Charles New in 1873 also concurred with his predecesors assertion that both Maasai and 'Wakuavi' called themselves Orloikob which he translated as \"possessors of the soil\" and that both groups were pastoralists. James Last who was stationed at Mamboia in central Tanzania during the 1880's also concluded as Krapf had done that \"Humba\" was an equivalent term for \"Kwavi\". He also concurred with earlier descriptions of both peoples as pastoralists.\n\nJoseph Thompson in his account \"Through Maasai Land\" which was published in 1887 made an observation that was a subtle but significant departure from previous accounts, he noted about the country \"...however, we are including several isolated areas occupied either by tribes wholly different from the Masai, or by the agricultural Wa-kwafi, who are mere off-shoots of the Masai,\" thus inverting previous understanding of Wakwavi/Maasai relationship. This inversion of the order laid out by Krapf, Rebmann and other explorers would become the standard interpretation in years to come, possibly as a result of actual changes on the ground brought about by the reduction of the larger Iloikop society to mere scatterlings and the consequent subsumption of the larger Iloikop identity by the Maasai.\n\nBy the early 20th century, Maasai identity was distinct apart from Wakwavi though they were still unclear about the distinction between Iloikop and Lumbwa. Thomas Wakefield in his accounts published in 1904, distinguishes the Wakwavi and Maasai stating 'the Wakwavi and Maasai are cognate races, but mutually hostile. They are alike in physique, manners and customs, modes of life, weapons and war, and spend their time in cattle-lifting and in murdering all who happen to fall across their war path. They are not always distinguished by the natives about here, \"Wakwavi\" being almost the synonym for \"Maasai\" and vice-versa.\" \n\nA.C.Hollis writing on the Maasai in 1905 identifies two divisions among the Maasai; some living in British territory and \"who called themselves Il-Maasae\" and another section \"...who were called 'L-Oikop or Il-Lumbwa [who] lived in German East Africa\" as agriculturalists. In his account of the Nandi, published also in 1905, he notes extensively that the Nandi referred to the Kipsigis as Lumbwa.\n\nThe focus of some contemporary scholarly accounts touching on the Lumbwa is the distinction between Maasai and Iloikop where the Maasai-centric understanding of Iloikop identity is being challenged.\nIt has been suggested by various authors that the term Humba (or Lumbwa) was a Bantu word used by Bantu of the East African hinterland in reference to Iloikop pastoralists.\n\nThe names recalled in Meru tradition i.e. \"Umpua,\" \"Umbua,\" \"Mbumbua,\" and \"Lumbua\" all sound like reasonable variations of Lumbwa though the strongest evidence linking the Meru Umpua to the Lumbwa is language (below).\n\nIt is at this time unclear what the Lumbwa referred to themselves as, though one of the more common Kalenjin origin tales, mentions that the pre-Kalenjin grouping that comprised the Kipsigis, Nandi, Tugen and possibly Keiyo was known as Myoot (or Miot), a term that is today used by the Kalenjin council of elders.\n\nFosbrooke who conducted many interviews among the Maasai in various parts of East Africa in the decade to 1948, noted that his informants told him repeatedly that they shared a common pastoralist origin with the \"Lumbwa\" who they told him had only recently taken up agriculture.\n\nThe archaeological/landscape feature commonly referred to as Sirikwa holes are found in Meru where they are known as \"Agumba holes\". \n\nTraditions captured in Igoji and Imenti associate these with the Umpua of that area, cattle keepers who kept livestock in pits at night. These holes were dug by the herders themselves and were gradually deepened as mud was removed after the rains.\n\nIgoji and Imenti informants in Meru recall that the Umpua were \"tall, slender, cattle keeping people [who] wore shoulder-length hair, plaited into braids.\n\nIn 1969 in Mwimbi, Meru, an aged informant claimed to remember four Umpua words which had been sung in songs about the Umpua when he was a child. These were agenge, uii, chito and ngeta; meaning one, two and the last two both meaning man. These words largely have the same meaning in Okiek and to a lesser extent modern Kalenjin.\n\nPrior to and through the early 20th century, the Kipsigis people were referred to as Lumbwa by the Nandi and other Kalenjin speakers. \n\nIn the account of the settlement and formation of the Nandi community, two streams of clans are said to have come from Lumbwa. The initial group forms part of the first stream of settlers in Nandi and includes the Kipamwi, Kipkenda and Kipiegen along with the Kipoiis who came from Elgon. The second stream came purely from Lumbwa and includes the Tungo, Kipaa, Kipasiso and Kapchemuri (Chemuri) and the Elgoni (Kony)\n\nThe Kwavi of Tanzani are often called Lumbwa\n"}

Although it is a member of the Surmic cluster, this language is the most isolated one in that cluster (Fleming 1983). A language survey has shown that dialect variation from north to south is minor and does not seriously impede communication. The 2007 Ethiopian Census lists 6,433 speakers for Majang (Messengo), but also reports that the ethnic group consists of 32,822 individuals (Messengo and Mejengir). According to the census, almost no speakers can be found in Mezhenger Zone of Gambela Region; a total of eleven speakers are listed for the zone, but almost 10,000 ethnic Mejenger or Messengo people.\n\nVowel length is distinctive in Majang, so all vowels come in pairs of long and short, such as \"goopan\" 'punishment' and \"gopan\" 'road'. The vowel inventory is taken out of Joswig (2012) and Getachew (2014, p. 65). Unseth (2007) posed a 9-vowel system with a row of -ATR closed vowels ɪ and ʊ. Moges claims a tenth vowel ɐ, whereas Bender (1983) was only ready to confirm six vowels. All authors agree that there is no ATR vowel harmony in the language.\n\nBender also claims that the glottal stop needs to be treated as a phoneme of Majang though Unseth refutes this. Majang has two implosives, bilabial and coronal, which Moges Yigezu has studied acoustically and distributionally.\n\nTones distinguish meaning in Majang, on both the word level and the grammatical level: \"táŋ\" (higher tone) 'cow', \"tàŋ\" (lower tone) 'abscess'. The tonal inventory consists of two tone levels, with falling and rising contour tones possible at the end of phonological words, plus automatic and non-automatic downstep. \n\nThe language has markers to indicate three different past tenses (close, mid, far past) and two future tenses (near and farther).\n\nThe language has a wide variety of suffixes, but almost no prefixes. Though its use is limited to a handful of roots, there are a few words that preserve vestiges of the archaic causative prefix \"i-\", a prefix found in other Surmic languages and also Nilotic.\n\nThe counting system is a modified vigesimal system, based on 5, 10, and 20. \"Twenty\" is 'one complete person' (all fingers and toes), so 40 is 'two complete people', 100 is 'five complete people'. However, today, under the influence of schools and increased bilingualism, people generally use the Amharic or Oromo words for 100.\n\nThe person and number marking system does not mark the inclusive and exclusive we distinction, a morphological category that is found in nearby and related languages.\n\nMajang has a basic VSO word order, though allowing some flexibility for focus, etc. The language makes extensive use of relative clauses, including for circumstances where English would use adjectives.\nA recent study states that Majang is characterized by a strong morphological ergative-absolutive system, and a conjoint-disjoint distinction which is based on the presence or absence of an absolutive noun phrase directly following the verb. Many of these distinctions are coded by tonal differences.\n\nMajang, and some related Surmic languages, has been shown to be exceptional to some syntactic typological predictions for languages with Subject–verb–object word order. Majang has postpositions and question words sentence-finally, two properties that had been predicted to not occur in languages with VSO word order.\n\n\n"}

Most are the descendants from those who migrated from India during the British colonisation of Malaya. However, historical sources prove that the ancient Indians arrived in Penang during the Chola dynasty. Today, the Penangite Indians are one of the most successful ethnic groups in Penang state and whole of Malaysia. Penangite Indians forms a large percentage of the state's professional labours such as business, law and medicine as well as politics, it can be proved by the appointment of Dr P.Ramasamy as deputy chief minister of Penang. It made him the first Malaysian of Indian origin to hold the post of deputy chief minister in any state of Malaysia. In addition, first Tamil Vernacular School in Malaysia was established in Penang.\n\nAlready in the 1790s, Light mentions Chulias (that is, people from the Coromandel Coast of India) as shopkeepers and farm labourers in Penang. Light estimated that about two thousand men came to work in this manner each year. however, in contrast to the Chinese, these labourers did not create a permanent settlement in Penang. They would, rather, work long enough to save money and then return to their families in south India. This group of migrants comprised the ‘Adi Dravidas,’ a group of impoverished labourers originating in the hinterlands of the Tamil country and Andhra Desa who, facing insufficient work in their homeland, went abroad for survival.\n\nAnother class of Indian migrants was a class of people hailing from the Kaveri delta areas (from the Sivaganga district of Madras) known as ‘Nattukottai Chettiars’ who were by occupation money-lenders. Their presence in Penang and elsewhere where plantations sprang up aided merchants, miners, and planters, as these Chettiars were advancing required working capital in the absence of any effective banks. Light also encouraged migration by the Chettiar community as part of his plan to create a cash economy on Penang.\n\nUnlike the Tamil migrants, Telugu migrants from the northern Coromandel Coast came to Penang as families. For this reason, many did not leave when their work terms expired, but rather continued working on plantations or as merchants. Over 1,500,000 south Indians who worked in Malayan plantations, more than three-fourths returned to India, nearly all of them Tamil.\n\nAs a result of the occupayion of Malaysia, the Japanese killed about 150,000+ Indian Tamils of Malaysia and Burma in Burma within a period of time after arriving for slave labour work of constructing the Myanamr rail.\n\nBeginning with Light, Penang boasted a tradition of religious and ethnic tolerance. All races could practice their respective religious faith and social stability in a multi-racial society was thus achieved.\n\nThe main language spoken by Indians in Penang is Malaysian Tamil dialect of Tamil language in addition to the country's official and national language Malaysian (English is also widely spoken and understood). Besides Tamil, Urdu is also spoken by a small number of Indian Muslims and Telugu as well as Punjabi is also spoken by ethnic Telugu and Punjabi community. However, young people are more interested in speaking English and English-Tamil mixture macaronic language, Tanglish. Ethnic Jawi Peranakan, a Muslim creole ethnic group of mixed Indian, Malay and Arab ancestry with predominantly Indian origin mostly use Malay as their first language in addition to English. Another distinct group of Indian Muslims known as \"Mamak\" use the Penang Malay (\"Pelat Utara\") variant as their first and daily language. Historically, Penang Hokkien was referred to as a lingua franca of Penang before the rise in the use of Mandarin and English. Penang Hokkien is still used by some members of the Penangite Indian community particularly street vendors.\n\nLittle India in the city of George Town is a well-known Indian enclave in Malaysia. It Covers an area around Lebuh Queen, Lebuh Chulia and Market Street. Its location at the centre of Penang Heritage Zone and nearby Penang's main finance centre, Beach Street makes it one of the most famous and notable shopping spot in Penang among local and international tourists.\n\nIndian cuisine in Penang is a phenomenon in Malaysian cuisine. Dishes like Nasi Kandar and Roti Canai are not only the most popular dishes in Penang, but throughout Malaysia. Indian food in Penang is heavily influenced by the Chitty cuisine.\n\nOne of the biggest festivals in Penang is a Hindu religious festival called Thaipusam. Thaipusam is dedicated to the lord Murugan. Deepavali, better known as the 'Festival of Lights', is another major Hindu festival celebrated by all Hindus. Tamils celebrate the harvest festival of Pongal, which is usually held 13 to 16 January. Similar celebrations, known as Makar Sankranti is celebrated by most other Indian communities and Punjabis called them as Lohri. While Indian Christians celebrate Christmas Day and Good Friday. Indian Muslims, Jawi Peranakans and Mamaks celebrates Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha along with the country's other Muslim groups like their ethnic Malay counterparts.\n\nTeppa Tiruvizla or floating chariot festival is consider as one of the most important festival in Penang after Thaipusam. The annual festival hosted by Sri Singhamuga Kaliamman Temple at Teluk Bahang.\n\nA celebration to thank the goddess, Sri Singhamuga Kaliamman, for her good grace and to beseech her to continue providing devotees with protection and prosperity, Teppa Tiruvizla only takes place during Masi Magam, the 11th month1 in the Tamil calendar. It is a day when temple idols are taken out for a ceremonial bath. Thousands travel from all over Malaysia to take part in the festivities.\n\nThe day begins with morning prayers; the devotees who attend bring milk as an offering to the goddess. In the afternoon, the floating chariot is carefully pushed into the sea by temple president Sadha Sivam, the youth club members and other temple members. Later, after evening prayers, the idol of the goddess is carried to the chariot\n\nhe first known Tamil magazine called Thangai Nesan was published in 1876. Two other magazines Ulaka Nesan and Hindu Nesan were published in 1887 and 1888 respectively. We also know that in 1887 a book entitled Sathiya Vedha Sarithira Saaram (The Essence of the Bible) by Palavendhiram Rayappan was published here. In 1890 Pathaanandha Maalai (A garland of Praise) was published by Mohamed Sultan Maraikkayar. (A list of early books provided.)\nMany of these books and magazines were produced by Indian immigrants and much of the literary output was in the form of poetry and some of the notable poets of recent times were Swami Ramadasar, Panaikkulam M. Abdul Majid and N.Karim. This tradition continues today with home-grown writers and poets.\nIn the early fifties Tamil Murasu, a Singapore Tamil daily, began a student supplement called Maanavar Manimandra Malar (Supplement for Students Bell Club). This served as a training ground for budding writers in Tamil. The Thamilar Thirunaal (Tamils Festival, also sponsored by this daily, provided motivation and training for writers with its various literary competitions.\n\nFollowing these examples, several- associations were formed in Penang to promote and nourish Tamil writing. Among them were the Tamil Youth Bell Club, Valluvar Debating Society, Bharathi Debating Society, the Senthamizh Kala Nilayam and North Malaya Tamil Writers Association.\n\nPoetry can be said to be the most. prolific of the literary output. (A list of significant poets and poetry provided.) Following this is the significant production of short stories. The Penang-based writers’ list is long, but among them are Murugaiyan, Dato P. Shanmugam, A. Kadir, CT. Ramasamy, Anthony Muthu, S. Anbanantham, M. Sultan etc. (List provided.)\n\nSignificant contribution from Penang to Malaysian Tamil literature includes writings of K. Sonaimuthu with several of his biographies and essays, and R. Karthigesu with his novels. While writers like Karthigesu and Seeni Naina Mohamed came into Penang from other states, Penang has also lost some of its illustrious writers like M. Asan Gani, M. Sultan, and Karaikizhaar to other states.\n\nA current list of writers is appended. Almost all the writers in our list belong to an older generation, and it is a thing of great concern that writers from the younger generation are scarce.\n\n\nThe first Tamil vernacular schools in Malaya (now Malaysia) was set up in Penang under the Labour Code. In 2014, the Penang government brought a motion to open the first Tamil vernacular secondary school in Malaysia at Penang. But for political reasons this proposal was rejected by the central government.\n\nIndian Malaysians also form the bulk of English teachers in Penang.

The society's most notable recent achievement was the statewide protection of all Syngnathidae (including the Leafy sea dragon, Weedy sea dragon, pipefish and seahorses) under the State's Fisheries Management Act. This was driven by concerns that the animals could become targeted by aquarium keepers and poachers looking to exploit the species for the aquarium trade.\n\n\nIn February 2006, Minister for Fisheries Rory McEwen announced the protection of all Syngnathidae in South Australian waters under the Fisheries Management Act. The decision was the result of club President Philip Hall's direct representation to the State Premier, Mike Rann during a Community Cabinet meeting.\n\nIn 2014 the society took a more outward facing approach than in previous years, presenting the inaugural Whyalla Underwater Shootout photography competition and an art exhibition at Port Noarlunga. The Society also responded to a variety of marine conservation issues including the potential impact of shipping noise on the giant Australian cuttlefish aggregation of Upper Spencer Gulf and a mass stranding of sperm whales at Ardrossan, Yorke Peninsula in December. The Marine Life Society was also represented at Adelaide rallies and events held in opposition to the Western Australian shark cull.\n\nThe Society's current projects include the preparation of a \"Beach Wash Guide\", designed to help beach-combers identify and learn about organisms sighted or collected from South Australian beaches. As of 2013, the guide has been under development for 14 years.\n\nThe society also produces an annual calendar featuring photographs of South Australian marine life taken by its members. The calendars are sold as a fundraising and outreach exercise. The society also hosts an online photo index of species native to South Australian waters on its website.\n\nIn December 2013, a once-off grant to the \"Marine Discovery Centre\" at the Star of the Sea School was approved by the Committee to sponsor the design, production and establishment of three outdoor interpretive signs. The project is intended to provide information on the need for 'catchment to coast' care. At the time, it was the largest grant ever made by the Society.\n\nSince 2006, the Society's priority species of conservation concern have become the Western blue groper (Achoerodus gouldii) and the Harlequin fish (Othox dentex). As of 2014, the society is developing a number of position statements on a variety of marine conservation matters.\nThe society published a monthly newsletter and an annual journal until 2014. An archive of past issues is available at the Society's website, dating back to the 1990s. In 2014, the newsletter was discontinued in favour of posting articles online.\n\nThe society has an extensive library of publications relevant to South Australian marine life which are available to members.\n\nThe society is both a sponsor of and a recipient of sponsorship from other organisations. The society's patron is published author and marine scientist, Scoresby Shepherd.\n\n"}

Weingast notes that there is a fundamental dilemma facing a government attempting to build and protect markets: the government must be strong enough to protect property rights and enforce contracts, but weak enough to credibly commit the state to honoring such rules. \n\nMarket-preserving federalism is a means by which some countries address the fundamental dilemma of government. By decentralizing the authority to make economic policies, market-preserving federalism reduces the ability of both the central government to act arbitrarily (it has given up these powers) and the subnational governments (they face competition with one another for scarce capital and labor). \n\nMontinola, Qian, and Weingast argue that this form of federalism was critical for the success of China's reforms in the early 1980s.\n\nMontinola, Qian, and Weingast identify a set of five conditions that represent an ideal type of institutional arrangement for market-preserving federalism (italics in original). \n\n(F1) There exists a hierarchy of governments with a \"delineated scope of authority\" (for example, between the national and subnational governments) so that each government is autonomous in its own sphere of authority.\n\n(F2) The subnational governments have primary \"authority over the economy\" within their jurisdictions. \n\n(F3) The national government has the authority to police the \"common market\" and to ensure the mobility of goods and factors across subgovernment jurisdictions. \n\n(F4) Revenue sharing among governments is limited and borrowing by governments is constrained so that all governments face \"hard budget constraints\". \n\n(F5) The allocation of authority and responsibility has an \"institutionalized degree of durability\" so that it cannot be altered by the national government either unilaterally or under the pressures from subnational governments.\n\nWhile condition F1 is the defining feature of federalism, conditions two through five are required to ensure federalism’s market-preserving qualities. Federal systems that fail to satisfy these five conditions generally do not sustain markets and economic development; for example, Argentina, India, and Mexico.\n\nMcKinnon, Ronald I. 1997. “Market-Preserving Fiscal Federalism in the American Monetary Union,” in Mario I.

{"id": "99362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99362", "title": "Oduduwa", "text": "Oduduwa\n\nOduduwa, was not only the first ruler of a unified Ife, but also the progenitor of various independent royal dynasties in Yorubaland, and is today venerated as \"the hero, the warrior, the leader and father of the Yoruba race\".\n\nThrough war lasting many years, Oduduwa was able to defeat the forces of the 13 indigenous communities of Ife led by Obatala and formed these communities into a single Ife state.\n\nHe held the praise names \"Olofin Adimula\", \"Olofin Aye\" and \"Olufe\". His name, phonetically written by Yoruba language-speakers as Odùduwà and sometimes contracted as \"Ooduwa\", \"Odudua\" or \"Oòdua\", is generally ascribed to the ancestral dynasties of Yorubaland because he is held by the Yoruba to have been the ancestor of their numerous crowned kings. Following his posthumous deification, he was admitted to the Yoruba pantheon as an aspect of a primordial divinity of the same name.\n\n\nAccording to early historians, Oduduwa was an exiled prince of a foreign people who left his homeland with a retinue and journeyed south, subsequently settling amongst the aboriginal Yoruba at some point in the 12th century CE. He is said to have brought the Yoruba religion with him when he came. This faith system was so important to him and his followers that it is said to have been the cause of their exodus in the first place.\nThe location of Oduduwa's land of origin is a matter of some debate. The popular opinions of a number of the Yoruba claim that he was a prince of Mecca. It was supposedly the persecution of the Muslim elite of the city that caused him and his fellow animists to leave Arabia.\n\nWhatever the case may be, it is now considered a historical fact that Oduduwa and his fellow settlers were outsiders from elsewhere that were absorbed by the aborigines of Ife.\n\nUpon the ending of Oduduwa's time on Earth, there was a dispersal of his children and grandchildren from Ife to the outposts that they had previously founded or gained influence over, in order for them to establish effective control over these places. Each is said to have made his or her mark in the subsequent urbanization and consolidation of the Yoruba confederacy of kingdoms, with each child or grandchild fashioning his or her state after Ile-Ife.\n\nOrunto, a child of Oduduwa that was born to his maid, is the ancestor of the families that are entitled to inherit the \"Obalufe\" title - it is held by a royal that's traditionally ranked second in the order of precedence at the Ooni's court.\n\nObalufon II Alayemore was on the throne when Oranmiyan returned from his sojourn and ordered that the kingship be given to him and hence back to the legitimate family of Oduduwa. Oranmiyan's son Lajamisan was therefore the progenitor of all of the Oonis that have reigned in Ife from his time till now.\n\nIn contradiction of the preceding historical claims, Ife tradition relates that Oduduwa was an emissary from the community of Oke-Ora, the easternmost part of the Ife cultural area which stretches towards the Northeastern Ijesa people. He descended from the Hills on a chain, earning the oriki \"Atewonro\" (which means 'one who descends on a chain'). He is said to have been a warrior that wore armor made of iron.\nAt that time, a confederacy existed between the 13 communities of the valley of Ile-Ife, with each community or 'Elu' having its own Oba; the Oba of Ijugbe, the Oba of Ijio, the Oba of Iwinrin etc.\n\nWhen Oduduwa rose to be a prominent citizen of ancient Ife, he and his group are believed to have conquered most of the 13 component communities and deposed Obatala, subsequently evolving the palace structure with its effective centralized power and dynasty. Due to this, he is commonly referred to as the first Ooni of Ife and progenitor of the legitimate kings of the Benin and the Yoruba people.\n\nThe first child of Oduduwa, Okanbi Iyunade, married Obatala and later gave birth to the future crowned king of Owu. He is believed to have acquired his crown as a toddler while crying on his grandfather's lap.\n\nOmonide, Oduduwa's favorite wife, gave birth to Sopasan, the father of the future crowned kings of Ketu. Sopasan was the first to leave Ile-Ife with his mother and crown. He settled at such temporary sites as Oke-Oyan and Aro. At Aro, Soposan died and was succeeded by Owe. The migrants stayed for a number of generations and broke camp in the reign of the seventh king, Ede, who revived the westward migrations and founded a dynasty at Ketu.\n\nAjagunla Fagbamila Orangun, the first legitimate son of Oduduwa, is crowned king of Ila.\nOduduwa is said to have wanted more sons to silence his critics. On the advice of the Ifa oracle, he went to a stream, where he found a naked lady by the name of Adetinrin Anasin. She eventually became his wife and the mother of Ifagbamila (which means \"Ifa saves me\")\n\n\n\nOranmiyan went on to found Oyo-Ile. His sons Ajaka and Sango rule Oyo in their turn.\n\nOranmiyan was the last son and the most adventurous of the members of Oduduwa's household. He was the first Oba of Benin, first Alaafin of Oyo, and the sixth Ooni of Ife.\n\nAfter the dispersal of the family of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of the Ibolo region of the old Oyo kingdom, a member of the Ooduan dynasty by marriage to Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently played a significant role in restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was \"FIRE\", if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people of their weakness. The people of Ife were soon prepared for the marauders.\n\nNative religious traditions about the dawn of time claim that Oduduwa was Olodumare's favourite Orisa. As such, he (or she, as the primordial Oduduwa is gender fluid) was sent from heaven to create the earth upon the waters, a mission he/she had usurped from his/her consort and sibling Obatala, who had been equipped with a snail shell filled with sand and a rooster to scatter the said sand inorder to create land. These beliefs are held by Yoruba traditionalists to be the cornerstone of their story of creation. Obatala and Oduduwa here are represented symbolically by a calabash, with Obatala taking the top and Oduduwa taking the bottom. In this narrative, Oduduwa is also known as \"Olofin Otete\", the one who took the Basket of Existence from Olodumare.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1553275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1553275", "title": "Physical dependence", "text": "Physical dependence\n\nPhysical dependence is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a tolerance forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual drug withdrawal causes unpleasant physical symptoms. Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as the recreational misuse of drugs such as alcohol, opioids, and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or \"PAWS\", is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, often resulting in relapse and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months, years, or depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by benzodiazepines. To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction, physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes.\n\nPhysical dependence can manifest itself in the appearance of both physical and psychological symptoms which are caused by physiological adaptions in the central nervous system and the brain due to chronic exposure to a substance. Symptoms which may be experienced during withdrawal or reduction in dosage include increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, sweating, and tremors. More serious withdrawal symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and visual hallucinations indicate a serious emergency and the need for immediate medical care. Sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates are the only commonly available substances that can be fatal in withdrawal due to their propensity to induce withdrawal convulsions. Abrupt withdrawal from other drugs, such as opioids can cause an extremely painful withdrawal that is very rarely fatal in patients of general good health and with medical treatment, but is more often fatal in patients with weakened cardiovascular systems; toxicity is generally caused by the often-extreme increases in heart rate and blood pressure (which can be treated with clonidine), or due to arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance caused by the inability to eat, and constant diarrhea and vomiting (which can be treated with loperamide and ondansetron respectively) associated with acute opioid withdrawal, especially in longer-acting substances where the diarrhea and emesis can continue unabated for weeks, although life-threatening complications are extremely rare, and nearly non-existent with proper medical management.\n\nTreatment for physical dependence depends upon the drug being withdrawn and often includes administration of another drug, especially for substances that can be dangerous when abruptly discontinued or when previous attempts have failed. Physical dependence is usually managed by a slow dose reduction over a period of weeks, months or sometimes longer depending on the drug, dose and the individual. A physical dependence on alcohol is often managed with a cross tolerant drug, such as long acting benzodiazepines to manage the alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\nA wide range of drugs whilst not causing a true physical dependence can still cause withdrawal symptoms or rebound effects during dosage reduction or especially abrupt or rapid withdrawal. These can include caffeine, stimulants, steroidal drugs and antiparkinsonian drugs. It is debated if the entire antipsychotic drug class causes true physical dependency, if only a subset does, or if none do, but all, if discontinued too rapidly, cause an acute withdrawal syndrome. When talking about illicit drugs rebound withdrawal is, especially with stimulants, sometimes referred to as \"coming down\" or \"crashing\".\n\nSome drugs, like anticonvulsants and antidepressants, describe the drug category and not the mechanism. The individual agents and drug classes in the anticonvulsant drug category act at many different receptors and it is not possible to generalize their potential for physical dependence or incidence or severity of rebound syndrome as a group so they must be looked at individually. Anticonvulsants as a group however are known to cause tolerance to the anti-seizure effect. SSRI drugs, which have an important use as antidepressants, engender a discontinuation syndrome that manifests with physical side effects. E.g., There have been case reports of a discontinuation syndrome with venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\n\n"}

Francis Bacon described revenge as a kind of \"wild justice\" that \"does... offend the law [and] putteth the law out of office.\" Primitive justice or retributive justice is often differentiated from more formal and refined forms of justice such as distributive justice and divine judgment.\n\nSocial psychologist Ian Mckee states that the desire for the sustenance of power motivates vengeful behavior as a means of impression management: \"People who are more vengeful tend to be those who are motivated by power, by authority and by the desire for status. They don't want to lose face\". \n\nVengeful behavior has been found across a majority of human societies. Some societies encourage vengeful behavior, which is called a feud. These societies usually regard the honor of individuals and groups as of central importance. Thus, while protecting of his reputation an avenger feels as if he restores the previous state of dignity and justice. According to Michael Ignatieff, \"Revenge is a profound moral desire to keep faith with the dead, to honor their memory by taking up their cause where they left off\". Thus, honor may become a heritage that passes from generation to generation. Whenever it is compromised, the affected family or community members might feel compelled to retaliate against an offender to restore the initial \"balance of honor\" that preceded the perceived injury. This cycle of honor might expand by bringing the family members and then the entire community of the new victim into the brand-new cycle of revenge that may pervade generations.\n\nFeuds are cycles of provocation and retaliation, fueled by a burning desire for revenge and carried out over long periods of time by familial or tribal groups; they were an important part of many pre-industrial societies, especially in the Mediterranean region. They still persist in some areas, notably in Albania with its tradition of \"gjakmarrja\" or \"blood feuds\". During the Middle Ages, most would not regard an insult or injury as settled until it was avenged, or, at the least, paid for—hence, the extensive Anglo-Saxon system of weregild (literally, \"man-price\") payments, which placed a certain monetary value upon certain acts of violence in an attempt to limit the spiral of revenge by codifying the responsibility of a malefactor.\n\nBlood feuds are still practiced in many parts of the world, including Kurdish regions of Turkey and in Papua New Guinea.\n\nIn Japan, honouring one's family, clan, or lord through the practice of revenge killings is called \"katakiuchi\" (敵討ち).These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. Today, katakiuchi is most often pursued by peaceful means, but revenge remains an important part of Japanese culture.\n\nThe motto of the Order of the Thistle is \"Nemo me impune lacessit\", Latin for \"Nobody shall provoke/injure me with impunity\". The origin of the motto reflects the feudal clan system of ancient Scotland, particularly the Highlands.\n\nThe goal of some legal systems is limited to \"just\" revenge—in the fashion of the contrapasso punishments awaiting those consigned to Dante's \"Inferno\", some have attempted to turn the crime against the criminal, in clever and often gruesome ways.\n\nThe popular expression \"revenge is a dish best served cold\" suggests that revenge is more satisfying if enacted when unexpected or long feared, inverting traditional civilized revulsion toward \"cold-blooded\" violence.\n\nThe idea's origin is obscure. The French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) has been credited with the saying, \"La vengeance est un met que l'on doit manger froid\" [\"Revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold\"], albeit without supporting detail. It has been in the English language at least since the 1846 translation of the 1845 French novel \"Mathilde\" by Joseph Marie Eugène Sue: \"la vengeance se mange très bien froide\", there italicized as if quoting a proverbial saying, and translated \"revenge is very good eaten cold\". It has been wrongly credited to the novel \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" (1782).\n\nIts path to modern popularity may begin with the 1949 film \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" which had \"revenge is a dish which people of taste prefer to eat cold.\" The familiar wording appears in the film \"Death Rides a Horse\" (1967), in the novel \"The Godfather\" by Mario Puzo (1969), as if from an \"old Klingon proverb\" in the film \"\" (1982). The title sequence of the Quentin Tarantino film \"\" (2003) referred to this last movie by again citing it as a Klingon proverb. After that it appeared in the 2004 version of \"Man on Fire\".\n\nThe phrase has also been credited to the Pashtuns of Afghanistan.\n\nAnother proverb states, \"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves\". Another version () proposes that a son who does not take revenge for his parents is not a son.\n\nRevenge is a popular subject across many forms of art. Some examples include the painting \"Herodias' Revenge\" by Juan de Flandes and the opera \"Don Giovanni\" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In Japanese art, revenge is a theme in various woodblock prints depicting the forty-seven rōnin by many well-known and influential artists, including Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The Chinese playwright Ji Junxiang used revenge as the central theme in his theatrical work \"The Orphan of Zhao\"; it depicts more specifically familial revenge, which is placed in the context of Confucian morality and social hierarchical structure.\n\nRevenge has been a popular literary theme historically and continues to play a role in modern and contemporary works today. Notable examples of literature that feature revenge as a theme include the plays \"Hamlet\" and \"Othello\" by William Shakespeare, the novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexandre Dumas, and the short story \"The Cask of Amontillado\" by Edgar Allan Poe. More modern examples include the novels \"Carrie\" by Stephen King and \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn. Other examples are the Greek myths of Medea, and the novel \"The Princess Bride\" by William Goldman. Although revenge is a theme in itself, it is also considered to be a genre.\n\nRevenge as a genre has been consistent with a variety of themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries. Such themes at hand include but are not limited to: disguise, masking, sex, cannibalism, the grotesque, bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy. Each theme, along with the concept of dramatic irony, play a large role in the success of revenge in literature. Dramatic irony is a literary device in which the audience possesses knowledge unavailable to characters in a novel, play, or film. Its purpose is to intensify the tragic events that are going to unfold by creating tension between the audience and the actions of the characters. It is essential to narratives of revenge.\n\nThe most common theme within the genre of revenge is the recurring violent murders that take place throughout the text, more so, however, in the final act or scene. The root of the violence is usually derived from the characters' childhood development. Violent murders are seen in many texts ranging from dramas to novels. \"Carrie\", a 20th-century novel written by Stephen King, has prime examples of this theme that do, indeed, occur during the final scenes. Another interesting text that incorporates this theme is the sixteenth-century drama \"Titus Andronicus\" by William Shakespeare.\n\nContinuing on, the themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with one another. A character may employ disguise literally or metaphorically. A mask, per se, is the literal example of this theme; while pretending to be something one is not is considered to be the metaphoric example. Additional themes that may cause the protagonist and antagonist to develop a masked or disguised identity include sex, power, and even cannibalism. Examples of sex and power being used as themes can be seen in the novel \"Gone Girl\", by Gillian Flynn, as well as the already mentioned drama, \"Titus Andronicus\".\n\nOverall, although revenge is considered a theme in itself, its constant development over the last few centuries can allow it to be considered a genre as well. Key components, expressed as themes, that make up this genre are prevalent in copious literary works.\n\nHorsfall, J. A. (1984). Brood reduction and brood division in coots. Animal Behaviour, 32(1): 216-225.\n\nHumans are not the only species known to take revenge. There are several species such as camels, elephants, fish, lions, coots, and many species of primates (chimpanzees, macaques, baboons, etc.) that have been recognized to seek revenge. Primatologists Frans de Waal and Lesleigh Luttrellave conducted numerous studies that provide evidence of revenge in many species of primates. They observed chimpanzees and noticed patterns of revenge. For example, if chimpanzee A helped chimpanzee B defeat his opponent, chimpanzee C, then chimpanzee C would be more likely to help chimpanzee A's opponent in a later squabble. Chimpanzees are one of the most common species that show revenge due to their desire for dominance. Studies have also been performed on less cognitive species such as fish to demonstrate that not only intellectual animals execute revenge.\n\n"}

The Romani people in Bulgaria \"speak Bulgarian, Turkish or Romani, depending on the region and their religious affiliations.\"\nAccording to the latest census in 2011, the number of the Romani is 325,343, constituting 4.4% of the total population, in which only one ethnic group could be opted as an answer and 10% of the total population did not respond to the question on ethnic group. In a conclusive report of the census sent to Eurostat, the authors of the census (the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria) identified the census results on ethnicity as a \"gross manipulation\". The former head of the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria, Reneta Indzhova claims to have been fired by the Bulgarian Prime Minister in 2014 for attempting to check the actual number of the Romani and implied that neither the census did enumerate the Romani, nor its statistics did provide the \"real data\". Unlike other censuses under Eurostat, which require the ethnic identification to be verified by a family tree, in the Bulgarian census the ethnic identification is completely up to the voluntarily identification of the enumerated and not up to any further investigation by the enumerators.\n\nThe previous 2001 census recorded 370,908 Romani (4.7% of the population). The preceding 1992 census recorded 313,396 Romani (3.7% of the population), while a secret backstage 1992 census ordered by the Ministry of Interior recorded a figure of 550,000 Romani (6.5% of the population); the Ministry of Interior ordered at least two other secret censuses to enumerate the Romani in denial, the one in 1980 recorded 523,519 Romani, while the one in 1989 recorded that the number of the Romani was 576,927 (6.5% of the population) and that over half of the Romani identified as Turks. The majority of the estimated 200,000-400,000 Muslim Romani tend to identify themselves as ethnic Turks, some deny their origin, or identify as Bulgarians. \n\nThe demographic collapse in Bulgaria affects only ethnic groups other than the Romani.\nAccording to data of the European Commission, to which Eurostat belongs, the Romani in Bulgaria number 750,000 and they constitute 10.33% of the population. An NGO estimates that the number of the Romani in Bulgaria is twice as this high and their population grows by 35,000 a year.\n\nIn Bulgaria, Romani are most commonly referred to as \"Tsigani\" (цигани, pronounced ), an exonym that some Romani resent and others embrace. The form of the endonym \"Roma\" in Bulgarian is \"romi\" (роми). They are generally younger, according to the 2011 census they make up 10.2% of the population aged up to 9 years, on a note 14.9% of the total age group being non-respondents.\n\nIn Bulgaria Roma are discriminated: 59% to 80% of non-Roma have negative feelings towards Roma.\nThey are emancipated social group, having higher crime, unemployment, birth, death and poverty rates, and not many of them attend school. Though most live in poverty, the Romani are represented in Bulgarian mafia and rich Romani crime bosses deal with drug trade and prostitution. Though most of them are officially unemployed, they have a high rate of child sex workers. Roma constitute the majority of prison population according to self-identification of inmates, with 7000 prisoners (70%) out of 10,000 in total. According to 2002 data, the poverty rate among Romani is 61.8%, in contrast to a rate of 5.6% among Bulgarians. In 1997, 84% of Bulgarian Romani lived under the poverty line, compared with 32% of ethnic Bulgarians. In 1994, the poverty rate of Romani was estimated at 71.4%, compared with 15% for Bulgarians. The unemployment rate of non-Romani in Bulgaria was 25%, while of the Romani it was 65% in 2008, for instance in neighbouring Romania and Hungary the Romani had much lower unemployment rates - 14% and 21% respectively. In 2016 only 23% of the Romani in Bulgaria are employed. The unemployed enjoy more financial aid than other citizens, especially for children, which may have prompt the higher birth rates of the Romani.\n\nIn 2011 the share of Romani with university degree reached 0.3%, while 6.9% have secondary education; the same share was 22.8%/47.6% for Bulgarians.\n\nThe Turks are more negative towards the Romani than the Bulgarians, with 30-50% rejecting various interactions and friendship with Romani. Although only 25% of Romani parents object to their children to be married with a Bulgarian and a Turk, only 4% of the Bulgarians and 6% of the Turks would marry a Romani person. Romani are avoided by the majority traditionally, especially for marriage, however, there are ethnically mixed people with Gypsy and Bulgarian parents who are called жоревци \"zhorevtsi\" (from the common name George). \n\nBulgaria participates in the Decade of Roma Inclusion, an international initiative to improve the socio-economic status and social inclusion of Roma, with eight other governments committing themselves to \"work toward eliminating discrimination and closing the unacceptable gaps between Roma and the rest of society\". The rights of the Romani people in the country are also represented by political parties and cultural organizations, most notably the Civil Union \"Roma\". Noted Roma from Bulgaria include musicians Azis, Sofi Marinova and Ivo Papazov, surgeon Aleksandar Chirkov, politicians Toma Tomov and Tsvetelin Kanchev, footballer Marian Ognyanov, and 1988 Olympic boxing champion Ismail Mustafov.\n\nThe Romani people originate from Northern India, presumably from the northwestern Indian states Rajasthan and Punjab.\n\nThe linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines.\n\nMore exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali.\n\nGenetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group.\nAccording to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the Ḍoma, are the likely ancestral populations of the modern European Roma.\n\nIn February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora.\n\nThe Romani people emigrated from Northern India, presumably from the northwestern Indian states of Rajasthan and Punjab, possibly as early as 600 A.D. They emigrated to the Middle East and then reached the European continent. Moreover, \"the Roma (the name is the plural form of the word “Rom”) moved from India at the beginning of the 12th century, reached Europe in the 14th century and Central Europe in the 15th century.\" The language of the Romani people is called Romani [romaňi čhib] or Romany. It is an Indic (or Indo-Aryan) language — like Sanskrit, Hindi, and Bengali — which belongs to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. The language retains much of the Indic morphology, phonology and lexicon, while its syntax has been heavily influenced by contact with other languages.\n\nBulgarian ethnologists Elena Marushiakova and Veselin Popov assert that no direct evidence indicates when precisely the Romani first appeared in Bulgaria. While they mention that other Bulgarian and international scholars have associated the 1387 Charter of Rila term \"Agoupovi Kleti\" with the Romani, they hold that the term refers to seasonal lodgings for mountain herdsmen. Instead, they delimit the mass settlement of Romani in Bulgarian territory between the 13th and 14th centuries, supporting this time frame with 13th- and 14th-century documents referring to Romani presence in the surrounding Balkan states. According to Bulgarian sociologist Ilona Tomova, Ottoman fiscal reports between the 15th and 17th centuries indirectly indicate Romani settlement in Bulgaria since the 13th century, as most registered Romani possessed Slavonic names and were Christians.\n\"Although the largest Roma migration wave to the Bulgarian lands seems to have occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries, many Roma arrived with the Ottoman troops, accompanying army craftsmen and complementary military units.\"\n\nIn addition, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Muslim Romani arrived in Bulgaria with the Ottoman rule, serving as auxiliaries, craftsmen, musicians and other professions. Unlike the Ottoman Empire’s other subjects in the millet system, Romani were governed based on their ethnicity, not their religious affiliation. Ottoman tax records first mention Romani in the Nikopol region, where 3.5% of the registered households were Romani. Under Mehmed II’s reign, all Romani — Christian and Muslim — paid a poll-tax that was otherwise imposed only on non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Suleiman I enacted laws to prohibit the mingling of Muslim and Christian Romani and to administer taxes collected from the Romani: the 1530 \"Gypsies in the Rumelia Region Act\" and a 1541 law for the Romani sancak. Muslim Romani were taxed less than Christian Romani, yet they were taxed more than other Muslims for not adhering to Islamic laws and customs. Ottoman imperial assembly registers from 1558-1569 characterize the Romani as \"ehl-i fesad\" (people of malice), charging them with crimes such as prostitution, murder, theft, vagrancy and counterfeiting.\n\nRoma in Bulgaria are not a unified community in culture and lifestyle. The most widespread group of the Romani in the country are the \"yerlii\" or the 'local Roma', who are in turn divided into Bulgarian Gypsies (\"daskane roma\") and Turkish Gypsies (\"horahane roma\"). The former are mostly Christian (Eastern Orthodox and Protestant), while the latter are Muslim. Many of the Muslim Romani or the so-called Turkish Gypsies are usually well integrated in the ethnic Turkish society in Bulgaria. Many possess Turkish ethnic identity and speak Turkish in addition to Romani. Moreover, between 50% and 75% of Romani are Muslims and more than 30 Romani dialects are reportedly used in the country. Muslim Romani can be divided into several linguistic groups: for example the Xoraxane Romani, who speak only Romani (although they know Turkish or Bulgarian) and identify themselves as Romani; Romani whose language is a mix between Romani and Turkish; Romani who use only Turkish (rarely Bulgarian and Romani); and Romani who can only speak Turkish, identifying themselves as either Romani or Turkish.\n\nA subgroup of the Bulgarian Gypsies in southern Bulgaria, the \"Asparuhovi bâlgari\" ('Asparuh Bulgarians') — that is known also as \"stari bâlgari\" ('Old Bulgarians'), \"sivi gâlâbi\" ('Grey Doves', 'Grey Pigeons'), or \"demirdzhii\" — self-identify as the descendants of blacksmiths for Khan Asparuh's army. Some deny any connection with the Romani and most do not speak Romani.\n\nOther Romani groups include the conservative wandering \"Kalderash\" (sometimes referred to by the exonym \"Serbian Gypsies\") that are Eastern Orthodox and the \"Rudari\" (or \"Ludari\") who speak a dialect of Romanian and are known as \"Vlax Gypsies\". They are further subdivided into three groups by their traditional craft: the \"Ursari\" or \"Mechkari\" ('bear trainers'), the \"Lingurari\" or \"Kopanari\" ('carpenters', primarily associated with wooden bowls) and the \"Lautari\" ('musicians'). They migrated from Wallachia to present-day Bulgaria after 1856, the year of their liberation from slavery.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census of the population of Bulgaria, there are 325,343 Gypsies in Bulgaria, or 4.4 percent. 180,266 of these are urban residents and 145,077 rural.\n\nThe CIA Factbook claimed that 10% of the population is from unknown ethnic group, citing the 2011 census of the population of Bulgaria.\nIn 1992 of 5202 settlements there were registered Romani in 2095.\n\n22% of the Romani live in northeast, whereas settlements with prevailing Romani are located mostly in northeastern Bulgaria - mostly in Dobruja. According to the 1910 census, although in Bulgarian Dobruja there were settlements mostly populated even by Germans and Russians, there wasn't a single settlement with Romani plurality there and also on the 1930 Romanian census of the same region.\n\nWhile most of the Roma, 66%, are young children and adults up to 29 years old, the same group constitutes 37% among ethnic Bulgarians, while 5% of Roma are 60 years and over, Bulgarians are 22%.\n\nFrom the 1992 census to the 2001 census, the number of Romani in the country has increased by 57,512, or 18.4%. The Romani were only 2.8% in 1910 and 2.0% in 1920.\n\nWhile the Romani are present in all provinces of Bulgaria, their highest percentages are in Montana Province (12.5%) and Sliven Province (12.3%) and their smallest percentage is in Smolyan Province, where they number 686 — about 0.05% of the population.\n\nVarbitsa is possibly the only urban settlement where the Romani are the most numerous group. The largest Romani quarters are Stolipinovo in Plovdiv and Fakulteta in Sofia. The number of places where Romani constitute more than 50% of the population has doubled from the 1992 to the 2001 census.\n\nAlthough Roma constitute only 4.4 percent of the Bulgarian population, they constitute around 12 percent of all children aged between 0 and 9 years old according to the 2011 census . In some municipalities, like Valchedram in northwestern Bulgaria , more than the half of all children belong to the Roma ethnicity. \n\nIn a UNDP/ILO survey, Bulgarian Romani identified unemployment, economic hardship and discrimination in access to employment as major problems.\n\nThe Council of Europe body ECRI stated in its June 2003 third report on Bulgaria that Romani encounter \"serious difficulties in many spheres of life\", elaborating that:\n\n\"The main problems stem from the fact that the Roma districts are turning into ghettos. [...] Most Roma neighbourhoods consist of slums, precariously built without planning permission on land that often belongs to the municipalities [...]. As the Bulgarian authorities have not taken steps to address the situation, the people living in these districts have no access to basic public services, whether health care, public transport, waste collection or sanitation.\"\n\nTo which the Bulgarian government answered officially in the same document:\n\nECRI has correctly observed that members of the Roma community encounter “serious difficulties” “in many spheres of life”. The rest of this paragraph, however, regrettably contains sweeping, grossly inaccurate generalizations ... Due to various objective and subjective factors, many (but by no means all!) members of the Roma community found it particularly difficult to adapt to the new realities of the market economy. “…Romani mahala-dwellers are still captives of the past, holding onto and behaving according to preconceptions about the socialist welfare state that clash with the modern realities of a market economy and privatisation.” (Skopje Report, p.6)\n\nMore concretely, the allegation that the people living in these districts “have no access to basic public services” is largely inaccurate. Certain difficulties (though not remotely on the scale suggested) do exist in this regard, and the authorities are taking concrete measures to address them (see above). However, as the Advisor on Roma and Sinti issues at the OSCE, N. Gheorghe remarked during the Skopje meeting: “…many of the Roma confuse public services with rights to which they are entitled and which are guaranteed by the welfare state” (Skopje Report, p.16). ...\n\nConcerning the issue of the electricity supply it should be noted that dwellers of such neighbourhoods sometimes refuse to pay their electricity bills. This attitude could at least in part be explained by the fact that “…Romani mahala-dwellers believe they have rights as citizens to electricity and other services, and that the state has an obligation to provide and to a large extent to subsidize them” (Skopje Report, p. 7). In these circumstances electricity suppliers may find themselves with no other option but to “sometimes cut off” the electricity supply in order to incite the consumers to commence honouring their debts. Such cut-offs are part of standard practice and the ethnic origin of the consumers is irrelevant in these cases.\n\nWith respect to welfare benefits, which allegedly “in some cases, moreover, Roma do not receive” while “they are entitled” to them, it should be underscored that Bulgaria’s social welfare legislation sets uniform objective criteria for access to welfare benefits for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin (furthermore, any discrimination, including on ethnic grounds is expressly prohibited by law). The question of who is entitled or not entitled to welfare benefits is determined by the relevant services on the basis of a means test. Every single decision of these services must be (and is) in written form and clearly motivated. If a claimant is not satisfied with a decision, he/she is entitled to appeal it before the regional welfare office. Consequently, this allegation of ECRI is also erroneous.\"\n\nA monitoring report by the Open Society Institute found that Romani children and teenagers are less likely to enroll in primary and secondary schools than the majority population and less likely to complete their education if they do. Between 60% and 77% of Romani children enroll in primary education (ages 6–15), compared to 90-94% of ethnic Bulgarians. Only 6%-12% of Romani teenagers enroll in secondary education (ages 16–19). The drop-out rate is significant, but hard to measure, as many are formally enrolled but rarely attend classes.\n\nThe report also indicates that Romani children and teenagers attend de facto segregated \"Roma schools\" in majority-Romani neighbourhoods and villages. These \"Roma schools\" offer inferior quality education; many are in bad physical condition and lack necessary facilities such as computers. As a result, Romani literacy rates, already below those for ethnic Bulgarians, are much lower still for Romani who have attended segregated schools.\n\nThe official position of the Bulgarian government to such segregation is:\n\n\"There had never been a policy of \"segregation\" of Roma children in the national education system. The fact that in some neighbourhoods in certain towns particular schools were attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin was an unintended consequence of the administrative division of the school system. According to the rules valid for all children irrespective of their ethnic origin, admittance to any public school was linked administratively to the domicile of the family. In neighbourhoods where the population was predominantly of Roma origin, this system produced schools, attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin. It is precisely this situation that the authorities are taking special measures to rectify. Therefore, the word “segregation\" with respect to Roma children is inaccurate.\"\n\nRomani children are often sent to special schools for children with intellectual disabilities or boarding schools for children with \"deviant behavior\" (so-called \"delinquent schools\"). According to reports of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee (BHC), Romani made up half the number of students in schools for children with intellectual disabilities and about two-thirds of the students of the boarding schools, where the BHC found a variety of human rights abuses, including physical violence. In both sets of special schools, the quality of teaching is very poor and essential things such as desks, textbooks and teaching materials are inadequate or altogether lacking.\n\nOn two occasions, the European Committee of Social Rights has found violations of the European Social Charter in situations with Bulgaria's Romani population: in 2006, concerning right to housing, and in 2008, concerning right to health — in both cases on complaints from the European Roma Rights Centre.\n\nAccording to a report of POLITEA, \"For the most of the 1990s the only representation the Romani got was through the mainstream political parties. This was a very limited form of representation in which one or two Romani had a symbolic presence in Parliament during each term.\" The Bulgarian Constitution does not allow political parties based on ethnic, religious, or racist principles or ideology. However, \"Twenty one Roma political organizations were founded between 1997 and 2003 in Bulgaria [...]\".\n\nIn the 2005 Bulgarian parliamentary election, three Romani parties took part: Euroroma, Movement for an Equal Public Model (as part of a coalition led by the Union of Democratic Forces) and the Civil Union \"Roma\" (as part of a coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party).\nCurrently, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms represents Muslim Romani. The party relies on the biggest share of Romani people, 44% of the total Romani vote, including non-Muslims.\n\nRomani people are considered second-class citizens by some Bulgarians. Romani integration programmes funded by the European Union have had mixed success.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "436021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436021", "title": "Rudolf Wanderone", "text": "Rudolf Wanderone\n\nRudolf Walter Wanderone Jr. (January 19, 1913 – January 15, 1996; originally spelled Wanderon) was an American professional billiards player, also known as \"Minnesota Fats\". Although he never won a major pool tournament as \"Fats\", he was perhaps the most publicly recognized pool player in the United States — not only as a player, but also as an entertainer. Wanderone was inducted in 1984 into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame for his decades-long public promotion of pool.\n\nWanderone began playing at a young age in New York City. As a teenager, he became a traveling pool hustler. Later, in his 30s, he moved to southern Illinois where he met and married his first wife, Evelyn. During World War II, he hustled servicemen in Norfolk, Virginia. With the end of the war, Wanderone returned to Illinois and entered semi-retirement.\n\nWanderone adopted the nickname \"Minnesota Fats\" from a character in the 1961 film \"The Hustler\", claiming that the character was based upon him. He parlayed the association with the film into his own book deals and television appearances, including a series of matches with rival Willie Mosconi. Later in life, Wanderone divorced Evelyn and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he married his second wife, Theresa, with whom he remained until his death.\n\nWanderon was born in New York City to Rosa and Rudolf Wanderon, Swiss immigrants. He was born in 1913, but sometimes hinted he was born earlier, even as early as 1900. \nKnown as \"Rudy\" to friends and family, Wanderone started playing pool as a child while living in Washington Heights, Manhattan. In 1923, he traveled to Europe with his father where he received training from German balkline billiards champion Erich Hagenlocher. His first prominent match was in 1926 when he competed against former nine-ball champion \"Cowboy\" Weston; Wanderone won, handily. Wanderone left school in the eighth grade and became a traveling pool hustler, spending much of the 1920s playing at a pool hall called Cranfield's in New York City, where he received his first nickname after beating another hustler known as \"Smart Henry\". The intensity of their competition led Wanderone's friend, Titanic Thompson, to dub Wanderone \"Double-Smart\". By the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression, Wanderone had become a manager of a pool hall, owned by a friend, in Anacostia, southeast Washington, D.C. He had acquired more notoriety and nicknames, including \"Triple-Smart Fats\", \"New York Fats\", \"Broadway Fats\", and \"Chicago Fats\", attracting from other hustlers, including the then-unknown Luther \"Wimpy\" Lassiter.\n\nIn 1941, Wanderone and friend Jimmy Castras arrived in southern Illinois — a major hustling center on a fast track to televised tournament play — and settled in Du Quoin, Illinois, where he continued hustling. Eventually, he met Evelyn Inez Graff; they married two months to the day later, on May 7, 1941. Following their wedding, the Wanderones settled in Dowell, Illinois. In 1942, the couple moved to Norfolk, Virginia. Norfolk had become a key mustering point for American soldiers, as well as a shipbuilding center. The growing population led to an enormous interest in gambling; Wanderone, in partnership with fellow hustler Lassiter, quickly recognized the financial possibilities. Following World War II, however, the action \"dried up\" soon, and the Wanderones returned to Little Egypt. For a period throughout the 1950s, Wanderone entered semi-retirement, making only occasional hustling trips to New York City.\n\nIn 1961, the film version of Walter Tevis' novel \"The Hustler\" was released. The film tells the story of a pool shark named \"Fast Eddie\" Felson and his quest to beat the greatest pool player in America, \"Minnesota Fats\". World Champion Willie Mosconi served as a technical advisor and trick shot stunt man for the film. Wanderone almost immediately dropped his \"New York Fats\" nickname, adopted the name \"Minnesota Fats\" and began spreading the story that the character was based on him. Tevis denied this for the rest of his life.\nWanderone's notoriety as \"Minnesota Fats\" led to a job as executive vice-president of billiard table manufacturer Rozel Industries, playing exhibition matches and giving demonstrations. Rozel, in 1965, published Wanderone's first book: \"Minnesota \"Fats\" Book of Billiards\". On January 17, 1965, he appeared on the television game show \"What's My Line?\", successfully stumping the panel.\n\nIn 1966, he wrote his autobiography, \"The Bank Shot, and Other Great Robberies\", with \"Sports Illustrated\" journalist Tom Fox. His first television game show, \"Minnesota Fats Hustles the Pros\", debuted in 1967, featuring \"Fats\" playing against other pro players.\n\nIn 1967 he completed and published an instructional paperback, \"Minnesota Fats on Pool\", which was reprinted through 1976 in large-quantity editions, then reissued as a hardcover in 1993, and remains to this day commonly available.\n\nThe next year, on January 24, 1968, Wanderone was a guest on \"The Joey Bishop Show\". By 1970, \"Celebrity Billiards with Minnesota Fats\", another short-lived television game show series, featured Wanderone playing against celebrity guests such as Sid Caesar.\n\nIn a feature film \"The Player\" (produced in December 1970, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana), Wanderone played himself as \"Minnesota Fats\" and was featured prominently on the promotional poster. The screenplay was written and directed by Thomas DeMartini, also starred pool pro Jack Colavita, and had a limited release in 1971 by International Cinema. That same year Wanderone was a guest on both \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (September 21, 1971), on which he hustled Carson out of US$1, and the British \"David Frost Show\" (October 13, 1971). His fame as \"Fats\" had already made it difficult for Wanderone to hustle effectively, so he relied more and more on exhibition games for income.\n\nBy 1979, Wanderone was well-known enough to be playing himself as a celebrity guest star on a Season 2 episode of the popular television detective drama \"Vega$\", titled \"the Usurper\", the episode featured \"Fats\" and pro Jimmy Mataya playing one another in a game of pool. In 1980, while visiting a one-mile stretch of St. Louis, Wanderone had to double his order of autographed pictures after he was stopped thirty-seven times. During this trip he was beaten by Michael Boulton 4 out of 10 times in games of pool.\n\nWanderone enjoyed promoting a feud with world champion Mosconi over how to present pool — either as a rough-and-tumble gambling game (Wanderone) or as a genteel pastime and art form (Mosconi). Mosconi's widow, Flora, said of the rivalry, \"My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that <nowiki>[Wanderone]</nowiki> was always hurting the image of the game instead of helping it.\" Wanderone would state smugly, \"I may have 'given away' a few games to deserving competitors, but I have never lost a real money game since I was old enough to spell 'Weeli Mesconi'.\" The two competed on Valentine's Day (February 14), 1978 in a televised match on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". With almost 11 million viewers, the game was the second-highest rated episode of the show for that year, behind only the Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks rematch. The game was held at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, and was announced by Howard Cosell. Although Wanderone lost the game, he won the audience with his banter, and with his joking manner. Mosconi on the other hand was reportedly perceived as cold.\n\n\"Fats\" lost a number of rematches to Mosconi in the following years. However, in the nationally-broadcast \"Resorts International Shoot-Out\" of October 1984 — Wanderone's last notable television appearance — he finally turned the tables on his rival. The event began with a trick shot competition among four players — Wanderone, Mosconi, Steve Mizerak, and Allen Hopkins.\n\nNext, Hopkins and Fats played against Mosconi and Mizerak in doubles seven-ball, then nine-ball. Wanderone and Mosconi ultimately played a one-on-one game of seven-ball; Wanderone won the match. During the exhibition, a very quiet and genteel Mosconi blocked Wanderone's rough-and-tumble banter by wearing ear plugs; yet that failed to stop Wanderone from putting on a show for his fans. In an interview, Wanderone was asked about his strategy to defeat Mosconi, and replied that he had thought to himself, \"I'll make [the 7 ball] on the break and end it ... then I'll help carry Willie out on a stretcher.\"\n\nThe Billiard Congress of America in 1984 inducted Wanderone into its Hall of Fame for \"Meritorious Service\" in recognition of his contributions to helping popularize the game of pool. In 1984, Wanderone abandoned his wife, Evelyn; they divorced a year later.\n\nWanderone moved into the Hermitage Hotel in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, in 1985, remaining there for several years. In 1992, while undergoing surgery for a knee injury, he suffered a massive heart attack, but survived. In 1993, he met and married his second wife, Theresa Ward Bell. He lived in Bell's Nashville house until his death on January 15, 1996, four days shy of his 83rd birthday, although some sources, including \"The New York Times\", erroneously gave the date of his death on January 18.\nWanderone had no known children. Singer Etta James said she believed that he was her biological father, having reportedly been told this by her mother, as well as by others who knew her mother and whom James described as \"people who were there and should know\". However, there is no published evidence of such a relationship. James and Wanderone are only known to have met once, in 1987.\n\nIn her autobiography, \"Rage to Survive\", James recounted their meeting, writing that Wanderone neither confirmed nor denied his paternity. According to James, he told her that he did not recall the details of his life at the time of her conception well enough to know whether he could have been the father.\n\nThe epitaph on his tombstone reads: \"Beat every living creature on Earth. 'St. Peter, rack 'em up. — Fats.\n\nWanderone was known for ostentation, self-aggrandizement, tall tales, fast-talk, and entertaining banter. He was even publicly recognized by famed boaster Muhammad Ali as better at boasting. His critical biographer, R. A. Dyer, documents that Wanderone completely fabricated a \"here-by-fate\" tale about a car wreck which brought the player to Little Egypt; it was a tale that Wanderone encouraged to spread and further embellished in his autobiography, to lend an air of the mystical to his public persona. He made false claims about beating Willie Mosconi so frequently that Mosconi filed a slander lawsuit, to little avail.\n\nAccording to Dyer, Wanderone was notorious for non-stop chatter on subjects about which he knew little, or stories about himself. At the beginning of his first television match against Mosconi, Wanderone claimed \"I've never lost [a game] for money in my \"life\"; beat everyone that ever lived.\" Yet, as Dyer concedes, \"Pool hustlers are, by nature, liars. And by this measure, Minnesota Fats was just a very, very good pool hustler.\"\n\nWanderone was a lover of animals, and was reported to have had dozens of cats and dogs simultaneously, and to have devoted a lot of time to finding homes for strays. \"I'm crazy about every living creature\", he wrote in \"The Bank Shot\". \"It doesn't matter what it happens to be. I even love insects; in fact, I wouldn't swat a fly or a mosquito for a whole barrel of gold.\"\nRemembered well for his turns of phrase and his puns, Wanderone once wrote, \"If you happened to drive from Mobile to Dowell [Illinois] with a carload of pool hustlers, you would get bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well\", a reference not only to the area's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers. Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, \"Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg.\" Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.\n\nWanderone owned various limousines throughout his career. He once toured the country in a colorful Lincoln limousine, with his extended moniker painted along the side panels in translucent paint, changing colors as it moved with the reflections from the Sun: \"Minnesota Fats, King of Pool\". His 1980 Cadillac Fleetwood limousine was later in the Nashville auto museum, until the facility closed.\n\nWanderone was notorious for his spontaneous wit. When he was named the \"uncrowned king\" of pool because he never got actively involved in tournament circles (due to being too busy hustling), his reply: \"You judge a king by the size of his wallet and his palace. You can leave the crown in the toilet.\"\n\n\n"}

They speak an Indo-Aryan language, called Shina, which has varied dialects, such as Brokskat.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Shina people are found in Shinkari (the part of the Indus Valley below Gor near Ghorband), Gor, Chilas, Tangir, the Indus Valley below Sazin, and the upper part of the Gilgit Valley above Ponyal. Many Shina people have also migrated to Karachi and Islamabad for employment, carrying out business, and education purposes, and many of them have permanently settled in these cities.\n\nIn India, the Shina people are found in Gurais, as well as in Dah Hanu and beyond the city of Leh.\n\nThe Shina people originally practiced Hinduism, as well as Buddhism. As such, the Shina, particularly the Dangariké caste, were referred to by their neighbours as \"cow people\". In Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, the Hindu Shina formerly practiced sati, which ceased before A.D. 1740. 1877, in that region, marked the last year that Shina men underwent Hindu cremation rites. Many castes of the Shina people, such as the Açar'îta, converted to Islam in the 19th century and this faith is now observed by the majority of the ethnic group.

It is known as Deodar, which is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Devadaru\", which means \"wood of the gods\" and is a compound of the words \"deva\" (god) and \"dāru\" (wood, etym. tree).

{"id": "1154806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154806", "title": "Singapore Police Force", "text": "Singapore Police Force\n\nThe Singapore Police Force (Abbreviation: SPF; ; ; ) is the main government agency tasked with maintaining law and order in the island city-state. Formerly known as the \"Republic of Singapore Police\" (\"RSP\"; ), it has grown from an 11-man organisation to a 38,587 strong force. Singapore has been ranked consistently in the top five positions in the Global Competitiveness Report in terms of its reliability of police services.\n\nThe organisational structure of the SPF is split between the staff and line functions, roughly modeled after the military. There are currently 17 staff departments, 3 specialist staff departments and 17 specialist and line units, including 7 land divisions. The headquarters is located in a block at New Phoenix Park in Novena, adjacent to a twin block occupied by the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nThe Singapore Police Force is almost as old as modern Singapore. The Force was formed in 1820, with a skeleton force of 11 men under the command of Francis James Bernard, son-in-law of William Farquhar. Farquhar informed Raffles that he had provisionally introduced licences for opium and alcohol sales that would raise $650 per month, with $300 of this sum being used to run a small police department. As the department took form, Bernard became in charge of a Malay writer, one jailor, one \"jemadar\" (sergeant) and eight \"peada\" (constables) by May 1820. Raffles approved these arrangements by August 1820, and cemented the formal establishment of a police force in Singapore. Manpower constraints meant that the men had to perform a wide range of roles, and required the help of headmen among the various ethnic communities to maintain orderliness on the streets, all the more possible as the communities lived in segregated areas around the city.\n\nThis partnership with the community was in line with Sir Stamford Raffles' vision of a thriving colony largely self-regulated by local social structures, with the British masters administrating it via indirect rule. The large influx of migrants from China, however, began to test this system when the hands-off approach by the British allowed secret societies in Singapore to thrive. Although originally formed with legal intentions of community bonding and the provision of assistance to fellow migrants, these societies gradually became influential, competitive, and increasingly engaged in illegal activity including monetary extortion from the masses, the operation of gambling dens, and the smuggling of illegal goods on top of more legal commercial operations to meet their financial needs.\n\nCompetition gradually heated up between large rival factions, such as that between the larger Ghee Hin Kongsi, the Ghee Hock Kongsi and the Hai San Kongsi. Murders, mass riots, kidnappings, arson and other serious crimes became commonplace in the next four decades since the colony's founding. Faced with violent acts of crime which may involve thousands, such as the funeral riots of 1846 involving 9,000 members from the Ghee Hin and Ghee Hock secret societies, the police force was woefully incapable of bringing the situation under control, and often had to call in the army for assistance. The escalating number of serious crimes prompted the need for stronger legislation to deter would-be criminals. Singapore's first executions were thus held in the wake of the first criminal session in June 1828, when a Chinese and Indian were found guilty and convicted for murder.\n\nHeaded by Europeans and predominantly staffed by Malay and Indian officers, the force had little Chinese representation as the military and policing professionals were traditionally shunned by the Chinese community, which therefore impaired policing efforts among the large Chinese populace. In 1843, the force comprised a sitting magistrate doubling up as a superintendent, three European constables and an assistant native constable, 14 officers and 110 policemen. With a total strength of no more than 150 men, the police was compelled to avoid direct intervention in these mass acts of violence, else risking almost total annihilation.\n\nA repeat of this scenario occurred in 1851, when lingering displeasure against Roman Catholic ethnic Chinese erupted into major rioting leaving over 500 Chinese dead. The army was called in again, although it involved having to induct Indian convicts into military service almost overnight. In 1854, twelve consecutive days of violence sparked by a dispute between the Hokkiens and Teochews disrupted trade. This particular incident led to the formation of the military's Singapore Rifle Corps on 8 July 1854, the earliest predecessor of the Singapore Armed Forces' People's Defence Force today.\n\nHowever, criminal violence was not merely in the domain of the ethnic Chinese. Rivalries between Malay princes and communities also often result in acts of violence, which prompted the passing of Singapore's first arms law in March 1823 restricting the right to bear arms to 24 of the Malay Sultan's followers. Nearly two centuries later, these anti-arms laws continue to be strictly enforced, resulting in a society relatively free from firearms-related criminal offences.\n\nMurder rate in Singapore is reportedly low.\n\nThe divisions are also named after NATO phonetic alphabet. These include:\n\n\n‡ Now defunct units\nThe Singapore Police Force receives the highest budget allocation annually as compared to the various departments of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), typically accounting for about 50% of its annual budget. For the fiscal year of 2013 (for the year beginning 1 April 2013), S$3.89 billion was budgeted to the MHA, of which 47.8%, or S$1.86 billion was allocated for the Police Programme. Actual expenses in the 2013 fiscal year was S$2.04 billion, of which S$1.88 billion was spent on operating expenditure (against the budgeted S$1.79 billion) and S$159.1 million on development expenditure (budgeted at $71.83 million). Manpower costs amounting to S$1.16 billion continue to dominate the SPF's expenditure, accounting for 61.7% of its operating expenditure and 56.9% of total expenditure in FY2013.\n\nThe latest budget for fiscal year 2015, S$2.47 billion was allocated to the Police Programme, or 49.5% of MHA's total budget of S$5 billion (the Ministry of Defence, in comparison, received a S$13.12 billion budget allocation). This includes S$2.26 billion for Operating Expenditure and $210.93 million for Development Expenditure. The main Development Expenditures expected in FY2015 included the construction of new buildings such as the Woodlands Police Divisional HQ as well as the acquisition of new patrol craft for the Police Coast Guard and the installation of police cameras at more HDB blocks and multi-storey car parks.\n\nAs of 31 March 2017, the total strength of the force stands at 45,176, of which 16,0253 are full-time staff. Manpower trends in recent years are as follows:\n\nRegulars, or uniformed, full-time officers, constitute about 20% of the police's total workforce and number approximately 9,000 in strength. Basic entry requirements for police officers include normal fitness levels, good eyesight, and at least five passes in the GCE Ordinary level or a NITEC from the Institute of Technical Education, although those with lower qualifications may still be considered. Those joining the senior police officers require a basic degree from a recognised university. Alternatively, police officers from the junior ranks may also be considered for promotion into the senior ranks. Officers serving in the force as national servicemen are also regularly considered for absorption into the regular scheme. Basic training for all officers are conducted at the Home Team Academy, under the purview of the Police Training Command. It takes about six months and nine months to train a new police officer and senior police officer respectively.\n\nAs is the case with many other civil service positions in Singapore, the salaries of police officers are reviewed in accordance to market rates. Salaries are kept competitive as part of anti-corruption measures. Gross starting salaries for police officers may range from S$1,820 to S$2,480, and that of senior police officers from S$3,400 to S$4,770, depending on entry qualifications, relevant/useful work experiences and National Service.\n\nPolice officers commence their careers as Sergeants (Full GCE 'A' level or Diploma holders), while senior police officers start as Inspectors (Bachelor's degree). Reviews of an officer's performance for promotion consideration are conducted annually. Interviews conducted for promotion to certain ranks were phased out since 1995. It takes approximately five years for a police officer to be promoted to the next rank, although the system allows for accelerated promotion for outstanding officers.\n\nWhile joining the force as a career is generally considered a respectable decision in contemporary Singapore, support from the ethnic Malay community has been traditionally stronger due to less social stigma attached to the profession. Traditionally, Chinese culture has eschewed careers in uniformed positions, resulting in a force dominated by non-Chinese officers for most of the force's early history. National servicemen also contribute a higher proportion of ethnic Malays in the force. The current ethnic profile of the force continues to have a significantly higher proportion of ethnic minorities compared to the national ethnic profile, although such an outcome is related to operational demands: police resources are typically deployed with a diverse ethnic mix to decrease communication problems while attending to incidents in ethnically-diverse Singapore.\n\nCompetition in the employment market, usually heating up during economic boom times, occasionally depressed the number of police recruits as well as its existing ranks. A series of major incidents in 2008 affecting agencies of the Home Affairs Ministry has led to the ministry conducting a study which concluded that there is a shortage of officers, resulting in officers being \"overstretched, strained and over-stressed\". In the police force, it was admitted that the recruitment and retention of non-graduate police officers has been \"adversely affected by the tighter labour market\", with resignation rates increasing by 50% between 2004 and 2007. Recruitment figures, while remaining relatively stable, has been unable to \"address the higher demands placed on the Force. Various measures were thus taken in response, including an increase in starting salaries, sign-on bonuses for senior police officers, and retention bonuses of up to S$30,000 for non-graduate police officers in a bid to encourage them to stay for at least eight years, over the five years where many leave at the end of their service bonds.\n\nWhen full-time National Service (NS) was first introduced in Singapore way back in 1967, it was initially solely aimed and geared towards the building-up of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Meanwhile, in Singapore's police force, NS was not extended to that of compulsory full-time service, with police NS being only part-time, unlike that of the SAF. There was little urgency and pressure for the police force to increase its overall manpower-strength until the Laju incident of 1974, Singapore's first encounter with international terrorism, demonstrated the need for additional trained reserve-officers who could be called up at short-notice in the event of a national crisis or a major and serious public emergency. Singapore's full-time National Service policy was thus extended to the Singapore Police Force in 1975, which stemmed from the then-primary aim of guarding and protecting key and vital public installations, such as sensitive ones like power substations and petro-chemical industries, and to act as a swift-response reserve unit. Subsequent expansion of this NS scheme, along with changing security needs and requirements and the trend in outsourcing key-installation protection (such as to the various local auxiliary police forces) has expanded the role of police national servicemen to more varied functions, which may range from mainstream administration and operations (such as the role of office-based Staff Assistants (SAs)), to basic police investigation (like under the Ground Response Force (GRF) of the SPF's Land Divisions) to frontline policing (as seen in the Police Coast Guard) alongside their regular counterparts.\n\nFormed in 1946, The Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) is an important component of the Singapore Police Force, contributing more than fifty years of volunteer service to the nation.\n\nThe VSC is composed of volunteers from all walks of life in Singapore, from businessmen to blue-collar executives to even bus captains, bonded with the same aspiration to serve the nation by complementing the Singapore Police Force. They are vested with equal powers of a police officer to enforce law and order in Singapore. VSC Officers don the same police uniform and patrol the streets, participate in anti-drug operations and sometimes even high-speed sea chases.\n\nPreviously headquartered at the Eu Tong Sen Street Police Station and Toa Payoh Police Station, it relocated to the new Police Cantonment Complex in year 2000.\n\nCivilian staff in the Police Force are deployed in areas such as technology, logistics, human resource and administrative and finance services as well as investigation, planning and intelligence.\nThe civilian staff schemes falls under the general civil service schemes managed by the Public Service Division. These schemes include:\n\nThe civilization of non-core police functions have accelerated over the years in order to free up additional manpower for redeployment into Police Divisions. Other changes include the deployment of contract staff through organisations such as Ministry of Finance's VITAL.org for administrative staff and partners such as Singapore Technologies and Cyber Security Agency for technical support.\n\n\nDark blue (or more accurately Dacron blue) is the organisational colour of the Singapore Police Force, and has remained so continuously since 1969, although the first police uniforms introduced in 1856 were also in the same colour.\n\nOn 1 July 1969, dacron blue made a comeback to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, in part to coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary since its founding in 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, shoes and socks, and coded whistle lanyard in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a metal cap badge are affixed, and a black plastic name tag completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The lanyard was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% polyester 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.\n\nDerivatives of the standard blue uniform (collectively called the no.3 uniform) was adopted for specialized forces and for all officers in various occasions which calls for more formal or casual attire. The Traffic Police Department was among the few to move away from the all-blue attire, adopting a short-sleeved white tunic, dark blue breeches, a black leather Sam Browne belt, and riding boots for its officers performing mobile squad duties. A white crash helmet is worn when on the move, while a new dark blue jockey cap with chequered white and dark blue patterns around its circumference is worn when convenient while performing static duty. Members of the Vigilante Corps are also attired by a white short-sleeved top similar in design to the dark blue version for normal officers, gold-coloured buttons and badges, and a dark blue beret in place of the peak cap. Parking wardens will be issued new uniforms to combat the heat.\n\nCombat uniforms has also been adopted for specialist units such as those from the Special Operations Command and the Police Coast Guard (PCG), collectively known as the No.4 uniforms. These involve the replacement of metal buttons with sewn-on plastic ones, the avoidance of all other metallic accruements which are deemed potentially hazardous to the officer or to others and the use of long-sleeved shirts.\n\nThere was no major change to the uniform since then, except for the adoption of embroidered shoulder ranks and badges for all ranks in the 1990s. Other changes are less distinct, such as the upgrading of shoes used, the change of the belt material and belt buckle to one including the police crest, and the replacement of the peak cap with a baseball cap for NPC officers on front-line duty.\n\nIn the past, the police were using their standard issued drill boots for their daily duties; however, using of the drill boots for daily duties such as patrols and chasing after suspects proved impractical as they were severely uncomfortable, causing blisters, or worse, causing the officer to be injured. In 2012, the police trialed the Magnum Stealth Force 6.0 and 8.0, subsequently they became the standard issue for their officers. While the Special Operations Command were previously using the traditional full leather combat boot, the force also rolled out the Magnum Spider 8.1 SZ for their troopers. \n\nIn 2008 - 2009, the black engraved plastic name-tags was changed to the black epoxy coated name-tags with the Home Team badge on the left. The name-tags with a safety-pinned backing were a safety hazard when struggling with suspects, progressively, the backing name-tags were fitted with Velcro for ease of fitting, and safety. The previous black engraved plastic name-tags is still in use by the National Police Cadet Corps. All officers under the Home Team are issued with these epoxy name-tags.\n\nOn April 16, 2018, the SPF has introduced new uniforms that are more stretchable, absorb perspiration better and dry faster, and they are made of 98% of polyester and 2% of spandex. The change in uniforms are part of ongoing efforts to enhance operational effectiveness and support in the officers' duty.\n\nThese uniforms are worn only by officers from Special Operations Command, the Public Transport Security Command and Ground Response Force when they work in front-line patrol and deployments. The word “police” is embroidered above the name tag of the new uniforms and the metallic buttons will be replaced with concealed plastic buttons for more comfort when officers put on the body vests over their uniforms. Riveted buttons are fixed on the shoulders for a body worn camera to be attached.\n\nA standard rank structure is used throughout the police force, although some ranks may be unique to specific organisations. These ranks are denoted where applicable in the following list, which lists them in ascending seniority:\n\nThe rank of Corporal was abolished in 1972, but reinstated in 1976. In 1997, all ranks were shifted from the sleeves to the epaulettes, except for the Gurkha Contingent. Also in the same year, the Station Inspector rank was changed from collar pips to epaulettes with a new design similar to that of the SAF Warrant Officers, and the rank of Senior Station Inspector was introduced. In 1998, the Senior Station Inspector (2) rank was introduced, and changes were made to the SI, SSI, and SSI(2) rank designs. The rank of Lance Corporal was abolished in 2002. The 2006, the Gurkha Contingent adopted embroidered ranks as part of an overhaul of its combat dress, but are worn on the right front pocket. There was a major rank overhaul in 2016 with the removal of the ranks of CPL, SSGT, SSI and SSI(2), as well as the removal of the distinction between \"Police Officers\" and \"Senior Police Officers\" in what is now called a \"unified police scheme\".\n\nPolice officers in the various divisions are armed when conducting regular uniformed patrols and plainclothes duties. Officers from different units are issued with different weapons.\n\nThe standard layout of a regular right handed officer's duty belt / ops kit consists of the followings in a clockwise direction; \n\n\nThe five-shot .38 Taurus Model 85 with 3-inch barrel featuring a laser sight by Crimson Trace is the standard issued sidearm of the Singapore Police Force with 10 rounds of ammunition. From 2016, the CZ P-07 semi-automatic pistol will gradually replace the Taurus Model 85 revolver in front-line policing. Extendable batons were initially used by specialist units such as Security Command and Speical Operations Command, however it has since been used by officers from other frontline units, replacing the Monadnock PR-21 side-handle baton. Sabre Red pepper spray canisters are exclusively equipped to the officers of Police Coast Guard and Police Tactical Unit. A pair of handcuffs is issued to the officers as restraints.\n\nThe Taser X26 stun gun is part of the officer equipment, which provides another non-lethal means of subduing suspects. Despite some safety concerns due to incidents experienced by foreign police forces, the weapon was deemed suitable for use by trained personnel, and was rolled out across other NPCs.\n\nHeckler & Koch USP pistols are known to be used by the Special Operations Command, Police Tactical Unit, Criminal Investigation Department and Security Command. Officers of Police Coast Guard's Special Task Squadron are issued with Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol and Special Tactics and Rescue (STAR) acquired the Swiss-made Sphinx 3000 pistol, replacing the previous used Glock pistols.\n\nAddition to the use of the handguns, Singapore Police Force also uses the Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun and the Remington 870 shotgun while specialized weapons are issued to the STAR and KINS units, such as the Sphinx 3000, FN SCAR, M4S1, M16S1, SIG-522, G22, SAR-21 rifles, MATADOR anti-armor weapon system and a variegated arsenal of sniper rifles.\n\nThe primary communication tool carried by each officer is through a common digital radio set used by Home Team organizations. In the first half of the 21st century, this was provided by Matra Nortel Communications/EADS based on TETRAPOL technology. In 2013, a contract was awarded to Motorola Communications for a replacement communication network (MCN2) using TETRA technology (Motorola Dimetra) with the first units being deployed in 2015. Whereas for secondary communication, officers are given the option to utilise the Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) or their personal issued Personal Digital Assistant, also known as Cubicon 2 in which real time information can be communicated between the officer and command center or ops room.\n\nStrict enforcement of anti-arm laws which are in existence in Singapore since 1823 has resulted in a relatively disarmed society, where firearms-related crimes are rare. It is therefore not an operational requirement for police officers to wear bullet resistant vests when conducting normal policing duties. However, vests, helmets, and shields are carried in police vehicles and stocked in police establishments and can be rapidly utilize should the situation require it. In addition, chemical protection equipment such as suit, gloves, boots and NBC masks etc. are readily available to be drawn from the maintenance stores. Special units such as the KINS unit are known for utilising the skeletal battle order vest as a direct alternative to the ops kit belt for as they are issued with firearm magazines while on duty. From 2004, new multi-purpose vests were introduced which offer officers protection against most handgun fire, knife thrusts, as well as doubling up as a buoyancy vest should officers fall into deep water.\n\nLand division officers typically respond to calls in rapid-deployment vehicles known as the Fast Response Car (FRC). The SPF have been staunch users of Japanese-made saloon cars since the 1980s for patrol duties, with the mainstay models in use being the various generations of the Mitsubishi Lancers, Mazda 323s and Toyota Corollas. At the turn of the century they have also included Nissan Sunnys, Subaru Impreza 1.6 TS sedans (not to be confused with the Subaru Impreza WRX used by the Traffic Police) in 2012 the traffic police have included the Volvo S80 T5.\n\nAll FRCs carry a large array of equipment to allow officers to conduct normal policing duties and basic investigative work which officers are expected to perform with the implementation of the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) system. A typical FRC vehicle may therefore stock equipment for the force-opening of locked doors, conducting roadblocks, fingerprint collection, and the provision of first aid. On top of these, chemical agent protection equipment, police shields and bulletproof vests are also carried for the officer's protection.\n\nIn 2002, the Enhanced Patrol Vehicle Project was unveiled at the SPF's annual work-plan seminar to highlight the need for off-road capability. The Volvo V70 AWD XC, Mitsubishi Space Wagon and Mitsubishi Chariot underwent evaluation in various NPCs. Eventually, all NPCs were to have at least three of such vehicles, but the project was met with skepticism by some of the public, stating that the police need not use such \"luxurious vehicles\" for police patrols. In 2004, the new Fast Response Vehicle (FRV) was introduced, consisting of cheaper modified Toyota Hi-Lux sport utility vehicles. These vehicles utilise diesel-power which provide greater ability to endure high usage on the roads over extensive periods of time. Their bigger storage space also allows for easier storage and retrieval of equipment.\n\nIn 2009, the SPF had introduced large truck-sized Forward Command Vehicles in which they were utilised for command and control during the simulated terrorist attacks in Singapore as part of Exercise Northstar VII.\n\nOther vehicles typically used in NPCs include the scooters and vans. Bicycles, although currently less seen, are still used by land division officers belonging to the Community Policing Unit (CPU) occasionally, particularly when conducting routine patrols in large, sprawling private housing estates. At NDP 2007, the Singapore Police Force unveiled a Tenix S600 APC (Armored Personnel Carrier) had been purchased for its operations for the Special Operations Command and in NDP 2015, the Achleitner HMV Survivor and the Gurkha MPV by Terradyne Armored Vehicles Inc was unveiled.\n\nIn 2017, the SPF had introduced new Division Command Vehicles with greater mobility designed to enhance command, control and coordination, as well as new unmanned aerial vehicles with red and blue siren lights, a searchlight, a high-definition camera and an audio warning system. The UAVs are controlled by two-man teams (consisting of a pilot and a safety officer) and are designed to conduct search and rescue operations, attending public order incidents, traffic management, hostage situations and crowd monitoring.\n\n\"For weaponry, equipment and vehicles of the various specialist forces, please see their respective pages for details.\"\n\nIn Singapore, auxiliary police officers are security police appointed under Section 92(1) or (2) of the Police Force Act 2004 and are vested with all the power, protection and immunity of a Police Officer of corresponding rank and are licensed to carry firearms when carrying out their duties.\n\nThese armed auxiliary police officers (APO) are full-time paid employees of their respective companies, and are not directly affiliated to the Singapore Police Force. They are appointed as auxiliary police officers only after attending and passing a residential course, the curriculum of which is set by the Security Industry Regulatory Dept. of the Singapore Police Force. Each APO is issued with a warrant card signed by the Commissioner Of Police of the Singapore Police Force.\n\n\nThere were also other auxiliary police forces in Singapore in the early years such as PSA Police, and Bukom Auxiliary Police. These APF were granted licences and powers under the Police Force Act to operate only in restricted geographical areas e.g. in the ports or airports or Pulau Bukom Island.\n\nThe Singapore Police Force (SPF) established the Security Industry Regulatory Department in 2004 to regulate the security industry.\n\nMore recently, the shortage of SPF officers has caused the role of auxiliary police forces to expand to enforcement, attending to road related incidents such as vehicle collision scenes and conducting patrol duties, even working alongside the Singapore Police Force themselves.\n\n\n\n\nBooks\n\nNovels\n\nPeriodicals\n\nTelevision programs\n\nMovies\n\n\n"}

The vertical mobility can be the change in social status between parents and children, which is intergenerational movement; as well as the change over the course of a lifetime, which is intragenerational movement. After World War II, Japan’s economy grew rapidly and stably. Japan achieved the high employment rate among developed countries as well as established a relatively equal class structure due to the rapid economy growth as well as its life-time employment system, progressive tax policies, and social security policies. Not only did the huge middle class establish the image of Japan’s “affluent society”, but also maintained the long-term stability of the running Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, and verified the proposition that industrialization narrows down the social stratification. In the early 1970s, Japan even created the myth of “100 million all in the middle class” (“ichi oku sochuryu”), showing that social satisfaction reached a high level and the middle class awareness maintained long-term stability.\n\nOne factor that contributed to social mobility in Japan was the rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1985 with Japan’s industrial structure changes. However, after the bubble economy burst in 1990, Japan entered a period of development stagnation known as \"The Lost Decade.\" Therefore, the occupational prestige, education levels, and assets among different social classes still existed and were not eliminated by industrialization. The trend of class stratification first appeared in the 1980s, and the main manifestations included the stagnation of equalized distribution, the fixation of employment patterns, and the narrowing gap between occupations. Therefore, wages and salaries were no longer the main variables in the economic stratification; instead, the difference in household assets became increasingly important in the economic stratification. During the bubble economy in the late 1980s, the huge wealth brought by the substantial appreciation of the Japanese yen was invested in stocks, securities, and real estate. The difference between financial assets and land prices rapidly expanded. Assets replaced wage income and became the determining factor of people’s economic status and consumption patterns. In 1980, Murakami Yasusuke put forward the concept of \"The Age of New Middle Mass Politics\", where the middle class was defined as \"middle level of standard of living\", \"conservative ideology\", and a sign of social stability. However, middle class was largely influenced and destabilized by the bubble economy burst in 1990, causing the instability of the whole society.\n\nFurthermore, the implementation of public policies including employment policies, tax policies, and social security policies also contributed to a relatively equal class structure in Japanese society. First, in the 1960s, Japan's total unemployment rate remained at around 1% and raised to 1.3% after 1973. During this period, due to the drastic changes in the industrial structure, industries and enterprises kept upgrading and the unemployment during this period mainly consisted of structural unemployment. The employment measures were mainly aimed at consolidating the life-time employment system, protecting the disadvantaged groups, and improving the labor market. Second, Japan's progressive tax system also resulted in the redistribution effect of personal income tax. The Japanese tax system was characterized by a high tax threshold and a steep increase in tax progressivity, creating high tax rate for high-income classes and low tax rate for low-income classes. Lastly, Japan's social security system also contributed to income redistribution effect. In 1961, Japan had established a comprehensive social security system - \"national health insurance and pension schemes\", when all Japanese people were finally covered. The most significant effect of redistribution under the social insurance schemes is the subsistence guarantee of low-income and disable people.\n"}

It is the largest section of the Italian Alpine Club.\n\nSAT was founded in Madonna di Campiglio on September 2, 1872 under the name of Alpine Society of Trentino. The founding members intended to promote the knowledge of the Trentino mountains, the tourist development of the valleys and the Italianity of Trentino. The means to pursue these goals were: the construction of huts, the creation of paths, the financing of hoteliers, the organization of mountain guides, climbing of peaks and the publication of geographic and mountaineering writings.\n\nFirst president was Prospero Marchetti (Bolbeno 1822 - Arch 1884), vice president Nepomuceno Bolognini (Pinzolo , 24 March 1823 - Milan, 18 July 1900). The members were summoned twice a year in a spring meeting and in at summer <nowiki>\"</nowiki>\"The congresses\"<nowiki>\"</nowiki> during which the mountaineering, geographic, naturalistic and historical reports were presented and the progress of the association was measured. The first congress took place in Madonna di Campiglioin 1872, in 1994 it was celebrated in Trento.\n\nIt should be noted that the SAT was not a group of mountaineers and hikers, but of a group of bourgeois irredentists who wanted to implement \"cultural appropriation and the acquisition of material possession of the homeland\". In fact, in 1874 the society was dissolved by the Austrian authorities for filo-Italian activities. Then, in 1877, it was renamed to Società degli Alpinisti Tridentini (\"Tridentini mountaineering company\").\n\nThe nationalist character of the SAT led to the so-called refuge war, a clash in the mountain toponomastics, between the unaltered flags hidden on the peaks, and the constructions of \"double\" shelters built alongside each other. For example, during the inauguration of the Quintino Sella hut in 1906, the participants could observe the yard of the German competitor Rifugio Tuckett. But shortly afterwards the great war broke out and the SAT was dissolved again. Many of its militants were interned or forced to confine, others took refuge in Italy.\n\nIn 1920 SAT became a section of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), maintaining autonomy. On January 7, 1921, the working subsection of SOSAT, a working group climber at the initiative of Nino Peterlongo, was formed, which in 1919 in Trento had founded a section of the Unione operai escursionisti italiani (\"Union of Workers Italian Walkers\").\n\nIn 2012 SAT had over 27,000 members, divided into 82 sections and 10 groups. It has 34 shelters, 12 bivouacs and various support points and social huts, cares for the signage and maintenance of over 6,000 km of trails; Its alpine relief, founded in 1952, has 800 volunteers divided into 37 stations spread across the provincial territory with a cyanophilic and speleological unit.\n\nThe headquarters of the association is located in Trento in the palace Saracini-Cresseri (XVI century), which houses; The SAT museum, The historical archive, The SAT mountain library, The SAT section of Trento, The SUSAT (University Section), The SAT Chorus, The Provincial College of the Alpine Guides, The SAT Rock Cluster and the Giorgio Graffer Mountaineering and Mountaineering School.\n\nSAT operates voluntarily in the Dolomites and the mountains of Trentino.\n"}

Liszt for the book's first edition in 1997).\n\nThe authors define the term \"slut\" as \"a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that sex is nice and pleasure is good for you.\" The term is reclaimed from its usual use as a pejorative and as a simple label for a promiscuous person. Instead, it is used to signify a person who is accepting of their enjoyment of sex and the pleasure of physical intimacy with others, and chooses to engage and accept these in an ethical and open way—rather than as cheating.\n\n\"The Ethical Slut\" discusses how to live an active life with multiple concurrent sexual relationships in a fair and honest way. Discussion topics include how to deal with the practical difficulties and opportunities in finding and keeping partners, maintaining relationships with others, and strategies for personal growth.\n\nIt contains chapters discussing how consensual non-monogamy is handled in different subcultures such as the gay and lesbian communities, information on handling scheduling, jealousy, communication, conflict in relationships, and etiquette for group sexual encounters.\n\nAn article in the January 31, 2007, issue of the \"East Bay Express\" reports that Moses Ma will be producing a movie adaptation of \"The Ethical Slut\". As of 2014, that project had not come to fruition.\n\nIn 2013, Ben Fritz (producer/director) raised funding privately and via Kickstarter to create an episodic web series inspired by the book with input from Easton and Hardy. By 2014, three seasons of \"The Ethical Slut,\" were released on YouTube despite struggles for funding during the second and third seasons. There are 38 episodes, ranging between 4 and 9 minutes. The series follows two female friends as they decide to explore open relationships with the aid of the helpful handbook, \"The Ethical Slut\".\n\nPlaywright John Sable's \"Multiple O\", a play adaptation of \"The Ethical Slut\", opened on May 2, 2008, at the Broom Street Theater.\n\nCo-author Dossie Easton reported in May 2007 that Easton and Liszt were working on a second edition of the book, including more communication exercises and information about polyamory communities on the Internet. It was published in March 2009 and is called \"The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships & Other Adventures\".\nA third edition was released in August 2017 entitled \"The Ethical Slut, Third Edition: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Freedoms in Sex and Love\".\n\nThe third edition has been revised to include interviews with poly millennials (young people who have grown up without the prejudices their elders encountered regarding gender, orientation, sexuality, and relationships), tributes to poly pioneers, and new sidebars on topics such as asexuality, sex workers, and ways polys can connect and thrive. The authors also include new content addressing nontraditional relationships beyond the polyamorous paradigm of \"more than two\": couples who don't live together, couples who don't have sex with each other, nonparallel arrangements, couples with widely divergent sex styles, power disparities, and cross-orientation relationships, while utilizing non-binary gender language and new terms that have come into common usage since the last edition.\n\nThe book has been translated and published in French in April 2013 under the title \"La Salope éthique: Guide pratique pour des relations libres sereines\" at Tabou Éditions. It was also translated in 2013 into Spanish under the name \"Ética promiscua\" at Editorial Melusina. In January 2014 an Italian translation was published by Odoya under the title \"La zoccola etica. Guida al poliamore, alle relazioni aperte e altre avventure\". In May 2014 the German translation at mvg Verlag was published under the title \"Schlampen mit Moral.

As of 2015, the Vietnamese community in Bulgaria numbers 2,600, including Bulgarian residents and/or citizens. They mainly live in the capital Sofia, but also in Plovdiv, Dimitrovgrad and Varna .\nMany Vietnamese people also live in Kozloduy.\n\nThe Vietnamese diaspora in Bulgaria dates to the 1960s. In 1950, Bulgaria and Vietnam had established diplomatic relations and signed a mutual agreement to co-operate in cultural and educational affairs. As a result, the first Vietnamese students arrived in Bulgaria in 1960. The main subjects that the Vietnamese came to study were agriculture, economics, tourism, humanities, arts, medicine and construction.\n\nAccording to an international agreement of 1980, Bulgaria, along with other Comecon members such as East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, accepted Vietnamese guest workers in the country as a relatively cheaper manual labour workforce. According to one estimate, over 35,000 Vietnamese people have worked in Bulgaria between 1980 and 1991, and 5,000 Vietnamese students have completed their higher education in various Bulgarian universities. Plattenbauten (панелка; \"panelka\") and mobile home hostels were built in 1984 in the Krasna polyana municipality of Sofia to accommodate the Vietnamese; by 1990, the area had acquired the nickname \"Little Saigon\". The hostels are still known as \"the Vietnamese hostels\" today, although their demolition has been considered by the Capital Municipality as they have since decayed into an unregulated Roma-inhabited slum.\n\nThe idea was to compensate Bulgaria's lack of sufficient manual workforce and at the same time to relieve Vietnam of some of its growing population, with the trained workers potentially coming back. In practice, however, this co-operation was subject to much corruption in Vietnam, with many members of its richest class of merchants paying bribes equivalent to around €1,000 (in 1985) to be sent to Bulgaria, where they expanded their speculative business, engaging in black market trade, production of counterfeit goods such as jeans, etc. As a consequence, shortly after the democratic changes of 1989, Bulgaria arranged the accelerated return of most of the Vietnamese workers to Vietnam, effective in 1991.\n\nOf the thousands of Vietnamese, all but the students and those who had married in Bulgaria left. Since 1991, Bulgaria has been a target country for economic immigrants from Vietnam, as the average wages remained higher despite the country's difficulties in the 1990s. Along with the Chinese, Koreans, Arabs and other immigrants, the Vietnamese have established a presence among the vendors in Sofia's well-known and frequented bazaar Iliyantsi. The number of Vietnamese immigrants is constantly rising, although they are yet to feature more prominently in Bulgaria's social life and media.\n\nIn 2008, it was widely reported and discussed that Bulgaria, now a European Union member, is again looking to employ Vietnamese workers, as unemployment in the country has been largely solved as an issue (with unemployment rates comparable to those in France or Belgium and lower than in Spain or Germany). and on the contrary, there is a lack of workers in the rapidly developing building and tourism branches in particular. Vietnamese would be offered jobs on contract terms with temporary residence in Bulgaria.\n\n\n"}

Hurwitz, M.D., was a Virginia based pain management physician who was prosecuted and convicted by the United States Government in 2004 for excessively prescribing addictive opioid pain medication to patients, some of whom subsequently abused and redistributed their medications on the black market. Before his conviction, Hurwitz had had a series of running battles with the Virginia Board of Medicine which, in 2003 found fault with some of his prescriptions but also held that all were written \"in good faith\".\n\nWilliam E. Hurwitz is a graduate of Columbia College. He then spent a period at the Harvard University School of Education before attending Stanford University's Medical School. While at Stanford he also earned a Masters in Sociology. He served as a staff physician in Brazil with the Peace Corps upon completing his medical degree.\n\nIn 2004, Hurwitz was convicted of over 50 counts of distribution of narcotics originally sentenced to four 25-year sentences and forty-six 15-year sentences, all of which were to be served concurrently, and was fined $2 million (U.S.). During the prosecution of the first case, all of Hurwitz's property was seized.\n\nHurwitz maintains that he was duped by his patients, and that the enforcement tactics being applied in the War on Drugs unfairly target law-abiding doctors, leading to a situation where doctors must choose between providing compassionate care and accepting personal liability for what their patients do with prescribed medications.\n\nHis case has potentially serious ramifications among all practitioners of pain medicine, and is considered by many to be a drastic example of the overreach of anti-drug law enforcement efforts.\n\nHis conviction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on August 22, 2006, due to errors by the trial judge that essentially prevented the jury from considering Hurwitz's defense—that he was prescribing the medication in good faith as part of the regular practice of medicine. His re-trial began on March 26, 2007 in federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Hurwitz's entire defense team—including four expert witnesses and every attorney—worked on the matter \"pro bono\", i.e. for free.\n\nOn April 27, 2007 jurors found William E. Hurwitz guilty of 16 counts of drug trafficking and determined that he prescribed massive quantities of medicine to patients in chronic pain. The 12-member jury acquitted Hurwitz on 17 other trafficking counts. District Judge Leonie Brinkema dismissed the remaining 12 counts. His two lead trial attorneys for the second trial were Lawrence Robbins and Richard Sauber, of Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck & Untereiner, and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, respectively.\n\nOn July 13, 2007 Judge Brinkema sentenced Hurwitz to four years and nine months. The judge said that most of Hurwitz's practice was legitimate medicine that saved patients' lives and that medical literature increasingly supports his theories on the propriety of massive drug doses to treat patients in chronic pain. \"An increasing body of respectable medical literature and expertise supports those types of high-dosage, opioid medications,\" the judge said. \n\nThe judge added that Hurwitz had undermined his own cause by ignoring that some patients were clearly drug dealers and Hurwitz admitted before sentencing that he had deceived himself about some patients who in retrospect were clearly criminals. \n\nSince Hurwitz has already spent over 2-1/2 years in prison his lawyers believe he will be eligible for release in about 18 months.\n\n"}

{"id": "16084900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16084900", "title": "Women in Turkmenistan", "text": "Women in Turkmenistan\n\nThe role of women in Turkmenistan has never conformed to Western stereotypes about Muslim women. Although a division of labor exists and women usually are not visible actors in political affairs outside the home, Turkmen women have never worn a veil similar to that of the women of some of its neighboring countries. As Turkmenistan is a tribal nation, customs regarding women can vary within the country: for example, women in the eastern part of the country are permitted to drink some alcohol whereas women who live in the central portion of the country, particularly those of the Tekke tribe, are not permitted to imbibe alcohol. Most women possess a host of highly specialized skills and crafts, especially those connected with the household and its maintenance. During the Soviet period, women assumed responsibility for the observance of some Muslim rites to protect their husbands' careers. Many women entered the work force out of economic necessity, a factor that disrupted some traditional family practices and increased the incidence of divorce. At the same time, educated urban women entered professional services and careers.\n\nTurkmenistan is a country in Central Asia. Throughout the centuries, the territory of present-day Turkmenistan has been subjected to numerous civilizations, such as Persian empires, the conquest of Alexander the Great, Muslims, Mongols, Turkic peoples, and Russians. Throughout most of the 20th century it was part of the Soviet Union, until its fall in 1991. As with other former Soviet states, in the 1990s the economy collapsed and the country experienced social problems. Today, Turkmenistan is about half urban and half rural; its population is largely Muslim (89%), but there is also a significant Eastern Orthodox minority. The total fertility rate is 2.09 children born/woman (2015 est.).\n\nCooking is the main field of work for women in an independent area. Some households have a small room for making food and keeping utensils. Neighbors or relatives sometimes arrive unasked to assist in housework, or they may bring their own household tasks to work on together and socialize. Food preparation is done in the open air. Tasks, such as smoking meat and popping corn, are done by men and often turn into a social opportunity.\n\nWomen are expected to maintain a distance in regards to gender. Men and women might sit and eat in one place, but they are segregated during social occasions. Some women carry on the practice of wearing a yaşmak,head scarf, in the initial year after they are wed. The wife clenches the corner of her scarf in her teeth to show a significant barrier toward the male guests and to show respect to her parents-in-law. The scarf also stops her from communicating. The wife may stop covering her head with a yaşmak after a year of her wedding, after the birth of her first born,or by a decision within the family.\n\nThe total population of Turkmenistan constitutes the figure of 5,171,943 (July 2014 est.), with a total sex ratio among the total population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2014 est.).\n\nTurkmens are an attention-grabbing people, and this is especially true of the women. Women are garbed in ankle-length garments of silk or velvet, which are commonly a mix of bright oranges, purples, yellows, blues, and greens. The necklines are embellished with elaborate gold-thread needlework that drops down, decorating the neckline right to the navel. Richly decorated head wear, jewelry and embroidery accents are a part of their routine.\n\nEven in the present, ketene, a homespun silk, manufacturing persists largely as a cottage skill. These works, like other handmade artistries, are enormously painstaking and consume a lot of hard work.\n\nThe women of Turkmenistan are highly talented and hardworking, thus becoming the makers of ketene. It helps to make the fine-looking clothes for the Turkmen women at distinctive events. The embroidery on the garments reveal various patterns that are exclusively known as a family hallmark, distinguishing the family of its maker.\n\nSkilled Turkmen women use antique weaving looms known as tara, which were adopted in the ancient times. These succeed in high eminence, with a startling amount of precision on embellished fabrics.\n\nThe locals have been weaving beautiful patterns for hundreds of years. The garments prepared from keteni have been worn by both men and women. Since men's style was restricted mostly to shirts, ladies gathered a whole apparel of costumes and head scarves. The attractive costumes prepared from keteni still persist as a customary bridal dress (Central Asia Cultures).\n\nThe element that has transformed the role of women from homemaker to basic breadwinner of the family is a revolution that Turkmen civilization has gone through. This was the aftermath of a plan followed by the government, which caused a change in nationwide values and social principles. After splitting from the Soviet Union, several initiatives, organizations and establishments became insolvent in Turkmenistan which caused a severe upsurge in joblessness.\n\nMen, being the main providers of the family, imported items of use and food to sell in the local market. However, this was discouraged by the border patrol agents and police officers. This is when the women became the earners. However, in the beginning of the 90s, thanks to the social approach, the officers did not confront, examine or offend women. Subsequently, women became involved in the most accepted kind of private enterprise – trading in products from overseas.\n\nSince men were left with no opportunity to find employment in their own country, many men left the country in the hunt of work. They mainly traveled to Turkey, Russia, and United Arab Emirates. This also led the nation toward drug addiction, which flourished in the 90s, and caused a substantial reduction in the male population of the country able to provide for their families. These circumstances caused a severe gender disparity, which created a challenge for women to have a family. Some settled to live as the second or third spouses of prosperous men or to bear children outside of marriage.\n\nThe Gender Empowerment Measure reveals the amount to which Turkmen women play an energetic role in the financial and governmental domain. It emphasizes women’s financial participation and managerial ability, determining the gender inequalities in the political commercial scopes of activity.\n"}
