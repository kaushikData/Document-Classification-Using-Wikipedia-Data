Influenced by the new romantic ideas, they rejected the cultural Spanish heritage of the country. They did not acknowledge any national roots in the indigenous peoples or the period of European colonization, focusing instead on the Revolution as the birth of the country, as it gave them freedom, the possibility of behave as free people. They considered themselves \"sons of the May Revolution\", they were born shortly after it, and wrote some of the earliest Argentine literary works.\n\nThe group established a literary hall in 1837 in Buenos Aires, hence the name. This \"Salón Literario\" closed six months after it was created because of the reiterated warnings from the government. Initially, they claimed to be neutral in the Argentine Civil Wars, they wrote works biased against the federal governor Juan Manuel de Rosas (such as \"El Matadero\" by Esteban Echeverría or \"Facundo\" by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento) because Rosas were the Buenos Aires government on that time, but they were also against the former Unitarian governments, with whom they didn't agree in their absolutist manners that were considered by them as a mere restoration of the manners of the Spanish colony. Their efforts to install a full democratic Republic and guarantees of the civil rights by means of a peaceful \"propaganda\" were vains and shortly after that they ended up exiled or assassinated. After Rosas was overthrown in 1852, their writings were inspirers of the first Argentine Constitution in 1853, and their persons promoters of the \"Organización Nacional\", the articulation and organization of the political divisions, infrastructure and institutions of the country, that in its final form didn't was federal nor unitarian but a balance of both.\n\nThey were called \"unitarians\" in a loose sense and by Rosas \"propaganda\".\n\nSome notable members of this generation were Esteban Echeverría, Juan Bautista Alberdi, Juan María Gutiérrez, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento who was president between 1868 and 1874, Miguel Cané (senior), Bartolomé Mitre, Andrés Lamas, Antonio Somellera, Vicente Fidel López, Carlos Tejedor, Juan Bautista Peña, Florencio Varela, Juan Cruz Varela, José Mármol, José Rivera Indarte (Buenos Aires), Quiroga Rosas, Antonino Aberastain, Santiago Cortínez (San Juan), Benjamín Villafañe, Félix Frías (Tucumán), Francisco Álvarez, Paulino Paz, Enrique Rodríguez, Avelino Ferreyra, Ramón Ferreyra (Córdoba), Juan Thompson (Corrientes).\n\n"}

He regularly published a journal by the name of Sarfaroosh and remained engaged in the freedom movement against the British throughout his life. With his leftist leanings, he and other \"comrades\" set up a youth organisation called Nawajan Bharat Sabha. When the British banned Nawajan Baharat Sabha, he was elected head of the Socialist Party. Abdur Rahim Popalzai II played a leading role in the events which lead up to the Qissa Khwani massacre and was sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the uprising. Abdur Rahim Popalzai [II] borrowed his anti-imperialist ideology from Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi and Maulana Hussain Ahmed Madani In 1939, Abdur Rahim Popalzai II protested in Bannu against the British bombing Waziristan, for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment.\n\nAll his five elder brothers died young. Thus Abdul Rahim remained the elder living son of Abdul Hakim According to their family tradition, Abdul Hakim taught his son at home till 1908. Abdul Rahim learned from his father meaning and virtues of simplicity kindness, asceticism, abstinence and mysticism. With completion of his basic study, Abdul Hakim sent him for further study to Rampur, Delhi, and later on to the religious school of Deoband where he became student of Hazrat Sheikh-ul-Hind Maulana Mahmud-uI-Hassan.

As such, they elect a special representative to the Croatian Parliament, shared with members of four other national minorities.\n\nIn the 2011 Croatian census, there were 17,513 Albanians living in Croatia, 0.41% of total population. The largest religious groups among the Albanians were Muslims (9,594 or 54.8% of them) and Catholics (7,109 or 40.6% of them).\n\nIn the 1712/14 census done in Lika and Krbava among Vlach population, and other documents, many surnames with Albanian and Arbanasi word roots were recorded, such as those with suffixes \"-aj\" (e.g. Bulaja, Mataija, Šolaja, Saraja, Suknajić, Rapajić), \"-ez\" (Kokez, Kekez, Ivez, Malez etc.), and others (Šimleša, Šimrak, Šinđo/a/n, Šintić, Kalember, Flego, Macura, Cecić, Kekić, Zotović etc.).\n\nAlbanians came to Croatia in various historical periods. In the Middle Ages they lived in coastal cities and some were assimilated with Vlachs, in the 17th and 18th century the Arbanasi people settled the area around Zadar, and in modern time they came as seasonal workers, war refugees or sportspeople. Many people in Croatia descended from earlier waves of Albanian migration bear surnames of linguistically Albanian origin, but do not speak the language and are not considered to be Albanians.\n\nIn the Middle Ages there was a large Albanian community in Ragusa (today's Dubrovnik). In a document dating from 1285 from there, the sentence Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca (\"I heard a calling voice from the mountains in [[Albanian language\") is handed down. This is the oldest written record of the [[Albanian language]] per se.\n\nSome of them came to Croatian lands at the time of Venetian rule because in parts of [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]] were under the rule of the Venetian Republic. Thus through the internal migration, the Albanian families also migrated, of which a large number was croatianized over the centuries to come. Internal migration has been of economic nature.\n\nAnother period is the time of liberation wars against the [[Ottomans]] when Christian [[Albanians|Albanian]] families migrated to the liberated territories of [[Croatia]].\n\nAt the time of [[Yugoslavia]], [[Albanians]] migrated to [[Croatia]] for economic and political reasons, especially after 1945. [[Albanians|Albanian]] migrants were mainly from [[Kosovo]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].\n\nTraditionally, Croatian [[Albanians]] have been involved with jewelery, filigree, bakery and restaurant management, such as bakeries and confectioners.\n\nDuring the [[Croatian War for Independence]], according to the Association of Volunteers of the Homeland War, Croatia has protected 2,579 Albanian volunteers in 1991, of whom 86 were killed, 37 were missing and more than 500 were injured. Among them were generals ([[Rahim Ademi]] and [[Agim Çeku]]) and some famous soldiers, out of which 270 officers.\n\nThe [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] (Albanian also Arbëreshët e Zarës \"Albanians of Zadar\") are a small population group in [[Croatia]] still existing today. They are ethnically Catholic [[Albanians]] who fled the [[Ottomans]] between 1726 and 1733 in the Croatian coastal country, where they are still present today. In the city of [[Zadar]] they founded their own named after them district, which persists to this day. The Arbanasi traditionally speak a different dialect of Albanian.\n\nThe original Albanian inhabitants of Catholic faith Peroj (Albanian Përrua) in [[Pula]], who fled from the [[Ottomans]] in 1657, have given up their Albanian nationality.\n\nThe 2011 census shows that at that time 17,513 Albanians lived in Croatia. This corresponds to 0.41% of the population. In 2001, the proportion of 15,082 persons had only 0.34%. \n\nOf these, 9,594 (54.8%) are Muslims and 7,109 (40.6%) are Catholics. 17 belong to other Christian denominations and the remaining 793 (4.5%) are partly atheists, partly agnostics, give no indication with respect to religion or belong to other religions. \n\nAlbanians are concentrated in [[Istria]] (2,393), [[Dalmatia]] (1,025), [[Zadar]] (908) and in the north of the Croatian coast (2,410) as well as in the capital [[Zagreb]] (4,292).

Some courts have weighed freedom of speech against the public safety interest, and upheld such laws. For example, the Georgia Supreme Court found the law constitutional on the grounds that the wearing of the mask was an act of intimidation and a threat of violence, which is not protected speech. That law has exceptions for holiday celebrations, theatre performances, and occupational safety; the ruling makes it unclear if someone is violating the law if they wear a mask without the intent to threaten violence. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a New York law on the ground that wearing a Ku Klux Klan mask did not convey a protected message beyond that conveyed by wearing a hood and robe. Other courts have struck down anti-mask laws. For example, Tennesee and Florida state laws have been invalidated on the grounds that they were unconstitutionally broad. An ordinance in Goshen, Indiana, was struck down based on First Amendment doctrine that specifically protects anonymous speech and anonymous association, especially for unpopular groups like the KKK.\n\n\nThe present table provides a non-exhaustive overview comparing legal restrictions of face coverings in European states. The 2010 French ban on face covering is widely regarded as the most strict, prohibiting face coverings in almost all situations in public places, as opposed to limited restrictions in countries such as Denmark that only outlaws such practices in the context of public assemblies such as demonstrations.\n\nA Belgian law adopted in June 2011 prohibits appearing in public \"with a face masked or hidden, in whole or in part, in such a way as to be unidentifiable\". Violations can result in fines and up to seven days in jail. On 11 July 2017 the ban in Belgium was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after having been challenged by two Muslim women who claimed their rights had been infringed.\n\n\n\n\nIn Italy, a law issued in 1975 strictly forbids wearing of any attire that could hide the face of a person. Penalties (fines and imprisonment) are provided for such behaviour. The original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a \"justified cause\", which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others –including local governments– disagree and claim religion is not a \"justified cause\" in this context.\n\nIn Latvia, a law issued in 2016 to ban niqab and burqa in entire country was passed by Latvian parliament.\n\nIn the Netherlands, a first attempt towards a partial prohibition on face covering was made from 2012 to 2015, but the bill was struck down. A new attempt was made in the years after when a new bill was submitted on 27 November 2015. Eventually a limited anti-mask law was passed on 26 June 2018. The law is called \"Instelling van een gedeeltelijk verbod op het dragen van gezichtsbedekkende kleding in het onderwijs, het openbaar vervoer, overheidsgebouwen en de zorg (Wet gedeeltelijk verbod gezichtsbedekkende kleding)\" (\"Introduction of a partial ban on the wearing of face-covering clothing in education, public transport, governmental buildings and healthcare (Partial Face-Covering Clothing Ban Act)\"). It is illegal to wear clothing which covers the entire face, or covered up to the point where only the eyes are uncovered, or renders the face unrecognisable, on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions. Frequently cited examples are a full face helmet, a balaclava, a burqa or a niqāb.

Exempted from the prohibition are participants in theatre, masquerade or similar. In accordance with § 30 of the same law; violation is punishable by a fine or up to three months imprisonment.\n\nAccording to the Law № 54-ФЗ\n\nAccording to the November 2013 \"Citizens' Security Law\" (), demonstration protesters who cover their faces may be fined up to €30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of the dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the \"Sabre Dance\", which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and tempo of a song.\n\nAssyrian folk dances belong to five metric groups: (10 dances), (6 dances), (13 dances), (1 dance), (1 dance). The tempo would usually range from slow (70 Beats Per Minute) to very fast (140 beats).\n\nAll Assyrians dances, with the exception of the \"Sabre Dance\", are done in a connected circle. Most Assyrian line dances are itinerant dances and move laterally. In an open floor space, the lines assume open circular shapes where they tend to curve and acquire spiral shapes as determined by floor space availability.\n\nThere are only five ways of moving the body; \"Step, leap, run, hop\" and \"jump\". The legs are also used to stamp, stomp and kick. The arms are used predominantly and they'd usually move independently of the legs. Arm gestures include bouncing, swinging forward and back, moving side-to-side, lifting above the head and clapping.\n\nIn many dances, the torso, along with the shoulders and arms, bounce up and down rhythmically. Stomps and stamps are also executed in Assyrian folk dances. Knee bends, deep squats and leg extensions are a regular occurrence in Assyrian dance.\n\nThe connections include, hand-to-hand, hand to shoulder, and hand to hip, with hand-to-hand being the most popular. The hand-to-hand type has three connections; The \"W\", the \"V\" and the \"T\". The \"W\" arm hold is the most common where the arms are raised into the \"W\" position (or, at least, it appears to look like the letter W). The \"T\" dance is where hands are placed on other participants's shoulders.

The name comes from the form of the party, which often involves closing an entire city block to vehicle traffic. Many times, there will be a celebration in the form of playing music and dance and activities like pony rides, inflatable slides, popcorn machines and barbecues.\n\nAs a form of activism street parties are festive and/or artistic efforts to reclaim roadways as public space by large groups of people. They were made known in Western Europe and North America by the actions of Reclaim the Streets, a widespread \"dis-organization\" dedicated to reclaiming public space from automobiles and consumerism.\n\nPoland Orange Alternative staged festive protests to break the Communist government's monopoly on public life.\n\nIn the UK, street parties are mainly known as private residents' events and have a special cultural meaning. They have historically been held to commemorate major national events, such as VE Day or the Queen's jubilees, with bunting dressing the street, and children playing in the street. An estimated 10 million people took part in street parties in 1977 for the Queen's Silver Jubilee.\n\nThe tradition seems to have begun mainly in England and Wales after World War I as residents' own \"peace teas\" to celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\nThe tradition was boosted for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011 with about 1 million people joining in street parties. For the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 about 2 million took part.\n\nNow street parties are held annually and at any time for residents to meet their neighbours in a traffic-free street in a private street party. Some \"street parties\" are public events taking many forms.\n\nAn application needs making to the local authority to close a road for a street party. Despite the age of the legislation, any order made by the local authority uses the Town Police Clauses Act 1847.\n\nBlock parties are reported as a World War I innovation originating from the East Side of New York City, where an entire block was roped off and patriotic songs sung and a parade held to honor the members of that block who had gone off to war. Traditionally, many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, because they did not file for an event permit from the local authorities. However, police turned a blind eye to them.\n\nIn the United States, block parties usually occur on holidays such as Independence Day and Memorial Day. Some towns may also have an annual block party.\n\nBlock parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s, particularly within the hip hop community. Block parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's sound system was taken illegally from street lights, as referenced in the song \"South Bronx\" by KRS-One.\n\nSometimes the occasion may be a theme such as a recent popular movie or \"Welcome to our town\" for a new family. Often block parties involve barbecues and lawn games such as Simon Says, karaoke, and group dancing such as the Electric Slide, the Macarena or line dancing. In many small towns, the local fire department may also participate in the party, bringing out trucks that they display for show.\n\n\n"}

The extent to which this led to collaboration with the Nazi occupiers of France during the war, together with their motivations, is a matter of historical controversy.\n\nBefore the occupation, Breton nationalists were split between regionalism, federalism, and separatism. Essentially these factions, though divided, remained insensitive and frankly hostile to democratic ideals. Among these groups, only the openly separatist Breton National Party remained organized; dissolved in 1939, it was rapidly reconstituted in the autumn of 1940 and became the most active political party in Brittany under the Occupation. Having broken in 1931 from regionalism, its founders (Olier Mordrel and François Debeauvais) were inspired by the Irish Revolution and played the nationalist card. When war broke out, the Breton National Party chose a position of strict neutrality. This party's ideas were anti-democratic and complacent towards xenophobia and antisemitism, influenced by German racism and close to all the varieties of European fascism. During the war the activism of the Breton National Party completely dominated the other branches of the Breton movement, who found themselves discredited.\n\nOn 15 December 1940 a \"petition\" signed by 46 Bretons requesting \"administrative autonomy\" in the confines of a united France was sent to Philippe Pétain. On 22 January 1941, the Vichy government named Hervé Budes de Guébriant President of the National Commission for Agricultural Cooperation. The daily journal \"La Bretagne\" was created by Yann Fouéré on 21 March 1941. It took a regionalist point of view, opposed to the separatism of the Breton National Party. An appreciable number of Breton nationalists were also to be found in the Consultative Committee of Brittany, created on 11 October 1942 by Jean Quénette, prefect of the region of Brittany. \"An organization of study and work\", according to Yvonnig Gicquel, it did not wield any executive or decisive powers (against the wishes of the provincial parliament which conceived the adoption of the Breton regionalist doctrine). The will of its members (including members of the Breton National Party Yann Fouéré, Joseph Martray, etc.) was to transform this consultative committee into a true legislative assembly to tackle regional problems. Many of its members were to resurface when CELIB was created.\n\nThe work of Henri Fréville and Kristian Hamon have opened up this field for research. Three different periods can be considered.\n\nBefore 1939, Germany was trying to stop France and the United Kingdom from entering the war. During the phony war, Germany planned to favor regionalist movements (particularly those of Flanders and Brittany) in order to undermine France. This was in revenge for the Treaty of Versailles. and to ensure that Germany remained the only Continental power, with no threats on its western border. Some weapons were delivered but never used. By the end of June and early July, some Breton nationalists could take it for granted the independence of Brittany was well on the way when the Germans appointed a military governor in Brittany ruling over the five départements of ancient Brittany.\n\nBut after the defeat of France a settlement was quickly made with the occupying power. The projects to undermine France were abandoned and the support for the nationalists disappeared (in particular it was formally forbidden to proclaim a Breton state or to harm public order). Moreover, the formal annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was never proclaimed. After the Conference of Montoire nationalist movements were simply tolerated (transport permits were given as well as authorizations for purchases of gasoline that soon meant little in practice), and German support went no further than preventing the Vichy regime from suppressing the nationalist movements.\n\nBretons were not considered untermenschen (subhuman) by the Nazis, unlike the Jews and Gypsies for example. Mordrel, Lainé and some other Celticists argued that the Bretons were a 'pure' strain of the Celtic race, who had retained their \"Nordic\" qualities, a view consistent with Nazi Aryan master race ideology. Other Nationalists, such as Perrot, adopted a more conservative-Catholic stance consistent with longstanding Breton anti-radical ideologies that had emerged among the Royalist-Catholic \"Whites\" during the French Revolution.\n\nA main intention of the German occupiers was to break French national unity. Its support for Breton nationalism needs to be seen in this wider context which included other aspects, for example the division of France into the occupied zone and the Vichy zone. But Breton nationalists very soon realized that Germany was in practice trying to keep its friends in the Vichy government content and therefore refusing to give any priority at all to the Breton nationalist demands.\n\nNazi scholar Rudolf Schlichting toured the region and sent the following comment to his superiors: \"from a racial point of view there would be no objection to a Germanization of the Breton population. It is evident that we have no interest in promoting the Breton national consciousness, once the separation [with France] is accomplished. Not a penny should be spent on the promotion of the Breton language. The French language will however be replaced by German. In one generation Brittany will be a predominately (\"sic\") German country. This goal is definitely attainable through the schools, the authorities, the army and the press.\"\n\nImportant members of the Breton National Party including Morvan Lebesque and Alan Heusaff began collaborating with the Germans to one degree or another. The example of Ireland, or even the ideal of an independent Brittany - continued to be their reference points. Recent studies have shown the close links that Breton separatist leaders such Célestin Lainé and Alan Louarn had with German military intelligence (the Abwehr), going back well before the war, to the 1920s. After the defeat of 1940, the Germans used these separatist agents in military operations or in repression against the Resistance. A short-lived breakaway faction of the Breton National Party, created in 1941, was the Mouvement Ouvrier Social-National Breton (Breton National-Socialist Workers Movement) led by Théophile Jeusset.\n\nAt the end of 1940, Job Loyant — along with Kalondan, André Lajat, and Yves Favreul-Ronarc'h, a former leader of the Breton National Party in Loire-Atlantique — developed the doctrine of the Brezona movement: supremacy of the Breton race, formation of a national community, and government by the elite. This movement was to have but a brief existence. To prevent a possible takeover of the BNP by this splinter group, Yann Goulet appeared at Nantes to pronounce the excommunication of the Brezona \"deviationists.\" With his revolver in plain sight on the hip of the black uniform he wore as chief of the Youth Organizations, he left no doubt as to his intentions. The Nantes PNB meeting, at which the Brezona movement had hoped to take control, took place without incident.\n\nA number of Breton nationalists choose to join the Bezen Perrot organization, a German militia led by Célestin Lainé and Alan Heusaff. As many as 70 to 80 people joined its ranks at one point or another, with typically 30 to 66 at any one time depending on recruiting and defection. At the end of the war a handful of Breton militants decided to ask for German support in the face of the assassination of several leading figures of the Breton cultural movement, such as Abbé Perrot. Having originally been named \"Bezen Kadoudal\", the 1943 assassination of the priest prompted Lainé to give his name to the organization in December of that year.\n\nIt had already been envisaged by German strategists that in the event of Allied invasion the Breton nationalists would form a rearguard, and that further nationalist troops could be parachuted into Brittany. In late 1943 sabotage dumps had been hidden for use by the militia.\n\nThe Strolladoù Stourm (also known as Bagadoù stourm), led by Yann Goulet and Alan Louarn, was the armed wing of the Breton National Party. A handful of their members took part in a confrontation with the population of Landivisiau, on August 7, 1943. Yann Goulet, their leader, forbade participation in Bezen Perrot.\n\nBy April 1943, the Gestapo had created specific units to combat the French Resistance. Formed at the end of April 1944 in Landerneau, the Landerneau Kommando took part in these units. It was composed of 18 German soldiers and ten French agents (some of whom were Breton separatists as well as former Resistance members). They fought against the maquis (rural French Resistance units) of Trégarantec, Rosnoën, and Ploumordien. Several Resistance members were tortured, and the Kommando also summarily executed some prisoners.\n\nSeveral Breton nationalists were assassinated by the Resistance in 1943. The best known was Abbé Perrot, killed on 12 December 1943 by Jean Thépaut, a member of the Communist Resistance. Earlier, on the 3 September, Yann Bricler had been shot in his office by three FTP members, and similarly Yves Kerhoas was killed by the Resistance when leaving a fete in the village of Plouvenez. When American troops arrived in 1944, communist \"maquis\" members began their repressive actions. Jeanne Coroller-Danio, the Breton historian who worked under the name \"Danio\", was beaten to death along with her brother-in-law, Commander Le Minthier; the Tastevint brothers were castrated, and the Maubré sisters and their brother were savagely murdered in Morbihan.\n\nThe BNP, dissolved along with the French Communist Party in 1939, no longer legally existed. Its activists were hunted down and not distinguished from the Breton militants who wore the symbol of the dukes of Brittany (\"ermine-trimmed berets\"). Many were deported to detention camps; notably at the Camp Marguerite in Rennes where 150 nationalists were detained for alleged collaborationism. The Breton nationalists sought to defend the fact that their widespread image as an overtly fascist, even Nazi, movement had nothing to do with the actual political backgrounds of their activists, as varied as the Action française (royalist), the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, socialist), the separatist Breton National Party (PAB), or the French Communist Party. Moreover, Yann Goulet received financial and public backing from several communist militants at the time of the Liberation. Other militants accused of collaboration demonstrated to the courts that they had protected Jewish families during the occupation (Alan Eon–Yann Goulet).\n\nAfter France was liberated, it was as collaborators, not as separatists, that the PNB members were punished, and even then it was by no means all those members that were affected. Only 15 to 16 per cent of PNB members appeared in court, and few non-member sympathisers were prosecuted. Most leading members escaped in Ireland or Germany and were not judged. There was no mass repression as claimed in post-war separatist propaganda. However the post-war nationalist movements will tend to minimise the collaboration with nazi Germany and will create the myth of the separatists repression by the French government.\n\nStill today, some people are worried by the \"collective amnesia\" of the current Breton autonomist movement about World War II or by their attempts to rehabilitate the nationalist collaborationnists.\n\nOn the other hand, the standpoint of the Breton nationalists consider that the representation of the Breton nationalism during World War II in the media is a pretext to discredit the current aspirations of the autonomist movement, such as the recognition of linguistic rights.\n\nSeveral leading Breton activists - regionalists, federalists and separatists - joined the Resistance against the occupation. They had various motivations:\n\nAs early as 1940 some joined \"Sao Breiz\", the Breton wing of the Free French. This included several members of the Union Régionaliste Bretonne (Breton Regionalist Union) and the \"Ar brezoneg er skol\" association, founded before the war by Yann Fouéré. M. de Cadenet, a member of the latter group, and some of his associates wrote a draft statute, presented to General Charles de Gaulle which would have given Brittany a number of political freedoms after the return of peace. According to Yann Fouéré, this plan was close in spirit to the one that the Breton Consultative Committee wanted to submit in 1943 to Marshal Pétain. Neither of these two plans resulted in anything.\n\nActivists like Francis Gourvil, Youenn Souffes-Després and Jean Le Maho had before the war been members of minority separatist or federalist movements such as the Parti Autonomiste Breton (PAB) or the Ligue fédéraliste de Bretagne. These organisations were always clearly anti-fascist and critical of the extreme right. This led their members directly into the underground Resistance. Others joined the Resistance as individuals and after the war restarted their involvement in Breton nationalism. The action of a few members of Bezen Perrot has often concealed a very different reality, for example the members of Bagadou Stourm who founded the Forces Bretonnes de l'Intérieur (Breton Forces of the Interior, a Breton wing of de Gaulle's French Forces of the Interior), and were deported to Buchenwald.\n\nFor other groups, such as the Liberty Group of Saint-Nazaire (composed of young former members of Bagadoù stourm), pro-British feeling was the determining factor in pushing them to ally themselves with the Resistance. The Liberty Group, under the name of \"Bataillon de la Poche\" (\"Pocket Battalion\"), helped to liberate Saint-Nazaire from a pocket of German holdouts in May 1945.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "979332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=979332", "title": "Carpathian Germans", "text": "Carpathian Germans\n\nCarpathian Germans (, or \"felvidéki németek\", ) are a group of ethnic Germans. The term was coined by the historian Raimund Friedrich Kaindl (1866–1930), originally generally referring to the German-speaking population of the area around the Carpathian Mountains: the Cisleithanian (Austrian) crown lands of Galicia and Bukovina, as well as the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy (including the Zips region), Bosnia-Herzegovina and the northwestern (Maramuresch) region of Romania. Since the First World War, only the Germans of Slovakia (the Slovak Germans or \"Slowakeideutsche\", including the Zipser Germans) and those of Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine have commonly been called \"Carpathian Germans\".\n\nGermans settled in the northern territory of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (then called Upper Hungary, today mostly Slovakia) from the 12th to 15th centuries (\"see Ostsiedlung\"), mostly after the Mongol invasion of Europe in 1241. There were probably some isolated settlers in the area of Pressburg/Pozsony (Bratislava) earlier. The Germans were usually attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in older Slavic market and mining settlements. Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present-day Slovakia consisted almost exclusively of Germans.\n\nThe main settlement areas were in the vicinity of Pressburg and some language islands in the Spiš (Hungarian: \"Szepesség\"; German: \"Zips\"; ) and the Hauerland regions. The settlers in the Spiš region were known as \"Zipser Sachsen\" (Zipser Saxons, Hungarian: \"cipszerek\"). Within Carpathian Ruthenia, they initially settled around Teresva (Hungarian: \"Taracköz\"; German: \"Theresiental\") and Mukachevo (Hungarian: \"Munkács\"; German: \"Munkatsch\").\n\nThe Carpathian Germans, like the Slovaks, were subjected to Magyarization policies in the latter half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Furthermore, many Carpathian Germans voluntarily magyarized their names to climb the social and economic ladder.\n\nOn 28 October 1918, the National Council of Carpathian Germans in Kežmarok (Hungarian: \"Késmárk\"; German: \"Käsmark\") declared their loyalty to the Kingdom of Hungary, but a Slovak group declared Slovakia part of Czechoslovakia two days later.\n\nDuring the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), Carpathian Germans had a specific political party, the Zipser German Party (1920–1938) of Andor Nitsch, who was elected from 1925 to 1935 on a common Hungarian-German list for parliamentary elections. In 1929, another party, more nationalist-oriented, was formed in Bratislava, the Carpathian German Party (KdP), which made a common list at the 1935 parliamentary elections with the Sudeten German Party, whose leader Konrad Henlein became its head in 1937 with Franz Karmasin as deputy. In 1935, both parties obtained a seat in both parliamentary assemblies. In 1939, the KdP was renamed German Party with Franz Karmasin as führer, who had become in October 1938 state secretary for German Affairs in the Tiso government.\n\nThe status of Slovak Republic as a client state of Nazi Germany during World War II made life difficult for Carpathian Germans at the war's end. Nearly all remaining Germans fled or were evacuated by the German authorities before the end of the war. Most Germans from Spiš evacuated to Germany or the Sudetenland before the arrival of the Red Army. This evacuation was mostly due to the initiative of Adalbert Wanhoff and the preparations of the diocese of the German Evangelical Church, between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945. The Germans from Bratislava were evacuated in January and February 1945 after long delays, and those of the Hauerland fled at the end of March 1945. The Red Army reached Bratislava on 4 April 1945.\n\nAfter the end of the war, one third of the evacuated or fugitive Germans returned home to Slovakia. However, on 2 August 1945, they lost the rights of citizenship, by Beneš decree no. 33, and they were interned in camps such as in Bratislava-Petržalka, Nováky, and in Krickerhau Handlová. In 1946 and 1947, about 33,000 people were expelled from Slovakia under the Potsdam Agreement, while around 20,000 persons were allowed/forced to remain in Slovakia because they were able, on petition, to use the \"Slovakisation\" process, which meant that they declared themselves as Slovaks and changed their names into their Slovak equivalent or simply Slovakized them., while others were simply forced to do so because their skills were needed. Out of approximately 128,000 Germans in Slovakia in 1938, by 1947 only some 20,000 (15.6% of the pre-war total) remained. The citizenship consequences of the Beneš decrees were revoked in 1948, but not the expropriation. There were many massacres in 1944-45, such as that of 270 civilians from the Upper Zips and Dobšiná, Carpathian Germans who had fled to Bohemia as refugees and intended to return home after the war.\n\nAccording to national censuses, there were 6,108 (0.11%) Germans in Slovakia in 2007, 5,405 in 2001, 5,414 in 1991, and 2,918 in 1980. A Carpathian German Homeland Association has been created to maintain traditions, and since 2005 there is also a museum of the culture of Carpathian Germans in Bratislava. There are two German-language media financially helped by the Slovak government, \"Karpatenblatt\" (monthly) and \"IKEJA news\" (Internet), plus minority broadcasting in German on the Slovak radio. After the war, their countrymen, now living in Germany and Austria, founded cultural associations as well. There is also a Carpathian German Landsmannschaft of North America.\n\nAmongst prominent member ethnic Germans in post World War II Slovakia is Rudolf Schuster, the second President of Slovakia (1999–2004).\n\nThe Carpathian and other German-speaking groups in Romania are currently represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (DFDR).\n\nDue to the isolation of the German from countries where German has been standardized (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), there are many obscure German dialects that still exist in Slovakia. Many of these dialects are in danger of extinction.\n\nIn the Upper and Lower Zips regions (and later in Romania), the Zipser Germans spoke Zipserisch. A community of speakers remains in Hopgarten, speaking a distinctive dialect called \"Outzäpsersch\" (German: Altzipserisch, literally \"Old Zipserish\"). In Dobsina they spoke what they called Dobschauisch or Topschauisch. In Metzenseifen (Medzev) they spoke Mantak of which only a few dozen people speak it today. The German schools were closed after World War II in the all of the former German-speaking towns, and children were forcibly taught Slovak. German was not to be used in the workplace or even in the street. \n"}

{"id": "35367175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35367175", "title": "Crime in Namibia", "text": "Crime in Namibia\n\nNamibia is situated in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that has some of the highest crime rates in the world. Among other factors, this situation is contributed to by poverty, a low level of development, and enormous social and economic disadvantages. For example, according to government statistics, the unemployment rate reached 28.1% in 2014; in 2008, it was 51.2%.\n\nCrimes reported in Namibia amounted to 96,200 in the financial year March 2008–February 2009, in 2009/10 to 98,671, and in 2010/11 to 90,675. More than two fifths of all reported crimes occur in the capital Windhoek, where the majority of reported crimes are burglaries, robberies, and assaults. According to a US State Department report in 2015, the most common type of crime in Windhoek, Namibia's capital, is petty street crime, with most incidents occurring after dark, and criminals using knives and occasionally firearms.\n\nOrganised crime across all of Southern Africa probably only developed in the 1980s. While the thousands of kilometers of unsecured borders are often believed to be responsible for enabling cross-border crime, \"research has shown that criminals prefer legal border points\". Organised crime in Namibia is active mainly in the transporting of drugs and the hiring of drug mules, as well in laundering of money through investments in real estate and luxury assets.\n\nNamibia has experienced at least one serial killings event when between 2005 and 2007 the B1 Butcher killed and dismembered five women and deposited body parts along Namibia's National Road B1. The identity of the B1 Butcher was never conclusively determined.\n\nNamibia has a high rate of domestic violence, particularly against women and children. Rape and murder cases are frequent. The number of rape cases reported annually was estimated to be between 700 and 1,600 in 2010, and domestic violence is primarily done by men against women. A report on the period from 2012 to 2015 counted roughly 40,000 assault cases, 2 839 rape cases, 1 138 attempted murders and 734 murders while pointing out that a large number of cases remain unreported. A census in 2011 showed that the Namibian population was 2 113 077, and the UN Drugs and Organised Crime Office counted the number of murders in 2012 at 388 or 17.2 people per 100,000. This is relatively high compared to other African countries; for comparison, Guinea-Bissau had 140 murders or 8.4 per 100,000 people according to UN survey data.\n\nThere are a number of non-profit organisations to counter gender-based violence but the problem is perceived to become worse. Former President Hifikepunye Pohamba suggested in 2014 that 6 March should become a national prayer day, a measure that has received criticism for undermining the secular organisation of the state.\n\nThere are a number of cases every year where newborn babies are dumped in river beds, in rubbish-bins and in dams. According to the report published by the parliamentary standing committee on human resources, social and community development, from 2003 to 2007, baby dumping rose from 6 to 23 cases per year, a 283 percent rise. Most of these cases of concealment of birth go unreported; Windhoek Water Works alone reported in 2008 that they discover 13 dead newborns in their waste water system per month. According to Sister Namibia, a feminist magazine published in the country since its independence, Namibian abortion laws are restrictive, and illegal backstreet abortions are also a growing concern in the country.\n\nMoney laundering is legislated by the \"Financial Intelligence Act\" and controlled by the \"Financial Intelligence Centre\". The Centre reported a significant increase in suspicious transactions in 2011, but already in 2003 the United Nations described the situation as \"critical\".\n\nStock theft is a prevalent crime in Namibia and carries hefty penalties. After a 2004 law amendment to the Stock Theft Act, stealing livestock over the value of 500N$ results in a 20-year (repeat offenders: 30 year) mandatory prison sentence. This clause has in 2011 been declared unconstitutional, but several people were sentenced until then.\n\n"}
{"id": "39767609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39767609", "title": "Dan art", "text": "Dan art\n\nDan art is created by the Dan people of Liberia and the Ivory Coast.\n\nMasks are the most important art form of the Dan people of Liberia. They are perceived to embody the most powerful of spirit forces, called \"ge \"or \"gle\".\n\nThe \"wunkirmian\" is a large ceremonial ladle that is carved to honor a particular woman who has distinguished herself through generosity or hospitality. The \"wunkirmian\" is owned by the \"wunkirle\", who is considered the \"most hospitable woman\" of her village quarter. Traditionally, she chooses her own successor.\n\nCurator Barbara C. Johnson describes the role of the feast ladle in a Dan feast: \"At feast times [the wunkirle] marches with her spoon at the head of the line of women from her quarter. Each woman carries a pot of cooked rice or soup. The wunkirle either distributes to the food to the guests, or more frequently uses her ladle to indicate the distribution. At some feasts the wurkirlone of a village compete with each other in generosity by distributing small gifts of peanuts, candy, coins and other foods. The women dance at these times. The wunkirle's prestige may be indicated by her being carried in a hammock through the village by the women of her quarter. They also contribute gifts of their own, but always in the name of the wurkirle.\"\n\nBesides acting as \"emblems of honor,\" feast ladles have spiritual power. According to the Dan, the ladles embody \"du\" and contain the power of the \"wunkirle\". The \"wunkirmiam\" is for the woman what the masks are for the men; \"wunkirmiam\" are the woman's chief liaison with the power of the spirit world and the symbol of that connection. Like masks, each \"wunkirmian\" is given its own name.\n\nThe most common form of the wunkirmian has a handle carved as a human head that displays the characteristic of the \"buangle\" mask: narrow eyes and an oval face. The face on the ladle depicts a specific woman.\n\nJanus-faced heads on a staff are reported to be carried by certain masked performers. The two faces looking in opposite directions symbolize the supernatural ability of the gle to see in all directions.\n\nLike feast ladles, these heads are considered powerful spiritual objects that act as receptacles for \"du\". Some are created as portraits of deceased family members that embody that person's spirit.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the antiquity of brass casting among the Dan, but it is clear that the practice began at least in the early 19th century if not much earlier. Some scholars believe that the We people to the East may have introduced the practice to the Dan. Brass casting was a practice of Dan blacksmiths. In Dan communities, the blacksmith was always awarded a high status because he was responsible for agricultural tools and weapons. Brass-casting took place at night to protect the object from onlookers. Brass-casters created brass objects using the cire-perdue, or lost wax method.\n\nBy the late 1930s, a Liberian government decree outlawing all brass jewelry resulted in an abundance of brass, which brass-casters used to figurative sculptures. Typically, figures stand at about 8 inches tall and carry objects of cultural importance in their hands. The figures were made principally as prestige items.\n"}

{"id": "993335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=993335", "title": "Feminist history", "text": "Feminist history\n\nFeminist history refers to the re-reading of history from a female perspective. It is not the same as the history of feminism, which outlines the origins and evolution of the feminist movement. It also differs from women's history, which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past. Feminist History seeks to change the nature of history to include gender into all aspects of historical analysis, while also looking through a critical feminist lens. Jill Matthews states “the purpose of that change is political: to challenge the practices of the historical discipline that have belittled and oppressed women, and to create practices that allow women an autonomy and space for self-definition”\n\nTwo particular problems which feminist history attempts to address are the exclusion of women from the historical and philosophical tradition, and the negative characterization of women or the feminine therein; however, feminist history is not solely concerned with issues of gender \"per se\", but rather with the reinterpretation of history in a more holistic and balanced manner. \n\"If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical processes and are not blindly \"natural,\" we can understand why feminist history has always had a dual mission—on the one hand to recover the lives, experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and workings of gender.\" —Susan Pedersen\n\nThe \"disappearing woman\" has been a focus of attention of academic feminist scholarship. Research into women's history and literature reveals a rich heritage of neglected culture.\n\nOne of the major issues with the history of feminism is its inability to address the concept of intersectionality. Jill Matthews states “The new feminist history emerged almost 20 years ago as an arm of the Women's Liberation Movement, or second wave feminism, and it continues to serve that political process”.\n\nFeminist history combines the search for past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women's history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman's perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist frame of mind. It is also not to be confused with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include “cultural and social investigations” in the job description. Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women's lives. A few of these, such as Susan B. Anthony and Audre Lorde, documented histories of their feminist movements.\n\nFeminist historians collect to analyze and analyze to connect. Rather than just recording women's history, they allow a connection to be made with “public history.\" However, problems remain in integrating this improved history into a curriculum appropriate for students. Finally, feminist historians must now be able to understand the digital humanities involved in creating an online database of their primary sources as well as published works done by notable feminist historians. Feminist digital humanists work with feminist historians to reveal an online integration of the two histories. Harvard's Women’s Studies Database contain sources, like the Gerritsen Collection, that allow scholarly papers by feminists to be written and publicly convey the fact that there is more than one history and the progress made in combining them.\n\nFeminist historians use women's history to explore the different voices of past women. This gathering of information requires the help of experts who have dedicated their lives to this pursuit. It provides historians with primary sources that are vital to the integration of histories. Firsthand accounts, like Fiedler's And the Walls Come Tumbling Down? (A Feminist View from East Berlin) recounts the daily lives of past women. It documents how their lives were affected by the laws of their government. Women's historians go on to interpret how the laws changed these women's lives, but feminist historians rely on this information to observe the ‘disappearing woman’. Fieldler even mentioned that “[t]hese feminists were disappointed when they meant ordinary eastern women who were good housewives too, while enjoying outside work.\" Because these feminists only knew the public history of the German Democratic Republic, they projected themselves into the imaginary.\n\nUpon investigation of eastern women's lives, they found that though the GDR's socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, there had been no women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler's, has allowed women's historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn't too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.\n\nFeminist historians see mainly two specific histories. The first is the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second is made up of women's history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look at the past with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women's History and Regular History that “[his] purpose is to help students understand the values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture.\" In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he wasn't learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women's contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the ‘public’ and the ‘domestic’ sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary.\n\nThough not all women are politicians or war generals, boys are raised in the domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “[n]o man can be a good citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men's history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women's history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men's and women's history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.\n\nFeminist historiography is another notable facet of feminist history. One important feminist historiography writer and researcher is Judith M. Bennett. In her book, \"History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism\", Bennett writes on the importance of studying a “patriarchal equilibrium”. Cheryl Glenn also writes on the importance of feminist historiography “Writing women (or any other traditionally disenfranchised group) into the history of rhetoric, then, can be an ethically and intellectually responsible gesture that disrupts those frozen memories in order to address silences, challenge absences, and assert women's contributions to public life” This facet of feminist history inspect historical writings that are typically assumed to be canon, and reinvents them under a feminist lens.\n\n\n"}

Sabotage in the form of cyberattacks can create havoc with computer, communication, and information systems, which could severely interrupt the electrical supply. This in turn can cause major disruptions to other infrastructure components of society. Comprehensive defense plans are proposed.\nOne method is to isolate load systems. Sophisticated defense systems should be\nwide-area, real-time protection, with control systems that are alerted and guided by sensing technologies. Communication and information must be capably routed.\n\nMany countries have initiated government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure usually through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as United States Federal Protective Service and also creation of dedicated transport police such as the British Transport Police. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the Amtrak Police in the United States.\n\nA number of government organizations has focus on infrastructure security and protection. The Technical Support Working Group has the Infrastructure Protection Subgroup. The UK has the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre.\n\nSeveral infrastructures also use fiber optic perimeter intrusion detection security systems, which enables the detection and location of intrusions over many miles of deployed fiber. This is commonly used at water utility sites and at other critical infrastructure sites globally.\n\n\nUS specific:\n\n"}

From her research and teaching, Timby writes on the cultural history of photography as a technology.\n\nTimby’s research draws on her learning, and combines her interests, in anthropology, history and photography. Her early experience of the medium was through her maternal grandmother, who had a darkroom and was active in her local photo club and showed her how to print in the darkroom. Her first camera was a high school graduation gift.\n\nTimby was educated at the private Connecticut College, New London, where as an Anthropology undergraduate she undertook a minor subject studio arts, studying photography and making photographs in the vintage processes of cyanotype and gum printing. From there she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Anthropology in 1992 before completing an M.A. in that discipline in 1996 at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, France, and from 2002–2006 undertook her PhD at the same Paris institution.\n\nTimby’s Master's thesis was \"La photographie et l'ethnologie de la France. Modes d'emploi et apports de l'image\" (‘Photography and the ethnology of France. Uses and contributions of the image’) dealing with the usefulness of photography to museums of French ethnography and how photography was employed by anthropologists in their field work and publications in studying French culture or as object of study in its own right. This research shifted her interest from traditional anthropology toward history, taking her into the history of photography, where her anthropology guides her consideration of its cultural impact.\n\nTimby’s research subsequent to her master's degree and her interest in photographic technologies and their social utility and impact stem also from her work as a curator. From 1996 to 2001 she was employed in that role at the Musée Carnavalet, the museum of the history of Paris, a city so closely associated with the progress of photography from its invention.\n\nThere she prepared exhibitions including \"Paris in 3D: from Stereoscopy to Virtual Reality, 1850-2000”, an exercise in configuring rigorous academic archival research for general consumption.\n\nTimby had first become interested in stereography when working with the photography historian Peter Palmquist for a month in the early 1990s as an undergraduate in the US. His study of original photographs and primary source materials to uncover overlooked aspects of the history of photography chimed with her background in anthropology and as an historian. Palmquist took her to an antique shop in Arcata (California) where he lived, and there she bought her first stereo view.\n\nTimby was able to find temporary work that engaged her interest in photography and anthropology at the Musée de l’Homme photography department and Musée Carnavalet specialising in the history of Paris. In 1996 she began co-curating a 3D exhibition at the Carnavalet museum, and the resultant display opened in Paris in October 2000 and closed January 2001. The exhibition and catalogue in English and in French ( “Paris en 3D: de la stéréoscopie à la réalité virtuelle, 1850-2000”) in hardbound editions, appealed to a diverse audience who, using the different stereo viewers enclosed in the book, could enjoy hundreds of images, stereo pairs, anaglyphs, lenticular images and holograms, of Parisian life from the early nineteenth century to the present. Timby contributed text that one reviewer called an ‘historical roadmap of the techniques leading to the development of 3D photography from stereocards, anaglyphs, and holograms to 3D computer imagery and virtual reality’. The book and exhibition were of ‘landmark’ historical value, in the opinion of another reviewer, with many of its pictures showing antique equipment and portraits of pioneers of stereoscopy and integrated biographical information and excerpts of treatises of prominent persons in stereoscopy. In the opinion of David Haberstich, the exhibition was ‘definitive’ in dealing with perception, art, and technology.\n\nIn 2001, with a training and research grant from the Ministry of Culture and Communication (photographic patrimony) for access to patents, and by the Carnavalet museum as part of her work on the exhibition \"Paris in 3D: de stereoscopy to virtual reality, 1850-2000 \", Timby published a 23-page academic paper on research into commercial, advertising, entertainment, and even medical and religious, applications of the lenticular image invention in France, and its technical development.\n\nWhen researching 3D imaging Timby found that colour was a major consideration, a thread that developed during her PhD on lenticular photography, begun after \"Paris in 3D\" closed and she had left Carnavalet. Her first published work on colour was the 2005 article \"Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories,\" from she developed the idea that colour, like 3D, was a constructed illusion; an ambition in common of the two technologies was the reproduction of an aspect of human perception through its deconstruction and reconstruction.” Also in 2005, before the completion in 2006 of her PhD at the Paris École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Timby was appointed Director of Collections at the Musée Nicéphore Niépce in Chalon-sur-Saône, France which houses the archive of devices and objects once belonging to the inventor of photography as well as nearly three million images from all photographic processes.\n\nThere, her work included curating \"Sous un beau ciel bleu: un siècle de couleurs et de photographie\" (June 17–October 1, 2006), augmenting the second strand of her research interests, colour photography, into the technological, aesthetic, and social history which she has since pursued investigations alongside stereoscopy. Timby’s other projects at the Musée Nicéphore Niépce included designing and implementing new permanent exhibition spaces structured around a rotating series of mini-exhibits, thus continuing her informed engagement with a wide audience.\n\nTimby elaborates a cultural history of photography by examining human engagement with, and transformation of, its particular techniques and technologies, as she does with the photo-booth, precursor to the ‘selfie-stick’, in her paper “Photographies d’amitié. De l’usage collectif du photomaton,” (‘Photographs of friendships: the collective use of the photo booth’). For the same purpose, she tracks the mid-century development of colour printing technologies for magazine photographs as a response to audiences’ and advertisers’ desire, and the adaptation of photographers, amateur and professional, to its availability and special demands.\n\nIn a move to alma mater École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in 2009, and until 2012, Timby co-coordinated investigation in \"La Création Photographique\", a research program in the history of photography funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche.\n\nDuring this period she published a chapter 'Le cinéma dans une seule photo' : le portrait animé des années 1910’, a contribution to a collection of essays on the crossover between cinema and the still image, also reproduced as ‘Cinema in a Single Photo: The Animated Screen Portrait of the 1910s’ in an English edition. Her text first raises the way that lenticular animation, in novelty portraits and advertising, satisfied an expectation of progress toward ever more perceptual naturalism in photographic technologies, and this was expanded in the second chapter of her book \"3D and Animated Lenticular Photography: Between Utopia and Entertainment\", published in 2015.\n\nResponse to the book was positive and recognised the value of Timby’s contribution to the literature on lenticular imagery which in comparison to the history and analysis of other 3D technologies had received little attention.\n\nAlongside the research affiliation with the EHESS where she was also in charge of a postgraduate seminar, Timby was a professor at the Paris College of Art from January 2010 to the end of 2012 and is currently, since 2005, professor responsible for the École du Louvre's intensive 3-year History of Photography survey course.\n\n\n\n"}

After several anthropological studies, they provide good illustrations of how colonial authorities become unwittingly enmeshed in local politics; of sustainable subsistence agricultural production in crowded areas; of successful self-directed development of market-oriented agriculture; and of the use of \"traditional\" cultural resources to prosper in modern Nigeria.\n\nThe population known as the Kofyar actually comprises three different \"tribes\" as designated by British colonial officers: the Doemak (or Dimmuk), Merniang, and Kwalla. However the three groups have a common language, economic pattern, and origin myth, and had formed into a union called the Koffyer Federation in the 1940s; they have therefore been referred to as a single group by anthropologists.\n\nWhen first encountered by early British colonial authorities, they lived in the rugged hills in the southeastern corner of the Jos Plateau and in settlements around the plateau base. Their subjugation by the British was largely non-violent until 1930, when a young Assistant District Officer named Barlow was killed in the hill village of Latok by a rock thrown at his head. After this the residents of Latok and neighboring villages were forced out of the hills and made to live on the plains below for nine years. In an award-winning study, anthropologist Robert Netting explained how Barlow had been unknowingly used in a local political dispute.\n\nRobert Netting began anthropological research with the Kofyar in the early 1960s. In the Kofyar homeland population densities were high, approaching 500/km² in many areas. Netting's primary focus was on the Kofyar ecological adaptations, including the highly intensive agriculture being practiced and also the social institutions that were instrumental to sustainability. Much of the land was in annual cultivation, with animal herds providing dung compost for fertilizer, and steep hillsides were intricately terraced. Netting's \"Hill Farmers of Nigeria\", a classic book in the field of cultural ecology, showed how social institutions such as household form and land tenure had adjusted to the intensive cultivation system. Netting compared adaptations of Kofyar and their neighbors to demonstrate Ester Boserup's thesis that agricultural intensification relates to the growth of increasingly dense population and decreasing per capita land area. Kofyar families farmed most intensively close to their homesteads while using less intensive bush and forest fallow systems, which required less investment, on more distant fields. Netting also observed that the Kofyar demonstrated a reversion to less labor-intensive long-fallow systems when land became available on the plains south of their traditional region. He further developed these ideas and placed the Kofyar within a much broader comparative context in his \"Smallholders, Householders\".\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Kofyar began to settle in the fertile plains of the Benue Valley to the south of the Jos Plateau. Pioneering farms there used extensive slash-and-burn methods, but with rising population density and market stimulus, intensive methods were gradually introduced. By the 1980s, Benue Valley Kofyar were producing considerable surpluses of yams, rice, peanuts, pearl millet and sorghum using labor-intensive but generally sustainable methods – an interesting contrast to the externally supported agricultural development schemes in the region, which have generally failed.\n\nAs in the homeland, millet beer was found to play a key role not only in daily life but in the organization of agricultural production. The highly productive farming system ran almost entirely on human labor, with little external inputs, and a key strategy for mobilizing local labor was the \"mar muos\", a festive labor party at which all workers were served generous amounts of millet beer.\n\nAlthough most Kofyars now live in the Benue Valley (or in cities), the Jos Plateau homeland is still inhabited largely because of the Kofyars' efforts to maintain it as a cultural and economic resource. Many Kofyar who live elsewhere still keep secondary homes in the homeland.\n\n<br>\n"}

The history of labour revolts often provides the historical basis for many advocates of marxism, communism, socialism and anarchism, with many instances occurring across the world in both the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe Canut Revolts in Lyons, France were the first clearly defined worker uprising of the Industrial Revolution. The First occurred in November 1831 and was followed by later revolts in 1834 and 1848. Following the closure of the national workshops after the 1848 revolution in Paris, there was an uprising in Paris involving 100,000 insurgents involved in a three-day battle with the army, volunteers and reserve forces.\n\nThe Paris Commune in France (1871) is hailed by both anarchists and Socialists as the first assumption of power by the working class, but controversy of the policies implemented in the Commune helped the split between the two groups.\n\nThe Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the 1877 Shamokin Uprising occurred in the United States.\n\nThe Battle of Blair Mountain in Logan County, West Virginia, USA (1921) was the largest organised armed uprising in American Labour History, and had a major impact on labour legislation in the United States.\n\nThe Revolution of 1905 in led to the creation of the Saint Petersburg Soviet or worker's council which became the model for most Communist Revolutionary Activity. The Soviet was revived in the Russian Revolution and the model was repeated in the German Revolution of 1918–19, The Bavarian Soviet Republic and the Hungarian Soviet Republic.\n\nSome revolutionary activity within the Eastern Bloc resembled Labour Revolts, such as the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Polish 1970 protests although many communists would dispute this as 'Counter-Revolutionary' activity.\n\nA Red Clydeside was a period of labour and political militancy in the city of Glasgow, Scotland between the 1910s and the 1930s. Most famously, this resulted in raising the red flag in the Battle of George Square.\n\n\nSome observers claimed that the protests of 1968 were part of a \"revolutionary wave\", with much of the activity motivated by students.\n\n\n"}

The vessels are sorted by ship length including bowsprit, if known.\n\nFinding the world's longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, not all of the claims to the title of the world's longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable.\n\nA further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one \"length\". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the \"length of the topmost deck\" – the \"length on deck\" (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the \"length between perpendiculars\" (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including jibboom and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length.

{"id": "6985736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6985736", "title": "Manus marriage", "text": "Manus marriage\n\nManus (; ) was an Ancient Roman type of marriage, of which there were two forms: cum manu and sine manu. In a cum manu marriage, the wife was placed under the legal control of the husband. In a sine manu marriage, the wife was still under the legal control of her father. \n\nIn both cum manu and sine manu marriages, if both the husband and wife were \"alieni iuris\" (persons under \"patria potestas\", that is, under the power of his or her family's \"pater familias\") the marriage could only take place with the approval of both of the \"patres familias\". However, the creation and termination of the marriage somewhat depended on the type of marriage. \n\nInitially cum manu was the only form of marriage but in time the cum manu union faded and only sine manu marriage was widely practiced.\n\nIn a cum manu union the wife legally and ritually became a member of her husband's family. She stood under the control of the husband’s \"potestas\" or that of his father, and was thus no longer under the control of her father. This change of status was referred to as \"capitis deminutio minima\", and the wife received the title of \"materfamilias\", meaning “mother of the household” - a title reserved for a woman in a cum manu union. Legally the wife was \"adopted\" by her husband and assumed the status of a daughter in the family. This granted her the same entitlements as the other children in the family over matters of intestate succession. Therefore, the wife no longer inherited from her father but from her husband. However, the husband held a limited power over her in comparison to his children. For example, the husband did not have the legal right of \"life and death\" the way he would his daughter, or that of \"noxal surrender\" and \"sale\". \n\nThe wife in a cum manu marriage held no proprietary capacity meaning she could not own any property. Everything acquired prior to cum manu was thus transferred into the husband's property or that of his \"paterfamilias\". During Cicero's time property such as dowry was recognized as distinguishable and therefore recoverable. Liabilities the wife may have acquired before marriage were erased. \n\nA widowed or divorced woman would become \"sui iuris\". For a widowed wife two significant benefits came from cum manu marriage: the husband could grant the wife the ability to select her tutor and she was able to create a will. \n\nCum manu (i.e. the woman enters into manus) was procured by one of three ways: Confarreatio, Coemptio and Usus.\n\nThe ritual of confarreatio was one way of obtaining cum manu marriage and was available only to patricians. This is a particular kind of sacrifice made to Jupiter. During this ritual the bridegroom and bride shared a bread made of \"farreus\" known as emmer grain, hence confarreatio translates to “sharing of emmer bread.” This process required the presence of ten witnesses and the recital of ceremonial sacred verses. High priests such as the priests of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus were required to be born from a confarreatio union and were otherwise unqualified to obtain priesthood. \n\nAs confarreatio slowly fell from favor it became difficult to find candidates for priesthood. In order to revive confarreatio marriages, the practice endured some amendments. Consequently, the \"flamen Dialis’s\" wife only fell under the control of her husband during rituals, and was otherwise as autonomous as other women. Cum manu was no longer acquired by the employment of confarretio and became restricted to patricians pursuing priestly positions.\n\nThe matrimonial process of coemptio was in essence a fictitious notional sale of the woman to the husband. Coemptio occurred at any time throughout marriage. This was a process of mancipation. The transaction occurred with a scales-holder and in the presence of at least five witnesses, all of whom were adult male Roman citizens.\n\nCoemptio could occur not only with a husband but also with an outsider. However, this process is deemed for the “sake of trust” not for the “sake of marriage.” Coemptio was only a convenient legal practice. If a wife, who had become cum manu through the process of coemptio, divorced, she became emancipated. By the 2nd century AD, a wife was able to compel her husband to emancipate her, a right not shared by her children. Coemptio was presumably a rare practice even during the 2nd century BC under Gaius. In addition, it was possibly the remains of earlier practices of notional sale.\n\nA cum manu acquired by usus was simply the cohabitation of the husband and wife for the duration of a year. After a year passed the wife was transferred into the ownership of her partner, she was considered taken by the decree of yearly possession. This process required no ceremonial practices. \n\nIf the woman was not willing to come into ownership of her husband, manus by usus was easily preventable. As conditioned in the Twelve Tables if the wife absented herself for the total of three days and three nights before the end of the year, each year, the marriage was not cum manu, and she was not under the ownership of her husband. If a woman married cum manu through the process of usus later divorced, she became emancipated. Subsequently, the law of usus was dissolved by legal enactments presumably because it fell out of use.\n\nIn a sine manu union the wife legally and ritually remained a member of her father's family, standing under the control of her father's potestas. A sine manu marriage did not change the legal status of the bride after the marriage, in regards to property rights. In other words, the bride is not under control of the husband. This form of marriage held no ceremonial formalities led by a public official. Ultimately it involved a husband and wife living together under the intention of a marriage, in conjunction with the legal capacity of marriage under the Roman law. Although no official ceremony was held, it was customary for the bride to be escorted to her bridegroom's house. The children of this union were legally members of the husband’s agnatic kin. They held no legal connection with the mother’s paterfamilias, and could not make claims on her intestate. \n\nIt was only when the woman’s paterfamilias died that she became \"sui iuris\". This union allowed the wife to become independent sooner than cum manu, under the assumption that the fathers are likely to have died before a husband. Primarily this served the natal family, allowing her property to stay in the father’s possession. \n\nVarious factors may have led to the extinction of cum manu and the predominance of sine manu during the Roman Republic. Women faced with the loss of property when entering a cum manu marriage began to only consent to sine manu unions.\n\n"}

After a career with international non-governmental organizations including the United Nations Development Program in Geneva, Daudzai started work as two term Chief of Staff of Afghan President Hamid Karzai from 2003 to 2005 and then from 2007 to around 2010. From 2005 until 2007, President Karzai appointed him as Afghan Ambassador in Iran. He then served as Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan, tasked with advancing efforts to reach a political solutions to the war in Afghanistan. In September 2013, Daudzai was asked to serve as Afghan Minister of the Interior in Kabul and instead ensure security for the elections.\n\nDaudzai has left official office and continues to work in Afghanistan's politics through supporting youth groups, and mobilizing politically influentials people and organizations in support of strengthening the country's democratic order. He has also emerged as a critic of President Ashraf Ghani's unbalanced regional diplomacy and pursuit of unilateral closeness to Pakistan—arguing in a NYT oped that \"rather than expect a miraculous U-turn from Islamabad, Mr. Ghani’s government would do better to use its resources, and the international community’s continued support, to concentrate on its main purpose: consolidating the Afghan state.\"\n\nDaudzai was born on 12 October 1957 in the Qarabagh District of the Kabul Province in Afghanistan. He grew up and completed his primary education in his home district of Qarabagh. In order to continue his higher education, Omar moved to the capital city Kabul.\n\nDuring the 1980s Daudzai became active in the resistance against the Soviet-occupation and joined the Mujahideen group of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar: Hezbi Islami. While still influential with the former cadre of Hebi Islami who are active in Afghanistan's politics, Daudzai has ended his official ties with the party reportedly after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and remains politically independent.\n\nDuring the Taliban era Daudzai decided to settle in Peshawar, Pakistan, and began working for the organization Save the Children. While working there through a scholarship program, he was able to go to the Victoria University in the United Kingdom for his Masters in Science. After completing his Masters he came back to work for the Swedish Committee in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. In 1996 he moved to Islamabad, Pakistan, where he started working for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). In 2001 he moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where he assumed the role of \"Area Development Specialist\" in UNDP Geneva.\n\nIn November 2003 Daudzai was approached by the Afghan Transitional Administration to assume the office of the Chief of Staff of the President and took the position. At that time, the key challenge was establishing the Afghan state amidst an environment full of traditional power holders and illegal militias. Commenting on how only few militias have disarmed, he said: \"Any force not part of the Afghan National Army is a challenge, but this is reality, so we ought to deal with it diplomatically and peacefully.

According to Daudzai, it later turned out the man wasn't Mansour at all, but an imposter who was just a shopkeeper in Quetta. Daudzai blamed the British for this debacle, because he said that they brought the man in front of Karzai. \"International partners should not get excited so quickly with those kinds of things,\" Daudzai said, adding that the incident shows that the Afghan peace talks should be \"Afghan-led and fully Afghanized.\" According to Wikileaks Cables Daudzai also believed that the Norwegians might have been fooled into meeting self-proclaimed members of the Taliban who may in fact not have been Taliban members at all. Daudzai claimed that he had never heard anything about contact between the Taliban and Norwegian authorities.\n\nThe Atlantic profiled him as: \"A soft-spoken former aid worker, Daudzai served as the president’s liaison to the many warlords and strongmen he had to keep in check—both to ensure stability and to secure his reelection in 2009. While Daudzai was once associated with the conservative Hizb-e-Islami party, the 56-year-old...is more pragmatic in his worldview. When Karzai made an ultimately unsuccessful push for reconciliation with the Taliban in 2011, he dispatched Daudzai as his ambassador to Pakistan. To express his displeasure with the Americans, who tried to oust him during his 2009 reelection campaign, Karzai replaced Daudzai as chief of staff with Abdul Karim Khurram, a conservative former culture minister with an anti-American reputation.\"\n\nIn 2010, there were rumors that then President Hamid Karzai's office was receiving bags filled with cash from Iranian officials. Karzai acknowledged and accepted the fact that the Government of Iran has been providing millions of dollars directly to his office. Karzai told reporters he had instructed Daudzai to accept the money from Tehran. \"It is official and by my order,\" Karzai said. Iranians also stated that the report was indeed true. Two weeks after the controversy about the Iranian money Daudzai came out to the Afghan Media for an open interview. In the interview Daudzai showed piles of files that proved that every cent of the money coming from Iran were spent on government expenses only and that he had record for all the money that came from Iran. He also claimed that Iranian money had been coming to Afghanistan since 2002 but the issue was brought out only now in order to pressure the Karzai government for political reasons and that since 2002 also the US, the UK and Japan had provided the presidential office with cash assistance. According to Newsweek, nearly every encounter between Afghan and Iranian officials ends up with the Iranians proffering a sack of cash.\n\nAccording to wikileaks cables Daudzai told deputy US ambassador Francis Ricciardone already in February 2010 that certain Afghan officials were on Tehran's payroll, including some people nominated for cabinet positions. Daudzai claimed that some of these officials had been relieved of their duties because 'you can't be an honest Afghan if you receive a package from Iran.' Daudzai had told Ricciardone, and he said that his government preferred the US' sustained cash support to the 'occasional and unpredictable' payments from Iran.\n"}

{"id": "55478967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55478967", "title": "No Bra Day", "text": "No Bra Day\n\nNo Bra Day is an annual observance on October 13 on which women are encouraged to forgo wearing a bra as a means to encourage breast cancer awareness. No Bra Day was initially observed on July 9, 2011, but within three years it had moved to October 13, the month of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Users on social media are encouraged to post using the hashtag #nobraday to promote awareness of breast cancer symptoms and to encourage gender equality. Some users on social media sites also encourage women to post pictures of themselves not wearing a bra. Some women embrace No Bra Day as a political statement while others prefer the comfort of discarding what they view as a restrictive, uncomfortable garment.\n\nThe observance has spread worldwide. The event was spun off a medical event in Toronto, Canada, that encourages breast cancer survivors to consider reconstructive surgery. First held on October 19, 2011, the medical event was named BRA (Breast Reconstruction Awareness) Day. It was adapted by an anonymous individual who conceived of No Bra Day as a way to encourage women to enjoy being braless and to become knowledgeable about breast cancer symptoms. The day is controversial as some see it as sexualizing and exploiting women's bodies while at the same time belittling a serious disease.\n\nThe original event known as \"BRA Day\" was started by Toronto plastic surgeon Dr. Mitchell Brown. The first BRA Day event, titled \"Breast Reconstruction – An Evening of Learning and Sharing\", was held in Toronto, Canada at Women's College Hospital and Toronto General Hospital on October 19, 2011. Brown found that many Canadian women who underwent a mastectomy due to breast cancer resisted undergoing reconstructive surgery. He founded \"Breast Reconstruction Awareness\" (BRA) Day to increase women's awareness of the availability of reconstructive breast surgery. BRA day is intended to raise awareness of breast cancer screening, alert women to breast cancer symptoms, and to encourage women to conduct regular self examinations. The event was adopted in the U.S. in 2012.\n\n, the BRA Day event devoted to educating women about reconstructive surgery, and hosted by the Canadian Cancer Society, continued to be held across Canada. BRA day is observed on different dates in different provinces of Canada during the month of October.\n\nThe origin of No Bra Day can be traced back to the first BRA Day held in Toronto, in 2011. In July that year, an anonymous individual using the name Anastasia Doughnuts conceived of No Bra Day and published the first website promoting the event.\n\nWomen have protested the physical and cultural restrictions imposed by bras over many years. In 1966, during the height of the hippie era in San Francisco, two women students at San Francisco State College protested a proposed law that would require women to wear bras by walking topless near the campus. On August 1, 1969, an Anti-Bra Day was declared in San Francisco to protest societal pressure to wear constrictive, feminine garments. The protest drew large crowds, blocking traffic, and a few women took their bras off from under their clothing in the Financial District. In 1968, feminists organized a protest at the Miss America Contest and tossed a number of feminine products in a garbage can. A newspaper headline erroneously stated that the women had burned their bras. That protest has been interpreted as a rejection of society's perception of women's bodies and dress requirements. During the 1970s women wore what they wanted without regard for political correctness. During the last two decades of the 20th century, bras expressed both professionalism and, due to the attention given a pink satin conical bra worn by Madonna, sexual freedom.\n\nThe first No Bra Day event was created by an anonymous internet user self-named \"Anastasia Doughnuts\" for July 9, 2011 and was observed on that date through 2013. In 2013 and 2014, social media posts announced both July 9 and October 13 as No Bra Day. Since 2015, the event has only been promoted on October 13. The event was initially described, in part, as:\n\nThe announcement was later reposted on a Facebook page promoting the event. October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and by 2014 the official day of the event was moved to October 13, during which women are urged to forgo wearing a bra. An increasing number of women, especially millennials, have expressed opposition to and are giving up wearing bras.\n\nIn 2012, about 400,000 individuals took part, 250,000 of those on Facebook. As of 2017 the day was observed by women in 30 countries, including New Zealand, Romania, Malaysia, Scotland, India, and Ghana. Women are urged after taking off their bra to give themselves a breast exam. On social media, women are encouraged to go braless and to post photos using the hashtag #nobraday. More than 82,000 women posted pictures on Twitter and Instagram in 2017. Women who choose not to go braless and men are encouraged to wear something purple on that day. Some sites suggest that participants donate to breast cancer charities. A Romanian photographer capitalized on the idea and published an album of photos depicting braless women. \n\nMany celebrities world-wide have been seen braless in public for a number of years. A increasing number of women are following their example. Fewer women are buying push-up style bras. Some are choosing an unstructured, wireless soft cup bralette, and some choose to go bra free altogether. Victoria's Secret's parent company L Brands Inc. derives about one-third of its earnings from bras, and in 2016, its revenues were down nearly 30%. Capitalizing on the trend, companies had begun offering clothing designed to advertise that the wearer is not wearing a bra, or fashions designed to take advantage of the no bra look. Some women choose to go braless to wear fashions that would otherwise expose straps and to create a streamlined silhouette.\n\nThe unofficial No Bra Day is not recognized by any cancer research organization or is formally part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Some critics have described the event as being \"purely sexual\". The event does not directly raise money for cancer research or prevention, although individuals are in some cases encouraged to support such causes.\n\nSome participants connect not wearing a bra to feminist protests like those at the 1968 Miss America protest. There, protesters symbolically threw a number of feminine products including bras into a \"Freedom Trash Can\". They described the items as \"instruments of female torture\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. The protest gained notoriety when a local news story in the Atlantic City \"Press\" erroneously reported that \"the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women's magazines\" were burned. Some feminist activists believe that anti-feminists used the protesters' suggestion of going braless to trivialize what the women were trying to accomplish and to minimize the importance of the feminist movement in general.\n\nSome feminists who support the idea of using No Bra Day to raise awareness of breast cancer are concerned with the sexualization of the #nobraday hashtag in social media. In the Philippines, the observance is seen as a day to advance the cause of gender equality. One journalist supported No Bra Day, saying that it \"asserts femininity and our appreciation of who we are as a woman... The bra symbolizes how women are being held in bondage\". The observance and its connections to gender equality has drawn comparisons with the Go Topless women's rights movement and Go Topless Day, a protest in which women assert their legal right to go both braless and shirtless.\n\nGoing braless during the current decade has according to some been politicized by No Bra Day, and the association between going braless and breast cancer screening has drawn criticism.\n\nThe tabloid website TMZ posted an item about \"Happy No Bra Day\" with an image of Selena Gomez wearing a see-through top. Another site featured a photo gallery titled \"#NoBraDay: 15 Celebs Who Frolick About With Their Fun Bags Freed\". One of the issues with the concept is that breast cancer survivors who use prosthetics must wear a bra to conceal their disfigurement or wear prosthetics and inserts in their bra to make them appear \"normal\". Some critics have described the event as sexualizing and exploiting women’s bodies while at the same time belittling a serious disease.\n\nJean Sachs, CEO of Living Beyond Breast Cancer, thinks No Bra Day is offensive. \"I mean breast cancer is a life-threatening illness. It has nothing to do with wearing a bra or not wearing a bra.\" Gayle Sulik, founder and executive director of the Breast Cancer Consortium, said, \"But we don't really pay attention to what's going on with breast cancer. That's a hugely damaging impact of this sort of message\".\n\nIn New Zealand, the New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation attempted to repeat the success of a Scottish television breast cancer awareness campaign that educated women about the appearance of their breasts. It featured comedienne Elaine C. Smith showing pictures of typical breasts displaying cancer symptoms. But New Zealand's Commercial Approval Bureau would have likely given the ad showing breasts and nipples for medical purposes an Adults Only classification, requiring it to be broadcast after 8:30 pm. The Breast Cancer Foundation opted to place objects strategically in front of the nipples instead.\n\nOne writer criticized the Facebook site's message \"P.S. Ladies…. Wearing a white t-shirt on this day is not only acceptable, but encouraged!\" as objectifying women's bodies. Some women resist the attempt to politicize their decision to not wear a bra or fetishize their breasts for a cause. One woman commented, \"The reason is that I tried being braless, and I liked it better. It wasn't a political decision, except insofar as everything a woman does with her body that isn't letting someone else dictate what she ought to do with it is a political decision\".\n\n"}

{"id": "20598392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20598392", "title": "Priapus", "text": "Priapus\n\nIn Greek mythology, Priapus (; , ) was a minor rustic fertility god, protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens and male genitalia. Priapus is marked by his oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the \"Priapeia\".\n\nPriapus was described as the son of Aphrodite by Dionysus, or the son of Dionysus and Chione, perhaps as the father or son of Hermes, and the son of Zeus or Pan, depending on the source. According to legend, Hera cursed him with inconvenient impotence (he could not sustain an erection when the time came for sexual intercourse), ugliness and foul-mindedness while he was still in Aphrodite's womb, in revenge for the hero Paris having the temerity to judge Aphrodite more beautiful than Hera. The other gods refused to allow him to live on Mount Olympus and threw him down to Earth, leaving him on a hillside. He was eventually found by shepherds and was brought up by them.\n\nPriapus joined Pan and the satyrs as a spirit of fertility and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid, he attempted to rape the goddess Hestia but was thwarted by an ass, whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses and a willingness to see them destroyed in his honour. The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent erection and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph Lotis until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a lotus plant.\n\nThe first extant mention of Priapus is in the eponymous comedy \"Priapus\", written in the 4th century BC by Xenarchus. Originally worshipped by Greek colonists in Lampsacus in Asia Minor, the cult of Priapus spread to mainland Greece and eventually to Italy during the 3rd century BC. Lucian (\"De saltatione\") tells that in Bithynia Priapus was accounted as a warlike god, a rustic tutor to the infant Ares, \"who taught him dancing first and war only afterwards,\" Karl Kerenyi observed. Arnobius is aware of the importance accorded Priapus in this region near the Hellespont. Also, Pausanias notes:\nIn later antiquity, his worship meant little more than a cult of sophisticated pornography.\n\nOutside his \"home\" region in Asia Minor, Priapus was regarded as something of a joke by urban dwellers. However, he played a more important role in the countryside, where he was seen as a guardian deity. He was regarded as the patron god of sailors and fishermen and others in need of good luck, and his presence was believed to avert the evil eye.\n\nPriapus does not appear to have had an organized cult and was mostly worshiped in gardens or homes, though there are attestations of temples dedicated to the god. His sacrificial animal was the ass, but agricultural offerings (such as fruit, flowers, vegetables and fish) were also very common.\n\nLong after the fall of Rome and the rise of Christianity, Priapus continued to be invoked as a symbol of health and fertility. The 13th century Lanercost Chronicle, a history of northern England and Scotland, records a \"lay Cistercian brother\" erecting a statue of Priapus (\"simulacrum Priapi statuere\") in an attempt to end an outbreak of cattle disease.\n\nIn the 1980s, D. F. Cassidy founded the St. Priapus Church as a modern church centred on worship of the phallus.\n\nPriapus' iconic attribute was his priapism (permanently erect penis); he probably absorbed some pre-existing ithyphallic deities as his cult developed. He was represented in a variety of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens. The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.\n\nAnother attribute of Priapus was the sickle which he often carries in his right hand. This too was used to threaten thieves, doubtless with castration: Horace (\"Sat.\" 1.8.1–7) writes:\n\nA number of epigrams, apparently written as if to adorn shrines of Priapus, were collected in the \"Priapeia\". In these, Priapus frequently threatens sexual assault against potential thieves:\n\nA number of Roman paintings of Priapus have survived. One of the most famous images of Priapus is that from the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. A fresco depicts the god weighing his phallus against a large bag of coins. In nearby Herculaneum, an excavated snack bar has a painting of Priapus behind the bar, apparently as a good-luck symbol for the customers.\n\nAs well as the collection known as the \"Priapeia\" mentioned above, Priapus was a frequent figure in Latin erotic or mythological verse.\n\nIn Ovid's \"Fasti\", the nymph Lotis fell into a drunken slumber at a feast, and Priapus seized this opportunity to advance upon her. With stealth he approached, and just before he could embrace her, Silenus's donkey alerted the party with \"raucous braying\". Lotis awoke and pushed Priapus away, but her only true escape was to be transformed into the lotus tree. To punish the donkey for spoiling his opportunity, Priapus bludgeoned it to death with his gargantuan phallus. In later versions of the story, Lotis is replaced with the virginal goddess Hestia. Ovid's anecdote served to explain why donkeys were sacrificed to Priapus in the city of Lampsacus on the Hellespont, where he was worshipped among the offspring of Hermes.\n\nPriapus is repeatedly mentioned in Petronius's \"Satyricon\". William Arrowsmith, in the introduction and notes to his translation of the work, draws parallels between his hounding of the protagonist and that of Poseidon in Homer's \"Odyssey\".\n\nPriapus is mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Merchant's Tale\", part of \"The Canterbury Tales\".\nDuring a description of a garden that the protagonist, Januarie, creates, Priapus is invoked in his form as God of gardens:\n\n<poem>\nNe Priapus ne myghte nat suffise,\nThough he be God of gardyns, for to telle\nThe beautee of the gardyn and the welle,\nThat stood under a laurer alwey grene.\n\n(Priapus might not suffice,\nThough he be god of gardens, to tell\nOf the beauty of the garden and the well\nThat stood under the laurel, always green.)\n</poem>\n\nPriapus serves to remind the reader, or listening audience, that Januarie's intentions are driven by lust and not love.\n\nPriapus is mentioned in William Carlos Williams's poem \"Paterson\". Priapus is also mentioned in John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\": \"She conducted her house like a cathedral dedicated to a sad but erect Priapus.\"\n\nT.S. Eliot refers to Priapus in his poem \"Mr. Appolinax\" (published in \"Prufrock and Other Observations\", 1920): \"When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States / His laughter tinkled among the teacups. / I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,/ And of Priapus in the shrubbery / Gaping at the lady in the swing.\"\n\nPriapus is also mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov's \"Invitation to a Beheading\": \"Or when you, with eyes closed tight, devouring a spurting peach and then, having finished, but still swallowing, with your mouth still full, you cannibal, your glazed eyes wandered, your fingers were spread, your inflamed lips were all glossy, your chin trembled, all covered with drops of the cloudy juice, which trickled down onto your bared bosom, while the Priapus who had nourished you suddenly, with a convulsive oath, turned his back to me, who had entered the room at the wrong moment.\"\n\nPriap[us] is mentioned as well in Nabokov's \"Lolita\": \"She was the loveliest nymphet green-red-blue Priap himself could think up\".\n\nPriapus' role as a patron god for merchant sailors in ancient Greece and Rome is that of a protector and navigational aide. Recent shipwreck evidence contains apotropaic items carried onboard by mariners in the forms of a terracotta phallus, wooden Priapus figure, and bronze sheath from a military ram. Coinciding with the use of wooden Priapic markers erected in areas of dangerous passage or particular landing areas for sailors, the function of Priapus is much more extensive than previously thought.\n\nAlthough Priapus is commonly associated with the failed attempts of rape against the nymphs Lotis and Vesta in Ovid's comedy Fasti and the rather flippant treatment of the deity in urban settings, Priapus' protection traits can be traced back to the importance placed on the phallus in ancient times (particularly his association with fertility and garden protection). In Greece, the phallus was thought of to have a mind of its own, animal-like, separate from the mind and control of the man. The phallus is also associated with \"possession and territorial demarcation\" in many cultures, attributing to Priapus' other role as a navigational deity.\n\nThe medical condition priapism derives its name from Priapus, alluding to the god's permanently engorged penis.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Historically this part of the population was called Criollo and were privileged but did not have equal rights with the Spaniards, some of them were mixed with Mestizos. Approximately 16,482 Spanish citizens living in Costa Rica for 2009.\n\nThe Spanish immigration began with the exploration of Hernán Ponce de León and Juan de Castañeda along the Pacific coast, soon after led to the native population of this region under Spanish control. Although a small number of colonists settled in Costa Rica because of the small number of Indians who inhabited the region. After independence, the governors were interested in populating the territories with white workers, preferably imported from Europe. After independence, the governors were interested in populating territories with white people workers, preferably brought from Europe, banana cultivation was attracting a lot of capital and labor for the construction of the railway to the Atlantic.\n\nIn the early twentieth century many Spaniards used Costa Rica as a bridge to move to Panama attracted by the construction of the Canal. The events in Catalonia for the same dates Catalan prompted many to migrate to Costa Rica, becoming in a few years a thriving and influential Catalan colony that persists today. This colony, located in San Jose (Costa Rica) came to consist mainly of Catalan, followed by Gallegos, Asturian and Castilian. Currently the Catalans make up most of the community of Spaniards in Costa Rica.\n\nSome Canarians had already settled in Costa Rica, beginning in the 16th century; a Canarian from Lanzarote island, Jose Martinez, was among the first Spanish settlers to arrive in Costa Rica in the 16th century. But large-scale Canarian immigration took place in 1884, when over 8,000 Canarians emigrated to a small town when the Costa Rican government invited Canarian immigration to populate the uninhabited town. \n\nThe mark on the Spanish in Costa Rican society is very large so much ethnic and cultural, about 80% of the white population is overwhelmingly of Spanish origin, and 17% of the population is mestizo (Spanish with native).

First among them is \"Bihari Muslims\". Although most of this population belonged to State of Bihar in India there are many from other Indian states such as U.P. (United Provinces or later Uttar Pradesh). There are still others who had settled in what is now known as Bangladesh in the late 19th century. The second term of reference for this group coined by themselves after creation of Bangladesh is \"Stranded Pakistanis\". In Urdu media in Pakistan and elsewhere this was translated as \"Mehsooreen\" or the \"Besieged\". Another common term is \"Non-Bengalis\", which includes not only the Urdu-speaking but also Punjabis, Pathans and Baloch living in Bangladesh. Henceforth any of the above terms may be used to identify this group depending on the context and history.\n\nBiharis were stateless until 2008 when a judgement by the Dhaka High Court gave them right of citizenship. The judgement does not cover refugees who were adults at the time of Bangladesh Liberation War. \nIn March 2015, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan said that more than 170,000 Biharis had been repatriated to Pakistan and the remaining 'stranded Pakistanis' are not its responsibility but rather the responsibility of Bangladesh.\n\nIn pre-independence British India, there was an Urdu-speaking Muslim minority in the Hindu majority state of Bihar. In 1947, at the time of partition of India, the Bihari Muslims, many of whom were fleeing the violence that took place during partition, fled to the newly independent East Pakistan. They held a disproportionate number of positions in the new country due to the fact that Urdu was made the national language of the new state and as such was, for many Biharis, their mother tongue. This led to much resentment from the native Bengalis, who had to acquire a new language and were at a disadvantage on their own soil.\n\nIn 1971, when the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out between East and West Pakistan, the Biharis sided with West Pakistan, opposed the Bengali demand of making Bengali an official language, and chose to maintain Urdu as the state language as for many Bihari, it was their mother tongue. With covert and later overt Indian support, East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh. During the war there were \"many attacks on the Bihari community as they were seen as symbols of Pakistani domination.\"\n\nThe Biharis were now left behind as the Pakistani army and Pakistani civilians evacuated, and they found themselves unwelcome in both countries. Pakistan feared a mass influx of Biharis could destabilize a fragile and culturally mixed population which shared no similarity with the Bihari; furthermore, the Pakistani government believed that since Bangladesh was still the successor state of East Pakistan, it had to fulfil its duty in absorbing these refugees just as Pakistan (West) did with the many millions of refugees (incidentally, including Bangali) who fled to West Pakistan. Some groups in Pakistan have urged the Pakistan government to accept the Biharis.\n\nIn an agreement in 1974 Pakistan accepted 170,000 Bihari refugees; however, the repatriation process subsequently stalled. \n\nPost-independence Bangladesh scorned the Biharis for having supporting the Pakistan army. With neither country offering citizenship, the Biharis were stateless. Organisations like Refugees International urged the governments of Pakistan and Bangladesh to \"grant citizenship to the hundreds of thousands of people who remain without effective nationality\". \n\nIn 2006 a report estimated between 240,000 and 300,000 Biharis lived in 66 crowded camps in Dhaka and 13 other regions across Bangladesh. In 2003, a case came before a high court in which ten Biharis were awarded citizenship according to the court's interpretation of the constitution. Subsequently, however, little progress was made in expanding that ruling to others. Many Pakistanis and international observers believe the plight of the Biharis has been politicized with political parties giving the refugees false hopes and impracticable expectations. In recent years, several court rulings in Bangladesh have awarded citizenship to Biharis living in Bengali refugee camps, as the majority of these refugees were born there. International observers believe that Bangladesh, as the successor state needs to fulfil its international obligations and grant citizenship to this \"officially stateless\" ethnic group or arrange for the peaceful repatriation to their native state of Bihar, over the border in India from where they originally hail from. ref>. \n\nIn a visit to Bangladesh in 2002 Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf said while he had every sympathy for the plight of thousands of people in Bangladesh known as 'stranded Pakistanis', he could not allow them to emigrate to Pakistan as Pakistan was in no position to absorb such a large number of refugees which shared no linguistic, cultural or history with that of Pakistan. He encouraged his Bengali counterpart not to politicize the issue and accept the refugees as citizens being the successor state of East Pakistan. Pakistani government officials have threatened to deport the more than 1.5 million illegal Bengali refugees living in its country if the issue is not resolved acceptably.\n\nIn May 2003 a high court ruling in Bangladesh allowed 10 Biharis to obtain citizenship and voting rights; the ruling also exposed a generation gap amongst Biharis, with younger Biharis tending to being \"elated\" with the ruling but with many older people \"despair[ing] at the enthusiasm\" of the younger generation. Many Biharis now seek greater civil rights and citizenship in Bangladesh.\n\n\"Of Martyrs and Marigolds\", a novel by Aquila Ismail, highlights the atrocities committed by Bengali nationalists against Biharis during the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\n\n"}

Published by the University of Madras, it is said to be the most comprehensive dictionary of the Tamil language to date. On the basis of several precursors, including Rottler's Tamil–English Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil–English Dictionary, and Pope's Compendious Tamil–English Dictionary, work on a more exhaustive dictionary began in January 1913 and the first forms were printed by the end of 1923. Initially estimated at 100,000, the total cost of the project came to about 410,000. The first edition had 4,351 pages in seven volumes, including a one-volume supplement, which were printed between 1924 and 1939 and had 104,405 words, with an additional 13,357 words in the supplementary volume, totaling to 124,405 words in all.\n\nThe dictionary was reprinted in 1956 and 1982. Work on the revised and expanded edition of the dictionary, being published in twelve volumes, began on 1 May 2003, with the first volume published in 2012 under the vice-chancellorship of K. Thiruvasagam. The revised edition of the dictionary will include words taken from secondary sources like modern and old literary works, newspapers, scientific journals and inscriptions.\n\nAlthough the origin of the Tamil language dates back to antiquity, the first regular lexicon of the language, with words arranged alphabetically, did not appear until the eighteenth century. Lexicons of the earlier period were not arranged alphabetically but metrically, on the basis of the first-letter rhyme, a characteristic of Tamil poetry. \"Agaraadhi Nigandu\" was the first alphabetically arranged lexicon published in 1594. Several dictionaries followed suit, including those by the foreign missionaries, such as \"Palporut Choolaamani\", \"Podhigai Nigandu\", Tamil–Portuguese Dictionary of Fr. Antem de Proenca, \"Dictionarium Tamulicum\", \"Chathur Agaraadhi\", Fabricius's Tamil–English Dictionary, \"Manual Dictionary of the Tamil Language\" (The Jaffna Dictionary), \"Oru Sor Pala Porul Vilakkam\", Rottler's Tamil–English Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil–English Dictionary, Pope's Compendious Tamil–English Dictionary, Classical Tamil–English Dictionary, Tamil Pocket Dictionary, Tranquebar Dictionary, N. Kadhirvel Pillai's Dictionary, Sangam Dictionary, and \"Ilakkiya Sol Agaraadhi\".\n\nWhen the 67,542-words Winslow's Tamil–English Dictionary, which was sourced on the unpublished work of Rev. Joseph Night and Rev. Samuel Hutsings, was published in 1862 by the American Mission Press, it was considered the best lexicon available at that time. This dictionary by Miron Winslow was based on the works of Johann Rottler, which itself was inspired from Johann Fabricius's work in the mid-18th century. Winslow was sent out to Jaffna and then transferred to Madras by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. In both the places, he collaborated with Arumuga Navalar. It had the most number of words of any Tamil dictionary up to the time. The copyright of the dictionary was held by the American Ceylon Mission.\n\nSoon there was a demand to revise the Winslow dictionary. However, the mission suffered from lack of funds due to the closure of the Arbuthnot Bank. Citing lack of scholars in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), it then sought the help of the Madras branch of the Christian Literature Society.\n\nG. U. Pope, upon hearing of these plans, offered to give his collection of material for an exhaustive lexicon of the Tamil language. As he had retired to Oxford to work on the Tamil Classics, he suggested an editor be sent out to Oxford to work with him on the re-issue of Winslow's dictionary. The Government of Madras and the University of Madras reacted positively to Pope's suggestion. However, before any concrete decision could be taken, Pope died in 1907. In 1909, his son came to Madras with his father's papers and gifted them to the Oriental Manuscripts Library, permitting the use of the material for any new Tamil dictionary. In 1910, J. S. Chandler of the American Mission, then residing in Kodaikanal, forwarded a proposal to the Madras government on the new Tamil dictionary project.\n\nWith the Pope's collection it had, the government reacted to Chandler's proposal in January 1911 by appointing a five-member Lexicon committee comprising a representative each from the government, the university, the Madras Tamil Sangam, and the missionary bodies of Ceylon and South India. Chandler, who was nominated by South Indian missionaries, was appointed chairman of the committee and was asked to work full-time as editor of the project.\n\nDetailed discussions took place for the next couple of years, and the University of Madras was made supervisor of the project. The total cost of the project was estimated at 100,000 for a period of five years that the project was expected to take.\n\nWork on the project began on 1 January 1919, with the appointment of three pundits, three clerks and two typists. The scholars included a Tamil pundit, a Sanskrit pundit and one familiar with the other Dravidian languages and Urdu. M. Raghava Iyangar of Ramnad, a Tamil scholar, assumed the leader of the team. Incidentally, the Tamil typewriter used for the project, with a keyboard developed by Yost of the American Mission, was the first to be ever used in an office in India.\n\nWhen Chandler retired in 1922 at the age of 80, about 81,000 words had been compiled. Few more words were added soon, and in 1924 the Lexicon went to press. With the University of Madras holding the copyright, the printing of the work was entrusted to the Diocesan Press (now CLS Press), which had earlier printed the Winslow's dictionary as the American Mission Press.\n\nIn 1926, S. Vaiyapuri Pillai was appointed editor for the project. Further delays resulted in the final volume of the dictionary getting published only in 1936, with Pillai continuing as editor till the project was completed in 1939. In 1939, an additional 20,000 words collected for the Lexicon were published. In 1954, a concise version of the lexicon was published.\n\nThe dictionary was digitised in 2011.\n\n\nIn addition to the delay in publishing, the first volume of the revised and enlarged edition published in 2012 was found to have numerous spelling mistakes, bloomers, and grammatical and typographical errors. A complaint was sent to the Chief Minister's Cell. V. Murugan, one of the members of the expert committee who subsequently resigned, sent a detailed note to the Madras University's Tamil department, listing the errors.\n\n\n"}

Those who come from the Zomi area are considered highlanders). There are many different subgroups of Zo, such as the Mizo, the Kuki, the Chin and a number of other names, who are part of a large group of related Tibeto-Burman peoples spread throughout northwest Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. In northeastern India, they inhabit the states of Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur and Assam. This dispersal across international borders resulted from a British colonial policy that drew borders on political grounds rather than ethnic ones.\n\nThe Zomi people have typical Tibeto-Burman features and are generally of short stature with straight black hair and dark brown eyes. Natively, the Zo speak one of the fifty or so languages that linguists call the Kuki-Chin language group, which is also known as Kuki-Chin (Kuki/Chin), Mizo/Kuki/Chin, or Kuki Naga.\n\nVarious names have been used for the Zomi peoples, but the individual groups generally acknowledge descent from ancestral Zomi. Among the more prominent names given to this group are \"Chin\" and \"Lushai\", generally in Myanmar, and \"Mizo\" and \"Kuki\", generally in India.\n\nIn the literature, the term \"Kuki\" first appeared in the writings of Rawlins when he wrote about the tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It referred to a \"wild tribe\" comprising numerous clans. These clans shared a common past, culture, customs and tradition. They spoke in dialects that had a common root language belonging to the Tibeto-Burman group.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Chin\" is uncertain. Later the British used the compound term \"Chin-Kuki-Mizo\" to group the Kukish language speaking people, and the Government of India inherited this. Missionaries chose to employ the term Chin to christen those on the Burmese side and the term Kuki on the Indian side of the border. Chin nationalist leaders in Burma's Chin State popularized the term \"Chin\" following Burma's independence from Britain.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the generic names Chin and Kuki have been rejected by some for \"Zomi\", a name used by several small groups speaking Northern Kukish languages, including the Zomi. The speakers of the Northern Kukish languages are sometimes lumped together as the Gangte people. Some Zomi nationalists have stated that the use of the label Chin would mean subtle domination by Burmese groups.\n\nThe term \"Mizo\", incorporated in the name of the Indian state Mizoram, was also rejected by the Zomi National Congress.\n\nThey are spread out in the contiguous regions of Northeast India, Northwest Burma (Myanmar), and the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. In India, they are most prominent in Manipur, Nagaland, Assam and Mizoram. Some fifty Zo peoples are recognised as scheduled tribes.\n"}
