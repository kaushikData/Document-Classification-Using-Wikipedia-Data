It involved several highly positioned state officers and politicians, as well as controversial entrepreneurs and lobbyists. The scandal affected the top levels of Czech politics, including Prime Minister Petr Nečas and his coalition government. On 17 June 2013, it resulted in the resignation of the Prime Minister and the cabinet. Nečas also quit as leader of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS).\n\nThe investigation of the case started in early 2012, according to Robert Šlachta, the head of the Unit for Combating Organized Crime. Ivo Ištvan, the Chief Public Prosecutor in Olomouc, confirmed that a total of 400 policemen were deployed in the raid.\n\nOn 13 June 2013, some of the closest advisors and collaborators of the Czech Prime Minister, including Jana Nagyová, Managing Director of the Section of the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic's Cabinet, and Lubomír Poul, Director of the Office of the Government, were arrested in association with unspecified misconduct. Ondrej Páleník, former head of the Military Intelligence Service; Milan Kovanda, current head of the Military Intelligence Service; Ivan Fuksa, former Minister, and Petr Tluchoř, former Deputy, were among the arrested as well. The seat of the Government of the Czech Republic and offices of several influential Prague lobbyists were raided by police. The whereabouts of Petr Nečas after the arrests were not known, however, later he announced that his confidence in Nagyová \"had not decreased\". He also denied speculation about his resignation.\n\nOn 14 June 2013, the Unit for Combating Organized Crime and the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Olomouc announced that Nagyová and members of the Military Intelligence Service had been accused of abuse of power and corruption. Nagyová, one of the closest collaborators of the Prime Minister, allegedly misused the Intelligence Service to monitor Nečas' wife (among others) without the official approval of the Defence Minister in late 2012. Her motives were, according to the police, purely private. Petr Nečas was in divorce proceedings when the scandal erupted.\n\nAdditionally, the investigation targeted an organized group of lobbyists and state officers attempting to influence state institutions for their own enrichment. The Unit for Combating Organized Crime confiscated around CZK 120150m ($7.8m) in cash and tens of kilograms of gold during the raid. Eight people were charged with various offences.\n\nNečas, under pressure from opposition parties and politicians, repeated his refusal to resign. He issued an apology for the actions of Jana Nagyová and denied that he was aware of it. He also announced her retirement from the office. ČSSD, the major opposition party, announced its intention to invoke a vote of no confidence on 18 June 2013.\n\nOn 15 June, the District Court in Ostrava decided to take into custody Nagyová, Páleník, Tluchoř, Fuksa, Jan Pohůnek, former employee of the Military Intelligence Service, Marek Šnajdr, former Deputy, and Roman Boček, former employee of the Ministry of Agriculture. Lubomír Poul was not charged and Milan Kovanda was released.\n\nOn 16 June 2013, Petr Nečas announced that he would resign on Monday, 17 June 2013. \"I am fully aware of how the ups and downs of my personal life currently burden the political scene and ODS ... I want to emphasize that I'm aware of my political responsibility and I draw the consequences from that\", he said.\n\nOn 16 July 2013, the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno decided in favour of three former members of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic, Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the grounds of their parliamentary immunity at the time of their involvement in the case. The three named persons were released from prison. Jana Nagyová and the other suspects were released from custody on 19 July 2013. According to the court, the danger of influencing witnesses has passed, as key witnesses have already been interrogated.\n\nAccording to the Czech news websites, Nečas married Nagyová on 21 September 2013.\n\nIn February 2014, Nečas was charged with bribery.\n\nThe case of misusing of Military Intelligence Service had been trialed by District Court of Prague 1 since November 2014. During the trial Petr Necas himself admitted he requested monitoring of his wife Radka Necasova in 2012 due to security risks connected with his role as PM. \n\nOn 29 May 2015 the court acquitted all charged persons (including Jana Nagyová and military intelligence officers) of those particular charges while saying the monitoring of later PM’s spouse was not considered as any illegal wrongdoing. \n\nThe public prosecutor refused such outcome and appealed immediately after court’s statement. Appeal court (Regional Court of Prague) reviewed the trial in April 2016 and annulled it because the District Court overlooked some evidence. Another trial was held but on 17 June 2016, all charged persons were acquitted of their charges once again.\n\nAccording to the Czech media and political commentators, the case consists of several more or less related parts. A leaked police document based on wiretapping records indicates that spying on the Prime Minister's wife by his managing director was prompted by personal motives and that the relationship between Nagyová and Nečas was more than collegial. \"We see a story that meets the quality parameters of a good Mexican telenovela\", commented the newspaper \"Mladá fronta DNES\".\n\nThe arrests and charging of several deputies were substantiated by the fact that they were rewarded by lucrative posts in exchange for their resignation and loyalty to the party (ODS) during an important parliamentary vote. While the police considers it to be a case of corruption, Nečas claims it was a standard political deal. Nečas found himself among the suspects, as he had promised and provided the bribe to the deputies.\n\nThe large police operation also focused on activities of influential Prague entrepreneurs and lobbyists, namely Roman Janoušek and Ivo Rittig. The investigative authorities raided their offices in association with suspicious activities related to investments made by the Magistrate of the Capital City of Prague and other state-controlled subjects. Both Janoušek and Rittig were outside the country at the time of the raid.\n\nThe police investigation was prompted by suspicion that Libor Grygárek, a former Deputy at the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, was in connection with an organized group of entrepreneurs abusing state contracts (Janoušek and Rittig were among suspected). Grygárek was neither arrested nor charged with any crime at that time. In December 2013, he was charged with misuse of power in 2009. In February 2014, Ivo Rittig was arrested and charged with money laundering in a separate case.\n"}

It is commonly served to guests and business partners at meetings and social events, and has been drunk by Arab people for centuries. It is considered to be a healthy drink largely because boiling water kills of most of the bacteria and viruses that would otherwise cause sickness, and some claim that they offer additional medicinal advantages.\n\nTea is an important drink in the Arab world and is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs, tea denotes hospitality, and is typically served to guests. It is also common for Arabs to drink tea with dates, which acts as a sweetener. It owes its popularity to its social nature; tea is one of the most important aspects of hospitality and business etiquette in Arab culture. Importantly, one should not reject tea when offered, because it can be considered rude.\n\nThere are many different types of Arabic tea:\n\n\nTea in the Arab world is usually a strong dark mix, similar to the so-called \"breakfast tea\" served in other parts of the world. Often brewed with sugar and served in long glasses, it can also be made with mint or cardamom, or with a dash of milk. In Yemen, black tea is brewed in water and milk.\n\n"}
{"id": "26778610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26778610", "title": "Cartoon violence", "text": "Cartoon violence\n\nCartoon violence is the representation of violent actions involving animated characters and situations. This may include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted.\n\nPeople have different views about cartoons and the violence within them. Some researchers believe that high level of violence in cartoons can make children more aggressive. Their studies also found that young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. Output aimed at children as young as seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the highest levels of violence.\n\nSome researches on the other hand believe that people need to consider the ways in which children process information, the amount of mental effort they invest, and their own life experience to gain an understanding of how television violence affects children. For instance recent research has indicated that children do not appear to mimic acts of violence in the media, whether television or cartoons.\nBlumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz argue that children possess the ability to differentiate real life from animation, as well as the ability to understand right from wrong. They know that violent acts qualify as immoral and infringe on the welfare of others, therefore the violence witnessed in cartoons will register as \"make believe\" to children and will not be applied into their real lives.\n\nThere are a number of ways parents can control their children’s exposure to violence. One of the most effective and common ways of prevention is restricting the amount and types of programs children watch. With older children, parents might want to discuss, and explain television. This can help children to understand television material and overcome the effect TV violence has on their outlook and behaviors.\n\nThree initiatives have been put in place to combat violence in cartoons (). The first is The Children's Television Act which requires broadcasters to air shows which are educational and provide information for the children. The second initiative is the V-chip legislation that gives parents the opportunity to block out violent shows from their television. The third legislation against violent cartoons is the National Cable Television Association’s TV Parental Guidelines, which is a system that rates the Television shows based on their contents\n\nIn action-adventure oriented cartoons, the most consistent avenue of addressing violence is the use of a form of fantasy violence in which no one is injured or killed onscreen. In science fiction cartoons, for example, enemy forces are typically said to be robots so that they may be destroyed in bulk by the heroes without concern over killing living beings. In cases where vehicles are known to be piloted by living beings, tanks, aircraft, and other war vehicles that are destroyed in combat always allow time for the pilot to escape or bail out. Realistic firearms are often replaced with futuristic beam weapons which still seldom hit anyone. Swords and other bladed weapons may be prohibited from being used as offensive weapons but may be used defensively or be depicted as magical weapons. Direct violence is frequently limited to hand to hand combat where directly kicking or punching another character may or may not be allowed. The majority of action adventure cartoons over the past decades have used these methods of depicting dynamic action scenes although their use has been heavily criticized as \"sanitized violence\". Cartoons based on the Voltron, Transformers, G.I. Joe, and Masters of the Universe franchises (especially the versions produced during the 1980s) are notable examples using variations on fantasy violence.\n\nAdditionally, parents should limit the total screen time for children older than two years of age to no more than one to two hours per day. Children under two years of age should avoid watching television altogether. Televisions should be kept out of children’s bedrooms and parents should watch television with their children and discuss the content.\n\nHealth practitioners can also play their part by taking the time to ask their young patients how much time per day they spend with entertainment media and if there is a television or computer with Internet access in their bedroom.\n\nEffects of cartoon violence on youth remain controversial. Research has generally been divided on this issue with no consensus reached regarding the effects of violence on behavior. That being said, the impact of exposure to violence may remain regardless of whether children choose to imitate it.\n"}

On the other, casualty prediction is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths that might occur in a planned or potential battle or natural disaster.\n\nMeasures used to imply casualties include:\n\nMeasurement and signature intelligence alone cannot give a reasonable estimate of casualties. What Spectroscopic MASINT can do is help find mass graves. Geophysical MASINT can help localize metal and possibly bodies at that site. TECHINT is needed if there are weapons or artifacts to analyze. IMINT has a role to play in tracking movements. These all have to combine with all-source analysis. Perhaps the losses of tanks and aircraft, if available, might better predict what actually happened in a battle. MASINT's mass graves capability is a means that has been used for remote sensing of clandestine mass graves.\n\nAuthor Sam Adams' book, \"War of Numbers\" discusses, in great detail, a process of casualty estimation. Adams was a CIA analyst who eventually resigned over what he felt was political manipulation of casualty figures in the Vietnam War. He explains how he came up with casualty figures for the NLF and PAVN. Adams, and other U.S. analysts dealing with a guerilla war in jungle, found there were better metrics than \"body count\". David Hackworth, for example, used number of enemy weapons captured after an engagement, and that turned out to be a good predictor of casualties, with certain limits.\n\nRecent advances are improving the speed and accuracy of loss estimates immediately after earthquakes (within less than an hour) so that injured people may be rescued more efficiently. After major and large earthquakes, rescue agencies and civil defense managers rapidly need quantitative estimates of the extent of the potential disaster, at a time when information from the affected area may not yet have reached the outside world. For the injured below the rubble every minute counts.\nTo rapidly provide estimates of the extent of an earthquake disaster is much less of a problem in industrialized than in developing countries. This article focuses on how one can estimate earthquake losses in developing countries in real time.\n\n\n"}

The age of consent is 18.\n\nUNICEF reported in 2015 that one in four girls and one in ten boys in Nigeria had experienced sexual violence before the age of 18. According to a survey by Positive Action for Treatment Access, over 31.4 percent of girls there said that their first sexual encounter had been rape or forced sex of some kind.\n\nThe Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development reported that 1,200 girls had been raped in 2012 in Rivers, a coastal state in southeastern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, six out of ten children in Nigeria experience emotional, physical or sexual abuse before the age of 18, with half experiencing physical violence.\n\nConditions that increases the risk of girl-child sexual assault in Nigeria can be found in schools, baby factories and the practice of child labour. Studies conducted in Nigeria disclose that young girls are victims in majority of reported assault cases in hospitals. A four-year review of sexual assault cases at LASUTH that began in 2008 and ended in December 2012, showed that out of a total 287 reported cases of sexual assault, 83% of the victims were below the age of 19. A one-year survey conducted at Enugu State University Teaching Hospital between 2012 and 2013 revealed that 70% of sexual assault victims were under the age of 18. In the Enugu survey, majority of the victims knew their perpetrators and the assault occurred inside uncompleted buildings and the victims or perpetrators residence.\n\nOne of the traditional means of socialization of children is through trading. However, the introduction of young girls into street trading increases the vulnerabilities of the girls to sexual harassment. Sexual abuse of young girls in Nigeria is linked child labour.\n\nReligious and communal stigma associated with surrogacy and adoption has created a rise in baby factories in Nigeria. A large number of female victims in the baby factories are young adolescents. Operators of the baby factories mostly prey on pregnant young girls who are from lower income households, unmarried and are afraid of the public stigma associated with teenage pregnancy. Though, majority of the girls who enter the factory are pregnant some of girls in the factories were kidnapped or bartered to the operators. These girls are then raped solely for the purpose of procreation.\n\n\n"}

Colombia signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 and later ratified the CRC on September 2, 1990. Internally issues related to children are mostly under the \"Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar\", or the ICBF, which is translated as the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare.\n\nThe average school-leaving age in Colombia is 12. The numerous internal conflicts in which Colombia has been involved, has used children for combat related duties throughout the years, as well as political, social and economic instability have pushed for child labor. More recently the current internal armed conflict, while the government enforces the enlistment of adults in the military under the legal age, 18-year-olds, the guerrillas and paramilitary groups resort to the recruitment, sometimes forced, of children for combat. Between 11,000 and 14,000 children are estimated to be involved with left-wing guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries in Colombia. According to Human Rights Watch, \"Approximately 80 percent of child combatants in Colombia belong to one of the two left-wing guerrilla groups, the FARC or ELN. The remainder fights in paramilitary ranks.\"\n\nMoreover the children are also affected by the violence of war and the forced displacement that has come with it. Colombia has one of the highest number of victims of land mines in the world, most of the victims being children.\n\nIn 2002, FARC guerrillas kidnapped presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt and secretary Clara Rojas. A general rumor spread that Rojas was pregnant in captivity after a relationship with a guerrilla leader. This was later confirmed by John Frank Pinchao, a policeman who was also in captivity under the FARC along Betancourt and Rojas and escaped. Pinchao said that Rojas had a child in captivity named Emmanuel and he was being raised by the guerrillas.\n\nChild pornography and sexual exploitation are issues in Colombia. Children are mainly affected by poverty and end up in local brothels; others are placed into regional and international prostitution trade networks. These networks are often run by bigger cartels associated to illegal drug trade, weapons smuggling, and counterfeiting.

{"id": "215861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215861", "title": "Defence of property", "text": "Defence of property\n\nThe defence of property is a common method of justification used by defendants who argue that they should not be held liable for any loss and injury that they have caused because they were acting to protect their property. Courts have generally ruled that the use of force may be acceptable.\n\nGenerally, see self-defence in English law. In addition to the right of self-defence at common law, section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 states that\n\nInsofar as an attack on property is a crime, reasonable force may be used to prevent the crime or to arrest the offender, whether it be theft of a sum of money or the damage of an object. In many cases of robbery and burglary, the threat will be to both a person and property, and this combination can be a powerful defence. In \"AG's Reference (No 2 of 1983)\" (1984) 1 AER 988 Lane CJ. held that a defendant who manufactured ten petrol bombs to defend his shop during the Toxteth Riots could set up the defence of showing that he possessed an explosive substance \"for a lawful purpose\" if he could show he acted to protect himself or his family or property by means he believed reasonably necessary to meet the attack. In theory, the defence of property by itself cannot reasonably provide a justification for inflicting serious injury, but there are a number of cases approving considerable violence to arrest criminals threatening property.\n\nAlthough \"R v Scully\" (1824) 171 ER 1213 held that it was not justifiable to shoot an intruder merely to arrest him, on the facts, “the life of the prisoner was threatened, and if he considered his life in actual danger, he was justified in shooting the deceased as he had done; but if, not considering his own life in danger, he rashly shot this man, who was only a trespasser, he would be guilty of manslaughter.” See self-defence (Australia) for a comparative view on whether the use of excessive force causing death should give rise to a mitigatory defence and \"Reform\" below. In \"Mead and Belt's Case\" (1823) 68 ER 1006. Holroyd J. instructed a jury that violence could not be used against a civil trespasser, adding: “But, the making an attack upon a dwelling, and especially at night, the law regards as equivalent to an assault on a man's person; for a man's house is his castle and therefore, in the eye of the law, it is equivalent to an assault.\"\n\nOne recent case on using force against a burglar is \"Anthony Martin v R\" (2001) EWCA 2245, which resulted in the householder being convicted. As the law currently stands, a person in possession can use no more force than they reasonably believe necessary to remove a trespasser from the premises. Further, where the threat to the land or its possession is not immediate, and other measures could be taken that would make force unnecessary (e.g., calling the police or seeking remedies through the courts) the defence will normally be lost. But in \"Chamberlain v Lindon\" (1998) 1 WLR 1252 Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right-of-way, honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of protecting his property (and, incidentally, avoiding litigation). It was held that it was not necessary to decide whether Lindon’s action was justified as a matter of civil law.\n\nFor the purpose of the criminal law, what mattered was whether Lindon believed that his actions were reasonable. Although this case is on the specific interpretation of the statutory defence under s5 Criminal Damage Act 1971, the fact that the defendant was not out of time after nine months of inaction is interesting. On a similar statutory defence, \"DPP v Bayer and Others\" (2004) 1 Cr. App. R. 493 dealt with defence of private property as a defence to aggravated trespass under section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.\n\nThe court held that if defendants argued they had used reasonable force to defend property from actual or imminent damage that would constitute a criminal act, then the court had to consider whether, on the facts as the defendants honestly believed them to be, the force used was reasonable in all the circumstances.\n\nThe defence of \"private defence\" or \"protective force,\" when unlawful force is used or threatened against a person who may use proportionate force to defend persons or property, is distinguished from the line of authority concerned with a similar defence against trespassers. In the Law Commission's Report No. 218 \"Offences Against the Person and General Principles\" (1993) at pp 106–110) these defences are set out (so far as they relate to defence of property) as follows:\n\nCastle Doctrine\n\n"}

It is a standalone expansion pack following \"Dishonored 2\", and was released 15 September 2017 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It follows former-assassin Billie Lurk as she finds her mentor Daud and aids in his quest to kill the Outsider, a supernatural being who bestows magical powers on a select few.\n\nThe gameplay is more or less the same as in \"Dishonored\" and \"Dishonored 2\". The player is equipped with a short sword. If the player sneaks up on a foe, they can stab them to death quickly and quietly. The player also has other gear, such as a wrist-mounted crossbow, land mines, and grenades. A new piece of gear in this game is the hook mine, which grabs a nearby enemy and knocks them unconscious.\n\nAfter the first mission, the player gains access to three supernatural abilities. Unlike previous games in the series, the player does not purchase them with \"runes\"; they are all fully unlocked from the start. These abilities cost energy to use, but unlike in the previous games, the player's energy regenerates fully on its own; there are no energy-replenishing consumables.\n\nLurk's main mobility power is \"Displace\", which allows her to set a marker in the world, and then teleport that marker at any time. \"Semblance\" allows the player to take the faces of living NPCs and use them as a temporary disguise, though they can only take a character's face once. The disguise drains power as the player moves, but not when they are standing still. Using Semblance on specific named NPCs may produce unique interactions. Completing the game unlocks an \"original game plus\" mode, where the player has access to some powers featured in \"Dishonored 2\".\n\nAs in the previous games, the player can collect \"bonecharms\", which are scattered throughout the levels. Wearing a bonecharm provides minor upgrades to the player's abilities.\n\nDuring missions, the player may pick up optional \"Contracts\" at black markets, which are side missions that involve doing tasks such as assassinating another character. In one example, the character is tasked with killing a mime and making it look like a suicide.\n\nAfter the events of \"Dishonored 2\", Emily Kaldwin is reinstated as empress and begins to salvage the Empire previously broken by Delilah's rule. Billie Lurk wakes aboard her ship, the Dreadful Wale, having a recurring nightmare regarding her right arm and eye. Billie has tracked down her old mentor Daud's whereabouts to a boxing club in Albarca Baths. She makes her way to Daud's location, finding that the boxing club is run by a Void-worshiping cult called the Eyeless.\n\nLurk witnesses Daud being restrained by a special device that cancels out his Void-given powers. She disables the device, thereby freeing Daud. Daud is happy to see Billie and asks for her help in one last job: killing the Outsider, to which Lurk agrees. On board the Dreadful Wale, Daud explains that the Eyeless are in possession of a ritual knife, a special blade that was originally used to create the Outsider thousands of years ago. Daud surmises that the blade will allow Billie to kill the Outsider. Billie is then visited by the Outsider, who gives her a cryptic message, whilst simultaneously replacing her right arm with a Void-made arm, and her eye with a special red artifact, the Sliver of the Eye. The arm gives Lurk supernatural abilities.\n\nBillie makes her way into the city once again to investigate the leadership of the Eyeless. Upon figuring out the identities of the leaders, Billie steals two keys to a safety deposit box in Karnaca's largest bank. She is able to infiltrate the bank and steal the knife, while also discovering that one of the Eyeless' leaders attempted to abandon the group and hid important documents in the Royal Conservatory. Once Billie retrieves the knife, the Outsider appears and explains that he knows more than most, revealing that Daud had died of natural causes aboard the Dreadful Wale while Billie was on the heist, much to her dismay. She returns to the Dreadful Wale and cremates her mentor's deceased body, thus also burning down the Dreadful Wale (an anagram of 'Farewell Daud').\n\nBillie then infiltrates the Royal Conservatory, where she finds the documents. They detail the location of a Void portal at an abandoned mine outside Karnaca. Billie travels to the mine, which is now overseen and operated by the Cult that originally created the Outsider. The Cult members discuss occult sciences while marveling at the Void creatures walking about near the dig site. Billie learns from their notes that the Mark of the Outsider is actually his name, written in an esoteric script that only the dead can read. Billie makes her way to an artifact called the Eye of the Dead God and absorbs it, allowing her to safely enter the Void portal.\n\nOnce inside the Void, Billie makes her way to the Ritual Hold, where the Outsider resides. There she finds the Outsider, seemingly bound and immobile. Billie is then given a choice, to either return the Outsider to the mortal realm by having Daud's Void spirit pronounce the Outsider's real name to him, or to use the ritual knife to kill the Outsider. Either way, the Outsider is displaced, and Billie acknowledges that with the Outsider gone, the world will be changed in innumerable ways. However, the Void will continue to exist and there is no longer anybody who can decide who will gain its power.\n\nDinga Bakaba, lead designer of \"Dishonored 2\", was one of the initial voices for making the \"Death of the Outsider\" standalone. The game removes the chaos system featured in previous games, which tracked how many characters the player killed and altered the world depending on if the player had a high bodycount. Developers felt that removing the need to find elixirs, which were previously required to fully restore energy, encouraged players to experiment more with the full range of powers. Giving all the powers at once was \"liberating\" for Arkane, as they knew the full extent of what any player could do at any point in the game. Time restraints meant that levels couldn't all be \"themed\" in the same way \"Dishonored 2\"s levels were, though some levels are intended to make the player rely on different powers than others. Co-creative director Harvey Smith had immediate concerns about the semblance power when it was first pitched, as he felt implementing the idea appropriately would take an excessive amount of work; ultimately the full extent and ramifications of the power were reduced to more \"manageable\" levels, and Smith was glad for its inclusion.\n\n\"Death of the Outsider\" is meant to bring an end to \"the Kaldwin era\", an arc that began in the first \"Dishonored\" with the assassination of Jessamine Kaldwin and followed characters involved with it, such as Corvo Attano and Emily Kaldwin.

Marks praised the \"wonderfully detailed\" levels and the encouragement to use abilities more liberally, though expressed mixed feelings at the removal of the Chaos system and lack of character progression. Alessandro Fillari at \"GameSpot\" gave the game a positive review, praising the level design and individual missions, while also criticizing the story, stating that \"while starting strong, the story eventually runs out of steam.\"\n\n\"GamesRadar+\" ranked it 19th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.\n\nThe game was nominated for Best Expansion in \"PC Gamer\" 2017 Game of the Year Awards.\n"}

Many live in the village of Potapovo in Krasnoyarsk Krai in western Siberia near the Arctic Circle. According to the 2010 Census, there are 227 Enets in Russia.

They still speak their language, but education is in Russian so there is fear they may lose their language.\nBritish travel writer Colin Thubron visited the town of Potapovo in the late 1990s and found the Entsi deculturated and demoralized, beset with problems of alcoholism. The reindeer collective established in Nikita Khrushchev's day had been severely impacted by acid rain from the nickel smelters at Norilsk. A fur farm that raises fox was similarly diminished. About half the population was unemployed with a few employed in reindeer herding on the west side of the river, the remainder living by fishing in the Yenisei River. Fisherman from Potapovo sometimes catch red sturgeon and \"Omul\", a type of salmon, as well as char, gang fish, and northern pike. Thubron mentions a salted muksun fish product.\n\nSome social services continue to be provided by the Russian government: a small hospital, with a doctor and a few nurses; schools (although older children must attend in Dudinka to the north); and small Russian government pensions.

The term, as used in this article refers in a more restricted way to \"bidirectional\" communication networks, and to technology-based networks. Early networks such as international mail and unidirectional communication networks, such as radio and television, are described elsewhere.\n\nThe first global network was established using electrical telegraphy and global span was achieved in 1899. The telephony network was the second to achieve global status, in the 1950s. More recently, interconnected IP networks (principally the Internet, with estimated 2.5 billion users worldwide in 2014 ), and the GSM mobile communication network (with over 6 billion worldwide users in 2014) form the largest global networks of all.\n\nSetting up global networks requires immensely costly and lengthy efforts lasting for decades. Elaborate interconnections, switching and routing devices, laying out physical carriers of information, such as land and submarine cables and earth stations must be set in operation. In addition, international communication protocols, legislation and agreements are involved.\n\nGlobal networks might also refer to networks of individuals (such as scientists), communities (such as cities) and organizations (such as civil organizations) worldwide which, for instance, might have formed for the management, mitigation and resolval of global issues.\n\nCommunication satellites are an important part of global networks. However, there are specific low Earth orbit (LEO) global satellite constellations, such as Iridium, Globalstar and Orbcomm, which are comprised by dozens of similar satellites which are put in orbit at regularly spaced positions and form a mesh network, sometimes sending and receiving information directly among themselves. Using VSAT technology, satellite internet access has become possible.\n\nIt is estimated that 80% of the global mobile market uses the GSM standard, present in more than 212 countries and territories. Its ubiquity makes international roaming very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. In order to achieve this, these networks must be interconnected by way of peering arrangements, and therefore the GSM network is a truly global one.\n\nThe telegraph and telex communication networks have been phased out, so interconnection among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice telephony and digital data networks, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as VoIP (voice over IP). Mobile communication (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, because the majority of 21st century cell phones have both voice and data (internet navigation and emailing) capabilities.\n\nDigital global networks require huge carrying capacity in the main backbones. This is currently achieved by fiber optic cables.\n\nThe Canadian sociologist Marshall McLuhan was the first to forecast the huge impact of the matrix of global networks upon society, coining the term global village. His work, however, related to radio and television networks, which are broadcast (unidirectional) networks, thus predating the much larger impact of the internet.\n\nGlobal networks have revolutionized human communication several times. The first to do so was the electrical telegraph. Its impact was so large that it has been dubbed the Victorian Internet. It was expanded many times in its coverage with the advent of radiotelegraphy, and with text messaging using telex machines.\n\nThe Internet and mobile communication networks have made possible entirely new forms of social interaction, activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access, and instant communication from any connected point to another. Thus, its social impact has been, and still is, enormous. Finally, the impact on governance have been significant facilitating the emergence of 'transnational policy networks' \n"}

Some sources claim an estimation of 60,000 people of Iraqi descent living in the Netherlands. The Iraqi community in the Netherlands is the 4th largest and has the highest percentage of qualified and professional people and artistes who have integrated well and have become useful members of the Dutch society.\n\nThe first wave of immigrants was in 1992, the data confirm duo this phenomenon, which rose gradually to reach a peak in 1998. 19.5 per cent of the interviewees from study report came in that year. While 13.5 per cent in 1999. However, numbers have decreased in 2003 and 2004, which was 1 per cent, and in 1992, the proportion was 2 per cent.\n\nThe Iraqi community in the Netherlands has increased from 8,000 in 1995 to approximately 40,000 in 2002. Apart from this group, there is an unknown number of Iraqis illegally staying in the Netherlands.\n\nThe main motives of the Iraqi migration are political asylum seeking resulting previous conditions in Iraq regarding the nature of the former regime, and the circumstances of successive wars and the economic embargo which was imposed on Iraq.\n\nA recent study report, shows that two-thirds of the Iraqi community in the Netherlands are young and well qualified to work in the various fields of life. However, many of which are unemployed despite being well educated. The level of integration of the Iraqi community with the Dutch people is noticeably low. It amounts to a quarter out of the standards of social integration. The level of mastery of the Dutch language and of the participation in the social and political activities is quite low. The commitment to the mother culture with its Islamic, Arab and Iraqi references is quite high.\nJudging by gender of the Iraqi population, it has been assessed that 60 per cent are males and females account for 40 per cent.\n\nMost of the Iraqi community are younger age groups and qualify for the labor market, the age categories are between 26-35 and 36–45 years, they were 28 per cent for each category. This reflects the new age of the Iraqi community in the Netherlands, which also means that most members of this community are first generation.\n\nWith regard to the marital status, the largest proportion of whom are married is at 58 per cent, this figure represents 53 per cent males and 68 per cent females. Due to a lot of Iraqi women coming to the Netherlands because of family reunification, whether married already or later. The (non or never married) was accounted for 25 per cent.\n\nThere is a good proportion of inter-marriage between members of the Iraqi community in the Netherlands and Dutch or others. The proportion is 12.5 per cent with Dutch people, that was among 13 cases of Iraqi men with Dutch women and 4 cases of Iraqi women married from Dutch men. The rest is refers to some cases with foreigners. While the highest rate of marriage represents 81 per cent of the same country (Iraq).\n\nThere is a high level of friendship relations between Iraqi immigrants and the Dutch people. There is no divergence for Iraqis in accordance with their religious background of both Muslims and Christians to build a friendship with the Dutch. Where equal ratio between them is 70 per cent for each part. While the proportion of the non-believers is 100 per cent, which reflects the overcome on some reservations expressed by some immigrants from religious background.\n\nThe rate of education to the Iraqi community, whether men or women is high and over that with Moroccans, Surinamese and comparing with the Dutch people too. According to the study, the total holding higher degrees (High Institute, Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D.) are 54 per cent. While the rest carry secondary school and below certificates. \nHowever, there was a low proportion of Iraqis who obtained diploma’s and certificates from the Netherlands. The proportion is 21 per cent for various academic levels. But the percentage is higher for a secondary certificate, it is not a high level compared with other graduates from Iraq who made up 69 per cent. That means that most holders of these certificates are younger ages in the community study, or second generation.\n\nThere is a high rate of the unemployment among Iraqi immigrants, 40 per cent of whom are unemployed, compared with only 13 per cent who officially work and 12 per cent free work. Unemployment is also concentrated among people who are higher educated, especially university graduates, while lower percentage is among other educational levels.\n\nThere is a low percentage of Iraqis who use the Dutch language in their homes through their dealings with their children and parents. The proportion was only 17.5 per cent. Meanwhile, there is 47.5 per cent who do not use it at all. According to results of the study, the majority of interviewees (62 per cent) have impression that the Dutch language is (difficult). Compared with 30 per cent of them who felt that it is (reasonable to learn). While only 7 per cent said it is (easy).\n\n\n\n"}

Dougan was running a website that had been critical of Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff of Palm Beach County, Florida. Dougan fled after his home was raided by law enforcement authorities on March 14, 2016.\n\nDougan stated that after the raid on his home, the FBI was following him and his family, so he decided to flee the country. He wore various disguises and snuck into Canada to avoid U.S. Customs, which he suspected had him on a no-fly list. Dougan then took a flight from Toronto to Istanbul, and boarded another flight to his final destination, Moscow, Russia.\n\nIn 2009, Dougan started his website, PBSOtalk.org, and began making public records requests based on tips from readers and anonymous posters on the website. In 2012, he received information and public records, that the elected Sheriff of Palm Beach County was using taxpayer money to take campaign contributors, some with ties to organized crime. After filing a complaint with the Florida Commission on Ethics, the Sheriff was cleared \"because he didn't know it was a violation of the law.\" However, the Commission stated the money he used to take those people to dinner was \"inconsistent with the proper performance of his public duties\".\n\nShortly after the ethics complaint was filed, the Chief Deputy of Palm Beach County filed a lawsuit against Dougan after the Sheriff's office tried unsuccessfully to purchase the web site from Dougan.\n\nIn what was billed as a digital election-day dirty trick the night before the November 2012 elections, an email was sent out to the A-list of voters in Palm Beach County from BurtAaronson.com, a domain owned by Dougan. The email stated that BurtAaronson.com no longer endorsed the Sheriff as a candidate and instead endorsed the other candidate in the race. The real Burt Aaronson, who was, at the time, a county commissioner, stated he was outraged and had no knowledge of the email. He accused Dougan of identity theft, and attempted to have Dougan arrested. The Palm Beach County State Attorney's office, however, determined since Dougan owned the domain, he was legally justified in using it, however, called the email \"outrageous conduct,\" further saying that laws have not kept up with mischief that can be wreaked on the Internet.\n\nIn 2015, Dougan obtained and posted a collection of audio recordings of a Palm Beach County detective speaking to an unidentified woman. The recordings revealed targeted retaliations and investigations against the Sheriff's political enemies, including Dougan, that speak critically of the Sheriff. The FBI and Palm Beach County raid on Dougan's home was motivated by the posting of these audio files, which was deemed to be wiretapping. The other reason listed on the warrant was for suspected hacking, and posting of names, of thousands of names, addresses and phone numbers of law enforcement officers, judges and FBI agents, though the property appraiser claimed nothing was ever hacked. Dougan claimed it was merely a reason to seize his computers and attempt to locate the sources of his information as well as to shut down his web site.\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections, Dougan falsely claimed to have played a role in the leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\n"}

It now follows the Fe y Alegría school model which originated in Venezuela in 1955. It caters to the poor, drawing its students from a wide area. The Inter-American Development Bank assisted in funding the extension of this model to more schools in Bolivia. John XIII graduates contributed to this effort. \n\nJohn XIII took on this model in its fifth year of operation, in 1971, when Alfonso Pedrajas {\"Pica\") helped transform it, introducing to Bolivia a more socialist approach that creates a sense of solidarity and interdependence. He used the slogan: \"Not students who work but workers who study.\" \n\nIn 1976 Pica began admitting girls to the boarding school.

The school along with its utopian vision have been described as \"little new Bolivia\".

Elements of the school model include parent participation, pay in kind for school expenses, use of peasant educators, and physical labor (fetching firewood and water and tending an orchard).

The model spread to Rodeo (1985), Pampa (1987), and Churicana (1988). \n\nColegio Juan XXIII uses a system of student self-government, with a student prime minister and other ministers, to enable students to experience democracy and to expand their social skills. \n\nSimon Education Foundation in 2007 initiated a Pilot Center for Technology Education in Cochabamba at John XIII that has served as a model for six other such centers in Bolivia; their first effort was training electricians.\n\nFacilities include a coliseum, library, audio-visual rooms, two special education classrooms (serving 200 children with disabilities), and 24 ordinary classrooms.\n\nOn 19 November 1991 the National Association of Alumni of John XXIII College was formed, with working groups like \"CEADES Health and Environment\" which works toward improving health and environmental conditions, contributing to Bolivia's social development.\n"}

{"id": "790968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=790968", "title": "Lesbian feminism", "text": "Lesbian feminism\n\nLesbian feminism is a cultural movement and critical perspective, most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s (primarily in North America and Western Europe), that encourages women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and often advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. Some key thinkers and activists are Charlotte Bunch, Rita Mae Brown, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Marilyn Frye, Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, Cheryl Clarke, Gloria Anzaldua, Cherrie Moraga, and Monique Wittig (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of queer theory).\n\nLesbian feminism came together in the early 1970s out of dissatisfaction with second-wave feminism and the gay liberation movement.\n\nIn the words of lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, \"Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the WLM (Women's Liberation Movement) began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian politics, and lesbians in the GLF (Gay Liberation Front) left to join up with their sisters\".\n\nAccording to Judy Rebick, a leading Canadian journalist and political activist for feminism, lesbians were and always have been at the heart of the women's movement, while their issues were invisible in the same movement.\n\nLesbian feminism of color emerged as a response to lesbian feminism thought that failed to incorporate the issues of class and race as sources of oppression along with heterosexuality.\n\nLesbian feminism, much like feminism, lesbian and gay studies, and queer theory, is characterized by the ideas of contestation and revision. At the same time, one of the key themes of lesbian feminism is the analysis of heterosexuality as an institution. Lesbian feminist texts work to denaturalise heterosexuality and, based on this denaturalization, to explore heterosexuality's \"roots\" in institutions such as patriarchy, capitalism, and colonialism. Additionally, lesbian feminism advocates lesbianism as a rational result of alienation and dissatisfaction with these institutions.\n\nSheila Jeffreys defines lesbian feminism as having seven key themes:\n\nLesbian feminist literary critic Bonnie Zimmerman frequently analyzes the language used by writers from within the movement, often drawing from autobiographical narratives and the use of personal testimony. According to Zimmerman, lesbian feminist texts tend to be expressly non-linear, poetic and even obscure.\n\nLesbian feminists of color argue for intersectionality, in particular the crossings of gender, sex, class, and race, as an important component of lesbian feminist thought.\n\nAs outlined above, lesbian feminism typically situates lesbianism as a form of resistance to \"man-made\" institutions. Cheryl Clarke writes in her essay \"New Notes on Lesbianism\" \"I name myself \"lesbian\" because this culture oppresses, silences, and destroys lesbians, even lesbians who don't call themselves \"lesbians.\" I name myself \"lesbian\" because I want to be visible to other black lesbians. I name myself \"lesbian\" because I do not subscribe to predatory/institutionalized heterosexuality\".\n\nHowever, according to \"A Dictionary of Gender Studies\", some lesbians who believed themselves to be 'born that way' considered political lesbians or those who believe lesbianism is a choice based on the institutionalized heterosexuality were appropriating the term 'lesbian' and not experiencing or speaking out against the oppression that those women experience.\n\nIndeed, it could be argued that lesbian feminism pre-empted if not laid the groundwork for queer theory to posit sexuality as culturally specific.\n\nLesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy, and as a lifelong practice but mostly the latter. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women's relationships, and typically, limits their dealings with men.\n\nLesbian separatism became popular in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether mainstream society or even the Gay rights movement had anything to offer them. In 1970, seven women (including Del Martin) confronted the North Conference of Homophile [meaning homosexual] Organizations about the relevance of the gay rights movement to the women within it. The delegates passed a resolution in favor of women's liberation, but Del Martin felt they had not done enough and wrote \"If That's All There Is\", an influential 1970 essay in which she decried gay rights organizations as sexist. In the summer of 1971, a lesbian group calling themselves \"The Furies\" formed a commune open to lesbians only, where they put out a monthly newspaper. \"The Furies\" consisted of twelve women, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all feminists, all lesbians, all white, with three children among them. They shared chores and clothes, lived together, held some of their money in common, and slept on mattresses on a common floor. They also started a school to teach women auto and home repair so they would not be dependent on men. The newspaper lasted from January 1972 to June 1973; the commune itself ended in 1972.\n\nCharlotte Bunch, an early member of \"The Furies\", viewed separatist feminism as a strategy, a \"first step\" period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance personal growth. Other lesbians, such as Lambda Award winning author Elana Dykewomon, have chosen separatism as a lifelong practice.\n\nIn addition to advocating withdrawal from working, personal or casual relationships with men, \"The Furies\" recommended that Lesbian Separatists relate \"only (with) women who cut their ties to male privilege\" and suggested that \"as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits\".\n\nThis was part of a larger idea that Bunch articulated in \"Learning from Lesbian Separatism\", that \"in a male-supremacist society, heterosexuality is a political institution\" and the practice of separatism is a way to escape its domination.\n\nIn her 1988 book, \"Lesbian Ethics: Towards a New Value\", lesbian philosopher Sarah Lucia Hoagland alludes to lesbian separatism's potential to encourage lesbians to develop healthy community ethics based on shared values. Hoagland articulates a distinction (originally noted by Lesbian Separatist author and anthologist, Julia Penelope) between a \"lesbian subculture\" and a \"lesbian community\"; membership in the subculture being \"defined in negative terms by an external, hostile culture\", and membership in the community being based on \"the values we believe we can enact here\".\n\nBette Tallen believes that lesbian separatism, unlike some other separatist movements, is \"not about the establishment of an independent state, it is about the development of an autonomous self-identity and the creation of a strong solid lesbian community\".\n\nLesbian historian Lillian Faderman describes the separatist impulses of lesbian feminism which created culture and cultural artifacts as \"giving love between women greater visibility\" in broader culture. Faderman also believes that lesbian feminists who acted to create separatist institutions did so to \"bring their ideals about integrity, nurturing the needy, self-determination and equality of labor and rewards into all aspects of institution-building and economics\".\n\nThe practice of Lesbian separatism sometimes incorporates concepts related to queer nationalism and political lesbianism. Some individuals who identify as Lesbian separatists are also associated with the practice of Dianic paganism.\n\nThe term \"womyn's land\" has been used in America to describe communities of lesbian separatists.\nElsewhere, lesbian feminists have situated female separatism as quite a mainstream thing and have explored the mythology surrounding it. Marilyn Frye's (1978) essay \"Notes on Separatism and Power\" is one such example. She posits female separatism as a strategy practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women's refuges, electoral quotas or women's studies programmes). She argues that it is only when women practice it, self-consciously \"as\" separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests hysteria). On the other hand, male separatism (one might cite gentleman's clubs, labour unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen as quite a normal, even expedient phenomenon.\n\nStill, other lesbian feminists put forward a notion of \"tactical separatism\" from men, arguing for and investing in things like women's sanctuaries and consciousness-raising groups, but also exploring everyday practices to which women may temporarily retreat or practice solitude from men and masculinity.\n\nMargaret Sloan-Hunter compared lesbian separatism to black separatism. In her work \"Making Separatist Connections: The Issue is Woman Identification\" she stated \"If Lesbian separatism fails it will be because women are so together that we will just exude woman identification wherever we go. But since sexism is much older than racism, it seems that we must for now embrace separatism, at least psychically, for health and consciousness sake. This is a revolution, not a public relations campaign, we must keep reminding ourselves\".\n\nSome of the lesbian feminist groups, however, were skeptical of separatism. As such, a prominent black lesbian feminist group, the Combahee River Collective, stated that separatism is not a viable political strategy for them.\n\nIf the founding of the lesbian feminist movement could be pinpointed at a specific moment, it would probably be May 1970, when Radicalesbians, an activist group of 20 lesbians led by lesbian novelist Rita Mae Brown, took over the \"Congress to Unite Women\", a women's conference in New York City. Uninvited, they lined up on stage wearing matching T-shirts inscribed with the words \"Lavender Menace\", and demanded the microphone to read aloud to an audience of 400 their essay \"The Woman-Identified Woman\", which laid out the main precepts of their movement. Later on, Adrienne Rich incorporated this concept in her essay \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\", in which she unpacks the idea that patriarchy dictates women to be focused on men or to be \"men-identified women. Becoming women-identified women, i.e. changing the focus of attention and energy from men to women, is a way to resist the patriarchal oppression\".\n\nContrary to some popular beliefs about \"man-hating butch dykes\", lesbian feminist theory does not support the concept of female masculinity. Proponents like Sheila Jeffreys (2003:13) have argued that \"all forms of masculinity are problematic\".\n\nThis is one of the principal areas in which lesbian feminism differs from queer theory, perhaps best summarized by Judith Halberstam's quip that \"If Sheila Jeffreys didn't exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\"\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the activists and scholars associated with lesbian feminist theory have been women; however, there are a few exceptions. For instance, political theorist Eugene Lewis, whose critique of patriarchal society explores the parallels between the theatrical mockery of women in the works of C.S. Lewis (no relation) and underground male prostitution rings, describes himself as \"a lesbian feminist in the ideological sense\".\n\n\"Womyn\" along with \"wimmin\" and \"womin\" were terms created by alliances within the lesbian feminist movement to distinguish them from men and masculine (or \"phallogocentric\") language. The term \"women\" was seen as derivative of men and ultimately symbolized the prescriptive nature of women's oppression. A new vocabulary emerged more generally, sometimes referencing lost or unspoken matriarchal civilizations, Amazonian warriors, ancient – especially Greek – goddesses, sometimes parts of the female anatomy and often references to the natural world. It was frequently remarked that the movement had nothing to go on, no knowledge of its roots, nor histories of lesbianism to draw on. Hence the emphasis on consciousness-raising and carving out new (arguably) \"gynocentric\" cultures.\n\nSalsa Soul Sisters, Third World Wimmin Inc organization united lesbian feminists and womanists of color.\n\nAs a critical perspective, lesbian feminism is perhaps best defined in opposition to mainstream feminism and queer theory. It has certainly been argued that mainstream feminism has been guilty of homophobia in its failure to integrate sexuality as a fundamental category of gendered inquiry, and its treatment of lesbianism as a separate issue. In this respect, Adrienne Rich's (1980) classic text \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\" is instructive and one of the landmarks in lesbian feminism.\n\nLesbians have been active in the mainstream American feminist movement. The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the National Organization for Women (NOW) was in 1969, when Ivy Bottini, an open lesbian who was then president of the New York chapter of NOW, held a public forum titled \"Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?\". However, NOW president Betty Friedan was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969 she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a \"lavender menace\" and fired openly-lesbian newsletter editor Rita Mae Brown, and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including Ivy Bottini, from NOW's New York chapter. In response, on the first evening when four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, a group of twenty women wearing T-shirts that read \"Lavender Menace\" came to the front of the room and faced the audience. One of the women then read the group's declaration \"The Woman-Identified Woman\", the first major lesbian feminist statement. The group, who later named themselves \"Radicalesbians\", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms. In 1971, NOW passed a resolution that proclaimed “a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle,\" as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust. That year, NOW also committed to offering legal and moral support in a test case involving child custody rights of lesbian mothers. In 1973 the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism was established.\n\nDel Martin was the first open lesbian elected to NOW, and Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were the first lesbian couple to join the organization.\n\nIn 2014, Old Lesbians Organizing for Change (OLOC) issued an \"Anti-Sexism Statement\" which states, \"Men run the world and women are supposed to serve according to the belief that men are superior to women, which is patriarchy. Patriarchy is the system by which men's universal power is maintained and enforced. OLOC works toward the end of patriarchy and the liberation of all women.\"\n\nIn November 1977 the National Women's Conference issued a National Plan of Action, which stated in part, \"Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding, and the military. State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation.\" \n\nCanadian photographer Deborah Bright created a series called \"Dream Girls\" which challenged mainstream gender-sex identities that the Hollywood industry in the 1980s chose to propagate.\n\nThe emergence of queer theory in the 1990s built upon certain principles of lesbian feminism, including the critique of compulsory heterosexuality, the understanding of gender as defined in part by heterosexuality, and the understanding of sexuality as institutional instead of personal. Despite this, queer theory is largely set in opposition to lesbian feminism. Whereas lesbian feminism is traditionally critical of BDSM, butch/femme identities and relationships, transgenderism, transsexuality, pornography, and prostitution, queer theory tends to embrace them. Queer theorists embrace gender fluidity and subsequently have critiqued lesbian feminism as having an essentialist understanding of gender that runs counter to their stated aims. Lesbian feminists have critiqued queer theory as implicitly male-oriented and a recreation of the male-oriented Gay Liberation Front that lesbian feminists initially sought refuge from. Queer theorists have countered by pointing out that the majority of the most prominent queer theorists are feminists and many (including Judith Butler, Judith Halberstam, and Gayle Rubin) are lesbians.\n\nBarry (2002) suggests that in choosing between these possible alignments (lesbian feminism and/or queer theory) one must answer whether it is gender or sexuality that is the more \"fundamental in personal identity.\"\n\nBecause of its focus on equality in sexual relationships, lesbian feminism has traditionally been opposed to any form of BDSM that involve perpetuation of gender stereotypes. This view was challenged in the late 1970s, most notably by the Samois group. Samois was a San Francisco-based feminist organization focused on BDSM. Samois members felt strongly that their way of practicing BDSM was entirely compatible with feminism, and held that the kind of feminist sexuality advocated by Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media was conservative and puritanical.\n\nIn contrast, many black lesbian feminists have spoken out against the practice of BDSM as racist. According to scholars Darlene Pagano, Karen Sims, and Rose Mason, sadomasochism, in particular, is a practice that often lacks sensitivity to the black female experience as it can be historically linked to similar forms of sexual violence and dominance enacted against black female slaves.\n\nBisexuality is rejected by some lesbian feminists as being a reactionary and anti-feminist backlash to lesbian feminism.\n\nA bisexual woman filed a lawsuit against the lesbian feminist magazine \"Common Lives/Lesbian Lives\", alleging discrimination against bisexuals when her submission was not published.\n\nA number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian feminist activism came out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was anti-feminist, that bisexuality was a form of false consciousness, and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were \"deluded and desperate.\" However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.\n\nNevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a \"fashionable trend\" being promoted due to \"sexual hedonism\" and questioned whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers.\n\nLesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys writes in \"The Lesbian Heresy\" (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to sexually harass women, bisexual men are just as likely to be troublesome to women as heterosexual men.\n\nIn contrast, \"Bi Any Other Name\" (1991), an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Ka'ahumanu considered one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, contains (among other things) the piece, \"Bisexuality: The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Lesbian Feminism?\", by Beth Elliot.\n\nThough lesbian feminists views vary, there is a specific lesbian feminist canon which rejects transgenderism, transsexuals and transvestites, positing trans people as, at best, gender dupes or functions of a discourse on mutilation; or at worst, shoring up support for traditional and violent gender norms. This is a position marked by intense controversy. Sheila Jeffreys summarized the arguments on this topic in \"Unpacking Queer Politics\" (2003).\n\nIn 1979, lesbian feminist Janice Raymond published \"\". Controversial even today, it looked at the role of transsexualism – particularly psychological and surgical approaches to it – in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, the ways in which the medical-psychiatric complex is medicalizing “gender identity”, and the social and political context that has been instrumental in making transsexual treatment and surgery a normal and therapeutic medicine.\n\nRaymond maintains that transsexualism is based on the \"patriarchal myths\" of \"male mothering,\" and \"making of woman according to man's image.\" She claims this is done in order \"to colonize feminist identification, culture, politics and sexuality,\" adding: \"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves ... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.\"\n\nThese views on transsexuality have been criticized by many in the LGBT and feminist communities as transphobic and constituting hate speech against transsexual men and women.\n\nIn her book, Janice Raymond includes sections on Sandy Stone, a trans woman who had worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records, and Christy Barsky, accusing both of creating divisiveness in women's spaces. These writings have been heavily criticized as personal attacks on these individuals.\n\nLesbian feminism is sometimes associated with opposition to sex reassignment surgery; some lesbian feminist analyses see sex reassignment surgery as a form of violence akin to BDSM.\n\nFeminism among lesbians of color emerged as a response to the texts produced by white lesbian feminist authors in the late 1970s. Typically, lesbian feminism at the time failed to recognize issues related to intersectionality between race, gender, and class. Apart from this, lesbian feminists of color addressed the relationship between feminism as a movement and \"ideology of cultural nationalism or racial pride\", as well as the differences found in the prevalent texts. Among the most influential lesbian feminists of color are Audre Lorde, Gloria Anzaldua, Cherrie Moraga, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Kate Rushin, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, Cheryl Clarke, and Ochy Curiel. Audre Lorde addressed how these movements should intersect in her 1979 speech “The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House”. In particular, she stated “As women, we have been taught either to ignore our differences, or to view them as causes for separation and suspicion rather than as forces for change. Without community there is no liberation, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice between an individual and her oppression. But community must not mean a shedding of our differences, nor the pathetic pretense that these differences do not exist.”\n\nBlack lesbian feminism originates from black feminism and the Civil Rights Movement in the beginning of the 1970s. Kaila Adia Story, a contemporary black lesbian feminist scholar, defines black lesbian feminism \"as the thought and praxis of an intersectional gendered and sexual analysis of the world's relationship to queer women of color specifically, both cis and trans\". The prominent authors who were at the roots of black lesbian feminism include Audre Lorde, Barbara Smith, Pat Parker, Kate Rushin, doris davenport, Cheryl Clarke, and Margaret Sloan-Hunter.\n\nBlack lesbian feminism emerged as a venue to address the issue of racism in the mainstream feminist movement, which was described as white, middle-class, and predominantly heterosexual. According to a 1979 statement by Barbara Smith, \"the reason racism is a feminist issue is easily explained by the inherent definition of feminism\", which is \"the political theory and practice to free all women: women of color, working-class women, poor women, physically challenged women, lesbians, old women, as well as white economically privileged heterosexual women.\" Later, in 1984, she extended her views on black lesbian feminism mission to \"a movement committed to fighting sexual, racial, economic and heterosexist oppression, not to mention one which opposes imperialism, anti-Semitism, the oppressions visited upon the physically disabled, the old and the young, at the same time that it challenges militarism and imminent nuclear destruction is the very opposite of narrow.” \n\nMost prominent black lesbian feminists were writers rather than scholars and expressed their position in literary ways. Allida Mae Black states that unlike black feminism, in 1977 the position of black lesbian feminism was not as clear as the position of black feminism and was \"an allusion in the text.\" Apart from this, the position of black lesbian feminists was expressed in their interviews and public speeches. As such, in a 1980 interview published in American Poetry Review, Audre Lorde stated that a \"true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women\", as well as that all black women, whether they admit it or not, are lesbians because they are \"raised in the remnants of a basically matriarchal society\" and are still oppressed by patriarchy.\n\nPat Parker's work reflected the oppression she suffered and observed in lives of other women. In her poem \"Have you Ever Tried to Hide\", Parker calls out racism in the white feminist movement. In her multiple works, including the poem \"Womanslaughter\", she drew attention to the violence Black women experience in their lives. Among others, Parker defended the idea of complex identities and stated that, for her, revolution will happen when all elements of her identity \"can come along.\"\n\nThe Combahee River Collective is a Boston-based black feminist group that was formed as a radical alternative to the National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO) founded by Margaret Sloan-Hunter in 1973. For the organization's members, NBFO lacked attention to the issues of sexuality and economic oppression. The Collective united the women that were dissatisfied with racism in white feminist movement and sexism in civil rights movement. The name of the organization alludes to the Underground Railroad Combahee River Raid that happened in 1863 under Harriet Tubman's leadership and freed 750 slaves. The Combahee River Collective issued a statement in 1977 that described the organization's vision as being opposed to all forms of oppression — including sexuality, gender identity, class, disability, and age oppression (later incorporated in the concept of intersectionality) that shaped the conditions on black women's lives.\n\nIn its \"Statement\", the Combahee River Collective defined itself as a left-wing organization leaning towards socialism and anti-imperialism. The organization also claimed that unlike some white feminist groups or NBFO, the Collective members are in \"solidarity with progressive Black men and do not advocate the fractionalization\" and emphasizing that \"the stance of Lesbian separatism ... is not a viable political analysis or strategy.\"\n\nOther organizations under the stance of black lesbian feminism include Salsa Souls Sisters, formed in 1974 in New York City and considered to be the oldest black besbian feminist organization; and Sapphire Sapphos, formed in 1979 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe more recent art form used to express black lesbian feminist ideas is film. In particular, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, an award-winning black lesbian feminist, made \"NO! The Rape Documentary\" (2006), a documentary that explores how rape is used as a weapon of homophobia. For Simmons, a sexual assault survivor herself, the film was also an exploration of how rape impacted her Black feminist lesbian journey.\n\nChicana lesbian feminism emerged from the Chicana feminism movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this time, Chicana feminism began to form as a “social movement aimed to improve the position of Chicanas in American society.” \nChicanas separated from the Chicano movement began drawing their own political agendas, and started to question their traditional female roles. Specifically, Chicana feminists (see also Chicana literature) started addressing the forces that affected them as women of color and fighting for social equality.\n\nIn \"With Her Machete in Her Hand: Reading Chicana Lesbians\" (2009), the first monograph dedicated to the work of Chicana lesbians, Catriona Rueda Esquibel stated \"Chicana lesbians are central to understanding Chicana/o communities, theories, and feminisms.\" Similarly to black lesbian feminists, Chicana lesbian feminists use literature as a way of naming themselves, expressing their ideas, and reclaiming their experiences flagged with a number of accusations. They are accused of being lesbians, of betraying society by denying men of their reproductive role, and of betraying their Chicana identity by adhering to feminist and lesbian ideologies, both things considered by Chicano culture as \"white\" notions. The key Chicana lesbian feminist thinkers include Cherrie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldúa, Lidia Tirado White, Alicia Gaspar de Alba, Emma Pérez, Carla Trujillo, Monica Palacios, Ana Castillo, Natashia López, and Norma Alarcon.\n\nIn the feminist anthology, \"This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color\", Moraga and Anzaldúa describe the Chicana lesbian feminist mission as follows: \"we attempt to bridge the contradictions in our experience. We are the colored in a white feminist movement. We are the feminists among the people of our culture. We are often the lesbians among the straight. We do this bridging by naming ourselves and by telling our stories in our own words.\"\n\nOne of the foundational concepts of Chicana lesbian feminist movement is “theory in the flesh”, which is \"flesh and blood experiences of the woman of color.\" Specifically, as described by Moraga and Anzaldúa, \"a theory in flesh means one where the typical realities of our lives —our skin color, the land or concrete we grew up on, our sexual belongings—all fuse to create a political born out of necessity.\" In Moraga's article \"La Güera,\" she continues making reference to the theory in the flesh: \"it wasn't until I acknowledged and confronted my own lesbianism in the flesh, that my heartfelt identification with and empathy for my mother's oppression —due to being poor, uneducated, Chicana— was realized.\" Furthermore, this theory incorporates the ideas of finding strength in and celebrating each other's difference as well as reinterpreting the history by “shaping new myths”, and lays in a process of naming themselves but also naming the enemies within oneself to break down paradigms. As Moraga explains in her prose \"Loving in the War Years: Lo que nunca paso por sus labios\": \"in this country, lesbianism is a poverty — as is being brown, as is being a woman, as is being just plain poor. The danger lies in ranking the oppressions. The danger lies in failing to acknowledge the specificity of the oppression. The danger lies in attempting to deal with oppression purely from a theoretical base. Without an emotional, heartfelt grappling with the source of our own oppression, without naming the enemy within ourselves and outside of us, no authentic, non-hierarchical connection among oppressed groups can take place.\"\n\nChicana lesbian feminists challenge traditional forms of knowledge production, and introduce new ways of knowledge creation through new forms of writing. Many Chicana lesbian feminists use what Teresa de Lauretis named “fiction/theory”, “a formally experimental, critical and lyrical, autobiographical and theoretically conscious, practice of writing-in-the-feminine that crosses genre boundaries (poetry and prose, verbal and visual modes, narrative and cultural criticism), and instates new correlations between signs and meanings.” They combine genres such as autobiography, poetry, theory, personal diaries or imaginary interviews. At the same time, Chicana lesbian feminists today navigate and struggle across a variety of discursive contexts (as activist, academics, feminists, and artists).\n\nThrough their literature and art, Chicana lesbian feminists explore their body lived experiences, a fundamental aspect in the construction of lesbian identity. They reclaim the idea of the real body and the physical aspect of it. Chicana lesbian feminists bring into the discussion the conflicts with the concept of \"la familia\", the new \"familias\" they create, and their right to choose their own sexuality. Martha Barrera writes “we are just as valid a \"familia\" as we would be if she were a brown man who I married in the Catholic Church.” At the same time they try to find reconciliation with their \"familia\". Juanita M. Sánchez writes “my father wanted me to go to work my grandmother wanted me to speak more Spanish she couldn't speak English i wanted to make a living selling popsicles on my 1948 cushman scooter nothing turned out like they wanted but my mother did say, “if you want to be with a woman, que le hace, as long as you're happy”.\n\nChicana lesbian feminists confront their lesbian identity with their Chicano identity. This constitutes a central aspect of Chicana lesbian literature. Renée M. Martinez expresses her impossibility to reconcile the two identities: \"being a Chicana and a lesbian, my parents' daughter and a lesbian, alive and a lesbian\", lesbianism “would sever me from everything that counted in my life: homosexuality, the ultimate betrayal of my Mexican heritage, was only for white people.” Moraga writes how “the woman who defies her role ... is purported to be a “traitor to her race” by contributing to the “genocide” of her people ... In short, even if the defiant woman is not a lesbian, she is purported to be one; for, like the lesbian in the Chicano imagination, she is una Malinchista. Like the Malinche of Mexican history, she is corrupted by foreign influences which threaten to destroy her people. […] Lesbianism can be construed by the race then as the Chicana being used by the white man, even if the man never lays a hand on her. The choice is never seen as her own. Homosexuality is his disease with which he sinisterly infects Third World people, men and women alike.”\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24885644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24885644", "title": "Ma'anyan people", "text": "Ma'anyan people\n\nMa'anyan (colonial spelling Maanjan or Meanjan), Dayak Maanyak or Eastern Barito Dayak people are a sub-ethnic group of the Dayak people indigenous to Borneo. They are also considered as part of the east Barito Dusun group with the name Dusun Ma'anyan. According to J. Mallinckrodt (1927), the Dusun people group is part of the Ot Danum people cluster, although later that theory was disproved by A. B. Hudson (1967), who argues that the Ma'anyan people are a branch of the Barito family. The Ma'anyan people who are often referred to as Dayak people are also referred to as Dayak Ma'anyan. The Dayak Ma'anyan people inhabit the east side of Central Kalimantan, especially in the East Barito Regency and parts of South Barito Regency which are grouped as Ma'anyan I. The Dayak Ma'anyan people also inhabit the northern parts of South Kalimantan, especially in Tabalong Regency which refers to the Dayak Warukin people. The Dayak Balangan people or Dusun Balangan people which are found in the Balangan Regency and the Dayak Samihim people that are found in the Kotabaru Regency are grouped together with the Dayak Ma'anyan people group. The Dayak Ma'anyan people in South Kalimantan are grouped as Ma'anyan II.\n\nAdministratively, the Ma'anyan people have just recently appeared in the 2000 census and made up 2.8% of the Central Kalimantan population; previously the Ma'anyan people were grouped together with the Dayak people in the 1930 census.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Dusun Ma'anyan people among others are agriculture, elaborate funeral ceremonies, and having shaman to treat their disease.\n\nIt is said that the Ma'anyan people arrived and settled on Madagascar island in 945 to 946 AD, sailing through the Indian Ocean on 1,000 leeboard sailboats. Based on historical facts, every stone relief in Borobudur tells of the Malay archipelago conditions during the peak of Buddhism period. The Srivijayan, Nan Sarunai and Majapahit kingdom had used the leeboard sailboats throughout its history. It is known that the Srivijaya kingdom did expand its empire covering West Java, part of Central Java and the desperate Empu Sendok from Medang Kingdom which was about to reach East Java in 929 to 947 AD. Therefore, it is possible that scholars and artisans of that time period recorded the events of the Ma'anyan people evacuating in large numbers on leeboard sailboats in 945 to 946 AD on the stone reliefs of Borobudur.\n\nIn the oral literature of the Ma'anyan people, after the Nan Sarunai kingdom was attacked by the Majapahit kingdom, the Ma'anyan people broke up into several sub-group. Among the sub-groups, they are:-\n\nAccording to the Ma'anyan people, before they had begun occupying the current regions, they came from the downstream of South Kalimantan. Although today the East Barito Regency is not part of the South Kalimantan province, that region in the past was the last region to be a part of the Banjar sultanate before it was annexed to the Dutch Indies in 1860. It was a region of the Banjar sultanate that had shrunk and was land-locked as it was surrounded by other Dutch Indies territories.\n\nThe Ma'anyan language shares many similarities with the languages in Madagascar. Examples of Ma'anyan words are:-\nThe organization of the Ma'anyan people is \"Dusmala\" which combines three Dayak people sub-group which are Dusun people, Ma'anyan people and Lawangan people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dayak Ma'anyan Warukin people whom are often referred as Dayak Warukin people are the sub-ethnic of the Ma'anyan people group living in villages such as Warukin, Haus and its surrounding in Tabalong Regency, South Kalimantan. The settlements of the Dayak Warukin are found in regions where its surroundings are Banjarese settlements. The Dayak Warukin in Warukin village in Tanta District, Tabalong Regency are part of the Ma'anyan Banua Lima people. The Ma'anyan Banua Lima people are a sub-ethnic of the Ma'anyan people found in Banua Lima, East Barito Regency. The original name of the people was Ma'anyan Paju Lima. The word \"Banua\" (literally means, continent) came from the Banjar language.

{"id": "4891313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4891313", "title": "Moru people", "text": "Moru people\n\nMoru is an ethnic group of South Sudan. Most of them live in Equatoria. They speak Moru, a Central Sudanic language. Many members of this ethnicity are Christians, most being members of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS). The Pioneer missionary in the area was Dr Kenneth Grant Fraser of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). The population of this ethnicity possibly does not exceed 200,000.\n\nThe clearest communal historical narratives are of attacks by the Azande, particularly those that drove them onto a hill near Lui, raids by slavers from the North. It was loosely part of the Ottoman-Egyptian province of Equatoria, administered by Sir Samuel Baker and then Charles George Gordon and finally Emin Pasha. The Moru area was then part of the Lado Enclave, in the far north east of the Congo Free State, later Belgian Congo from 1894 to 1910.\n\nDr Kenneth Grant Fraser, a physician and missionary for the Gordon Memorial Sudan Mission (GMSM) of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) of England, and his wife Eileen began working in South Sudan in 1920 to improve access to health care, establish churches, and improve education. Fraser organized the establishment of a hospital at Lui and developed a program that trained and equipped medical workers to provide medical care under his direction at the hospital. Leper colonies were created under his direction. He trained teachers and evangelists to serve schools and churches that were established in Moruland along main roads. The buildings also operated as dispensaries. The benefits have included a good quality of education for the Moru people and reform of some harmful indigenous practices and customs.\n\nThe Moru, who belong to the ethnic group which includes the Madi, Lugbara, Avukaya and Logo of Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo, live in the southern part of Mundri County, Western Equatoria, South Sudan. Mundri County is located in Central Western part of Equatoria Region in Western Equatoria Province. It is between 4°N and 6°N of Equator and 29°E and 31°E. There are five main divisions of the Moru, namely: Miza; Ägyi; Moroändri; Kediro and 'Bari'ba, who each live in a distinct area and have their own dialectical differences. Other partial divisions can also be recognised.\n\nThe northern part of Mundri County is inhabited by the Jur cluster, which includes the Beli, Sopi, Mödö, Nyamusa, Wira, Biti and Morokodo. Although they are often erroneously classified as Moru they form a distinct language group, more closely related to the Bongo and Baka. The Moru have received the most attention in the past and Moru Miza was the vernacular used in education and the church throughout the district.\n\nSettlement is in extended family groups surrounded by their gardens. These families are linked together into clans under headmen and sub-chiefs, but there are few physical concentrations of villages. The term village is generally used to describe the people who relate to one centre.\n\nMost families are subsistence farmers depending on rain fed agriculture to produce food for their families. Any surplus may be sold for cash or bartered for products that cannot be produced locally. The staple crop is sorghum which is grown in various field types in association with sesame, cowpeas, bulrush millet and finger millet. Other important crops are groundnuts, maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, okra, pumpkins and various green vegetables. Livestock are kept mainly on the northern and eastern sides of the district. The most commonly kept animals are sheep and goats. Poultry are kept by most households. The number of cattle has increased during the last two decades.\n\nContact with the wild bush is important, and many of the relishes are obtained from wild sources. Hunting and fishing are important economic and social activities. Other wild foods include vegetables, wild fruit, fungi and insects, especially termites. The bush is also the source of building materials, fuel and fibres. The traditional way of cultivation is for close relatives to cultivate together in one area. This is traditionally called a Kätiri, and is traditionally made of segments divided round a central marker such as a large tree or ant hill.\n\nBetween and during economic activities, the Moru spend a lot of time on other cultural pursuits which are of non-economic values. Predominant among the many cultural and social activities are dancing and singing. Both of these activities serve as recreation and realization of cultural values. Drumming, dancing and singing in Moru society are related to the three seasons. The correlation between the drumming, dancing and singing, the three seasonal periods, and general physical and economic welfare of the people, is one of the most interesting features of the Moru society.\n\nFrom January to April, food is abundant, the people are healthy, physical labour is very little, and there is a great deal or idle time. During this time, the dance performed is called \"RUMA\". The number of drums used during this dance is four. The biggest drum is called \"Dugye\" (sometimes also called \"Lari Endre\" ‘the mother drum’), the medium size drum is called Ruma, from which the dance takes its name, and the two small high pitched drums are called \"Lari Ngwa\" ‘Children of the Drum’.\nFrom May to August, when there is a great deal of agricultural economic activities, the dancing is called \"DEGO\". The number of drums used during this dance is one \"Dugye\" and two small \"lari ngwa\". With the peoples' strength sapped by the heavy labours and the assumed or real scarcity of food, the movements or this dance begin slow in relation to the rhythm or the songs which is also slow. The movements progress to Ngala when the movements and steps become considerably quicker and faster. \"DEGO\" dances are infrequent and do not last a complete night.\nFrom September to December the dance is called \"YELU\". The number of drums used is five. They consist of one \"Dugye\", one \"Diri\" (also known as \"Biri\") and three small high-pitched drums \"Lari Ngwa\". The movements which are involved reflect the great health and strength which the people have just acquired as a result of eating freshly harvested crops. \"YELU\" is the harvest season dance.\n\nThe \"Kudi\" and \"Lekyembe\" are harps which play important roles in Moru society. They serve as recreation and realization of cultural values. They particularly play a role during engagement between males and females. They are also used as important instruments for covering long distances and entertainment.\n\nA rattle called \"gara\" is used by women in church or at dances. It is made from a small gourd that has been dried. It has a spherical body and narrow tapering neck with rounded end that serves as the instrument's handle. It is filled with a number of medium-sized seeds, normally okra, inserted through a circular hole cut into the centre of the top, and then resealed.\n\nCATFORD, J.R.

He was stepfather to the late rap artist Tupac Shakur.\n\nShakur was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on August 8, 1950, as Jeral Wayne Williams. At age seven he moved to Jamaica, Queens, New York City with his mother and younger sister.\n\nBy his late teens, he was politically active with the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) and later joined the Republic of New Afrika. He has four biological children and one surviving stepchild.\n\nIn 1970, Shakur started working with the Lincoln Detox (detoxification) Community (addiction treatment) Program, which offered drug treatment to addicts using acupuncture vs the FDA approved drug methadone. He became certified and licensed to practice acupuncture in the State of California in 1976. Eventually he became the program’s assistant director and remained associated with the program until 1978. He went on to help found and direct the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of North America (BAAANA) and the Harlem Institute of Acupuncture.\n\nSince his incarceration, he founded a New York-based organization named Dare 2 Struggle that released a 10-year anniversary tribute album for Tupac Shakur called \"\" in 2006 through music industry veteran Morey Alexander's First Kut Records and Canadian activist Deejay Ra's Lyrical Knockout Entertainment. The album features artists such as Mopreme Shakur, Outlawz, and Imaan Faith. As Shakur explains it, the CD was created in order to motivate, inspire, and challenge black people to struggle against their obstacles. He also recorded a radio PSA for Deejay Ra's \"Hip-Hop Literacy\" campaign, encouraging reading of books about Tupac. Shakur was interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary \"Tupac: Resurrection\", in which he described how he wrote a \"Thug Life Handbook\" with Tupac, expressing an anti-drug and anti-violence message.\n\nShakur was one of six Black Liberation Army members to carry out the Brink's robbery (1981). They stole $1.6 million in cash from a Brink's armored car at the Nanuet Mall, in Nanuet, New York, killing a Brink's guard, Peter Paige, seriously wounding another Brinks guard Joseph Trombino, and subsequently killing two Nyack police officers, Edward O'Grady and Waverly Brown (the first black member of the Nyack, New York, police department). Trombino recovered from the wounds he received in this incident but was killed in 2001 in the September 11 attacks.\n\nShakur, the alleged ringleader of the group, evaded capture for six years and thus was the last one to go on trial on charges related to the robbery. In the 1980s, Shakur and Marilyn Buck were indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges. While at large, on July 23, 1982, he became the 380th person added by the FBI to the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He was arrested February 12, 1986, in California by the FBI. Shakur and Buck were tried in 1987 and convicted on May 11, 1988.\n\nAlthough federal parole was abolished pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Shakur's convictions were exempt because the Act's provisions didn't take effect until 1987. Thus, under the rules in effect at the time of his conviction, he was due for a mandatory parole determination after serving thirty of his original sixty-year sentence, which came in 2016. However, the United States Parole Commission denied his release for unspecified grounds on April 7, 2016. Shakur's next parole eligibility review will occur in 2018, and according to the Bureau of Prison, his sentence will be completed December 15, 2024.\n\n\n"}

The concept is often used in sociology, psychology and linguistics.\n\nNominal identity is the name to which one identifies, or calls oneself (i.e. general \"African American,\" \"Irish,\" \"Straight,\" \"Gay,\" \"Female,\" \"Male\"). Whereas virtual identity is the experience of that identity, \"The latter is, in a sense, what the name means; this is primarily a matter of its consequences for those who bear it, and can change while the nominal identity remains the same (and vice versa).\"\n\nAmong those who self-identify as \"gay,\" the term may not confer the same experience for two people or even between various geographical or cultural regions. Similarly, while one may talk about a \"chair,\" \"chair\" itself can entail many forms, from arm chair to ladder back to even tree stump, if the experience of \"chair\" is something upon which a person sits.\n\nPierre Bourdieu uses the term nominal identity in \"\" to mean both that which the identity of a subject is named and also where identity is an insignificant measurement or representation of the \"perceived reality\" of a subject or phenomenon. To further clarify, for Bourdieu nominal identity can often mean \"face value\" or \"appearance.\" He often mentions the term nominal identity in order to illustrate the idea of a more complex reality, beyond the name, within the studied subject.\n\nEthnic identity is a \"social identity arising through group formation, individual identification with a group, and interaction between different ethnic groups.\"\n\nHenry E. Brady and Cynthia S. Kaplan compiled a study called \"Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity\" that takes a look at ethnicity as a nominal identity. Their study proposed whether or not \"the attitudes of members of the group with the more salient identity can be completely explained by its nominal identity while the attitudes of the members of the group with less salient identity require a graded measure of ethnicity.\"\n\nBrady and Kaplan focused on the country Estonia, where they posited two groups: \"Estonians,\" and one that they call the \"Slavs,\" a collective group of Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. They chose this geographical area in particular because of the \"centrality of ethnicity in the politics of transition in the USSR.\" media usage (such as television, radio, or newspaper, whether it was the Estonia language Republic television or Russian-language media), individuals who identify themselves with another nationality, and the language used at home.\n\nBrady and Kaplan concluded that \"ethnicity is not always a nominal characteristic\" for these two groups in Estonia. It is only nominal when most salient. \"Ethnic identity ... causes individuals within a group to form their attitudes based upon their nominal identity\". Individuals may generalize themselves in a certain category such as their nationality, but when it comes down to variables of different degrees in formulating their ethnicity, it is no longer nominal. It is their way of dividing themselves from a generalized name.\n\nNominal identity in linguistics pertains to the identity of a word or group of words functioning as a noun or an adjective within a sentence's structure. Specifically, it relates to how one can look at a sentence and propose a different understanding of that sentence through the analysis of its identity defined in its lexical construct, such as in the example used by Chris Barker when discussing one of Manfred Krifka's study \"Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events\":\n\"(1) Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year.\"\n\nOn the surface, the proposition suggests that 4,000 distinct ships passed through the lock last year. However, as Krifka points out in his study, one could say that there were fewer than 4,000 distinct ships and that some of those ships passed through the lock more than once. Individuals reading this sentence could argue about the interpretation of this sentence. The outcome could be many interpretations when looking at the sentence more closely and determining what variables were taken into consideration when making this statement.\n"}
{"id": "1209357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1209357", "title": "Nubi language", "text": "Nubi language\n\nThe Nubi language (also called Ki-Nubi) is a Sudanese Arabic-based creole language spoken in Uganda around Bombo, and in Kenya around Kibera, by the descendants of Emin Pasha's Sudanese soldiers who were settled there by the British colonial administration. It was spoken by about 15,000 people in Uganda in 1991 (according to the census), and an estimated 10,000 in Kenya; another source estimates about 50,000 speakers as of 2001. 90% of the lexicon derives from Arabic, but the grammar has been simplified, as has the sound system. Nairobi has the greatest concentration of Nubi speakers. Nubi has the prefixing, suffixing and compounding processes also present in Arabic.\n\nThe Nubi speakers are Kakwa who came from the Nubian region, first into Equatoria, and from there southwards into Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Idi Amin, who was Kakwa, recruited the Kawa and Nubians into his army, to kill the Acholi and Lango.\n\nJonathan Owens argues that Nubi constitutes a major counterexample to Derek Bickerton's theories of creole language formation, showing \"no more than a chance resemblance to Bickerton's universal creole features\" despite fulfilling perfectly the historical conditions expected to lead to such features.\n\nThere are five vowels in Nubi. Vowels are not distinguished by length except in at least two exceptions from Kenyan Nubi (which are not present in Ugandan dialects) where \"bara\" means \"outside\" and is an adverb while \"baara\" means \"the outside\" and is a noun, and also where \"saara\" meaning \"bewitch\" is compared to \"sara\" meaning \"\"herd, cattle\".\" Despite this, there is a tendency for vowels in stressed syllables to be registered as long vowels. \n\nEach of the vowels has multiple allophones and the exact sound of the vowel depends on the surrounding consonants.\n\nSpeakers may use Standard Arabic phonemes for words for which the Arabic pronunciation has been learned. The a retroflex version of the /r/ sound may also occur and some dialects use /l/ in its place. Geminates are very unusual in Nubi. These less common phonemes are shown in brackets. \n\nIneke Wellens gives the following orthography for Nubi where it differs from the IPA symbols: // = sh; /t/ = ch; // = j; // = ny; /w/ = w or u; /j/ = y or i; // = th; // = dh; /x/ = kh; // = ḥ.\n\nSyllables typically have a CV, VC, V or CVC structure with VC only occurring in initial syllables. Final and initial CC occur only in a few specific examples such as \"skul\" which means \"school\" or \"sems\" which means \"sun\".\n\nStress can change the meaning of words for example \"saba\" means \"seven\" or \"morning\" depending on whether the stress is on the first or second syllables respectively. Vowels are often omitted in unstressed, final syllables and sometime even the stressed final \"u\" in the passive form may be deleted after \"\"m\", \"n\", \"l\", \"f\" or \"b\".\" This can caused syllables to be realigned even across words.\n\nNouns are inflected by number only (taking a singular or plural form) although for most nouns this does not represent a morphological change. Jonathan Owens gives 5 broad noun classes of nouns:\nThe table below shows examples of each type of pluralisation. The apostrophe has been placed before the stressed syllable:\n\n\"Nuswan\" may be supplemented by a suffix as if it were type 3, thus, \"nuswana\" could also mean \"\"women\".\" \n\nAdjectives follow the noun and some adjectives have singular and plural forms which must agree with the noun. Adjectives may also take the prefixes \"\"al\", \"ali\", \"ab\"\" or \"abu\" which mark them as habitual. When a noun is a possessor follow the possessed noun and is mark with the particle \"ta\" which is placed between the two nouns. The particle can be emitted in what are called inalienable possessed nouns where it is clear that the latter possesses the former.\n\n\n"}

During his career, Oakland performed primarily on television, appearing in over 130 series and made-for-television movies between 1951 and 1983.\n\nOakland was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the son of Jacob Weiss and Ethel Oaklander. His father was a plasterer and builder. While he later claimed in media interviews to have been born in 1922 (a date repeated in his \"New York Times\" obituary), Social Security and vital records indicate he was born Simon Weiss in 1915; his stage name was likely derived from his mother's maiden name, Oaklander.\n\nHe began his performing arts career as a musician (he was a violinist, an avocation he would pursue during his entire career as an actor). Oakland began his acting career in the late 1940s. He enjoyed a series of Broadway hits, including \"Light Up the Sky\", \"The Shrike\" and \"Inherit the Wind\", and theater was one of his lasting passions. He was a concert violinist until the 1940s.\n\nIn 1955 Oakland made his film debut, though uncredited, as an Indiana state trooper in \"The Desperate Hours\". He next appeared in two films released in 1958: as the character Mavrayek in \"The Brothers Karamazov\" and then in the role of Edward Montgomery in \"I Want to Live!\" The character Montgomery was a real-life journalist, who had reported on the California murder trial and 1955 execution of Barbara Graham, played by Susan Hayward in the film. Oakland's portrayal of the journalist as a \"tough, but compassionate\" personality resulted in the actor's often being typecast in his subsequent roles in both films and on television.\n\nSimon Oakland's notable performance in \"I Want to Live!\" led to his playing a long series of tough-guy types, usually in positions of authority, most notably in \"Psycho\", in which he plays the psychiatrist who explains Norman Bates's multiple personality disorder. He also appeared in \"West Side Story\", \"The Sand Pebbles\", and \"Bullitt\". He made two guest appearances on CBS's \"Perry Mason\", both times as the murder victim. He also appeared in the syndicated crime drama, \"Decoy\", starring Beverly Garland. Oakland appeared once each on the CBS western, \"Dundee and the Culhane\" and in another syndicated crime drama series, \"Sheriff of Cochise\", starring John Bromfield. Oakland played the regular role of General Thomas Moore on NBC's \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\", starring Robert Conrad. He also appeared in two episodes of the original \"The Twilight Zone\" TV series. In 1974 and 1975, he was a series regular on \"\", playing newspaper editor Tony Vincenzo.

{"id": "17796960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17796960", "title": "South Guelderish", "text": "South Guelderish\n\nSouth Guelderish (Dutch: \"Zuid-Gelders\", German: \"Südgeldersch\", \"Kleverländisch\") refers to the easternmost group of Dutch dialects spoken along the lower Rhine (Dutch Nederrijn and German Niederrhein). In its narrower sense, the term refers strictly to the Rivierenlands, Nijmeegs, and Liemers sub-dialects; in its broader sense, the term encompasses also North Limburgish in the Netherlands and Kleverlander (around Cleves; Dutch \"Kleverlands\", German \"Kleverländisch\") and East Bergish in Germany. South Guelderish (in the narrow sense) — especially Rivierenlands — is sometimes included as part of Brabantic, a more widely spoken Dutch dialect and the closest relative of South Guelderish. Alternatively, it is considered to extend southward into Northern Limburg until the Uerdingen line. It is arguably more appropriate to group South Guelderish (narrow sense), North Limburgish, Kleverlander, and East Bergish into one dialect group—East Dutch. \n\nIn the Netherlands, South Guelderish is spoken in the following regions: North Limburg, the Veluwezoom National Park, Rijk van Nijmegen, Land van Maas en Waal, the Bommelerwaard, the Tielerwaard, the Betuwe, Land van Cuijk and Liemers.\n\nThe status of East Dutch differs greatly between the Netherlands and Germany. On the Dutch side, East Dutch is subject to the influence of Standard Dutch. Since it is a Dutch dialect, it is already similar enough to the standard language to have had relatively little influence. In Germany, however, since 1713, when Prussia took control of the area, Kleverlander and East Bergish have been in retreat under the pressure of Standard German to which they are only distantly related. The dialects, mainly in their vocabulary, have been influenced.\n\nFurthermore, large-scale industrialization in the Cleves–Duisburg area in Germany, as well as the resulting immigration, during the late 19th century and the 20th century, has greatly reduced its use today, leaving very few native speakers. For example, in Duisburg (though traditionally within the South Guelderish area), it has virtually died out. (See Duisburg Platt Dialect).\n\nAs noted before, South Guelderish is sometimes included within Brabantic. That is because there exists no tight isogloss bundle between the Brabantic and South Guelderish dialects. Instead, change occurs in two individual steps: the \"alt\"-\"oud\" isogloss, between Groesbeek and Nijmegen, and the \"ies\"-\"ijs\" isogloss, west of Nijmegen.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1602013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1602013", "title": "Tanka people", "text": "Tanka people\n\nThe Tankas () or boat people are an ethnic subgroup in Southern China who have traditionally lived on junks in coastal parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hainan, and Zhejiang, as well as Hong Kong, and Macau. Though many now live onshore, some from the older generations still live on their boats and pursue their traditional livelihood of fishing. Historically, the Tankas were considered to be outcasts. Since they were boat people who lived by the sea, they were sometimes referred to as \"sea gypsies\" by the Chinese and British. Tanka origins can be traced back to the native ethnic minorities of southern China who may have taken refuge on the sea and gradually assimilated into Han culture. However, Tanka have preserved many of their native traditions that are not found in Han Chinese culture.\n\nA small number of Tankas also live in parts of Vietnam. There they are called Dan () and are classified as a subgroup of the Ngái ethnicity.\n\nThe term \"Tanka\" is now considered derogatory and no longer in common use. \"Tank\" is a Cantonese term for boat or junk and \"ka\" means family or peoples. These boat dwellers are now referred to in China as \"on-water people\" (), or \"people of the southern sea\" (). No standardised English translation of this term exists. \"Boat People\" is a commonly used translation, although it may be confused with the similar term for Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong. The term \"Boat Dwellers\" was proposed by Dr. Lee Ho Yin of The University of Hong Kong in 1999, and it has been adopted by the Hong Kong Museum of History for its permanent exhibition.\n\nBoth the Tanka and the Cantonese speak the Cantonese language. However, Tanka living in Fujian speak Min Chinese.\n\n\"Boat people\" was a general category for both the Tanka and the Hoklo, who also made their living on boats. They spoke different dialects, and the Hoklo originated from Fujian. The Hoklo used the term Hoklo to refer to themselves, while the name Tanka was used only by Cantonese to describe the Tanka.\n\nThere were two distinct categories of people based on their way of life, and they were further divided into different groups. The Hakka and Cantonese lived on land; the Tanka and Hoklo lived on boats and were both classified as boat people.\n\nThe differences between the sea dwelling Tanka and land dwellers were not based merely on their way of life. Cantonese and Hakka who lived on land fished sometimes for a living, but these land fishermen never mixed or married with the Tanka fishermen. Tanka were barred from Cantonese and Hakka celebrations.\n\nBritish reports on Hong Kong described the Tanka and Hoklo living in Hong Kong \"since time unknown\". The encyclopaedia Americana described Hoklo and Tanka as living in Hong Kong \"since prehistoric times\".\n\nSome Chinese myths claim that animals were the ancestors of the Barbarians, including the Tanka people. Some ancient Chinese sources claimed that water snakes were the ancestors of the Tanka, saying that they could last for three days in the water, without breathing air.\n\nThe Tanka are considered by some scholars to be related to other minority peoples of southern China, such as the Yao and Li people (Miao). The Amoy University anthropologist Ling Hui-hsiang wrote on his theory of the Fujian Tanka being descendants of the Bai Yue. He claimed that Guangdong and Fujian Tanka are definitely descended from the old Bai Yue peoples, and that they may have been ancestors of the Malay race. The Tanka inherited their lifestyle and culture from the original Yue peoples who inhabited Hong Kong during the Neolithic era. After the First Emperor of China conquered Hong Kong, groups from northern and central China moved into the general area of Guangdong, including Hong Kong.\n\nOne theory proposes that the ancient Yue inhabitants of southern China are the ancestors of the modern Tanka boat people. The majority of western academics subscribe to this theory, and use Chinese historical sources. (The ancient Chinese used the term \"Yue\" to refer to all southern barbarians.) The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, states that the ancestors of the Tanka were native people.\n\nThe Tanka's ancestors had been pushed to the southern coast by Chinese peasants who took over their land.\n\nDuring the British colonial era in Hong Kong, the Tanka were considered a separate ethnic group from the Punti, Hakka, and Hoklo. Punti is another name for Cantonese (it means \"local\"), who came from mainly Guangdong districts. The Hakka and Hoklo are not considered as Puntis.\n\nThe Tanka have been compared to the She people by some historians, practising Han Chinese culture, while being an ethnic minority descended from natives of Southern China.\n\nChinese scholars and gazettes described the Tanka as a \"Yao\" tribe, with some other sources noting that \"Tan\" people lived at Lantau, and other sources saying \"Yao\" people lived there. As a result, they refused to obey the salt monopoly of the Song dynasty Chinese government. The county gazetteer of Sun on in 1729 described the Tanka as \"Yao barbarians\", and the Tanka were viewed as animals.\n\nWolfram Eberhard suggested that the Yueh are related to the Tanka, that the Chinese admixture in the Tanka is due to the Tanka prostitutes serving Chinese, and that the Tanka replaced their own culture with Chinese culture, including the Chinese language.\n\nIn modern times, the Tanka claim to be ordinary Chinese who happen to fish for a living, and the local dialect is used as their language.\n\nSome southern Chinese historic views of the Tanka were that they were a separate aboriginal ethnic group, \"not Han Chinese at all\". Chinese Imperial records also claim that the Tanka were descendants of aboriginals. Tanka were also accused of being \"sea gypsies\".\n\nThe Tanka were regarded as Yueh and not Chinese, they were divided into three classifications, \"the fish-Tan, the oyster-Tan, and the wood-Tan\" in the 12th century, based on what they did for a living.\n\nThe three groups of Punti, Hakka, and Hoklo, all of whom spoke different Chinese dialects, despised and fought each other during the late Qing dynasty. However, they were all united in their overwhelming hatred for the Tanka, since the aboriginals of Southern China were the ancestors of the Tanka. The Cantonese Punti had displaced the Tanka aboriginals, after they began conquering southern China.\n\nThe Chinese poet Su Dongpo wrote a poem in which mentioned the Tanka.\n\nThe Nankai University of Tianjin published the Nankai social and economic quarterly, Volume 9 in 1936, and it referred to the Tanka as aboriginal descendants before Chinese assimilation. The scholar Jacques Gernet also wrote that the Tanka were aboriginals, who were known for being pirates, which hindered Qing dynasty attempts to assert control in Guangdong.\n\nThe most widely held theory is that the Tanka are the descendants of the native Yue inhabitants of Guangdong before the Han Cantonese moved in. The theory stated that originally the Yueh peoples inhabited the region, when the Chinese conquest began, the Chinese either absorbed or expelled the Yue to southern regions. The Tanka, according to this theory, are descended from Yue who preserved their separate culture.\n\nA minority of scholars who challenged this theory deny that the Tanka are descended from natives, instead claiming they are basically the same as other Han Cantonese who dwell on land, claiming that neither the land dwelling Han Cantonese nor the water dwelling Tanka have more aboriginal blood than the other, with the Tanka boat people being as Chinese and as Han as ordinary Cantonese.\n\nEugene Newton Anderson claimed that there was no evidence for any of the conjectures put forward by scholars on the Tanka's origins, citing Chen, who stated that \"to what tribe or race they once belonged or were once akin to is still unknown\".\n\nSome researchers say the origin of the Tanka is multifaceted, with a portion of them having native Yueh ancestors and others originating from other sources.\n\nThe Song dynasty engaged in extensive colonisation of the region with Chinese people.\n\nDue to the extensive sinicisation of the Tanka, they now identify as Chinese, despite their non-Chinese ancestry from the natives of Southern China.\n\nThe Cantonese exploited the Tanka, using their own customs against them to acquire fish to sell from the Tanka.\n\nThe Portuguese, who were granted Macau during the Ming dynasty, often married Tanka women since Han Chinese women would not have relations with them. Some of the Tanka's descendants became Macanese people.\n\nSome Tanka children were enslaved by Portuguese raiders.\n\nThe Chinese poet Wu Li wrote a poem, which included a line about the Portuguese in Macau being supplied with fish by the Tanka.\n\nWhen the Portuguese arrived at Macau, women from Goa (part of Portuguese India), Siam, Indochina, and Malaya became their wives, rarely were they Chinese women. The Tanka women were among the only people in China willing to mix and marry with the Portuguese, with other Chinese women refusing to do so.\n\nThe majority of marriages between Portuguese and natives was between Portuguese men and women of Tanka origin, who were considered the lowest class of people in China and had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors, or low class Chinese women. Western men like the Portuguese were refused by high class Chinese women, who did not marry foreigners.\n\nLiterature in Macau was written about love affairs and marriage between the Tanka women and Portuguese men, like \"A-Chan, A Tancareira\", by Henrique de Senna Fernandes.\n\nTanka. Tankia (tan'ka, tan'kyä), n. [Chinese, literally, 'the Tan family or tribe'; < Tan, an aboriginal tribe who formerly occupied the region lying to the south and west of the Meiing (mountains) in southern China, + kia (pronounced ka in Canton), family, people.] The boat population of Canton in southern China, the descendants of an aboriginal tribe named Tan, who were driven by the advance of Chinese civilisation to live in boats upon the river, and who have for centuries been forbidden to live on the land. \"Since 1730 they have been permitted to settle in villages in the immediate neighbourhood of the river, but are still excluded from competition for official honours, and are forbidden by custom from intermarrying with the rest of the people. (Q&es, Glossary of Reference.)\n\nThe Tankas originally included many refugees to the sea and were considered a non-Chinese aboriginal ethnic group, classified by the Qing government as \"mean\". The Yongzheng Emperor freed them and several other \"mean\" groups from this status in a series of edicts from 1723 to 1731. They mostly worked as fishermen and tended to gather at some bays. Some built markets or villages on the shore, while others continued to live on their junks or boats. They claimed to be Han Chinese.\n\nThe Qing edict said \"Cantonese people regard the Dan households as being of the mean class (beijian zhi) and do not allow them to settle on shore. The Dan households, for their part, dare not struggle with the common people\", this edict was issued in 1729.\n\nAs Hong Kong developed, some of the fishing grounds in Hong Kong became badly polluted or were reclaimed, and so became land. Those Tankas who only own small boats and cannot fish far out to sea are forced to stay inshore in bays, gathering together like floating villages.\n\nAlways there is plenty to see, as the Tanka. the people who live in the boats, are full of life. They are an aboriginal tribe, speaking an altogether different language from the Chinese. On the land they are like fish out of water. They are said never to intermarry with landlubbers, but somehow or other their tongue has crept into many villages in the Chiklung section. The Chinese say the Tanka speech sounds like that of the Americans. It seems to have no tones. A hardy race, the Tanka are untouched by the epidemics that visit our coast, perhaps because they live so much off land. Each family has a boat, its own little kingdom, and, there being plenty of fish, all look better fed than most of our land neighbours. Christianity is, with a few rare exceptions, unknown to them. The only window of our Chiklung house gives the missioner a full view of the village life of some of the boat tribe. The window at present is just the absence of the south wall of the little loft to the shop. Wooden bars can be inserted in holes against robbers.\n\n\"Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America\" in 1921\nBefore leaving the market, by special invitation we had a swim from off one of the sampans (a term used around Canton: here \"baby boat\" is the name). The water was almost hot and the current surprisingly swift. Nevertheless the Tanka men and boys go in several times a day, and wash jacket and trousers, undressing and dressing in the water. They seem to let the clothes dry on them. Women and girls also jump in daily.\n\n\"Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America\" in 1921\n\nMasonry was unknown by the water dwelling Tanka.\n\nThe Tanka also formed a class of prostitutes in Canton, operating the boats in Canton's Pearl River which functioned as brothels, they did not practice foot binding and their dialect was unique. They were forbidden to marry Chinese or live on land. Their ancestors were the natives of Southern China before the Chinese expelled them to their current home on the water.\n\nDuring the intensive reclamation efforts around the islands of Shanghai in the late 1960s, many Tanka were settled on Hengsha Island and organised as fishing brigades.\n\nIn 1937, Walter Schofield, then a Cadet Officer in the Hong Kong Civil Service, wrote that at that time the Tankas were \"boat-people [who sometimes lived] in boats hauled ashore, or in more or less boat-shaped huts, as at Shau Kei Wan and Tai O\". They mainly lived at the harbours at Cheung Chau, Aberdeen, Tai O, Po Toi, Kau Sai Chau and Yau Ma Tei.\n\nElizabeth Wheeler Andrew (1845–1917) and Katharine Caroline Bushnell (5 February 1856 – January 26, 1946), who wrote extensively on the position of women in the British Empire, wrote about the Tanka inhabitants of Hong Kong and their position in the prostitution industry, catering towards foreign sailors. The Tanka did not marry with the Chinese, being descendants of the natives, they were restricted to the waterways. They supplied their women as prostitutes to British sailors and assisted the British in their military actions around Hong Kong The Tanka in Hong Kong were considered \"outcasts\" categorised low class.\n\nOrdinary Chinese prostitutes were afraid of serving Westerners since they looked strange to them, while the Tanka prostitutes freely mingled with western men. The Tanka assisted the Europeans with supplies and providing them with prostitutes. Low class European men in Hong Kong easily formed relations with the Tanka prostitutes. The profession of prostitution among the Tanka women led to them being hated by the Chinese both because they had sex with westerners and them being racially Tanka.\n\nThe Tanka prostitutes were considered to be \"low class\", greedy for money, arrogant, and treating clients with a bad attitude, they were known for punching their clients or mocking them by calling them names. Though the Tanka prostitutes were considered low class, their brothels were still remarkably well kept and tidy. A famous fictional story which was written in the 1800s depicted western items decorating the rooms of Tanka prostitutes.\n\nThe stereotype among most Chinese in Canton that all Tanka women were prostitutes was common, leading the government during the Republican era to accidentally inflate the number of prostitutes when counting, due to all Tanka women being included. The Tanka women were viewed as such that their prostitution activities were considered part of the normal bustle of a commercial trading city. Sometimes the lowly regarded Tanka prostitutes managed to elevate themselves into higher forms of prostitution.\n\nTanka women were ostracised from the Cantonese community, and were nicknamed \"salt water girls\" (ham sui mui in Cantonese) for their services as prostitutes to foreigners in Hong Kong.\n\nTanka women who worked as prostitutes for foreigners also commonly kept a \"nursery\" of Tanka girls specifically for exporting them for prostitution work to overseas Chinese communities such as in Australia or America, or to serve as a Chinese or foreigner's concubine.\n\nA report called \"Correspondence respecting the alleged existence of Chinese slavery in Hong Kong: presented to both Houses of Parliament by Command of Her Majesty\" was presented to the English Parliament in 1882 concerning the existence of slavery in Hong Kong, of which many were Tanka girls serving as prostitutes or mistresses to westerners.\n\nErnest John Eitel claimed that all \"half caste\" people in Hong Kong were descended exclusively from Europeans having relationship with Tanka women, and not Chinese women. The theory that most of the Eurasian mixed race Hong Kong people are descended only from Tanka women and European men, and not ordinary Cantonese women, is backed up by other researchers who pointed out that Tanka women freely consorted with foreigners due to the fact that they were not bound by the same Confucian traditions as the Cantonese, and having a relationship with European men was advantageous for Tanka women. The ordinary Cantonese women did not sleep with European men, the Eurasian population was formed only from Tanka and European admixture.\nThe day labourers settled down in huts at Taipingshan, at Saiyingpun and at Tsimshatsui. But the largest proportion of the Chinese population were the so-called Tanka or boat people, the pariahs of South-China, whose intimate connection with the social life of the foreign merchants in the Canton factories used to call forth an annual proclamation on the part of the Cantonese Authorities warning foreigners against the demoralising influences of these people. These Tan-ka people, forbidden by Chinese law (since A.D. 1730) to settle on shore or to compete at literary examinations, and prohibited by custom from intermarrying with the rest of the people, were from the earliest days of the East India Company always the trusty allies of foreigners. They furnished pilots and supplies of provisions to British men-of war, troopships and mercantile vessels, at times when doing so was declared by the Chinese Government to be rank treason, unsparingly visited with capital punishment. They were the hangers-on of the foreign factories of Canton and of the British shipping at Lintin, Kamsingmoon, Tungkin and Hongkong Bay. They invaded Hongkong the moment the settlement was started, living at first on boats in the harbour with their numerous families, and gradually settling on shore. They have maintained ever since almost a monopoly of the supply of pilots and ships' crews, of the fish trade and the cattle trade, but unfortunately also of the trade in girls and women. Strange to say, when the settlement was first started, it was estimated that some 2,000 of these Tan-ka people had flocked to Hongkong, but at the present time they are about the same number, a tendency having set in among them to settle on shore rather than on the water and to disavow their Tan-ka extraction to mix on equal terms with the mass of the Chinese community. The half-caste population in Hongkong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the off-spring of these Tan-ka people. But, like the Tan-ka people themselves, they are happily under the influence of a process of continuous re-absorption in the mass of the Chinese residents of the Colony.\nDuring British rule some special schools were created for the Tanka.\n\nIn 1962 a typhoon struck the Tanka and Hoklo boats, with hundreds being destroyed.\n\nDuring the 1970s the number of Tanka was reported to be shrinking.\n\nShanghai, with its many international concessions, contained prostitutes from various areas of China, including Guangdong province, this included the Tanka prostitutes, who were grouped separately from the Cantonese prostitutes. The Cantonese served customers in normal brothels while the Tanka served customers in boats.\n\n...always enlivened by the fleet of Tanka boats which pass, conveying passengers to and fro, between the land and the Canton and Hong Kong steamers.\"\n\n\"Japan and the Japanese: a narrative of the US government expedition to Japan under Commodore Perry\" in 1859\nOur next picture shows a Chinese tanka boat. The tanka boats are counted by thousands in the rivers and bays of China. They are often employed by our national vessels as conveyances to and. from the shore, thereby saving the health of the sailors, who would be otherwise subjected to pulling long distances under a hot sun, with a liability of contracting some fatal disease peculiar to China, and thus introducing infection in a crowded crew.\n\n\"Ballou's monthly magazine, Volume 8\" in 1858\n\"Macao.\n\n\"We arrived here on the twenty-second, and dispatched a boat to the shore immediately for letters. I received three or four of those fine large letters which are the envy of all who see them, and which are readily distinguishable by their size, and the beautiful style in which they are directed. You cannot imagine the delight with which I devoured their costents. I am glad you wrote so much of our dear pet. 0, my Dita, the longing I feel to take the dear little thing to my heart is agonising! Yesterday I was on shore, and saw a beautiful child of about the same age as ours. I was almost crazy at the sight. Twenty months old! How she must prattle by this time! I fancy I can see her trotting about, following you around the house. What a recompense for the hardest toil of the day would it not be to me, could I only lie down on the floor and have a good romp with her at night!\n\n\"And now for Macao, and what I saw, felt, and did. You probably know that a very numerous Chinese population lives entirely in boots; some of them so small that one pities the poor unfortunates who live so miserably. They are born, grow up, marry, and raise children in these boats. You would be astonished to see mothers, with infants at the breast, managing the sails, oars, and rudder of the boat as expertly as any sailor. The Tanka is of very light draft, and, being able to go close in shore, is used to land passengers from the larger boats. As we neared the shore, we noticed small boats pulling toward us from all directions. Soon a boat, \"manned\" by two really pretty young girls pulling oars, and a third sculling, came alongside, calling out earnestly, 'Takee me boat!' 'Takee me boat!' They had beautiful teeth, white as ivory, brilliant eyes, and their pretty faces, so earnest and pleading, were wreathed in smiles as we gave them the preference over others that joined us from all quarters, clinging to the sides of our large boat, and impeding our headway. The boatmen tried in vain to drive them off. One brute of a fellow splashed repeatedly a poor girl, who. though not at all pretty, had such a depth of meaning and such a sad expression in her eyes and face as charmed me completely. It would have interested any one to hear her scold back, and to see the flashing of her eyes, and the vivid expression in every feature. When I frowned at our sailor, the sudden change in her face from anger to smiles, the earnest 'takee me boat,' as she caught evidence of sympathy from me, was beautiful. We were assailed with these cries from so many, and there was such a clamour, that, in self-defense, we had to choose a boat and go. The first-mentioned girls, on account of their beauty, won the majority, and their boat was clean and well furnished, which is more than could be said of many of them. I caught the look of disappointment which passed over the features of the girl I have described, and it haunts me even now. Trifling as it, appeared to us, such scenes constitute the great events in their poor lives, and such triumphs or defeats are all-important to them.\n\n\"Upon entering the Tanka boat, we found the mother of the young girls, and a young infant dressed heroically. The infant was the child of the prettiest one of the girls, whose husband was away fishing. The old woman was quite talkative, and undoubtedly gave us lots of news!\n\n\"They had a miniature temple on the bows of the boat, with Joss seated cross-legged, looking very fat, and very red, and very stupid. Before him was an offering of two apricots, but Joss never deigned to look at it, and apparently had no appetite. I felt a sincere respect, however, for the devotional feeling of these poor idolaters, recognising even there the universal instinct which teaches that there is a God.\n\n\"I called upon the commodore, who received me with great courtesy, and gave me a very interesting account of the voyage out, by the way of Mauritius, of the Susquehanna, to which I was first appointed. She has gone on to Amoy.\n\n\"I made the acquaintance of a Portuguese family, named Lurero. The young ladies are quite accomplished, speaking French, Spanish, and Italian, but no English. They came down to receive the visit of our consul and lady, who called while I was there. Mr. Lurero gave me some specimens of a soap-fruit, and showed me the tree. The fruit is an exceedingly fine soap, which, without any preparation, is used for washing the finest goods.\n\n\"We expect to hear of the sailing of the 'Japan Expedition' by the next mail. When Commodore Perry arrives, we shall be kept so busy that time will fly rapidly, and we shall soon be looking forward to our return home, unless Japan disturbances (which are not seriously anticipated) delay us.\n\n\"I did not tell you of my visit to 'Camoens' Cave,' the principal attraction of Macao. This 'cave' was the resort of the distinguished Portuguese poet Camoens, who there wrote the greater part of the ' Lusiad.' The cave is situated in the midst of the finest wooded walks I ever saw. The grounds are planted beautifully, and immense vases of flowers stand around. The grounds are not level, but lie up the side of a slope or hill, irregular in shape, and precipitous on one side. There are several fine views, particularly that of the harbor and surrounding islands.\"\n\nI will here reproduce the following additional items regarding Camoens, from the pen of Walter A. Hose: —\n\n\"Macao had a particular interest for me as the first foothold that modern civilisation obtained upon the ancient shores of 'far Cathay,' and as the birthplace of one of the finest epic poems ever written. ... On one of those calm and beautiful nights peculiar to sub-tropical climes, I stood alone upon the white sea-wall, and no sound fell upon my ears save the whirring monotone of insects in the trees above the hills, the periodical chime of bells from anchored ships, and the low, sweet cadence of the incoming tide. I thought it must have been such a night as this that inspired Camoens when he wrote,\n\n\"Life of Capt. Joseph Fry, the Cuban martyr: Being a faithful record of his remarkable career from childhood to the time of his heroic death at the hands of Spanish executioners; recounting his experience as an officer in the US and Confederate navies, and revealing much of the inner history ...\" in 1875\n\nThe Fuzhou Tanka have different surnames than the Tanka of Guangdong. Qing records indicate that \"Weng, Ou, Chi, Pu, Jiang, and Hai\" (翁, 歐, 池, 浦, 江) were surnames of the Fuzhou Tanka. Qing records also stated that Tanka surnames in Guangdong consisted of \"Mai, Pu, Wu, Su, and He\" (麥, 濮, 吴, 蘇, 何), alternatively some people claimed Gu and Zeng as Tanka surnames.\n\nTests on the DNA of the Tanka people found that the disease Thalassemia was common among the Tanka. Tests also stated that the ancestors of the Tanka were not Han Chinese, but were native people.\n\nThe Tanka suffer from lung cancer more than the Cantonese and Teochew. The frequency of the disease is higher among Tanka. The rate among the Teochew is lower than that of the Cantonese.\n\n\n"}

In Tamil nadu the Amman(Paarvathi) festivals were celebrated during summer and neem leaves are very prominently hung in temples, houses and streets.\n"}
{"id": "43576791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43576791", "title": "Togutil people", "text": "Togutil people\n\nThe Togutil people (also known as Inner Tobelo, a term referring to the isolated people of Halmahera who live in the woods and \"can sleep standing up under a leaf during rain\") are an indigenous group with a semi-nomadic lifestyle living in the jungles of Totodoku, Tukur-Tukur, Lolobata, Kobekulo and Buli, North Maluku in the Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park, North Halmahera Regency, North Maluku, Indonesia.\n\nThe external ethnonym \"Togutil\" is equivalent to the native designations \"o fongana ma nyawa\" and \"o hongana ma nyawa\" (literally \"the forest people\"). Their lifestyle is very much dependent on the surroundings of the jungle. Sago is a staple food.\n\nTheir settlements are usually in groups of community along river banks. There are about 42 households of Togutil communities that settled along the Dodaga river, while about 500 lived along the Akelamo river. Their houses are made of wood and bamboo with \"Pelem\" leaves (a type of Livistonia) as roofing. Generally their houses do not have walls or wooden flooring.\n\nThe Togutils are categorized as separate group of people living in the interiors of north and central Halmahera. The Togutil people use the same language as the Tobelo people that live in the coastal area. Their communities are often categorized as a group of outcasts living in the jungles compared to the Tobelo living in the coastal area. Their physical appearance, especially their facial features and skin tone have a stronger resemblance to the Malay people than of the Tobelo.\n\nAccording to legend, they are actually coastal dwellers who moved to the jungles in order to avoid taxes. In 1915 during rule of the Dutch East Indies, there was an effort to settle them in the countryside of Kusuri and Tobelamo. But because they refused to pay taxes, they returned to the jungles and the settlement effort became a failure.\n\nThe Togutil have a very laid back lifestyle. Some of them still wear loinclothes, although most of them have adopted modern clothing. Apart from farming they lived on sago, pigs, and fish from the rivers. They also harvest Megapode eggs, resins, and antler horns to be sold to people from the coastal area. Bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes, papayas and sugar cane are common crops that can be found in their gardens. However, because of their semi-nomadic lifestyle, it is presumed that the farms are not cultivated intensively. Therefore, as it is common in areas where there are primitive tribes, jungles in this region do not show any significant disruption.\n"}

Emergency medical technicians at the scene of the accident uttered derogatory epithets and withdrew medical care after cutting open Tyra's pants and\ndiscovering that she had a penis, and ER staff at DC General Hospital subsequently provided dilatory and inadequate care.\n\nOn December 11, 1998, a jury awarded Hunter's mother, Margie, $2.9 million after finding the District of Columbia, through its employees in the D.C. Fire Department and doctors at D.C. General, liable under the D.C. Human Rights Act and for negligence and medical malpractice for causing Tyra's death. While $600,000 of the amount was awarded for damages attributable to violations of the D.C. Human Rights Act associated with the withdrawal of medical care at the accident scene and openly denigrating Tyra with epithets, a further $1.5 million was awarded to her mother for Tyra's conscious pain and suffering and for economic loss from the wrongful death medical malpractice claim. Doctors at D.C. General failed to diagnose and treat Tyra who died of internal bleeding in the hospital emergency room. Evidence at the trial demonstrated that had Tyra been provided with a blood transfusion and referred to a surgeon, she would have had an 86% chance of surviving.\n\nThe case against the District of Columbia was tried by Richard F. Silber. Dana Priesing, an observer at the trial, wrote that the evidence supported \"the inference that a stereotype (namely that Tyra was an anonymous, drug using, transgender street person) affected the treatment Tyra received,\" and that the \"ER staff, as evidenced by their actions, did not consider her life worth saving.\" The trial itself included a great deal of \"unlikely testimony and missing evidence.\" Adrian Williams, one of the EMTs who had neglected to treat Hunter, testified that he assumed she was a man on sight, \"failing to notice that she had breasts, make-up, women's clothing, a woman's hairstyle, and white nail polish.\" One D.C. General employee, after being subpoenaed, left for Africa and did not return until late December 1998. In the end, none of the EMTs involved were ever disciplined.\n\nTyra had transitioned at the age of 14 and lived entirely as a woman. Over 2,000 people attended her funeral.\n\nT.Y.R.A.

{"id": "1939300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1939300", "title": "Women in Pakistan", "text": "Women in Pakistan\n\nThe status of women in Pakistan is one of systemic gender subordination even though it varies considerably across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide due to uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of tribal, feudal, and capitalist social formations on women's lives. The Pakistani women of today do, however, enjoy a better status than in the past.\n\nAlmost all religious groups often quote the Quran and advocate subordination of women in Pakistan. Even rape victims have not been allowed to use DNA evidence to prove their cases, however the All Pakistan Ulema Council recently issued fatwas denouncing \"honour killings\". Other improvements are also being made as Lahore has inaugurated its first service of lady traffic wardens to manage the traffic and the country's most conservative province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is planning to increase the percentage of women in the police force.\n\nEven with these improvements, rampant domestic abuse and a high rate of child marriages and forced marriages still remain.\n\nPakistan has a dual system of civil and sharia law. The Constitution of Pakistan recognizes equality between men and women (Art. 25(2) states \"There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex\") but also recognizes as valid Sharia law (Chapter 3A. – Federal Shariat Court).\n\nHistorically, Muslim reformers such as Syed Ahmad Khan tried to bring education to women, limit polygamy, and empower women in other ways through education. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was known to have a positive attitude towards women. After the independence of Pakistan, women's groups and feminist organisations started by prominent leaders like Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah started to form that worked to eliminate socio-economic injustices against women in the country.\n\nJinnah points out that Muslim women leaders from all classes actively supported the Pakistan movement in the mid-1940s. Their movement was led by wives and other relatives of leading politicians. Women were sometimes organised into large-scale public demonstrations. Before 1947 there was a tendency for the Muslim women in Punjab to vote for the Muslim League while their menfolk supported the Unionist Party.\n\nMany Muslim women supported the Indian National Congress Quit India Movement. Some like Syeda Safia Begum of Muslim Town Lahore started the first English School for Muslim Children in Muslim Town in 1935.\nPakistani women were granted the suffrage in 1947, and they were reaffirmed the right to vote in national elections in 1956 under the interim Constitution. The provision of reservation of seats for women in the Parliament existed throughout the constitutional history of Pakistan from 1956 to 1973.\n\nHad General Ayub Khan run fair elections, Ms. Fatima Jinnah of Pakistan would have become the first Muslim President of the largest Muslim country in the world. However, despite that setback, during 1950–60, several pro-women initiatives were taken. Also the first woman Lambardar or Numberdar (Village Head Person) in West Pakistan Begum Sarwat Imtiaz took oath in Village 43/12-L in Chichawatni, District Montgomery (now Sahiwal) in 1959. The 1961 Muslim Family Law Ordinance, which regulated marriage, divorce, and polygamy continues to have a significant legal impact on the women of Pakistan.\n\nThe regime of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1970–1977) was a period of liberal attitudes towards women. All government services were opened to women including the district management group and the foreign service (in the civil service), which had been denied to them earlier. About 10% of the seats in the National Assembly and 5% in the provincial assemblies were reserved for women, with no restriction on contesting general seats as well. However, the implementation of these policies was poor as the Government faced a financial crisis due to the war with India and consequent split of the country.\n\nGender equality was specifically guaranteed in the Constitution of Pakistan adopted in 1973. The constitution stipulates that \"there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex alone.\" The Constitution additionally affords the protection of marriage, family, the mother and the child as well as ensuring \"full participation of women in all spheres of national life.\". However, many judges upheld the \"laws of Islam\", often misinterpreted, over the Constitution's guarantee of non-discrimination and equality under the law.\n\nIn 1975, an official delegation from Pakistan participated in the First World Conference on Women in Mexico, which led to the constitution of the first Pakistan Women's Rights Committee.\n\nGeneral Zia ul-Haq, then Army Chief of Staff, overthrew the democratically elected Zulfikar Ali Bhutto government in a military coup on 5 July 1977. The Sixth Plan during the martial law régime of General Zia-ul-Haq (1977–1986) was full of policy contradictions. The régime took many steps toward institutional building for women's development, such as the establishment of the Women's Division in the Cabinet Secretariat, and the appointment of another commission on the Status of Women. A chapter on women in development was included for the first time in the Sixth Plan. The chapter was prepared by a working group of 28 professional women headed by Syeda Abida Hussain, chairperson of the Jhang District council at that time. The main objective as stated in the Sixth Plan was \"to adopt an integrated approach to improve women's status\". In 1981, General Zia-ul-Haq nominated the \"Majlis-e-Shoora\" (Federal Advisory Council) and inducted 20 women as members, however Majlis-e-Shoora had no power over the executive branch. In 1985, the National Assembly elected through nonparty elections doubled women's reserved quota (20 percent).\n\nHowever, Zia-ul-Haq initiated a process of Islamization by introducing discriminatory legislation against women such as the set of Hudood Ordinances and the \"Qanun-e-Shahadat\" Order (Law of Evidence Order). He banned women from participating and from being spectators of sports and promoted purdah. He suspended all fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution that had been adopted in 1973, including the right to be free of discrimination on the basis of sex. He also proposed laws regarding Qisas and Diyat, Islamic penal laws governing retribution (\"qisas\") and compensation (\"diyat\") in crimes involving bodily injury. When the victim was a woman, the amount of \"diyat\" was halved\n\nThe Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 was a subcategory of the Hudood Ordinance. \"Zina\" is the crime of non-marital sexual relations and adultery. The Zina Ordinance included \"zina-bil-jabr\", the category of forced intercourse. If the woman who accuses a man of \"zina-bil-jabr\" (rape) cannot prove to the judicial system that she was raped, she faces adultery charges. In order for a rapist to receive \"hadd,\" the maximum punishment provided for under the Quran, either the rapist must confess to the rape, or four pious adult Muslim men must witness the \"act of penetration\" itself and testify against the rapist. \n\nUnder \"Qanun-e-Shahadat\", a woman's testimony was not weighed equally to that of a man. Thus, if a woman does not have male witnesses but does have female witnesses, their testimony would not satisfy the evidence requirement. The perpetrator may be acquitted and the victim may face adultery charges. The threat of being prosecuted discourages victims from filing complaints.\n\nIn addition, the legal possibility of marital rape was eliminated; by definition, rape became an extramarital offence according to the Zina ordinance. The ordinance prompted international criticism. Women's rights groups helped in the production of a film titled \"Who will cast the first stone?\" filmmaker by Sabiha Sumar to highlight the oppression and sufferings of women under the Hudood Ordinances.\n\nIn September 1981, the first conviction and sentence under the Zina Ordinance, of stoning to death for Fehmida and Allah Bakhsh were set aside under national and international pressure. In September 1981, women came together in Karachi in an emergency meeting to oppose the adverse effects on women of martial law and the Islamization campaign. They launched what later became the first full-fledged national women's movement in Pakistan, the Women’s Action Forum (WAF). WAF staged public protests and campaigns against the Hudood Ordinances, the Law of Evidence, and the Qisas and Diyat laws (temporarily shelved as a result).\n\nIn 1983, an orphaned, thirteen-year-old girl Jehan Mina was allegedly raped by her uncle and his sons, and became pregnant. She was unable to provide enough evidence that she was raped. She was charged with adultery and the court considered her pregnancy as the proof of adultery. She was awarded the \"Tazir\" punishment of one hundred lashes and three years of rigorous imprisonment.\n\nIn 1983, Safia Bibi, a nearly blind teenaged domestic servant was allegedly raped by her employer and his son. Due to lack of evidence, she was convicted for adultery under the Zina ordinance, while the rapists were acquitted. She was sentenced to fifteen lashes, five years imprisonment, and a fine of 1000 rupees. The decision attracted so much publicity and condemnation from the public and the press that the Federal Shariah Court of its own motion, called for the records of the case and ordered that she should be released from prison on her own bond. Subsequently, on appeal, the finding of the trial court was reversed and the conviction was set aside.\n\nThe International Commission of Jurists mission to Pakistan in December 1986 called for repealing of certain sections of the Hudood Ordinances relating to crimes and so-called \"Islamic\" punishments which discriminate against women and non-Muslims.\n\nThere is considerable evidence that legislation during this period has negatively impacted Pakistani women's lives and made them more vulnerable to extreme violence. Majority of women in prison were charged under the Hudood Ordinance. Similarly, a national level study conducted in \"dar-ul-aman\"s (shelters for women) mentioned that 21% of women had Hudood cases against them. According to a 1998 report by Amnesty International, more than one-third of all Pakistani women in prison were being held due to having been accused or found guilty of zina.\n\nAfter Zia-ul-Haq's regime, there was a visible change in the policy context in favour of women. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth plans formulated under various democratically elected governments have clearly made efforts to include women's concerns in the planning process. However, planned development failed to address gender inequalities due to the gap between policy intent and implementation.\n\nIn 1988, Benazir Bhutto (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter) became the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan, and the first woman elected to head a Muslim country. During her election campaigns, she voiced concerns over social issues of women, health and discrimination against women. She also announced plans to set up women's police stations, courts and women's development banks. She also promised to repeal controversial Hudood laws that curtailed the rights of women However, during her two incomplete terms in office (1988–90 and 1993–96), Benazir Bhutto did not propose any legislation to improve welfare services for women. She was not able to repeal a single one of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation laws. By virtue of the eighth constitutional amendment imposed by Zia-ul-Haq, these laws were protected both from ordinary legislative modification and from judicial review.\n\nIn early 1988, the case of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar sparked bitter public criticism. Shahida's first husband, Khushi Muhammad, had divorced her and the papers had been signed in front of a magistrate. The husband however, had not registered the divorce documents in the local council as required by law, rendering the divorce not legally binding. Unaware of this, Shahida, after her mandatory 96-day period of waiting (\"iddat\"), remarried. Her first husband, rebounding from a failed attempt at a second marriage, decided he wanted his first wife Shahida back. Shahida's second marriage was ruled invalid. She and her second husband, Sarwar were charged with adultery. They were sentenced to death by stoning. The public criticism led to their retrial and acquittal by the Federal Shariah Court.\n\nMinistry of Women's Development (MWD) established Women's Studies centres at five universities in Islamabad, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar, and Lahore in 1989. However, four of these centres became almost non-functional due to lack of financial and administrative support. Only the center at University of Karachi (funded by the Canadian International Development Agency) was able to run a master of arts programme.\n\nThe First Women Bank Ltd. (FWBL) was established in 1989 to address women's financial needs. FWBL, a nationalised commercial bank, was given the rôle of a development finance institution, as well as of a social welfare organisation. It operates 38 real-time online branches across the country, managed and run by women. MWD provided a credit line of Rs 48 million to FWBL to finance small-scale credit schemes for disadvantaged women. The Social Action Programme launched in 1992/93 aimed at reducing gender disparities by improving women's access to social services.\n\nPakistan acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 29 February 1996. The Ministry of Women Development (MWD) is the designated national focal machinery for its implementation. However MWD faced a lack of resources initially. Pakistan failed to submit its initial report that was due in 1997. Pakistan neither signed nor ratified the Optional Protocol of the Women's Convention, which has led to non-availability of avenues for filing grievances by individuals or groups against Pakistan under CEDAW.\n\nIn 1997, Nawaz Sharif was elected as the Prime Minister. He had also held office for a truncated term (1990–1993), during which he had promised to adopt Islamic law as the supreme law of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1997, the Nawaz Sharif government formally enacted the Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, which institutes shariah-based changes in Pakistan's criminal law. The ordinance had earlier been kept in force by invoking the president's power to re-issue it every four months.\n\nSharif then proposed a fifteenth amendment to the Constitution that would entirely replace the existing legal system with a comprehensive Islamic one and would override the \"constitution and any law or judgment of any court.\". The proposal was approved in the National Assembly (lower house), where Sharif's party has a commanding majority, but, it remained stalled in the Senate after facing strong opposition from women's groups, human rights activists, and opposition political parties.\n\nA 1997 ruling by the Lahore High Court, in the highly publicised Saima Waheed case, upheld a woman's right to marry freely but called for amendments to the 1965 Family Laws, on the basis of Islamic norms, to enforce parental authority to discourage \"love marriages\".\n\nThe report of the Inquiry of the Commission for Women (1997) clearly stated that the Hudood legislation must be repealed as it discriminates against women and is in conflict with their fundamental rights. A similar commission during Benazir Bhutto's administration had also recommended amending certain aspects of Hudood Ordinance. However, neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif implemented these recommendations.\n\nThe enhancement of women's status was stated as one of the 16 goals listed in the \"Pakistan 2010 Program\" (1997), a critical policy document. However, the document omits women while listing 21 major areas of interests. Similarly, another major policy document, the \"Human Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy\" (1999), mentioned women as a target group for poverty reduction but lacks gender framework.\n\nThe country's first all-women university, named after Fatima Jinnah, was inaugurated on 6 August 1998. It suffered from delays in the release of development funds from the Federal Government.\n\nIn 2000, the Church of Pakistan ordained its first women deacons. In 2002 (and later during court trials in 2005), the case of Mukhtaran Mai brought the plight of rape victims in Pakistan under an international spotlight. On 2 September 2004, the Ministry of Women Development was made an independent ministry, separating from the Social Welfare and Education Ministry.\n\nIn July 2006, General Pervez Musharraf asked his Government to begin work on amendments to the controversial 1979 Hudood Ordinance introduced under Zia-ul-Haq's régime. He asked the Law Ministry and the Council of Islamic Ideology (under the Ministry of Religious Affairs) to build a consensus for the amendments to the laws. On 7 July 2006 General Musharraf signed an ordinance for the immediate release on bail of around 1300 women who were currently languishing in jails on charges other than terrorism and murder.\n\nIn late 2006, the Pakistani parliament passed the Women's Protection Bill, repealing some of the Hudood Ordinances. The bill allowed for DNA and other scientific evidence to be used in prosecuting rape cases. The passing of the Bill and the consequent signing of it into law by President General Pervez Musharraf invoked protests from hard-line Islamist leaders and organisations. Some experts also stated that the reforms will be impossible to enforce.\n\nThe Cabinet has approved reservation of 10% quota for women in Central Superior Services in its meeting held on 12 July 2006. Earlier, there was a 5% quota for women across the board in all Government departments. In December 2006, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz approved the proposal by Ministry of Women Development, to extend this quota to 10%.\n\nIn 2006, The Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act was also passed. In December 2006, for the first time, women cadets from the Military Academy Kakul assumed guard duty at the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nThe Women's Protection Bill, however, has been criticised by many including human rights and women's rights activists for only paying lip service and failing to repeal the Hudood Ordinances.\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari led Pakistan People's Party government was responsible for landmark development in women rights' legislation and empowerment in Pakistan and commended by Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and on international level.\n\nComing into power it appointed a female member of parliament and party loyalist Dr. Fehmida Mirza as the first female speaker in South Asia. During the tenure Pakistan saw its first female foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, first secretary of defence, Nargis Sethi, deputy speaker of a province Shehla Raza and numerous female ministers, ambassadors, secretaries including Farahnaz Ispahani, Media Advisor to former President of Pakistan and co-chairman PPP, Sherry Rehman former ambassador of Pakistan to US, Fauzia Wahab, Firdous Ashiq Awan, Farzana Raja, Shazia Marri, Sharmila Faruqi and others held prestigious positions within the administration.\n\nOn 29 January 2010 the President signed the 'Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Bill 2009' which the parliament adopted on 21 January 2010. Two additional bills were signed into law by the President in December 2012 criminalising the primitive practices of Vani, watta-satta, swara and marriage to the Quran which used women as tradable commodoties for settlement of disputes. In addition the punishment for acid throwing to life imprisonment. The government further established special task force in the interior Sindh region to for action against the practice of Karo-Kari establishing helplines and offices in the districts of Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Khairpur.\n\nIn 2012 the government revived the National Commission on Status of Women established by General Musharraf for three years in 2000, later being revived for three years at a time. The bill moved by government established the commission as a permanent body with the task to ensure the implementation of women protection legislation and abuses against women.\n\nIn February 2012, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement held the world's largest women's political rally in Karachi, with an estimated 100,000 women in attendance.\n\nPurdah norms are followed in few communities of Pakistan. It is practised in various ways, depending on family tradition, region, class, and rural or urban residence. Purdah is most likely to be practised among the Pashtuns and the Muslim Rajputs.. Now, many women in Pakistan don't wear Purdah, which is opposed by many religious scholars. Generally, women living in more developed areas like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad are more liberal in terms of dressing than women living in less developed areas.\n\nAlthough the Child Marriages Restraint Act makes it illegal for girls under the age of 16 to be married, instances of child marriages are commonly found in rural areas. Vani is a child marriage custom followed in tribal areas and the Punjab province. The young girls are forcibly married off in order to resolve the feuds between different clans; the Vani can be avoided if the clan of the girl agrees to pay money, called Deet, to other clans. Swara, Pait likkhi and Addo Baddo are similar tribal and rural customs that often promote marriage of girls in their early teenage years. In one extreme case in 2012, a local Jirga in Aari village, Swat ordered that Roza Bibi, a girl of six, must be married off to settle a dispute between her family and the rival family.. As of 2018, the trend of Vani is decreased very much, allowing more young girls to live their childhood freely.\n\nWatta satta is a tribal custom in which brides are traded between two clans. In order to marry off a son, one must also have a daughter to marry off in return. If there is no sister to exchange in return for a son's spouse, a cousin, or a distant relative can also do. Even though Islamic law requires that both partners explicitly consent to marriage, women are often forced into marriages arranged by their fathers or tribal leaders. Watta satta is most common in rural parts of northwest and west Pakistan, and its tribal regions.\n\nLike in other parts of South Asia, the custom of dowry is practised in Pakistan, and conflicts related to it often result in violence, even dowry deaths. At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.\n\nA majority of the victims of honour killings are women and the punishments meted out to the murderers are very lenient.\nThe practice of summary killing of a person suspected of an illicit liaison is known as \"karo kari\" in Sindh and Balochistan. In December 2004, the Government passed a bill that made \"karo kari\" punishable under the same penal provisions as murder. In 2016, Pakistan repealed the loophole which allowed the perpetrators of honour killings to avoid punishment by seeking forgiveness for the crime from another family member, and thus be legally pardoned.\nMany cases of honour killings have been reported against women who marry against their family's wishes, who seek divorce or who have been raped.\n\nIn some parts of Sindh, the practice of marrying a woman to Quran is prevalent among landlords, although this practice is alien to Islam and has no religious basis. The practice is often used by men to keep and grab the land of their sisters and daughters.\n\nAlthough Pakistan's population is almost entirely Muslim (96.4% as of 2010), women's status differs significantly by community.\nWomen's dress varies depending on region, class and occasion, but shalwar kameez is the principal garment worn by Pakistani women. Ghararas (a loose divided skirt worn with a blouse) and lehengas were once common, but are now worn mostly at weddings.\n\nFew Pakistani women wear the hijab or burqa in public, and the degree to which they choose to cover varies; with the use of the burqa being primarily predominant in Pashtun territories. Some traditionally Afghan clothing styles have become prevalent in recent decades in some areas of Pakistan. \nPakistan has no laws banning or enforcing the hijab. Surveys conducted in Pakistan show that most women wearing the hijab do so of their own choice. The veil is not an absolute requirement, and women may even wear jeans and T-shirts in urban areas of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and other big cities. In last five years, western dressing has become much common among women in cities. Many women wear pants, plazzo and tight jeans with long shirts as well as short shirts. Most women in small cities and rural areas wear the Shalwar Kameez, which consists of a tunic top and baggy trouser set which covers their arms, legs and body. A loose dupatta scarf is also worn around the shoulders, upper chest and head. Men also have a similar dress code, but only women are expected to wear a dupatta in public.\n\nSome Pakistani women who do not wear the hijab may wear the dupatta or chadar instead.\nA sari is a formal dress worn on special occasions by some, mainly urban, women. The Islamization under General Zia ul Haq's dictatorship branded the sari as an \"un-Islamic\" form of dress. but it has made a comeback in fashionable circles.\n\nIn Pakistan, the women's access to property, education, employment etc. remains considerably lower compared to men's. The social and cultural context of Pakistani society has historically been predominantly patriarchal. Women have a low percentage of participation in society outside of the family.\n\nDespite the improvement in Pakistan's literacy rate since its independence, the educational status of Pakistani women is among the lowest in the world. The literacy rate for urban women is more than five times the rate for rural women. The literacy rate is still lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 45.8% for females, while for males it is 69.5% (aged 15 or older, data from 2015).\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, the school drop-out rate among girls was very high (almost 50 percent), even though the educational achievements of female students were higher than male students at different levels of education. Since then, education for women has improved rapidly. In Lahore there are 46 public colleges out of which 26 are female colleges and some of the others are co-educational. Similarly the public universities of Pakistan have female enrollment than male.\n\nUNESCO and the Orascom subsidiary of Pakistan telco, Mobilink have been using mobile phones to educate women and improve their literacy skills since 4 July 2010. The local BUNYAD Foundation of Lahore and the UN's work via the Dakar Framework of Action for EFA are also helping with this issue.\nAs of 2010, the literacy rate of females in Pakistan was at 39.6 percent compared to that of males at 67.7 percent. More recent statistics provided by the UNICEF - shows that female education amongst 15-24 year olds has increased substantially to 61.5% - an increase of 45%. Male education is at a steady rate of 71.2%. \n\nThe objectives of education policies in Pakistan aim to achieve equality in education between girls and boys and to reduce the gender gap in the educational system. However, the policy also encourages girls, mainly in rural areas of Pakistan, to acquire basic home management skills, which are preferred over full-scale primary education. The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult. The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system. \nGirls of rural areas are facing many problems regarding their studies. There are several issues and causes of education problems for girls in rural areas of Pakistan.\nInaccessibility of education in Pakistan, especially in backward areas is a result of distance, child labor, scarcity of teachers, local leaders, frequent policy changes and fear of losing power. In KPK and Balochistan women are severely bound by cultural constraints and prejudices. They are involved in reproductive and productive and community work for 14 to 18 hours. Women which are the 51% on the country population, have been forced to just bear children for their husband and remain within their houses. In Balochistan, female literacy rate stands between 15 to 25%.\nIn backward areas, girls schools are far away from their homes, many families cannot afford traveling expenses for their children. Separate schools for girls are not available. Girls are living under the fear of extremist. In KPK militant groups have blasted thousands of schools because they are against women education , they have given threats to several governments and private girls school for stopping girls education. \n\nThis feudal system leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position. The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role within the confines of the home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5–16 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2011). Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as acid throwing which many girls fall victim to for attending school.\n\nFemales are educated equally like Males in urban areas such as Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi. However, in rural areas, the education rate is substantially lower. This has begun to change with the issuance of government policy, in which 70% of new schools are built for girls, and also plans to increase the size of women's school so that the infrastructure matches those of men's schools and more female colleges have also been established in order to provide women with higher education.\n\nWomen in elite urban districts of Pakistan enjoy a far more privileged lifestyle than those living in rural tribal areas. Women in urbanized districts typically lead more elite lifestyles and have more opportunities for education. Rural and tribal areas of Pakistan have an increasingly high rate of poverty and alarmingly low literacy rates. In 2002 it was recorded that 81.5 percent of 15- to 19-year-old girls from high-income families had attended school while 22.3 percent of girls from low-income families had ever attended school. \n\nIn comparison, it was recorded that 96.6 percent of Pakistani boys ages 15–19 coming from high-income families had attended schooling while 66.1 percent of 15- to 19-year-old boys from low-income families had attended school. Girls living in rural areas are encouraged not to go to school because they are needed in the home to do work at a young age. In most rural villages, secondary schooling simply does not exist for girls, leaving them no choice but to prepare for marriage and do household tasks. These rural areas often have inadequate funding and schooling for girls is at the bottom of their priorities.\n\nPakistan is a largely rural society (almost two thirds of the population lives in rural areas) and women are rarely formally employed. This does not mean that women do not participate in the economy: quite on the contrary, women usually work on the farm of the household, practice subsistence agriculture, or otherwise work within the household economic unit. However, women are often prevented from advancing economically, due to social restrictions on women's movement and gender mixing, as well as due to low education.\n\nAlthough women play an active role in Pakistan's economy, their contribution has been grossly underreported in some censuses and surveys. Part of the understimation of women's economic role is that Pakistan, like many other countries, has a very large informal sector. The 1991–92 Labour Force Survey revealed that only about 16% of women aged 10 years and over were in the labour force. According to World Bank, in 2014, women made up 22.3% of the labour force in Pakistan. \n\nAccording to the 1999 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, only two percent of Pakistani women participate in the formal sector of employment. However, the 1980 agricultural census stated that the women's participation rate in agriculture was 73%. The 1990–1991 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey indicated that the female labour force participation rate was 45% in rural areas and 17% the urban areas. Pakistani women play a major role in agricultural production, livestock raising and cottage industries.\n\nIn 2008, it was recorded that 21.8 percent of females were participating in the labor force in Pakistan while 82.7 percent of men were involved in labor. The rate of women in the labor force has an annual growth rate of 6.5 percent. Out of the 47 million employed peoples in Pakistan in 2008, only 9 million were women and of those 9 million, 70 percent worked in the agricultural sector. The income of Pakistani women in the labor force is generally lower than that of men, due in part to a lack of formal education. The low female literacy rate is a large obstacle in women taking part in the workforce.\n\nDue to the religious and cultural values in Pakistan, women who do try to enter the workforce are often pushed into the lower of the three employment structures. This structure level, unorganized services sector, has low pay, low job security and low productivity. In order to improve this situation, governmental organizations and political parties need to push for the entrance of women into the organized services sector. Conservative interpretations of Islam have not promoted women's rights in the workforce, since they value women as keepers of the family honor, support gender segregation, and institutionalization of gender disparities. \n\nFurthermore, women who do work are often paid less than minimum wage, because they are seen as lesser beings in comparison to men, and “their working conditions vis-à-vis females are often hazardous; having long working hours, no medical benefits, no job security, subjected to job discrimination, verbal abuse and sexual harassment and no support from male oriented labor unions”(An In-Depth Analysis of Women's Labor Force Participation in Pakistan).\n\nAlthough these religious and cultural barriers exist keeping women away from the workforce, studies have shown that women-only entrepreneurial training that allows participants to develop capital and competences, can break these down. Programs such as this can go a long way in an Islamic socio-cultural context to develop tolerance and understanding.\n\nAround 90% of the Pakistani households are headed by men and most female-headed households belong to the poor strata of the society\n\nWomen lack ownership of productive resources. Despite women's legal rights to own and inherit property from their families, in 2000 there were very few women who had access and control over these resources.\n\nPakistan is a patriarchal society where men are the primary authority figures and women are subordinate. Gender is one of the organizing principles of Pakistani society. Patriarchal values embedded in local traditions, religion and culture predetermine the social value of gender. Islam heavily influences gender roles in particular. An artificial divide between production and reproduction, made by the ideology of sexual division of labor, has placed women in reproductive roles as mothers and wives in the private arena of home and men in a productive role as breadwinners in the public arena.\n\nPakistani women lack social value and status because of negation of their roles as producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male members of the family are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena.\n\nThis situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships. However, the spread of patriarchy is not even. The nature and degree of women’s subordination vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater control over their lives.\n\nAccording to Pakistani standards, 'good women' could be either educated or uneducated and are expected to be unselfish, calm, tolerant, empathetic, reliable, able to organize, compromise, coordinate and maintain hospitality within the house and in keeping good relationships. They are also expected to do household chores, care for her children, husband and in-laws and, when needed, provide the home with external income. Women are also expected to marry a man of their parent's choice, follow Islam's code of dress and sacrifice their own dreams.\n\nIn a study carried out by Gallup Pakistan, the Pakistani affiliate of Gallup International, majority of the Pakistanis believe that both males and females have different roles to play in the society. Although women’s role has broadened beyond being a housewife over time, many people still give priority to men in politics, education, employment, and related walks of life. When the respondents were asked to give their opinion on a number of statements about gender roles 63% of the respondents agreed with the statement that \"Boys’ education is more important than girls’\"; 37% disagreed with it. The percentage of people agreeing with this statement was higher among rurallites (67%) as compared to the urbanites (53%). However, more than 90% believe that female children should be educated, nearly half of them believing that, should opportunity be available, they should rise to college education and beyond.\n\nFifty five percent (55%) of the respondents believe that \"Both husband and wife should work\"; while 45% said it is wrong for both husband and the wife to work. More than 50% of men including those from rural areas agree that both husband and wife should work for a better living. When the respondents were asked whether \"Men are better politicians as compared to women or not\"; 67% agree men are better politicians while 33% think otherwise. More women agree with this statement as compared to men. In response to the following statement \"If jobs are in shortage should men be given priority for employment\"; 72% of the respondents believe they should be given priority while 28% disagree. Eighty three percent (83%) of the respondents think that \"To live a happy life women need children\"; while only 17% think they do not. A vast majority of all respondents including 82% of women respondents believe that \"prosperous women should raise their voice to support the rights of poor women.\"\n\nThe average age of women for marriage increased from 16.9 years in 1951 to 22.5 years in 2005. A majority of women are married to their close relatives, i.e., first and second cousins. Only 37 percent of married women are not related to their spouses before marriage. A study published in 2000 recorded that the divorce rate in Pakistan was extremely low due to the social stigma attached to it.\n\nMany girls are still married off into a child marriage, and many complications with this can occur as childbirth from a child can cause complications with the baby and mother. A common system in place with marriage is the Dowry system in which a low or no status is assigned to a girl right from the prenatal stage.There are issues around the dowry system such as dowry related violence, in which the wife is abused by her husband. Before the marriage, the groom will make heavy financial demands on the bride's family as a condition of marrying their daughter. \n\nIn order for many parents' daughters to get married, they start \"obtaining loans from people, getting interest based loans from banks, utilising their life savings and even sell their homes\" (JAHEZ (Dowry Conditions Set by the Groom for Marriage)). Within the dowry system, abuse is likely to occur after the marriage has taken place. Prior to the marriage, if certain conditions that the groom and his family have put in place are not met, they will threaten to break off the marriage, which would be devastating for the bride and her family because of the lengths the bride's family already had to go through to pay her dowry and because traditionally it is a great dishonor to the family.\n\nAccording to 1998 figures, the female infant mortality rate was higher than that of male children. The maternal mortality rate was also high, as only 20 percent of women were assisted by a trained provider during delivery. Only 9 percent of women used contraceptives in 1985, but by 2000 this figure had increased substantially, and as of 2012/13, the contraceptive prevalence rate was 35.4%. The total fertility rate is 2.75 children born/woman (2015 est.).\n\nPakistan has taken certain initiatives in the health sector to redress gender imbalances. The SAP was launched in 1992–1993 to accelerate improvement in the social indicators. Closing the gender gap is the foremost objective of the SAP. The other major initiative is the Prime Minister's program of lady health workers (LHWs). Under this community-based program, 26,584 LHWs in rural areas and 11,967 LHWs in urban areas have been recruited to provide basic health care including family planning to women at the grassroots level. Other initiatives include the village-based family planning workers and extended immunisation programs, nutritional and child survival, cancer treatment, and increased involvement of media in health education.\n\nWomen in Pakistan have progressed in various fields of life such as politics, education, economy, services, health and many more.\n\nIn 2000, women's presence in political parties as well as in the political structure at the local, provincial, and national levels was insignificant due to cultural and structural barriers. The situation gradually improved, and by 2014, 20.7% of elected representatives were female, a statistic well ahead of the United States and less than 2% behind the United Kingdom.\n\nMiss Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, was an instrumental figure in the Pakistan movement.
