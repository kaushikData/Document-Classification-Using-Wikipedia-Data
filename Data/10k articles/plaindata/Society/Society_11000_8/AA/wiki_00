As of August 2018, each U.S. state has set its age of consent at either age 16, age 17, or age 18.\n\nThe age of consent in Mexico is complex. Typically, Mexican states have a \"primary\" age of consent (which may be as low as 12), and sexual conduct with persons below that age is always illegal. Sexual relations which occur between adults and teenagers under 18 are left in a legal gray area: laws against corruption of minors as well as estupro laws can be applied to such acts, at the discretion of the prosecution. These laws are situational and are subject to interpretation.\n\nThe ages of consent in the countries of Central America range from 14 to 18.\n\nThe below is a list of all jurisdictions in North America as listed in List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America.\n\nThe age of consent is the age at or above which a person is considered to have the legal capacity to consent to sexual activity. Both partners must be of legal age to give consent, although exceptions to the age of consent law exist in some jurisdictions when the minor and his or her partner are within a certain number of years in age or when a minor is married to his/her partner. Persons below the age of consent may not, by law, give consent, and sexual relations involving such persons may be punished by criminal sanctions similar to those for rape or sexual assault. Non-violent sexual contact with persons under the age of consent may be punished with varying degrees of severity, ranging from a misdemeanor with a simple fine, to a felony with a punishment equivalent to rape.\n\nDifferent ages may apply if one partner is in a position of power or authority over the other, such as a teacher, manager, coach, parent or stepparent. For example, in Indiana the age of consent is 16 but it is illegal for a person over 18 to have sex with anyone under 18 if they work at their school, are their parent or a stepparent, or are a person recruiting them to join the military.\n\nHistorically, the age of consent applied to male-female relationships; same-sex relationships were often illegal regardless of the ages of participants. Modern laws vary, and there may be multiple ages that apply in any jurisdiction. For instance, different ages may apply if the relationship is between partners of the same sex, or if the sexual contact is not strictly vaginal intercourse.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, the age of consent is 16. \"The Sexual Offences Act of 1995\" raised the age of consent from 14 to 16 years of age.\n\n\n6. (1) Where a male person has sexual intercourse with a female person who is not his wife \"with her consent\" and who has attained the age of fourteen years but has not yet attained the age of sixteen years, he is guilty of an offence, and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for ten years.\n\n(2) A male person is not guilty of an offence under subsection (1) –\n\n(a) if he honestly believed that the female person was sixteen years of age or more; or\n\n(b) if the male person is \"not more than three years older\" than the female person and the court is of the opinion that the evidence discloses that as between the male person and the female person, the male person is not wholly or substantially to blame.\n\n\n7. (1) Where a female adult has sexual intercourse with a male person who is not her husband and who is under the age of sixteen years, she is guilty of an offence,\" whether or not the male person consented\" to the intercourse, and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for seven years.\n\nA female adult is not guilty of an offence under subsection (1) –\n\n(a) if she honestly believed that the male person was sixteen years of age or more; or\n\n(b) if the female adult is \"not more than three years older\" than the male person and the court is of the opinion that evidence discloses that as between the female adult and the male person, the female adult is not wholly or substantially to blame.\n\nThe age of consent in Anguilla is 16. It is determined in Part 14 of the Criminal Code - \nSEXUAL OFFENCES -\"Sexual Offences Against Minors\" - by Article 143. \"Sexual intercourse with person between 14 and 16 years of age\".\n\nThe age of consent in Aruba is 15, as specified in Article 251 of the Criminal Code of Aruba (which Aruba adapted after its secession from the Netherlands Antilles) which reads:\n\nArticle 251: \"A person who, out of wedlock, with a person , performs indecent acts comprising or including sexual penetration of the body is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than eight years or a fine of at most 100 000 florin\".\n\nIn The Bahamas, the age of consent for opposite-sex activity is 16 and the age of consent for same-sex activity is 18. Homosexuality was legalized in 1991, but \"public homosexuality\" is an offense that carries a 20-year jail term without parole.\n\n11. (1) Any person who has unlawful sexual intercourse with any person being of or above fourteen years of age and under sixteen years of age, whether with or without the consent of the person with whom he had unlawful sexual intercourse, is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for life subject to, on a first conviction for the offence, a term of imprisonment of seven years and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction for the offence, a term of imprisonment of fourteen years.\n\nIn Barbados the age of consent is 16.\n\nSection 5, part I \"Sexual intercourse with person between 14 and 16\" of the Sexual Offences Act 1992\n\n(1) Where a person has sexual intercourse with another \"with the other's consent\" and that other person has attained the age of 14 but has not yet attained the age of 16 that person is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of 10 years.\n\nIn Belize, the age of consent is 16, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.\n\nThe legislation reads:\n\nCriminal Code [CAP. 101]\n\n\"Every person who, with or without consent, has sexual intercourse with a person who is under the age of fourteen years commits the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse and is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term that is not less than twelve years but may extend to imprisonment for life.\"\n\n\"Every person who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a person who is above the age of fourteen years but under the age of sixteen years, commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term that is not less than five years but no more than ten years.\"\n\nAge of sexual consent is 16, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender.\n\nThe Tackling Violent Crime Act took effect on 1 May 2008, raising the age of consent from 14 to 16.\n\nThere exist two close-in-age exemptions, depending on the age of the younger partner. A youth of twelve or thirteen can consent to sexual activity with an individual less than two years older than they. A fourteen- or fifteen-year-old can consent to sexual activity with a partner who is less than five years older than they.\n\nCriminal law (including the definition of the age of consent) is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, so the age of consent is uniform throughout Canada. Section 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada makes it a crime to touch, for a sexual purpose, any person under the age of 16 years. Section 153 then goes on to prohibit the sexual touching of a person under 18 by a person in three circumstances: if he or she is in a \"position of trust or authority\" towards the youth, if the youth is in a \"relationship of dependency\" with him or her, or if the relationship is \"exploitative\". The term \"position of trust or authority\" is not defined in the Code but the courts have ruled that parents, teachers, and medical professionals hold a position of trust or authority towards youth they care for or teach. Section 153 (1.2) of the Code provides that a judge can infer whether or not a relationship is \"exploitative\" by considering its nature and circumstances including how old the youth is, the difference in ages between the partners, how the relationship evolved, and the degree of control or influence that the older partner has over the youth.\n\nThe \"position of trust under 18\" anti-exploitation rules were expanded in 2005 by Bill C-2 where a judge may choose to term a situation to be sexual exploitation based on the nature and circumstances of the relationship including the age of the younger party, age difference, evolution of the relationship (how it developed, e.g. quickly and secretly over the Internet), the control or influence over the young person (degree of control or influence the other person had over the young person). This passed before the 2008 amendments, and they were not repealed so they are still in effect and can apply towards adults in these situations with young persons over the age of consent and under 18 (16-17).\n\nWhere an accused is charged with an offence under s. 151 (Sexual Interference), s. 152 (Invitation to sexual touching), s. 153(1) (Sexual exploitation), s. 160(3) (Bestiality in presence of or by child), or s. 173(2) (Indecent acts), or is charged with an offence under s. 271 (Sexual assault), s. 272 (Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party, or causing bodily harm), or s. 273 (Aggravated sexual assault) in respect of a complainant under the age of sixteen years, it is not a defense that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge.\n\nSection 159 of the Criminal Code criminalizes anal intercourse, but provides exceptions for a husband and wife, and any two persons 18 years of age or older. These exceptions do not apply if a third person is present, or if the anal intercourse takes place anywhere but in private. However, courts in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta have independently declared s. 159 to be unconstitutional as violations of the equality provision of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\".\n\nDuring the 19th century, the age of consent for heterosexual vaginal sex was 12; in 1890, the Parliament raised the age of consent to 14. The punishment for anyone who had sexual intercourse with someone younger than 14 was life imprisonment and whipping, while the punishment for anyone who attempted to seduce an underage girl was two years' imprisonment and whipping. Canada had also laws against \"seducing\" minor girls who were over the age of consent. In 1886, a law was enacted that made the \"seduction\" of a girl over 12 and under 16 \"of previously chaste character\" a criminal offence; the \"seduction\" of a female under 18 \"under promise of marriage\" was also made illegal in 1886, and amended in 1887 to apply to females under 21. After the raising of the age of consent to 14, the laws against \"seducing\" minor girls were amended to apply to those older than 14, and various laws of this kind have remained in force through the 20th century. The age of consent was raised from 14 to 16 in the spring of 2008, when the \"Tackling Violent Crime Act\" became effective. The new measures still allow for close-in-age exceptions between 12 and 16: if there is no more than a two-year gap for those 12 and 13, or a five-year gap for those 14 and 15. Anal sex remains illegal with exceptions for those over 18, if they comply with the restrictions set out under section 159.\n\nFemale homosexuality was never illegal in the former British colonies; oral sex was legalized in 1969 with the same age of consent as vaginal sex. Also introduced in 1969 were the exceptions regarding criminal anal sex (effectively legalizing it), but with a higher age barrier set at 21, under section 159; in 1988, the age barrier for these exceptions was lowered to 18. As of 2008 there are no plans to repeal section 159, even though it has been ruled unconstitutional in some Canadian provinces.\n\nThe age of consent in Cayman Islands is 16.\n\nDefilement of girls under sixteen years of age, etc.\n\n134. (1) Whoever unlawfully and carnally -\n\n(a) knows any girl under the age of twelve years is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for twenty years; or\n\n(b) knows any girl between the ages of twelve and sixteen years is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for twelve years.\n\nIndecent assaults on females\n\n132. (1) It is an offence for a person to make an \"indecent assault on a woman\".\n\n(2) A girl under the age of sixteen cannot in law give any consent which would prevent an act being an assault for the purposes of this section.\n\nThe age of consent in the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius) is 16, as specified by the Criminal Code BES, Articles 251, which reads:\n\nArt 251: \"A person who, out of wedlock, with a person , performs indecent acts comprising or including sexual penetration of the body is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than sixteen years\". Before prosecution, the public attorney will, if possible, allow the minor to indicate if prosecution is deemed desirable.\n\nClipperton Island is an uninhabited nine-square-kilometre (approx. 3.5-square-mile) coral atoll in the eastern Pacific Ocean, a state private property under the direct authority of the French government, administered by the Minister of Overseas France. The laws of France where applicable apply. See Age of consent Europe#France.\n\nIn Costa Rica under the \"Penal Code of 2004\", the age of consent is 18, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender. \n\n\nThe age of consent used to be 15, but it was increased in recent years after legal reform.\n\nThe age of consent in Cuba is 16.\n\nThe age of consent in Curaçao is 15, as specified by the Criminal Code of the Netherlands Antilles (which Curaçao didn't change after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles), Articles 251, which reads:\n\nArt 251: \"A person who, out of wedlock, with a person , performs indecent acts comprising or including sexual penetration of the body is liable to a term of imprisonment of not more than sixteen years\".\n\nFor children 12-14 prosecution only takes place upon a \"complaint\" by the minor, his parents, teacher, or the guardianship board.\n\nIn Dominica the age of consent is 16.\n\n\"Defilement of girls between fourteen (14) and sixteen (16) years of age\", Article 4 of the \"Sexual Offences Act\"\n\n\" (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), any person who -\na) unlawfully and carnally knows, or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any girl of or above the age of fourteen (14) years and under the age of sixteen (16) years (...) - is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n\nThe age of consent in the Dominican Republic is 18.\n\nIn El Salvador, the age of consent appears to be 18 (although the laws are not clear cut in regard to sexual acts with persons aged between 15 and 18).\n\n\nVIOLACIÓN EN MENOR O INCAPAZ\n\nArt. 159.- El que tuviere acceso carnal por vía vaginal o anal con menor de quince años de edad o con otra persona aprovechándose de su enajenación mental, de su estado de inconsciencia o de su incapacidad de resistir, será sancionado con prisión de catorce a veinte años.\n\n\"Approximate translation\": \"Anyone who has vaginal or anal sexual intercourse with a minor younger than fifteen years of age or of another person by taking advantage of their insanity, their state of unconsciousness or inability to resist, shall be punished with imprisonment of fourteen to twenty years.\"\n\n\nSeveral laws apply to sex with persons aged between 15 and 18.\n\nArticle 169 makes it illegal to \"promote, facilitate, manage, finance, instigate or organize in any way the use of persons under eighteen years of age in sexual or erotic acts individually or organized, publicly or privately\".\n\nArt. 169.- El que promoviere, facilitare, administrare, financiare, instigare u organizare de cualquier forma la utilización de personas menores de dieciocho años en actos sexuales o eróticos, de manera individual u organizada, de forma pública o privada, será sancionado con pena de tres a ocho años de prisión.\n\nEn igual responsabilidad incurrirá quien con conocimiento de causa autorizare el uso o arrendare el inmueble para realizar cualquiera de las actividades descritas en el inciso anterior.\n\n\"Approximate translation\": Article 169 .- Any person who promotes, facilitates, manages, finances, instigates or organizes in any way the use of persons under eighteen years of age in sexual or erotic acts, individually or organized, publicly or privately, shall be punished with penalty of three to eight years in prison.\n\nSimilarly, anyone who knowingly authorizes the use or rents a property to perform any of the activities described in the preceding paragraph, incurs criminal liability.\n\nArticle 167 makes it illegal to \"promote or facilitate the corruption of a person under eighteen (...) through various sexual acts of carnal knowledge, even if the victim consents to participate in them\".\n\nCORRUPCIÓN DE MENORES E INCAPACES\n\nArt. 167.- El que promoviere o facilitare la corrupción de una persona menor de dieciocho años de edad o de un deficiente mental, mediante actos sexuales diversos del acceso carnal, aunque la víctima consintiere participar en ellos, será sancionado con prisión de seis a doce años.\n\n\"Approximate translation\": Article 167 .- Any person who promotes or facilitates the corruption of a person under eighteen years of age or a mentally handicapped through various sexual acts of carnal knowledge, even if the victim consents to participate in them, shall be punished with imprisonment of six to twelve years.\n\nArticle 171 deals with \"obscene exhibition\", and also appears to set the age of consent at 18.\n\nEXHIBICIONES OBSCENAS\n\nArt. 171.- El que ejecutare o hiciere ejecutar an otros actos lúbricos o de exhibición obscena, o indecorosa, en lugar público o expuesto al público o bien ante menores de dieciocho años de edad o deficientes mentales, será sancionado con prisión de dos a cuatro años.\n\n\"Approximate translation\": Art. 171.

See Ages of consent in Europe#Denmark.\n\nThe age of consent in Grenada is 16. Penalties are 30 years' imprisonment if the victim is less than 14, and 15 years' imprisonment if the victim is 14 to 16 years of age.\n\nIn Guatemala, the age of consent is 18, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender. The \"Law against Sexual Violence, Exploitation, and Trafficking in Persons\" was passed in February 2009, and provides sentences ranging from 13 to 24 years in prison, depending on the young persons age, for sex with a minor.\n\nThe age of consent in Haiti is 18.\n\nHonduras, the age of consent is considered to be 14.\n\nArticle 142.

The federal law establishes the age of 12 as the minimum age of consent, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities is 18 (sex with someone 12-18 is not illegal \"per se\", but can still be open to prosecution under certain circumstances). Local state laws may override the federal law. In practice, the decision as to whether or not to prosecute is left to state authorities regardless of the younger person's age.\nAt state level, the minimum ages of consent vary between 12 (and puberty in a few states) and 15, while the age at which there are no restrictions for consensual sexual activities vary from 16 to 18 (most common 18).\n\n is a crime existing across Mexico, as well as in other Latin American jurisdictions. Although the definitions vary by state, it is usually defined as sexual conduct with a child who has reached the minimum age of consent but is under 18 (16 or 17 in some states) when the consent of the child is obtained by seduction and/or deceit. For instance the law of Aguascalientes reads: \"\"El estupro consiste en realizar cópula con persona mayor de doce y menor de dieciséis años de edad, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de seducción o engaño\".\" (translation: Estupro consists in copulating with a person over twelve and under sixteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through seduction or deceit). Traditionally, estupro applied only to acts committed with a girl, and required \"chastity\" or \"honesty\" of the girl. The vast majority of Mexican states have modernized their laws by removing the requirement of \"chastity\" or \"honesty\" and by making the laws gender neutral. However, traditional laws still exist in some states: for instance, the law of Baja California reads: \"Al que realice cópula con mujer de catorce años de edad y menor de dieciocho, casta y honesta, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de la seducción o el engaño\" (translation: \"Whoever copulates with a chaste and honest female over fourteen and under eighteen years old, obtaining her consent through seduction or deceit\"). Some states have removed the requirement of \"chastity\" or \"honesty\", but continue to define estupro as applicable only to girls. For instance, in Campeche the law states: \"Al que tenga cópula con mujer mayor de doce años pero menor de dieciocho, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de la seducción o el engaño\" (translation: \"Whoever copulates with a female over twelve and under eighteen years old, obtaining her consent through seduction or deceit\"). The exact type of coercion that must be used varies by state, for example the Federal Law only makes reference to \"deceit\", omitting \"seduction\" (it reads: \"Al que tenga cópula con persona mayor de doce años y menor de dieciocho, obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de engaño\", translation: \"Whoever copulates with a person over twelve and under eighteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through deceit\").\n\nArticle 261 of the Federal Criminal Code (PDF) states that: \"Whoever, without the purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act in a person under 12 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist, or demands that the act is performed, will be punished with a term of 2 to 5 years in prison\". If the offender uses moral or physical violence, an extra half term is added to the initial time.\n\nArticle 266 refers to the previous article 265, which covers the rape of adults in general and establishes a term of 8 to 14 years in prison for sex obtained through physical or moral violence. Article 266 then states that: \"It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty: (1st Clause) – who without violence performs a copulation with a person under 12\". The 3rd Clause of this article punishes with the same penalties also \"the vaginal or anal introduction of objects, without violence and with lascivious goals\", in a person under 12 or in a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the fact, or for any reason cannot resist. If any of the aforementioned acts is performed with physical or moral violence, the sentence is raised in up to a half.\n\nA further article, 266 Bis, determines an extra penalty of up to a half under certain circumstances – (a) when there are multiple offenders; (b) when the offense is committed by a parent, legal guardian, stepfather or \"companion\" (\"amasio\") of the mother; (c) when there is an abuse of authority of someone as a civil servant; (d) when the crime is committed by a person who has the minor under his or her custody, guard or education, or yet through the abuse of trust.\n\nThere is another crime in Article 262 for consented sex with adolescents aged 12 to 18, when consent is obtained through deceit. The penalty is 3 months to 4 years in prison. This crime, however, is prosecuted only through a complaint of the minor or his/her parents or legal guardians, as determined in Article 263.\n\nArtículo 262 del Código Penal: \" Al que tenga cópula con persona \"mayor de doce años y menor de\n\"dieciocho\", obteniendo su consentimiento por medio de \"engaño\", se le aplicará de tres meses a cuatro\naños de prisión.\"\n\n\"Translation\": Article 262: \"Whoever copulates with a person over twelve and under eighteen years old, obtaining his/her consent through deceit\"\n\nArticle 201 prohibits the \"corruption\" of a minor under 16.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nAll Mexican states (as well as Mexico City) have corruption of minors statutes that can, upon complaint of the family (or minor), be used to punish sexual relations with persons under eighteen. Although actual prosecutions for violations of Corruption of Minors statutes (and age of consent statutes in general) tend to be sporadic, regional, and very situation dependent, many Mexican states nonetheless classify Corruption of Minors as a \"Delito Grave\" (Major Crime) in their penal codes.\n\nAdditionally, all the states have \"Estupro\" laws that can, upon complaint of the family (or minor), be used to prosecute adults who engage in sexual intercourse with minors by seduction or deceit (the exact definitions of this crime vary by state, see section estupro, above).\n\nIn some Mexican jurisdictions prosecutors have chosen to prosecute consensual sexual activity involving adults and underage minors only upon complaint by the minor, or a custodial complaint.\n\nThe age of consent in the Federal District (Mexico City) is 12, one of the lowest in the world, and the overall criminal legislation of Mexico's capital is close to that of the federal law regarding this subject, although tougher in some aspects – higher penalties and broader definitions.\n\nAccording to the \"Estatuto del Gobierno del Distrito Federal (PDF)(in Spanish)\" (Government Statute of the Federal District), Article 42, Clause XII, the District's Legislative Assembly has powers to legislate in criminal law.\n\nArticle 175 of the Federal District Criminal Code refers to the previous Article 174, which stipulates a term of 6 to 17 years of prison for the rape of adults, while defining copulation as \"the introduction of the penis in the human body through the vagina, anus or mouth\". Article 175 (\"violación\") then states that: \"It is equivalent to rape and will be punished with the same penalty:\" (first clause) – \"who performs a copulation with a person under 12 years of age or with a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist\"; the second clause defines whosoever \"introduces in the vagina or anus any element, instrument or any part of the human body different from the penis\" as having committed the same crime, in relation to these same persons.\n\nArticle 177 covers \"sexual abuse\" and punishes other acts referred as \"unintentional\" acts –\"who without purpose of reaching copulation, performs a sexual act with a person under 12 or a person that has no capacity of understanding the meaning of the act or that for any reason cannot resist it, or that demands that such act is observed or performed, will be punished with 2 to 7 years in prison\".\n\nIn both Articles (175 and 177), there is an extra half term in case of physical or moral violence. And according to Article 178, there is also a punishment of an extra two thirds of the term under the same circumstances foreseen in Article 266 Bis of the Federal Law (see above), added by two new circumstances – (clause V) when the victim is inside a private vehicle or a public service vehicle; and (clause VI) when the crime is committed in a desert or isolated place.\n\nThere is a crime called \"estupro\" stipulated in Article 180, which refers to consented sex with adolescents aged 12 to 18, when consent is obtained through \"any means\" of deceit. The penalty is 6 months to 4 years of prison. This crime needs a complaint (\"querella\") to be prosecuted.\n\nThere is a Corruption of Minors statute (Article 184) that can be used to punish by imprisonment, for seven to twelve years, adults who engage in sexual relations with persons under eighteen.

There exist several federal statutes related to protecting minors from sexual predators, but none of them imposes an age limit on sexual acts. On 26 June 2003, both heterosexual and homosexual sodomy became legal in all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia under the U.S. Supreme Court decision \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (between non-commercial, consenting adults in a private bedroom). In \"State v. Limon\" (2005), the Kansas Supreme Court used \"Lawrence\" as a precedent to overturn the state's \"Romeo and Juliet\" law, which proscribed lesser penalties for heterosexuals than homosexuals convicted of similar age of consent related offenses.\n\nEach U.S. state has its own age of consent, as does the District of Columbia. As of August 1, 2018, the age of consent in each state in the United States was either 16 years of age, 17 years of age, or 18 years of age. The most common age of consent is 16.\n\nThe age of consent is 18. There is however a close-in-age exemption that allows minors 16 and 17 years old to consent with someone no more than five years older than themselves and minors 13 to 15 years old to consent with one another, but not with anyone 16 or over.\n\nArticle § 1700. \"Aggravated rape in the first degree\" bans sexual intercourse or sodomy with a child under 13. Sexual acts with minors are aggravated by the use of force, intimidation, or the perpetrator's position of authority, and by the fact that the minor, being under 16 and not the perpetrator's spouse, is residing in the same household as the perpetrator.(see Article § 1700, Article § 1702, Article § 1708).\n\nOther relevant articles of the criminal code are:\n\n(a) Any person over 18 years of age who perpetrates under circumstances not amounting to rape in the first degree, an act of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a person not the perpetrator's spouse who is at least 16 years but less than 18 years of age, and the perpetrator is 5 years or older than the victim, is guilty of rape in the second degree and shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years.\n\nAny person under 18 years of age but over 16 years of age who perpetrates an act of sexual intercourse or sodomy with a person not the perpetrator's spouse who is under 16 years of age but over 13 years of age, under circumstances not amounting to rape in the first degree, is guilty of rape in the third degree and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Family Division of the Superior Court\n\n\"Sexual contact\", that is, non-penetrative sex, defined as \"the intentional touching of a person's intimate parts, whether directly or through clothing, to arouse or to gratify the sexual desires of any person\" is not permitted with children under 16, but a close-in-age exemption allows those aged at least 13 to engage in such acts with partners under 18.\n\nA person who engages in sexual contact with a person not the perpetrator's spouse—\n(..)(2) when the other person is under thirteen years of age;\n\nA person over eighteen years of age who engages in sexual contact with a person not the perpetrator's spouse who is over thirteen but under sixteen years of age is guilty of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree and shall be imprisoned not more than 1 year\nParaphrasing Virgin Islands Code: V.I.C. § 1700-1709 Virgin Islands Code\nand appeals records Francis vs. VI\n\"NOTE: \"mistake of fact as to the victim's age is not a defense\".\"\n\n"}

{"id": "969290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=969290", "title": "Cape Malays", "text": "Cape Malays\n\nCape Malays (, ) are an ethnic group or community in South Africa. The name is derived from the Cape of Good Hope and the Malay people originally from Maritime Southeast Asia, mostly from the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), a Dutch colony for several centuries, and Dutch Malacca, which the Dutch held from 1641 to 1824. The community's earliest members were enslaved Javanese transported by the Dutch East India Company. They were followed by slaves from various other Southeast Asian regions, and political dissidents and Muslim religious leaders who opposed the Dutch presence in what is now Indonesia and were sent into exile. Malays also have significant South Asian (Indian) slave ancestry. Starting in 1654, these resistors were imprisoned or exiled in South Africa by the Dutch East India Company, which founded and used what is now Cape Town as a resupply station for ships travelling between Europe and Asia. They were the group that first introduced Islam to South Africa. By the 19th century, the term was used to describe anyone at the Cape who was a practicing Muslim, irrespective of ethnic background. As such, most Cape Malays were actually from Madagascar and East Africa, shipped to the Cape as slaves from the end of the 18th century, who converted upon arrival.\n\nThe Cape Malay identity can be considered the product of a set of histories and communities as much as it is a definition of an ethnic group. Since many Cape Malay people have found their Muslim identity to be more salient than their \"Malay\" ancestry, people in one situation have been described as \"Cape Malay\", or \"Malays\" and in another as Cape Muslim by people both inside and outside of the community. Also, over time, the original Indonesian slaves intermarried with various other groups, including other slaves from South and Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and native African groups.\n\nThe \"Cape Malay\" identity was also a subcategory of the \"Coloured\" category, in the terms of the apartheid-era government's classifications of ethnicity. \n\nThe term \"Malay\" may have originated from the Malayo-Portuguese language that was a lingua franca in many Asian ports.\n\nThe founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa. The community's culture and traditions have also left an impact that is felt to this day. The Muslim community in Cape Town remains large and vibrant. It has expanded greatly beyond those exiles who started the first mosques in South Africa.\n\nPeople in the Cape Malay community generally speak mostly Afrikaans but also English, or local dialects of the two. They no longer speak the Malay languages and other languages which their ancestors used, although various Malay words and phrases are still employed in daily usage.\n\nAdaptations of traditional foods such as \"bredie\", \"bobotie\", \"sosaties\" and \"koeksisters\" are staples in many South African homes. Faldela Williams wrote three cookbooks, including \"The Cape Malay Cookbook\", which became instrumental in preserving the cultural traditions of Cape Malay cuisine.\n\nThis cultural group developed a characteristic 'Cape Malay' music. An interesting secular folk song type, of Dutch origin, is termed the \"nederlandslied\". The language and musical style of this genre reflects the history of South African slavery; it is often described and perceived as 'sad' and 'emotional' in content and context. The \"nederlandslied\" shows the influence of the Arabesque (ornamented) style of singing. This style is unique in South Africa, Africa and probably in the world.\n\nCape Malay music has been of great interest to academics, historians, musicologists, writers and even politicians. The well-known annual Cape Town Minstrel or Carnival street festival is a deep-rooted Cape Malay cultural event; it incorporates the Cape Malay comic song or \"moppie\" (often also referred to as \"ghoema\" songs). The barrel-shaped drum, called the 'ghoema', is also closely associated with Cape Malay music.\n\nIt is estimated that there are about 166,000 people in Cape Town who could be described as Cape Malay, and about 10,000 in Johannesburg. The picturesque Malay Quarter of Cape Town is found on Signal Hill, and is called the \"Bo-Kaap\".\n\nMany Cape Malay people also lived in District Six before they, among many other South African people of diverse ethnicity, were forcefully removed from their homes by the apartheid government and redistributed into townships on the Cape Flats.\n\nConnections between Malaysians and South Africans took up when South Africa rejoined the international community. The latter's re-entry was welcomed by Malaysian government and many others in the Southeast Asian region. Non-governmental organisations, such as the Federation of Malaysia Writers' Associations, have since set on linking up with the diasporic Cape Malay\ncommunity. There is also an increase in the interest of the food, culture and heritage of Cape Malay descendants around the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "25814293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25814293", "title": "Climate governance", "text": "Climate governance\n\nIn political ecology and environmental policy, climate governance is the diplomacy, mechanisms and response measures \"aimed at steering social systems towards preventing, mitigating or adapting to the risks posed by climate change\". A definitive interpretation is complicated by the wide range of political and social science traditions (including comparative politics, political economy and multilevel governance) that are engaged in conceiving and analysing climate governance at different levels and across different arenas. In academia, climate governance has become the concern of geographers, anthropologists, economists and business studies scholars.\n\nIn the past two decades a paradox has arisen between rising awareness about the causes and consequences of climate change and an increasing concern that the issues that surround it represent an intractable problem.\nInitially, climate change was approached as a global issue, and climate governance sought to address it on the international stage. This took the form of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), beginning with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992. With the exception of the Kyoto Protocol, international agreements between nations have been largely ineffective in achieving legally binding emissions cuts and with the end of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period in 2012, starting from 2013 there is no legally binding Global climate regime. This inertia on the international political stage contributed to alternative political narratives that called for more flexible, cost effective and participatory approaches to addressing the multifarious problems of climate change. These narratives relate to the increasing diversity of methods that are being developed and deployed across the field of climate governance.\n\nThe development of climate governance can be traced firstly to climate diplomacy between inter-state actors and secondly to the development of transnational networks and non-state actors. The timeline above highlights key points throughout this process. The point of ‘creation’ is difficult to determine exactly, however a definitive point in its history is the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Rio. This has been termed “the first major milestone in the history of climate diplomacy”. The conference addressed nations from across the globe and sought to emulate the diplomatic success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals.\n\nAs climate governance has continued to develop on the international stage, a string of transnational public and public-private actor networks have sought to implement its aims within their own arena, for example the C40, the Global Cities Covenant on Climate (also known as the 'Mexico City Pact'), and the Cities for Climate Protection Programme (CCPP). The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNFCED) in 1992 was a 'trigger' for this process. Existing regional and local networks adopted its emissions reduction targets and began to consider how they could be achieved at a local level. An example is ICLEI ‘Local Governments for Sustainability’ that adopted the convention's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of its commitment to link local action to internationally agreed-upon goals. Under the umbrella of internationally agreed climate targets, innovative climate governance methods have also developed that seek to reduce emissions using market based mechanisms, for example the 'cap and trade' mechanism.\n\nThus, while the interstate process of treaty making continues to play a key part in mitigating anthropogenic climate change, it now exists as part of a wider tapestry of private and public climate governance initiatives that operate at multiple scales.\n\nThe North-South divide is a socio-economic and political division. Applied to climate governance, the divide separates 'developed' northern countries that have historically emitted disproportionately high emissions from 'undeveloped' southern countries that have emitted considerably less emissions. The divide has also been used to highlight differences in vulnerability to climate change (the global south is considered more vulnerable due to a higher incident of natural disasters, less developed infrastructure and less wealth). These divides have fed into all issues of international climate governance, bringing with them questions of social justice and equity that remain current today. A criticism of the divide is that it simplifies an increasingly complex landscape. In recent years, international trade, free capital flows and the development of some southern nations (for example China and India) have redefined global socio-economic and political relations.\n\nClimate governance has been identified as multi-scale, multi-actor and deeply embedded in our social and physical infrastructure:\n\n\nParticular scientific and technical practices shape and inform our understanding of climate change and in doing so define how environmental problems are defined as objects of governance. For example, recent advances in carbon cycle research, remote sensing and carbon accounting techniques have revealed that tropical deforestation accounts for 15% of global carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, it has become a viable concern of climate governance. Previous to its quantification, tropical deforestation had been expressly excluded from the Kyoto Protocol. However, the translation of scientific or policy research findings into governance through the political process remains difficult as science and politics have very different ways of dealing with the issue of uncertainty that is naturally a component of research\n\nCommunity engagement plays an important role in the implementation of climate governance policy. There are two main reasons for this. First, where climate governance necessitates change at a behavioural level, there is a need to educate the public in order to achieve this (for example reducing car travel). Where successful, this offers the possibility that communities can become self governing, for example choosing to drive less.\nSecond, effective community engagement ensures that climate governance policies are relevant to the communities in which they are intended to be applied. This necessitates a process of ‘bottom up learning’, as ideas are passed up from a local to national level. This approach has been identified as the normative framework of ‘learning organisations’ and popular within environmental organisations that seek to encourage grassroots development \n\nThe history of climate governance has seen increasing emphasis placed on market based solutions, or “flexibility mechanisms”. This is a development that complements, rather than replaces traditional ‘command and control’ regulation. The decision to favour market mechanisms has been identified as inevitable given the growth in popularity of neoliberalism over the past two decades. Thus, targets set at international climate governance conventions have been achieved through the application of markets (for example the EU-ETS), public-private partnerships (for example “type II partnerships”) and the self-regulation of industry (for example the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership).\n\nSignificantly, the Kyoto Protocol offers participating countries three market based mechanisms as means to meeting their binding emissions reduction targets. These are 'emissions trading' (known as “the carbon market\"), 'the clean development mechanism' (CDM) and 'joint implementation' (JI). The three Kyoto market mechanisms have been identified as forms of carbon market governance, a market based form of climate governance. Carbon market governance allows carbon emissions in one place to be exchanged with emissions reductions in another. It relies on measuring, monitoring and verification techniques to commensurate carbon, allowing seemingly disparate activities to appear on the same balance sheet.\n\nThe largest working example of carbon market governance to date is the EU-ETS. It is a multinational emissions trading scheme. Advocates of this mechanism cite its focus on improving efficiency, reducing carbon where it is most cost efficient to do so. Its critics identify that it has so far allowed participating industries to profit from excess carbon credits while having little or no effect on their carbon emissions.\n\nThe view of climate governance stakeholders that climate action was a costly burden has somehow changed in recent years: According to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, up to 90% of the actions required to get onto a 2°C pathway would be compatible with the goals of boosting national development, equitable growth and broadly shared improvements in living standards. Three phenomena are behind this cost-benefit analysis: First, \"negative cost abatement\" means that curbing emissions reduces overall costs (e.g. energy savings). Second, economies of scale and learning-by-doing innovation potentially lead to falling costs over time. Third, so-called \"co-benefits\" such as health benefits through less air pollution or livelihood security through land restoration can be beneficial for individual countries. \n\nIn addition to the efforts of nation-states to coordinate internationally on matters of climate governance, nation-states, non-state actors and private actors are becoming increasingly involved in multiple parallel climate governance partnerships on a global scale. These actors include cities, regions, NGOs and corporations. Their increasingly prominent involvement has led scholars to reassess the nature of power in climate governance as well as the relationship between public and private authority \n\nTo distinguish between types of climate governance networks currently in existence, it is useful to separate components into sub-categories. Studies into climate governance have distinguished between modes of governance (self-governing, governing through enabling, governing by provision and governing by authority), types of actors and political scale of governance. For the purpose of this section they are separated according to the type of actors involved – ‘public climate governance partnerships’, ‘public-private climate governance’ partnerships and ‘private climate governance partnerships’. 'Modes of governance' and ‘scale’ (e.g. supranational, national, regional, and local) represent equally viable alternatives to this categorisation. While none of these approaches are definitive (each approach exhibits overlaps), defining partnerships according to participating actor is here considered to draw the clearer distinction.\n\n\n\n\nA relatively new approach to governing climate impacts upon social systems is to use the flexible technique of adaptive governance, introduced by Holling in 1978 as opposed to the more mitigation-focused approaches which have generally dominated efforts thus far. Adaptive governance “refers to the ways in which institutional arrangements evolve to satisfy the needs and desires of the community in a changing environment”.\nSeveral theorists believe that it is within a society’s capacity to adapt to the gradual climate changes we are experiencing currently, and those felt in the future. Therefore, utilizing adaptive governance is perhaps the ideal solution as its experimental approach allows newly created institutions to “experiment with different solutions and learn from them in order to adapt and transform\". The role of these institutions is to then formulate policies to strengthen the resilience between complex climate and social systems, and therefore the system’s ability to adapt and remain stable in the face of climate changes in the future.\n\nIn addition, institutions encourage communication between different levels of power (local, regional, national and international) to govern resources, whilst also engaging a broad set of stakeholders e.g. NGO’s and the public. Therefore, the approach takes a predominantly ‘bottom up’ strategy, focusing on community-based actions. In terms of climate change this provides an alternative to the ‘top down’ IPCC proceedings and world negotiations, which many perceive as having no effect in addressing climate issues.\n\nAdaptive governance has been successfully implemented in a number of local society’s around the world in building their ability to adapt to climate change associated impacts such as extreme weather and altering plant biodiversities. Success has mainly been attributed to the fact that through adaptive governance, the social impact is dealt with locally to achieve a more effective result whilst still allowing communication to flow between low to high levels of command. For example, Brunner & Lynch in 2010 studied how the Barrow community in Alaska successfully communicated with local and regional governments to develop adaptive strategies for minimizing extreme weather impacts.\n\nSeveral limitations have arisen when applying the adaptive governance strategy to climate governance. Firstly, when applied at local level, adaptive governance is evidently successful; however, Evans (2011) found problems when applying such techniques over a large scale. For example, the technique could have limited success when adapting to a national or international problem as the system may become too complex. A further weakness highlighted by Ostrom in 2007 is that many adaptive governance systems have been implemented to build resilience to gradual changes but anthropogenic climate change could cause rapid alterations and so challenge the robustness of the whole governance system. Finally, using this experimental approach for such a precarious and influential system as our climate has been considered too risky, especially as Earth is potentially nearing the 2 degree global warming tipping point.\n\nEven with these limitations, adaptive governance is evidently a successful strategy at local scale in addressing unique climate change impacts on social systems. Therefore, the idea of focusing on and monitoring localized problems to achieve a global goal may well be highly influential as the impacts of climate change become increasingly widespread and complex.\n\nIt is said with some imprecision by some popular observers that the core commitments of the Kyoto Protocol expire in 2012. More precisely, the first commitment period for Annex B Parties (commonly known as Annex 1 Parties) to the Kyoto Protocol run from 2008 to 2012 inclusive, with a carbon accounting truing up period that may run for some time after 2012. The other obligations of parties to the Kyoto Protocol are not time limited in the way that the First Commitment Period QELEROs of Annex B Parties are. While the more recent Copenhagen Accord endorses these commitments, it does not commit signatory countries to agree on a binding successor. Future global consensus will require the respective roles of developed and developing countries to be determined according to their relative responsibilities and capabilities. Furthermore, all participating countries will need to agree that resultant legal architecture is fair and therefore acceptable. A key limitation in achieving this is the refusal of the United States to commit to legally binding negotiations. The re-engagement of the United States in this field has been cited as a potential future \"trigger\" that could lead to multilateral legally binding emissions reductions in GHG emissions.\n\nMovement at a national level could also stimulate multilateral negotiations as some countries look set to press ahead with legally binding emissions cuts. On 17 May 2011, the UK Government introduced the Fourth Carbon Budget which aims to \"set an ambitious target in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . . . and build momentum toward a legally global climate change deal\".\n\nIn the absence of a multilateral emissions reduction agreement, the future direction of climate governance remains uncertain. Supranational and national legislation could legislate the continuation of market based emissions reduction mechanisms, for example the EU-ETS. The increased agency of non-state actors in the realm of global governance and the growth of public and public-private networks offer the potential for the global climate arena to develop at a sub-national level. Recent attempts to 'territorialise' the carbon cycle seek to frame climate change as a local rather than global problem by rearticulating the global carbon cycle as a combination of national 'sinks'.\n\nAn emerging research direction is focusing on the institutional accountabilities and capability for change involved in effective global climate governance, from a perspective of individual organisations involved, as well as systemic responsiveness to people most affected by climate change\n"}

In a 2010 survey, Tajikistanis said they were most likely to be confronted with bribery during dealings with the traffic police (53.6%), followed closely by land purchases (53.3%) and dealings with universities (45.4%). Almost two-thirds believed that the level of corruption in the country was high and unlikely to change soon; about half thought that most officials take bribes; and about half viewed corruption negatively.\n\nTransparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 161st place out of 180 countries\n\nTajikistan gained independence in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and the ensuing civil war, waged from 1992 to 1997, left the people largely apathetic and passive in the face of government authority. Landlocked and poor in natural resources, Tajikistan remains the poorest and least developed of the former Soviet republics, with half of the inhabitants living on less than 2 USD a day. Many Tajiks have emigrated to Russia or Kazakhstan, and the large amounts of money they send back home make Tajikistan one of the more remittance-dependent countries on earth. There are, moreover, major problems with organized crime, drug trafficking, religious extremism, and drug abuse.\n\nThe 2012 Corruption Perception Index, published by Transparency International, gave Tajikistan a score of 22 out of 100, placing it in 157th place out of 176. Several of its neighbors received similar scores: Pakistan (27), Uzbekistan (17), Turkmenistan (17), and Kyrgyzstan (24). Afghanistan did considerably worse, scoring only 8 points.\n\nTajikistan received a score of 9 out of 100, for control of corruption on the World Bank’s 2009 Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). This score represented a drop from 18 in 2007.\n\nIn a 2010 survey by the United Nations Development Programme, almost 80% of respondents said their country was corrupt.\n\nTajikistan is not considered a free country; Freedom House has called the country's multi-party system a \"democratic façade.\" Government employees and officials often extort money from citizens, especially from civil servants. For instance, some public employees were required to buy shares in the Rogun Dam in order to keep their jobs.\n\nOwing to corruption, incompetence, and a lack of public resources and facilities, the country's government administration is highly inefficient, and bribery is common. Farmers and entrepreneurs in particular have to deal with corrupt officials on a regular basis.\n\nThe current regime is awash in patronage, cronyism, and self-enrichment. Political and economic power is concentrated the hands of the family of Emomali Rakhmon, president since 1992. The government has ties to organized crime and accountability is rarely present.\n\nU.S. diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 noted that members of Rakhmon's family and inner circle are widely viewed as being the most corrupt people in the country. An example of the problem of nepotism at the highest level is Rakhmon's son Rustam Emomali, who by his mid-20s had already been a member the Dushanbe city council, head of the Tajikistan Football Federation, owner of a major football club, head of the Customs Service, and head of the country's anti-corruption agency. In January 2017, Rustam Emomali was appointed Mayor of Dushanbe, a key position, which is seen by some analysts as the next step to the top of the government. Similarly, the president made his daughter Ozoda Emomali as the deputy minister of foreign affairs in 2009, and five years later appointed her as first deputy minister. Her husband, Jamoliddin Nuraliyev, became first deputy finance minister in 2008 and a deputy chairman of the National Bank in 2015.\n\nGenerally speaking, details of government budgets are not made available to the public. Government officials and high-level employees are required by law to disclose their assets, but their declarations are never audited.\n\nCorrupt Tajik officials have siphoned billions of dollars from state-owned banks and enterprises into offshore accounts. According to the IMF, about $3.5 billion, or more than a third of the country's annual GDP, has ended up in such accounts. The state-run Talco aluminum smelter is owned by British Virgin Islands-based firms, and its revenue, instead of being returned to the state budget, has been used as a slush fund for Tajik officials.\n\nElections are characterized by massive fraud, and members of opposition parties are routinely bought off, threatened, exiled, or imprisoned. While the law limits donations allowed to be made to political parties from a person and candidates, the financial accounts of parties and politicians are not audited.\n\nAlthough the judiciary is nominally independent, in practice it is under the control of the president, who has the power to hire and fire judges at will. President Rakhmon's power over the courts has intensified over time. Judges are widely viewed as incompetent, and many of them solicit illegal payments in order to settle cases or release inmates from prison. Conflicts of interests in legal cases are common, with no safeguards readily available.\n\nThe degree to which corrupt leaders in Tajikistan enjoy impunity is reflected in the case of Muradali Alimardon. Despite being found in 2009 to have made $550 million in illicit loans to family-related projects, Alimardon was promoted from National Bank chairman to deputy prime minister, after which, according to \"The Economist\", he took a $120 million more in unauthorized loans from state-owned Agroinvestbank.\n\nPolice officers, especially traffic police, are viewed as being highly corrupt. In particular, they are seen as catering to elites, who are virtually immune from arrest and prosecution, rather than serving citizens. Police salaries, moreover, are low, and officers routinely solicit bribes to supplement their incomes. Many members of the police force also collaborate with organized criminals, notably drug smugglers. As of 2012, about a third of Tajikistan’s GDP came from heroin trafficking, which, according to the U.S. State Department, occurs with the aid of law enforcement and government officials.\n\nBusiness executives in Tajikistan, according to the World Economic Forum’s 2013 Global Competitiveness Report, view corruption as the fourth largest obstacle to business in Tajikistan, behind tax rates, government regulations, and poor access to financing. In 2015, Tajikistan ranked at 166th out of 189 countries on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking place, placing it at the bottom of the Europe and Central Asia region. According to a 2008 World Bank survey, over 44% of business people say they were expected to present civil servants with “gifts,” and over a third had experienced bribery demands during the previous year.\n\nHealth workers are generally not well paid, and rely on gifts and bribes to supplement their income. Many citizens must pay bribes in order to receive supposedly free medical care or to secure a hospital bed.\n\nAs a rule, young people must pay sizeable bribes to get into universities and receive better grades.\n\nU.S. diplomatic cables written in 2006 and 2007 and leaked in 2010 called “anti-corruption” a new buzzword in Tajikistan, but suggested that there was little substance to the government's purported efforts on this front. A law passed in 2008 professes to set in place strong safeguards and to protect whistleblowers, but in practice corruption continues to flourish. Similarly, another law professes to guarantee access to government information, but in practice it is difficult for most citizens to gain such access. The Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman was established in 2008, but the government and judiciary pay little heed to complaints submitted to it. Although the Ombudsman is nominally independent, he is personally appointed by the president and can be replaced by him.\n\nThere are laws supposedly requiring transparency in political party financing, but they tend to be ineffective. Other laws require that announcements and tenders be published and that public procurement officials declare their assets, but they are not properly enforced.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Network (ACN) for Eastern Europe and Central Asia was founded by the OECD, European Union, and several banking and business organizations in 1998 to support anti-corruption efforts in the region. In 2003, the ACN launched an initiative which involves producing country reviews for Tajikistan and seven other countries. Tajikistan has been a member of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) since 2006. Since 2012, the OSCE's Tajikistan office has contained a Good Governance Unit, which seeks to work with the government to fight corruption. Also, Tajikistan is one of four countries in the region chosen by the World Bank to test its Country Governance and Anti-Corruption process.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of purported anti-corruption efforts is reflected in the fact that the nation's agency for the state's control of its budget and opposing corruption is generally viewed as one of the country's most corrupt institutions. Most of those who are prosecuted for corruption by the agency are employed in the lower rungs of the civil service, with the bulk of prosecutions occurring in the health, education, and agriculture sectors. This agency, formed in 2007, is under Rakhmon's control, not parliament's, guaranteeing that no one will be prosecuted for corruption without his personal approval. In an example of the high-level nepotism that is well-nigh ubiquitous in Tajikistan, the agency has been headed since March 2015 by Rakhmon's son Rustam.\n\nA June 2015 report noted that Rustam had just arrested Hasan Rajabov (sometimes transliterated as Khasan Radzhabov), an adviser to the president, on corruption charges. Rajabov was accused of massive embezzlement and soliciting bribes. Also arrested was Izzattullo Azizov, a member of the state religious affairs committee, who was accused of soliciting $2,000 bribes from Muslims wanting to travel to Mecca for the hajj. In addition, Rustam has arrested several other senior officials for corruption.\n\nOne problem with anti-corruption efforts is that persons in power routinely use corruption allegations to try to bring down their political opponents. In June 2016, a government newspaper accused Muhiddin Kabiri, the exiled leader of the opposition, of illicit property purchases, and he has avoided prosecution only by staying abroad. Zaid Saidov, a former industry minister who had attempted to establish an opposition party, was targeted with corruption charges in 2013, and was arrested and sentenced to 51 years in prison.\n\nA May 2014 OECD report called on Tajikistan to step up its fight against corruption. While praising the country for passing anti-corruption laws, the OECD urged the regime to enforce those laws.\n"}

These enterprises were overseen from 1833 to 1974 by the Office of the Crown Agents in London, thereafter named the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administration. Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations Ltd became a private Limited company providing development services in 1996.\n\nToday the term is also used to refer to state-controlled companies in some states of the British Commonwealth.\n\nCrown agencies nominally reported directly to (and were wholly owned by) the Crown, but in practice, reported to the Crown Agency Office in London, thus independent of the Colonial Office. This office became, in the late 19th century, the sole official British commercial and financial agent of all British protectorates and Crown colonies. The Colonial Office enforced a policy of sole usage of crown agencies for all purchases of goods for government use, creating a virtual monopoly over government retail supply within the colonies of the British Empire. The Crown Agencies also became financial institutions, supplying capital, routes for investment, and pensions to all public works and government in British dependent colonies (excluding such Dominions as Canada or Australia). Crown Agencies were the bodies responsible for all large projects such as railway or harbour construction throughout British Africa, India, and the West Indies.\n\nCrown Agencies trace their founding to the time of the British Empire and in 1833 the British government, hived off from the Colonial Office as a financing, stores, transport, and development (to use a modern term) office. Historians have argued that crown agencies, whose organisations operated across the British Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were the de facto administrators of British colonies. Crown Agencies welded governmental powers through the maze of British, territories, protectorates, dependencies, Mandates, and Crown Colonies which de jure made up the British Empire of the late 19th century. From 1833 to 1880, they also operated in areas with Dominion status. After this, their mandate was reduced to \"dependent\" colonies (most of British Africa, India, and the West Indies), but they were given near monopoly rights over finance and supply of non-local manufactures for any public or government use.\n\nWith the dissolution of the British Empire, many of these agencies reverted to control by their respective governments, became parts of the British government, or became Non-governmental organisations. The central Crown Agency Office became involved in the secondary banking sector, but the Secondary banking crisis of 1973–1975 drove the Agency into a debt of over two million British pounds and the agency filed for bankruptcy in 1974. The British government at the time found the Agency useful for overseas development and, argues one writer, enabled aid to be channeled to British goods, while providing cover for unsavory expenditures such as arms sales. This last function was carried out by what was originally a wholly owned subsidiary of the crown agency, Millbank Technical Services (1967–79, when it was transferred to the Ministry of Defence and renamed), which has since been accused of Neocolonial involvement in former British colonies and covert arms sales. The British government incorporated the Crown Agency as a government mandated corporation tied to the Minister of Overseas Development, called the \"Crown Agents for Overseas Governments and Administration\". In 1997, the Crown Agency was privatised. As a private limited company, the CAOGA has a number of contracts to provide governmental or para-governmental services throughout the world, such as providing the customs services of the Government of Angola \n\nThe legal category of crown agencies still exist in some nations of the former British Empire. In most places, these have been replaced by government agencies, state-controlled companies, and (in parts of the Commonwealth) Crown Corporations. Canada and New Zealand maintain the category of government managed or owned entities called Crown Agencies.\n\nWhere existing today, as in Canada they report to the sovereign governments in the states where they operate. In Canada, the term may refer to any government agency, created by statute, which does not report to a government Ministry. CN Rail and the Ontario Heritage Foundation, for instance, are under Canadian Law \"Crown Agencies\".\n\nThe term is also used under New Zealand law to designate state owned enterprises which do not report directly to a single Ministry.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term is sometimes used to refer to Crown bodies: public bodies which have Crown status, meaning that material which they produce is subject to Crown copyright protection.\n\n\n\n"}

Demalagattara are Theravada Buddhists by religion. They are ethnically Sinhalese but proclaim their Tamil ethnic origins, whereas all other South India-derived castes such as Karave, Salagama, Durave, Berava and even Govigama do not emphasise their Tamil links as part of their assimilation into Sinhalese society.\n\nAs the mainstream Sinhalese speakers claim North Indian ethnic origins the presence of many South Indian type Jatis like the Demalagatara indicate a complex migration history from India to Sri Lanka. Demalagatara do not indicate any tribal origins like the other, formerly untouchable, caste of Rodiyas. Their place in the caste structure is related to a primary function associated with formerly martial origins. They were classed as a sub-caste of the Govigama during the British period. Many are agriculturalists and workers throughout the country.\n\nSome anthropologists believe that the early society of Sri Lanka has looked to neighboring South India for manpower to fulfill functional needs as land was cleared and many new villages found. Demalagatara are believed to be descended from Maravar or Kallar like martial castes of South India who also play an important role as mercenaries medieval Sinhalese kingdoms.\n\n‘Demala’ is the Sinhala word for Tamil and ‘Gattara’ is the word used in ancient Sri Lankan rock inscriptions and literature to refer to serfs. Thus Demalagattara translates into English as ‘Tamil serfs’. ‘Agricultural serfs’ were part of the feudal land tenure system of Sri Lanka. There were also ‘domestic serfs’.\n\nThe community says that they descended from soldiers who accompanied a 2nd-century BCE Tamil Chola King named as Ellara. But in reality the story is partly true, they are South Indian soldiers who got to settle down due royal grants but the actual time and the king(s) who granted them these privileges happened much later than indicated by their origin myth. Research on origins was carried out during the British Colonial period and is dated. (See Caste in Sri Lanka)\n\n"}

The Armenian Apostolic Church can trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics and evangelical Protestants.\n\nAccording to the Census of 2011 the religion in Armenia is the following: Christianity 2,862,366 (94.8%) of whom 2,797,187 Armenian Apostolic (92.5%), 29,280 Evangelical, 13,996 Armenian and Roman (Latin) Catholic, 8,695 Jehovah's Witness, 8,587 Eastern Orthodox (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Greek), 2,874 Molokan (non-Orthodox Russians), 1,733 Assyrian Church of the East (Nestorian), 733 Protestant, 241 Mormon, Yazidism (0.8%), Paganism (0.2%), 812 Islam, 5,299 Other Religion (0.2%), 121,587 No Response (4%).\n\nThe estimated number of population net migration is -24.8 thousand persons, according to the Integrated living conditions survey of households of 2016; for urban population -13.8 thousand and for rural population -11.0 thousand persons.\n\n24.9 % of households were involved in external and internal migration processes over the period of 2013- 2016.

A majority of the republic's residents are the descendants of people from the Indian subcontinent. Mauritius also contains substantial populations from continental Africa, China, France, Great Britain and the East African island nation of Madagascar among other places.\n\nThe majority of the population are Indo-Mauritians (people of Indian descent) who make up 68% of the population. Creoles (of African descent or mixed-race) are about a quarter of the population. There are approximately 30,000 Sino-Mauritians from the Hakka and other Chinese sub-ethnic/linguistic groups.\n\nFranco-Mauritians (Mauritian of French ancestry) are numbered about 13,000. The Franco-Mauritian group, mostly are the descendants of former slave-owners, comprises the largest group of people of European origin on the island. There is a smaller population of people of British descent living in Mauritius, most of whom have Mauritian nationality. The term Anglo-Mauritian, which may also include Mauritians living in the UK, is used unofficially.\nThere's also a substantial new arrivals of white South Africans, numbering about 20,000, and is a growing community.\n\nWhile within the Mauritian social context, the main ethnic groups are refer to as the following: Hindus or Indians (North Indian Hindus) 40% (520,000), residing all over the Island, with higher concentration in the North. Creoles (Afro or Afro-Indian) 22% (286,000), mostly central plateau area, the suburbs of Port Louis and coastal villages such as Baie du Tombeau and the black river region. Muslims (Indo-Muslims) 16%(208,000), most living in the central plateau towns and Plaine Verte in the capital city.

The general population gathers all that don't practice the Hindu or Muslim religion, or are not Chinese by race. Hence general population is the Christian community, which includes whites, coloureds, blacks, and a good amount of those of Indian ancestry especially Tamils who have converted to Christianity. The exception to the rule is that the general population does not include the Christian-Chinese, although 90% are Christians.\n\nNote since independence nearly 60% of the Coloured community (51,000), 60% of the whites (17,000), 50% of the Chinese (26,000), and further 26,000 Afro-creoles and Christian-Tamils have departed; coloureds mostly to Australia, whites or near white coloureds (pass as whites) to South Africa, Chinese to Canada and Afro-Creoles and Christian Tamils mostly Europe/U.K. There is 200,000 Mauritians living outside of Mauritius of which 120,000 people are Christians, representing the majority in the diaspora at 60%.\n\nSmall groups of foreign students from Europe or the Indian Ocean region are also present. Recent years have seen a steady flow of foreign workers into the textile industry (primarily Chinese women), the construction industry (primarily Indian workers), and harbour-related activities (primarily Taiwanese men). Immigration policy does not provoke much debate in Mauritius, and the relative economic stability of the island serves to attract foreign workers.\n\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to 479,000 in 1950.\n\nThe proportion of the population aged under 15 was 21.9% in 2010. 71.2% were between 15 and 65 years of age, with 6.9% being 65 years or older.\n\nStructure of the population (04.07.2011) (Census, complete tabulation) :\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2012) (Estimates based on the results of the 2011 Population Census) :\n\nMauritius has an estimated population of 1,283,415 on December 31, 2010. 14,701 children were born in 2011 (birth rate 11.4 per 1,000).\n\nThe table below presents the population development of Mauritius since 1900.

{"id": "22983863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22983863", "title": "Deng Yujiao incident", "text": "Deng Yujiao incident\n\nThe Deng Yujiao incident () occurred on 10 May 2009 at a hotel in Badong County, Hubei province, in the People's Republic of China. Deng Yujiao, a 21-year-old pedicure worker, tried to rebuff the advances of Deng Guida (; no relation), director of the local township business promotions office, who had come to the hotel seeking sexual services. She allegedly stabbed her assailant several times trying to fight him off, resulting in his death. Badong County police subsequently arrested Deng Yujiao, charged her with homicide, and refused to grant her bail.\n\nThis case came to national prominence through internet forums and chatrooms, where netizens were enraged by her treatment. The case resonated with the public anger over the corruption and immorality of officials, and garnered over four million forum posts across the country. Chinese authorities attempted to downplay the incident by limiting its presence on Chinese web portals, and a large number of discussion threads were censored. Following groundswell of public protests and online petitions, prosecutors dropped murder charges, granted her bail, and charged her with a lesser offense of \"intentional assault\". She was found guilty but did not receive a sentence due to her mental state. The two surviving officials involved in the incident were sacked, also ostensibly in response to public pressure.\n\nDeng Yujiao, a native of Mulongya village, Badong County, was a 21-year-old pedicure worker at the Dream Fantasy City () bath center at Xiongfeng Hotel (), when the incident occurred.\n\nDeng Guida was the director of the local township's business promotions office. He, his deputy, Huang Dezhi (), and one other official arrived at the hotel where Deng Yujiao worked on 10 May 2009 and allegedly requested \"special services\" (a euphemism commonly taken to mean sexual services in China) from Deng Yujiao. She did not submit to the requests. Deng Guida had allegedly pulled out a stack of banknotes worth ¥ 4000 and slapped her in the face with it to show off his wealth. He then pushed Deng Yujiao onto a sofa and proceeded to lay on top of her. At this moment, in self-defense, Deng Yujiao used a small 3 inch knife and stabbed her assailant four times. One of the stabs landed in her assailant's neck, causing him to bleed to death at the scene. His deputy was also stabbed. Police, who apparently found pills in her purse, said Deng Yujiao may have been suffering from acute depression, and took her to a psychiatric hospital on 12 May for examination. During Deng's days in the hospital her arms and ankles were tied to the bed, which was referred to by the police as \"a procedure of protection.\"\n\nTwo lawyers from Beijing, Xia Lin () and Xia Nan (), took on her case \"pro bono\". On 25 May 2009, they lodged an official complaint against one of the attackers, Huang Dezhi at the Badong police station. Details of the complaint:\n\n\nOn 22 May 2009, Yang Liyong (楊立勇) was interviewed by \"Southern Metropolis Daily\", during which he presented the official police version of the incident.\n\n\nAfter Deng turned herself in to the police, she was initially charged with murder. Deng claimed she acted in self-defense after the official attempted to rape her. Blogger Wu Gan, wrote about her case in his blog. A Berkeley professor remarked to the \"New York Times\" that instead of garnering hundreds of thousands of mentions on Internet blogs and other forums, Deng’s case accumulated in excess of four million posts across websites. Deng's plight struck a note with millions of Chinese fed up with low-level corruption and \"rampant social injustice and the lack of fundamental respect in society,\" in the words of a Beijing lawyer. Deng was hailed as a national hero for resisting official abuse of power. Her supporters, who demanded a fair trial, took their protest to Beijing. Their visual stunt was a woman wearing a mask and wrapped in white cloth; a sign saying \"Anyone could be Deng Yujiao\" was laid on the ground around her. The photos immediately appeared on the Internet.\n\nChinese bloggers showed their solidarity with Deng Yujiao by distributing free T-shirts on the net with popular slogans like:\n\n\nAs a result of the national outcry, police released her on bail and put her under house arrest; prosecutors charged her with a lesser offense of \"intentional assault\" instead of murder. The two surviving officials were sacked on 31 May. \"Xinhua\" reported that Badong County Communist Party Discipline Inspection Committee removed Huang Dezhi from the post of vice director of the office of business delegations of Yesanguan Township, and stripped of his CPC membership, as he had \"pushed and shoved and verbally insulted a waitress who refused to accompany them to take a bath\" in a bathhouse on 10 May in Badong, the authorities said. Huang has been \"detained in connection with public order offences.\" Deng Zhongjia, 45, another vice director of the same office who was present at the time of the incident, was also fired, ostensibly because the incident had caused a \"bad social effect\" although he had not broken any laws or regulations.\n\nThe Badong county police said that an official had been killed whilst in a quarrel with Deng Yujiao. Their statement issued on 13 May said that Deng Guida twice pushed the girl onto a sofa and was killed by a pedicure knife. Police said that the murder weapon was a fruit knife five days later.\n\nMeng Jianzhu, minister of the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, allegedly gave instruction to his deputy:\nDeng Yujiao's mother received a call, purportedly from the police, after which she washed most of her daughter's clothes thereby removing potential physical evidence. The police also announced on 23 May that she had hired two Hubei lawyers to replace the initial lawyers who, it was alleged, had breached Deng Yujiao's privacy.\n\nOn approximately 22 May, Beijing censors ordered websites to stop reporting the case. The State Council Information Office issued directives to all Chinese websites to remove all the recommended news stories and commentaries on Deng Yujiao. No posts about Deng Yujiao must be placed at the top of the page. Later on, the Beijing Information Office telephoned portals instructing them to use only official government statements and not report or comment on Deng Yujiao. The State Information Office ordered media and web portals to 'dilute the Deng Yujiao case with other news', delete any 'open letters and pleadings', and bar any web based opinion poll or petition.\n\nTelevision and the Internet were cut off in Yesanguan, officially as a precaution against lightning strikes. The Internet attention drew Chinese journalists to Badong County. But after censorship was imposed, local officials began screening outsiders, and some journalists seeking to report there were beaten. The blog of Wu Gan, which had publicised Deng's case, was shut down by censors.\n\nAccording to the media, Deng Yujiao's murder charge was changed to intentional assault, most likely following massive public pressure from internet users who hailed her as a heroine. At her trial on 16 June, a judge said the court had found her guilty because Deng had used excessive force even though she was acting in self-defense. The lenient sentence was on account of diminished responsibility, and because she had surrendered to police and the officials involved had made a major mistake. One Beijing human rights lawyer said the court would not have freed Deng if there was not so much pressure from so much national attention. \"The Standard\" reported that mainland websites were euphoric after the trial.\n\n\n"}

In North India, the preferred self-designation is Dom.\n\nThe form \"ḍomba\" is Prakrit, while \"ḍoma\" and \"ḍumba\" are encountered in Kashmiri Sanskrit texts. Derived from \"ḍoma\" is \"ḍomaki\", the name of a language spoken in a small enclave in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is also believed that the Dom or Domi people of the Middle East, in addition to the Roma of Europe, are descendants of Domba, who were taken, or travelled, to Sassanid Persia as servants and musicians.\n\nIts presumed root, \"ḍom\", which is connected with drumming, is linked to \"damara\" and \"damaru\", Sanskrit terms for \"drum\" and the Sanskrit verbal root डम् \"ḍam-\" 'to sound (as a drum)', perhaps a loan from Dravidian, e.g. Kannada \"ḍamāra\" 'a pair of kettle-drums', and Telugu \"ṭamaṭama\" 'a drum, tomtom'.\n\nIn 1989, 500 people were counted as speaking Domaki in the Shina valley of Gilgit Baltistan region. The people are called Bericho, Dom, or Doma. They are musicians and blacksmiths. The Dom identity developed out of their work as musicians and blacksmiths. They are a heterogeneous group, descended from a number of families that took up service with the various local rulers. The Dom belong to the Nizari Ismaili sect in Hunza, and the Athna Ashri Shia sect in Nagar. After land reforms carried out by Pakistan government in the 1970s, the Dom were given ownership of land. However, the majority of the Dom are still landless, and are still employed as blacksmiths.\n\nDom in Himachal Pradesh exhibit the archetypal characteristics of an indigenous hunter gatherer tribe that has been incorporated as part of the caste system. Doms are agricultural workers, basket weavers and small scale agriculturalists. They are not known for their nomadic existence. They are also recognised by their neighbours as the original inhabitants of the forests lands.\n\nThe Dom community in Odisha speak both the Odia language. They live as neighbours with the Dravidian-speaking Khonds tribals. Doms speak Dravidian Kondhi as well as Indo-Aryan Odia language.\n\nIn Varanasi, the Hindu holy city in Uttar Pradesh, the Dom perform the most important task of cremation of dead bodies. Many are nomadic and peripatetic groups in Uttar Pradesh are said to be of Dom origin such as the Bangali, Bhantu, Bazigar, Habura, Kanjar, and Sansi. It could also be that term Dom is generically used to describe any peripatetic nomad, as all these groups mentioned are distinct and strictly endogamous. Some speak a dialect or argot of their own, while others speak the prevailing dialect or language. The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Dom as a Scheduled Caste with a population of 110,353.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11163017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11163017", "title": "Free public transport", "text": "Free public transport\n\nFree public transport, often called fare-free public transit or zero-fare public transport, refers to public transport funded in full by means other than by collecting fares from passengers. It may be funded by national, regional or local government through taxation, or by commercial sponsorship by businesses. Alternatively, the concept of \"free-ness\" may take other forms, such as no-fare access via a card which may or may not be paid for in its entirety by the user.\n\nTallinn, capital city of Estonia with more than 420,000 inhabitants, and several mid-size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their public transportation networks to zero-fare. The city of Hasselt in Belgium is a notable example: fares were abolished in 1997 and ridership was as much as \"13 times higher\" by 2006.\n\nLocal zero-fare shuttles or inner-city loops are far more common than citywide systems. They often use buses or trams. These may be set up by a city government to ease bottlenecks or fill short gaps in the transport network.\n\nZero-fare transport is often operated as part of the services offered within a public facility, such as a hospital or university campus shuttle or an airport inter-terminal shuttle.\n\nSome zero-fare services may be built to avoid the need for large transport construction. Port cities where shipping would require very high bridges might provide zero-fare ferries instead. These are free at the point of use, just as the use of a bridge might have been.\nMachinery installed within a building or shopping centre can be seen as 'zero-fare transport': elevators, escalators and moving sidewalks are often provided by property owners and funded through the sales of goods and services. Community bicycle programs, providing free bicycles for short-term public use could be thought of as zero-fare transport.\n\nA common example of zero-fare transport is student transport, where students travelling to or from school do not need to pay. A notable example is the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, which provides much of the funding to operate the Stevens Point Transit system. All students at the university can use any of the four citywide campus routes and the other four bus routes throughout the city free of charge. The university also funds two late night bus routes to serve the downtown free of charge with a goal of cutting down drunk driving.\n\nIn some regions transport is free because the revenues are lower that expenses from fare collection is already partially paid by government or company or service (for example BMO railway road in Moscow, most part of is used to as service transport and officially pick up passengers).\n\nMany large amusement parks will have trams servicing large parking lots or distant areas. Disneyland in Anaheim, California, runs a tram from its entrance, across the parking lot, and across the street to its hotel as well as the bus stop for Orange County and Los Angeles local transit buses. Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, provides tram service throughout its parking lot.\n\nIn July 2017, Dubai announced it would offer free bus services for a short period of time on selected days.\n\nTransport operators can benefit from faster boarding and shorter dwell times, allowing faster timetabling of services. Although some of these benefits can be achieved in other ways, such as off-vehicle ticket sales and modern types of electronic fare collection, zero-fare transport avoids equipment and personnel costs.\n\nPassenger aggression may be reduced. In 2008 bus drivers of Société des Transports Automobiles (STA) in Essonne held strikes demanding zero-fare transport for this reason. They claim that 90% of the aggression is related to refusal to pay the fare.\n\nSome zero-fare transport services are funded by private businesses, such as the merchants in a shopping mall, in the hope that doing so will increase sales or other revenue from increased foot traffic or ease of travel. Employers often operate free shuttles as a benefit to their employees, or as part of a congestion mitigation agreement with a local government.\n\nZero-fare transport can make the system more accessible and fair for low-income residents. Other benefits are the same as those attributed to public transport generally:\n\nGlobal benefits of zero-fare transport are also the same as those attributed to public transport generally. If use of personal cars is discouraged, zero-fare public transport could mitigate the problems of global warming and oil depletion.\n\nSeveral large U.S. municipalities have attempted zero-fare systems, but many of these implementations have been judged unsuccessful by policy makers. A 2002 National Center for Transportation Research report suggests that, while transit ridership does tend to increase, there are also some disadvantages:\n\nThis U.S. report suggests that, while ridership does increase overall, the goal of enticing drivers to take transit instead of driving is not necessarily met: because fare-free systems tend to attract a certain number of \"problem riders\", zero-fare systems may have the unintended effect of convincing some 'premium' riders to go back to driving their cars. It should be kept in mind that this was a study that only looked at U.S. cities, and the author's conclusions may be less applicable in other countries that have better social safety nets and less crime than the large U.S. cities studied.\n\nFree public transport creates the perception of a no-cost service, just as car drivers commonly perceive no cost to deciding to take their car somewhere. The catch of the car-based system is that the car trip is not in fact free, but it is generally perceived as such.\n\nLikewise, this \"perception\" of freeness is important for public transport, which is far more environmentally and resource efficient than own-car travel – which means in this case that full access to the system need not be altogether “free” for its users but that from a financial perspective it becomes front-loaded and affordable. The invariable fact of life of delivering any public service is that the money to do so must come from somewhere – and of “free” public transport that once the user has entered into some kind of “contract” with her or his city – for example a monthly or annual transit pass that opens up the public system to unlimited use for those who pay for it. Now, how they pay and how much will be part of the overall political/economic package (“contract”) of their community. In cities that offer such passes – as is the case to take but one example in most cities in France that since the mid-seventies have had their own Carte Orange – the remainder of the funds needed to pay for these services comes from other sources (mainly in this case from employers, local government).\n\nSocial-justice advocacy groups, such as the Swedish network Planka.nu, see zero-fare public transport as an effort in the redistribution of wealth. It is also argued that transportation to and from work is a necessary part of the work day, and is essential to the employer in the managing of work hours. It is thus argued that financing of public transportation should fall to employers rather than private citizens.\n\n\n"}

She moved into Mary Price's former apartment which was used as a meeting point for government employees engaged in espionage and their Soviet case handlers and couriers.\n\nTenny began supplying reports and memoranda from OSS. This information included a considerable quantity of data on activities of OSS personnel in virtually all sections and all countries around the world. Tenney also supplied information concerning a monitoring station on Long Island.\n\nBeginning in 1944, Tenney was being paid a regular stipend of $50 per month — considerable for the times — which had been arranged through Joseph Katz. In December 1944, Joseph Gregg became Tenney's handler, however Tenney complained about his technique and Gregg was replaced by Inez Munoz.\n\nTenney resigned from the OSS in June 1946 and transferred to the United States Department of State. By then the FBI had Tenney under surveillance. The State Department eased her out of her position and revoked her passport. In January 1947, Tenney had a nervous breakdown. She was confined to a psychiatric hospital for observation after a deadly combination of alcohol and phenobarbital which was regarded as a suicide attempt. Tenney remained unconscious for five days and upon regaining consciousness, was in a delirium and regarded as in a severe hallucinatory psychotic state. Her observers overheard Tenney mumbling about being followed, having her telephone tapped, having her friends under surveillance, and being a Russian spy. She then appeared to have a violent phobia against everything Russian, even the mention of the word \"Russian\", and was watched closely for another suicide attempt. Doctors, citing patient confidentiality, refused to discuss the case with FBI investigators.\n\nBy February 1946, unbeknownst to Tenney, her contact with Soviet intelligence Elizabeth Bentley, had defected and was cooperating with the counterintelligence investigation. Bentley visited with Tenney and concluded that her suicide attempt was genuine; Tenney felt alone and isolated not knowing the larger Soviet espionage operation had been compromised and that the Soviet controllers had broken off contact with their American agents. Tenney was unremorseful and appeared to wish to reestablish contact with Soviet handlers, dashing the FBI's hopes to gain her cooperation.\n\nIn June 1947, the FBI interviewed Tenney and determined she was in frail mental and physical health.\n\nIn 1998, Tenney was identified in the Venona project transcripts as code name \"Muse\", based on her transfer from the dismantled OSS to the Department of State.\n\n"}
{"id": "54746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54746", "title": "Incest taboo", "text": "Incest taboo\n\nAn incest taboo is any cultural rule or norm that prohibits sexual relations between closely related persons. All human cultures have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible sexual or marriage partners, making such relationships taboo. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. The sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called incestuous relationships.\n\nSome cultures proscribed sexual relations between clan-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother–sister marriages have been practiced by the elites with some regularity. Parent–child and sibling–sibling unions are almost universally taboo.\n\nDebate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in nature or nurture.\n\nOne explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since inbreeding may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called Westermarck effect discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.\n\nAnother school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group exogamy, which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable alliances that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over endogamy, and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.\n\nWhile it is theoretically possible that natural selection may, under certain genetic circumstances, select for individuals that instinctively avoid mating with (close) relatives, biological evolution cannot select for punishing others for incest, since even genetically weakened, inbred individuals are better watchposts against predators than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals. Punishing both parties in an incestous relation cannot even be beneficial for the genes of individuals punishing a somewhat more distant relative for mating with a closer relative, since punishing the closer relative as well is counterproductive to any function of protecting the closer relative and the health of its offspring (in a context where predation and starvation are significant factors, as opposed to a rich welfare state). Genetic sexual attraction theory is also incompatible with the theory of smell being a significant factor in avoiding inbreeding.\n\nModern anthropology developed at a time when a great many human societies were illiterate, and much of the research on incest taboos has taken place in societies without legal codes, and, therefore, without written laws concerning marriage and incest. Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society. The following excerpt from \"Notes and Queries on Anthropology\" (1951), a well-established field manual for ethnographic research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:\n\nAs this excerpt suggests, anthropologists distinguish between social norms and actual social behavior; much social theory explores the difference and relationship between the two. For example, what is the purpose of prohibitions that are routinely violated (as for example when people claim that incest is taboo yet engage in incestuous behavior)?\n\nIt should be further noted that in these theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother–sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.\n\nMoreover, the definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in Bali, mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breast-feeding.\n\nIt should also be noted that, in these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying \"incest\" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by \"incest\", and what the consequences of \"incest\" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.\n\nThis excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.\n\nFor example, Trobriand Islanders prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother, and between a woman and her father, but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not. This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not. A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.\n\nAn explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse genetic effects of inbreeding such as a higher incidence of congenital birth defects (see article Inbreeding depression). Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.<ref name=\"doi10.1038/ng1094-117\"></ref>\n\nThe increase in frequency of birth defects often attributed to inbreeding results directly from an increase in the frequency of homozygous alleles inherited by the offspring of inbred couples. This leads to an increase in homozygous allele frequency within a population, and results in diverging effects. Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population. In small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to \"decrease\" the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects. Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain immune systems genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives. Children born of close relatives have decreased survival. Many mammal species, including humanity's closest primate relatives, avoid incest.\n\nThe Westermarck effect, first proposed by Edvard Westermarck in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic. Melford Spiro argued that his observations that unrelated children reared together on Israeli Kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another as sexual partners confirmed the Westermarck effect. Joseph Shepher in a study examined the second generation in a kibbutz and found no marriages and no sexual activity between the adolescents in the same peer group. This was not enforced but voluntary. Looking at the second generation adults in all kibbutzim, out of a total of 2769 marriages, none were between those of the same peer group. However, according to a book review by John Hartung of a book by Shepher, out of 2516 marriages documented in Israel, 200 were between couples reared in the same kibbutz. These marriages occurred after young adults reared on kibbutzim had served in the military and encountered tens of thousands of other potential mates, and 200 marriages is higher than what would be expected by chance. Of these 200 marriages, five were between men and women who had been reared together for the first six years of their lives, which would argue against the Westermarck effect. A study in Taiwan of marriages where the future bride is adopted in the groom's family as an infant or small child found that these marriages have higher infidelity and divorce and lower fertility than ordinary marriages; it has been argued that this observation is consistent with the Westermarck effect.\n\nAnother approach is looking at moral objections to third-party incest. This increases the longer a child has grown up together with another child of the opposite sex. This occurs even if the other child is genetically unrelated. Humans have been argued to have a special kin detection system that besides the incest taboo also regulates a tendency towards altruism towards kin.\n\nOne objection against an instinctive and genetic basis for the incest taboo is that incest does occur. Anthropologists have also argued that the social construct \"incest\" (and the incest taboo) is not the same thing as the biological phenomenon of \"inbreeding\". For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness. Other studies on cousin marriages have found support for a biological basis for the taboo. Also, current supporters of genetic influences on behavior do not argue that genes determine behavior absolutely, but that genes may create predispositions that are affected in various ways by the environment (including culture).\n\nPsychoanalytic theory—in particular, the claimed existence of an Oedipus complex, which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire—has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.\n\nThe anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against endogamy, and the effect is to encourage exogamy. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, Lévi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on Marcel Mauss's theory of \"The Gift\", which (in Lévi-Strauss' words) argued:\n\nIt is also based on Lévi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. Lévi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by Margaret Mead during her research among the Arapesh. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: \"No we don't sleep with our sisters. We give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters.\" Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. Lévi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:\n\nBy applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, Lévi-Strauss proposed what he called alliance theory. He argued that, in \"primitive\" societies, marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship—an alliance—between two men. His \"Elementary Structures of Kinship\" takes this as a starting point and uses it to analyze kinship systems of increasing complexity found in so-called primitive societies (that is, those not based on agriculture, class inequalities, and centralized government).\n\nThis theory was debated intensely by anthropologists in the 1950s. It appealed to many because it used the study of incest taboos and marriage to answer more fundamental research interests of anthropologists at the time: how can an anthropologist map out the social relationships within a given community, and how do these relationships promote or endanger social solidarity? Nevertheless, anthropologists never reached a consensus, and with the Vietnam War and the process of decolonization in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, anthropological interests shifted away from mapping local social relationships.\n\nSome anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.\n\nWhile Lévi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing Lévi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.\n\nExogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in classless societies. Societies that are stratified—that is, divided into unequal classes—often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. A classic example is India's caste system, in which unequal castes are endogamous. Inequality between ethnic groups and races also correlates with endogamy. Class, caste, ethnic, and racial endogamy typically coexists with family exogamy and prohibitions against incest.\n\nAn extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother–sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family. Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners, but others have argued that this was in fact not the norm.\n\n\n"}

In the 21st century, the four largest populations of diaspora Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants in the Western Hemisphere live in Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Peru.\n\nBrazil is home to the largest ethnic Japanese population outside Japan, numbering an estimated more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity). more than that of the 1.2 million in the United States. The \"Issei\" Japanese Brazilians are an important part of that ethnic minority in that South American nation.\n\nThe first members of the \"Issei\" did not emigrate directly to the mainland United States, but to Hawaii (when it was American-controlled but not yet one of the United States). These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the steamship \"City of Tokio\" in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its sugar plantations. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.\n\nEmigration of Japanese directly to the United States began in 1885, when \"student-laborers\" landed on the West Coast of the United States. The earliest of these emigrated to San Francisco. Their numbers continually increased in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Their purpose in moving to America was to gain advanced knowledge and experience in order to develop the modern society at home. Both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the United States as a country that welcomed foreigners. When they first arrived in the U.S., they had not intended to live there permanently, but rather to learn from Americans and to take that knowledge back home. While they encountered discrimination, they also made opportunities, and many settled in California, and later in Washington and Oregon as well. \n\nWithin Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different socio-cultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences. The narrative of \"Issei\" Japanese-Canadians include post-Pearl Harbor experiences of uprooting, incarceration, and dispersal of the pre-war Japanese-Canadian communities.\n\nAmong the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the \"Issei\" Japanese Peruvians comprise a small number. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was the \"Nisei\" son of \"Issei\" immigrants from Kumamoto, Japan. Fujimori's political opponents tried unsuccessfully to prove that he was born in Japan. Persons must be native-born Peruvian citizens to qualify for the presidency.\n\nJapanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (\"sei\" 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like \"Issei\", \"Nisei,\" and \"Sansei\" which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called \"Yonsei\" (四世) and the fifth is called \"Gosei\" (五世). \n\nThe \"Issei,\" \"Nisei\" and \"Sansei\" generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, involvement with non-Japanese, religious belief and practice, and other matters. The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment during World War II has been found to be the most significant factor that explains such variations in attitudes and behaviour patterns.\n\nThe term \"Nikkei\" (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists. It encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations. The collective memory of the \"Issei\" and older \"Nisei\" was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911. Newer immigrants carry much different memories of more recent Japan. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other. The significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.\n\nIn North America, since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred. The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.\n\nThere are just over one hundred thousand British Japanese, mostly in London. Unlike other \"Nikkei\" communities in the world, these Britons do not identify themselves in such generational terms as \"Issei,\" \"Nisei,\" or \"Sansei.\"\n\nThe first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before moving to Canada or the United States, is called \"Issei\" (一世). In the 1930s, the term \"Issei\" came into common use, replacing the term \"immigrant\" (\"ijusha\"). This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves. The term \"Issei\" represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.\n\n\"Issei\" settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English. They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of World War II, and they were not able to rebuild their lost businesses and savings. The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of \"Issei\" being predominantly friends with other \"Issei.\"\n\nUnlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.\n\n\"Issei\" women's lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness. The \"Issei\" women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late \"Meiji\" Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. Substantive evidence of the working lives of \"Issei\" women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.\n\nWithin the framework of environmental contradictions, the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability, a perception that the events of life are beyond the control of the individual, which accounts for the consistency in the way in which Issei women, different and individual in many ways, seem to have structured their emotions—and this quality of emotional control was passed to their \"Nisei\" children.\n\nThe \"kanreki\" (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the \"Issei\" and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of \"Nisei.\" Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.\n\nJapanese American photographer and former social worker Mary Koga documented members of her parents' generation in their twilight years. Her \"Portrait of the Issei in Illinois\" series shows Koga at ease with these people in a relaxed atmosphere.\nDone over a long period from the 1970s to the 1990s, the images show her elderly subjects at the day care facility and the Senior Citizens Work Center of the Japanese American Service Committee (JASC) and at Heiwa Terrace, a Japanese American senior residence, both located in Chicago.\n\nThe experience of emigrants is inevitably affected by a range of factors directly related to the Japanese society they left behind. As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.\n\nJapan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the Tokugawa family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society. The only exceptions were Chinese and some Dutch, but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese citizens. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by Commodore Perry caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the Meiji era in order to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.\n\nAfter 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. in order to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.\n\nAfter 1884, emigration of working classes was permitted; and the first issei began to arrive in North and South America soon after. For example, in 1890, only 25 Issei lived in Oregon. By 1891, 1,000 Japanese lived in Oregon. In 1900, 2,051 Japanese had come to live in Oregon. By 1915, Japanese men with savings of $800 were considered eligible to summon wives from Japan.\n\nFew Japanese workers came to North America intending to become immigrants. Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan. This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many \"Issei\" arrived as laborers. They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.\n\nThe Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice. Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan. If they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens, many would have become citizens of the United States.\n\nIn 1913, California's Alien Land Law prohibited non-citizens from owning land in the state, and several other states soon after passed their own restrictive alien land laws. This included the \"Issei\", Japanese residents born in Japan, but not their children, the Nisei, who were born in United States or Hawaii, and who therefore were American citizens by birth. Many of the Issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their \"Nisei\" children.\n\nAmericans generally viewed the \"Issei\" as a crude, ill-educated lot. Possible reasons for this may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Many Issei were in fact better educated than either the Japanese or American public. Sixty percent had completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates. \n\nWhether Christian, Buddhists, or nonbelievers, the \"Issei\" almost never caused trouble in the civil authority. The arrest rate for the \"Issei\" from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in California. The only exceptions were that some young \"Issei\" committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution, which stemmed from different cultural morals in Japan.\n\nThe post-1900 cause to renew the Chinese Exclusion Act became generalized protests against all Asian immigrants, including the Issei. Since many Chinese immigrants left the U.S., hostility fell on the \"Issei.\" American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading Anti-Japanese sentiment. White Americans wanted to exclude them since they did not want any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the Asiatic Exclusion League that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat of American workers. The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and Korean pupils to join the Chinese students at a segregated school. The \"Issei\" were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former President, Theodore Roosevelt, and as a result, they signed the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.\n\nBy 1911, almost half of the Japanese immigrants were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman's agreement, a number of \"Nisei\", the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The \"Issei\" were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want to admit the virtues of the \"Issei.\"\n\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 represented the Issei's failed struggle against the segregation. The experiences of the Issei extend from well before the period before July 1, 1924, when the Japanese Exclusion Act came into effect.\n\nThe \"Issei,\" however, were very good at enhancing rice farming on \"unusable\" land. Japanese Californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state. The largest \"Issei\" community settled around Vacaville, California, near San Francisco.\n\nWhen the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese in 1942, neither distinguished between those who were citizens (\"Nisei\") and their non-citizen parents (\"Issei\"). When the apology and redress for injustices were enacted by the American Congress and the Canadian Parliament in 1988, most of the \"Issei\" were dead, or too old for it to make any significant difference in lives that had been disrupted.\n\nThe number of \"issei\" who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the \"nikkei.\" Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by \"issei\" from North America, the Latin American member countries of the Pan American Nikkei Association (PANA) include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, in addition to the English-speaking United States and Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

Celebrated on 27 April (26 April if the 27th is a Sunday), the date marks the birth of King Willem-Alexander. Until the abdication of Queen Beatrix in 2013, the holiday was known as Koninginnedag () or Queen's Day and was celebrated on 30 April.\n\nThe holiday was initially observed on 31 August 1885 as \"Prinsessedag\" or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday of Princess Wilhelmina, then heir presumptive to the Dutch throne. On her accession in November 1890 the holiday acquired the name \"Koninginnedag\", first celebrated on 31 August 1891. In September 1948, Wilhelmina's daughter Juliana ascended to the throne and the holiday was moved to her birthday, 30 April. The holiday was celebrated on this date from 1949.\n\nJuliana's daughter, Beatrix, retained the celebration on 30 April after she ascended the throne in 1980, though her birthday was on 31 January. Beatrix altered her mother's custom of receiving a floral parade at Soestdijk Palace, instead choosing to visit different Dutch towns each year and join in the festivities with her children. In 2009, the Queen was celebrating Queen's Day in the city of Apeldoorn when a man attempted to attack her by trying to ram the Royal family's bus with his car; instead he drove into a crowd of people and crashed into a monument: seven people in the crowd were killed, as was the driver. Queen Beatrix abdicated on \"Koninginnedag\" 2013, and her son, Willem-Alexander, ascended the throne (the first king since the observance of the national holiday). As a result, the holiday became known as \"Koningsdag\" from 2014 on, and the celebration was shifted three days back to 27 April, the King's birthday.\n\n\"Koningsdag\" is known for its nationwide \"vrijmarkt\" (\"free market\"), at which the Dutch sell their used items. It is also an opportunity for \"orange madness\" or \"oranjegekte\", a kind of frenzy named for the national colour.\n\nFaced with an unpopular monarchy, in the 1880s the liberals in Dutch government sought a means of promoting national unity. King William III was disliked, but his four-year-old daughter Princess Wilhelmina was not. A holiday honouring King William had been intermittently held on his birthday, and J. W. R. Gerlach, editor of the newspaper \"Utrechts Provinciaal en Stedelijk Dagblad\", proposed that the princess's birthday be observed as an opportunity for patriotic celebration and national reconciliation. \"Prinsessedag\" or Princess's Day was first celebrated in the Netherlands on 31 August 1885, Wilhelmina's fifth birthday. The young princess was paraded through the streets, waving to the crowds. The first observance occurred only in Utrecht, but other municipalities quickly began to observe it, organizing activities for children. Further processions were held in the following years, and when Wilhelmina inherited the throne in 1890, \"Prinsessedag\" was renamed \"Koninginnedag\", or Queen's Day. By then almost every Dutch town and city was marking the holiday.\n\nThe celebration proved popular, and when the Queen came of age in 1898, her inauguration was postponed a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with \"Koninginnedag\". The annual holiday fell on the final day of school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about \"Koninginnedag\", suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, \"Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how much you like being a Queen!\"\n\n\"Koninginnedag\" 1902 not only honoured the Queen's birthday, but was celebrated with increased enthusiasm as it marked her recovery from serious illness. Wilhelmina rarely attended \"Koninginnedag\" festivities after reaching adulthood. She attended ceremonies for her silver jubilee in 1923, which included massive festivities in Amsterdam and The Hague, despite the Queen's request that large sums not be spent because economic conditions at the time were difficult. To ensure that even the poorer parts of the city were included, bands played simultaneously at 28 locations across The Hague. Wilhelmina made further exceptions for such events as her fiftieth birthday in 1930. During the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, \"Koninginnedag\" celebrations were banned, and members of the Orange Committees, which organize the holiday events, destroyed their records for fear of German reprisals.\n\nAnother summertime birthday celebration in the Netherlands was that of Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards \"Koninginnedag\" was on her birthday. The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained an extra day of holiday. The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on \"Koninginnedag\" at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. The parade became televised in the 1950s, and \"Koninginnedag\" increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off. Juliana had a reputation as a \"queen of the people\", and according to Peek, \"it felt as if she invited her subjects to the royal home\".\n\nIn early 1966 Juliana's eldest daughter, Princess Beatrix, married Klaus-Georg von Amsberg. The marriage was controversial because the new Prince Claus (as he was dubbed) was a German, and Claus himself had served in the German Army during the war. Anti-German riots in Amsterdam marred the wedding day and the following observances of \"Koninginnedag\". Fearing further demonstrations on the holiday, government officials decided to open Amsterdam city centre to the \"vrijmarkt\" (\"free market\") that had long been held on \"Koninginnedag\" in the outskirts of town, principally for children. The \"vrijmarkt\" occupied the space where demonstrations might have been held, and began a new custom.\n\nWhen Queen Beatrix succeeded her mother Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen decided to keep the holiday on 30 April as a tribute to her mother. (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, \"Koninginnedag\" was observed the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.) The reason was practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for \"Koninginnedag\" celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in.\n\n\"Koninginnedag\" celebrations have sometimes been affected or disrupted. In 1988 three British servicemen stationed in Germany who were in the Netherlands for \"Koninginnedag\" were killed in Irish Republican Army attacks. In 1996 the celebrations in Rotterdam were dampened by an alcohol ban, put in place following riots earlier in the week after local football club Feyenoord won the Dutch league championship. The Queen's scheduled 2001 visits to Hoogeveen and Meppel were postponed for one year owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.\n\nOn 30 April 2009, Beatrix and other members of the royal family were at the town of Apeldoorn when a 38-year-old man, Karst Tates, drove his Suzuki Swift automobile into the crowd, narrowly missing the open-top bus the royal family members were riding on. Seven people were killed and further celebrations were cancelled. Tates died of injuries sustained in the attack soon afterwards and his exact motives remain unclear, though it appears his target was the royal family. The incident provoked questions about whether the royal family should continue to participate in the celebrations. However, Beatrix indicated that the tragedy would not stop her from meeting her people. In 2010, Beatrix and her family visited Wemeldinge and Middelburg, in Zeeland province. There were no incidents, and afterwards, the Queen thanked Zeeland for giving \"Koninginnedag\" back to her family, and to her country.\nQueen Beatrix visited the following towns and cities over the years on \"Koninginnedag\":\nOn 28 January 2013 Queen Beatrix announced her abdication on 30 April 2013 in favour of her son, Willem-Alexander. Since this date coincided with \"Koninginnedag\" the royal family's planned visit to De Rijp and Amstelveen was cancelled, although \"Koninginnedag\" 2013 was still celebrated throughout the country.\n\nOn 30 April 2013, Queen's Day, Willem-Alexander succeeded his mother Beatrix and became the first King of the Netherlands in 123 years. Consequently, from 2014 onwards the name has been changed from Queen's Day to King's Day. The date has also changed from 30 to 27 April, which is the birthday of Willem-Alexander. On the first King's Day – held on 26 April 2014 because 27 April 2014 was a Sunday – the king visited De Rijp and Amstelveen (originally planned to be visited by Queen Beatrix in 2013, but postponed due to her abdication).\n\nKing Willem-Alexander visited the following towns and cities over the years on \"Koningsdag\":\nThe festivities on \"Koningsdag\" are often organised by Orange Committees (Dutch: \"Oranjecomité\"), local associations that seek sponsorship and donations for their activities. In recent years some committees have had difficulty in recruiting new members from among the younger Dutch.\n\nThe \"vrijmarkt\" (literally 'free market') is a nationwide flea market, at which many people sell their used goods. \"Koningsdag\" is the one day of the year that the Dutch government permits sales on the street without a permit and without the payment of value added tax. ING Bank found in 2011 that one in five Dutch residents planned to sell at the \"vrijmarkt\" and estimated they would earn €100 per person for a total turnover of €290 million. Over half of the Dutch people buy at the \"vrijmarkt\"; ING Bank predicted they would spend €28 each at the 2011 \"vrijmarkt\". Queen Beatrix has been known to buy at the \"vrijmarkt\"; in 1995 she purchased a floor lamp. The bank also forecast that the lowest level of sales at the \"vrijmarkt\" in 2011 would be in the province of Limburg, site of Queen Beatrix's visit.\n\nAmong the most popular areas for the \"vrijmarkt\" in Amsterdam is the Jordaan quarter, but the wide Apollolaan in front of the Hilton hotel in southern Amsterdam is gaining in popularity. Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the Vondelpark, also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than they are asking for the goods. Until 1996 the \"vrijmarkt\" began the evening before and continued for 24 hours. This was ended in the hope of gaining a pause in the celebrations so preparations could be made for the daytime activities. Utrecht, uniquely among Dutch municipalities, retains the overnight \"vrijmarkt\".\n\n\"Koningsdag\" now sees large-scale celebrations, with many concerts and special events in public spaces, particularly in Amsterdam. An outdoor concert is held on Amsterdam's Museumplein, where as many as 800,000 people may gather. To aid visitors in returning home by train after the festivities outdoor events must end by 20:00, and the Museumplein show by 21:00. The city centre is closed to cars, and no trams ride in the heart of the city; people are urged to avoid Amsterdam Centraal railway station and use other stations if possible from their direction. International trains that normally begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop.\n\nIn recent years parties and concerts have been held the evening before \"Koningsdag\". Until 2013, nightclubs across the Netherlands organised special events for what became known as \"Koninginnenacht\" (Queen's Night). Many young people celebrate in the streets and squares (and in Amsterdam, the canals as well) throughout the night, and after all-night partying join the crowds at the \"vrijmarkt\".\nWhile King's Day celebrations take place throughout the Netherlands, Amsterdam is a popular destination for many revellers. Often the city's 750.000 residents are joined by up to 1 million visitors. In recent years Amsterdam authorities have taken some measures to try to stem the flow of visitors as the city became too crowded.\n\nThose taking part in \"Koningsdag\" commonly dye their hair orange or wear orange clothing in honour of the House of Orange-Nassau, which rules over the Netherlands. Orange-coloured drinks are also popular. This colour choice is sometimes dubbed \"orange madness\", or in Dutch, \"oranjegekte\". A local Orange Committee member said of \"Koninginnedag\" in 2011:\n\nFriendships—and community—will be formed. For me that’s really what Queen’s Day is all about. It’s not an outburst of patriotism, it’s not even about the popularity of the royal family. It’s about a sense of belonging. For one day, everybody is the same in Holland. Bright orange and barmy.\n\nChildren celebrate with a variety of games including \"koekhappen\" (in which they catch spice cake dangling from a string in their mouths) and \"spijker poepen\" (in which they tie string around their waist a nail dangling at one end, which they attempt to lower into a glass bottle).\n\n\"Koningsdag\" is an opportunity for the monarch to honour citizens for their service to the Netherlands. In 2011, Queen Beatrix issued an honours list noting the work of 3,357 people, most of whom became members of the Order of Orange-Nassau.\n\n\"Koningsdag\" is also celebrated in Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is less widely celebrated on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, also a part of the Kingdom, where the local celebration of Dia di Rincon (held on 30 April) is more popular.\n\n"}

{"id": "10974828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10974828", "title": "Murui Huitoto language", "text": "Murui Huitoto language\n\nMurui Huitoto - (or simply Murui also known as Bue, Witoto Murui or Witoto) is an indigenous American Huitoto language of the Witotoan family. Murui is spoken by about 1,100 Murui people along the banks of the Putumayo, Cara-Paraná and Igara-Paraná rivers in Colombia. In Peru it spoken in the North alongside the Ampiyacu and Napo rivers by some 1,000 people. Some Murui speakers live also outside their territories, for instance the vicinity of Leticia, Amazonas, Colombia.\n\nApproximately 1,000 Peruvians use Murui in both its written and oral forms. The language is accorded official status and is used in schools. It is also used in churches. There are no Murui-an monolinguals in Peru: speakers of the language who do not also use another language. The language has 1,900 speakers in southwestern Colombia where it has higher social utility and standing. It was formerly spoken in Brazil, but is now extinct in that country.\n\nMurui uses the Roman Script. There is a dictionary of the Murui language (Murui-Spanish and Spanish-Murui) compiled by an SIL linguist, Shirley Burtch (1983), and number of works concerning its grammar (Petersen de Piñeros 1994, Petersen de Piñeros & Patiño: 2000, Wojtylak 2012).\n\nCurrently, a PhD student at James Cook University, Katarzyna Wojtylak is working on a comprehensive grammar of Murui to be published in 2017.\n\nMurui has a relatively small inventory of 16 contrastive consonantal phonemes some of which have restricted phonotactics. Murui consonant inventory is similar to two other dialects of Witoto, Mɨka and Mɨnɨka.The vowel inventory of the language is based on a six vowel system that consist of, among other sounds, the high central vowel ɨ. This trait is typical for languages from Northwest Amazonia, such as Tucanoan and Carib languages (Aikhenvald, 2012).\n\nThe orthographic representation is to the left; the IPA to the right (note that before i and e, c is written qu). \n\nMurui is highly synthetic, predominantly suffixing and nominative-accusative. The language is predominantly verb-final; the organization of the constituents in the clause is usually SV/AOV. Grammatical relations are expressed through pronouns cross-referencing on the verb (with one cross-referencing position: the subject S/A). Syntactic functions can be expressed through case markers. Marking of core arguments (S, A, O = non S/A focus) is generally optional and is related to focus; marking of peripheral arguments on an NP (i.e. locative, ablative, commitative-instrumental, benefactive, privative) is usually mandatory. \n\nMurui has three open lexical classes (nouns, verbs and derived adjectives (that can also be referred to as 'descriptive verbs'). Closed classes of words are underived adjectives and quantifiers, adverbs, pronouns, demonstratives, anaphoric forms, interrogative words, low (1 and 2) and lexicalized (3 < 20) number words, connectives, adpositions, interjections and onomatopoeic forms.\n\nThe majority of the word classes can occupy the predicate slot but there are restrictions as to what kind of sets of suffixes can be attached to non-verbs. Quantifiers, connectives, adpositions, interjections and onomatopoeic forms cannot function predicatively.\n\nOne of the most salient characteristics of the nominal morphology of Murui is a large multiple classifier system that consists of at least 80 classifiers. The same (or almost the same) classifier form can be used in a variety of morphosyntactic contexts (hence the label 'multiple classifier system'). The system is semi-open due to the occurrence of repeaters (partially repeated nouns that occur in classifier slots). All types of classifiers are bound suffixes that can be either mono- or disyllabic.\n\nThroughout the years, the existing phonological analyses of the language have come to reflect different spelling variations with various graphemes used to describe the Witoto sounds. The first to analyze and describe the sound system of Witoto Mɨnɨka was Minor Eugene (Minor 1956). This description was fundamental to the development of the language orthography. Nowadays, there is a tendency to use graphemes introduced by Petersen de Piñeros (1994). Wojtylak (2012, 2014) uses slightly modified spellings.\n\nAikhenvald, A. Y. (2012).

{"id": "14757847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14757847", "title": "Polygamy in North America", "text": "Polygamy in North America\n\nPolygamy is the practice of taking more than one spouse. Polygyny is the specific practice of one man taking more than one wife: it is a common marriage pattern in some parts of the world. In North America polygamy has not been a culturally normative or legally recognized institution since the continent's colonization by Europeans.\n\nPolygamy became a significant social and political issue in the United States in 1852, when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) made it known that a form of the practice, called plural marriage, was part of its doctrine. Opposition to the practice by the United States government resulted in an intense legal conflict, and culminated in LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff announcing the church's official abandonment of the practice on September 25, 1890. However, breakaway Mormon fundamentalist groups living mostly in the western United States, Canada, and Mexico still practice plural marriage.\n\nSome other Americans practice polygamy including Muslims communities.\n\nPolygamy is defined as the practice or condition of having more than one spouse at the same time, conventionally referring to a situation where all spouses know about each other, in contrast to bigamy, where two or more spouses are usually unaware of each other.\n\nPolygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse. As this is the very definition of bigamy, it is illegal in the United States. The crime is punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense. Polygamy was outlawed federally by the Edmunds Act, and there are laws against the practice in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level, but the practice is considered \"against public policy\" and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated. Any immigrant who is coming to the United States to practice polygamy is inadmissible.\n\nMany US courts (e.g. Turner v. S., 212 Miss. 590, 55 So.2d 228) treat bigamy as a strict liability crime: in some jurisdictions, a person can be convicted of a felony even if he reasonably believed he had only one legal spouse. For example, if a person has the mistaken belief that their previous spouse is dead or that their divorce is final, they can still be convicted of bigamy if they marry a new person.\n\nIn Canada the federal Criminal Code applies throughout the country. It extends the normal definition of polygamy to having any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time. Also anyone who assists, celebrates, or is a part to a rite, ceremony, or contract that sanctions a polygamist relationship is guilty of polygamy. Polygamy is an offence punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nScots-Irish settlers, and some Welsh emigrants, carried long-standing multiple partner traditions to the Americas from Europe. Utopian and communal groups established during the mid-19th century had varying marriage systems, including group marriage and polygyny. There is also some evidence in the American South for multiple marriage partners, particularly after the Civil War.\n\nPolygamy has also been practiced, discreetly, by some Muslims living in America. However, these polygamous marriages are not recognized by American law.\n\nBecause polygamy has been illegal throughout the United States since the mid-19th century, and in many individual states before that, sources on alternative marriage practices are limited. Consequently, it is difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the practice in the past and at the present time.\n\nMormon practice of plural marriage was officially introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, on July 12, 1843. As polygamy was illegal in the state of Illinois, it was practiced secretly during Smith's lifetime. During the 1839–44 Nauvoo era, several Mormon leaders (including Smith, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball) took plural wives, any Mormon leaders that publicly taught polygamous doctrine were disciplined. For example, Hyram Brown was excommunicated on February 1, 1844. In May 1844 Smith declared, \"What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one.\"\n\nAfter the death of Joseph Smith, the practice of polygamy continued with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), then led by Brigham Young. In the territory that became Utah, and some surrounding areas, plural marriage was openly practiced by LDS Church adherents. In 1852, Young felt the LDS Church in Utah was secure enough to publicly announce their practice of polygamy. However opposition from the U.S. government threatened the legal standing of the LDS Church. President Wilford Woodruff announced the LDS Church's official abandonment of the practice on September 25, 1890. Woodruff's declaration was formally accepted in an LDS Church general conference on October 6, 1890. The LDS Church's position on the practice of polygamy was reinforced by another formal statement in 1904 called the Second Manifesto, which again renounced polygamy.\n\nAlthough the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent LDS Church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages well into the 20th century. A small percentage of adherents rejected the change, identifying as Mormon fundamentalists and leaving the mainstream LDS Church to continue practicing plural marriage.\n\nSome sects that practice or at least sanction polygamy are the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), the Latter-day Church of Christ and the Apostolic United Brethren. Polygamy among these groups persists today in Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Canada, and some neighboring states, as well as up to 15,000 isolated individuals with no organized church affiliation. Polygamist churches of Latter Day Saint origin are often referred to as \"Mormon fundamentalist\"; however, the main LDS Church has rejected polygamy since the early 20th century. Mormon fundamentalists often use an ambiguous September 27, 1886 revelation to John Taylor as the basis for continuing the practice of plural marriage.\n\nThe \"Salt Lake Tribune\" estimates there may be as many as 37,000 Mormon fundamentalists, with less than half living in polygamous households. Most polygamous groups are composed of about a dozen extended Mormon fundamentalist organizations. The LDS Church asserts it is improper to call any of these splinter polygamous groups \"Mormon.\"\n\nMembers of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) practice polygamy in [[arranged marriages]] that often, but not always, place young girls with older men. Most FLDS members live in [[Hildale, Utah]] and [[Colorado City, Arizona]], about 350 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, with other communities in Canada, Texas and other areas of the North American west. The FLDS leader is currently [[Warren Jeffs]].\n\nIn 1998, about 40,000 people living in Utah were part of a polygamist family, or about 1.4 percent of the population. Polygamists have been difficult to prosecute because many only seek [[marriage licenses]] for their first marriage, while the other marriages are secretly conducted in private ceremonies. Thereafter, secondary wives attempt to be seen in public as single women with children.\n\nSome polygamous families use a system of multiple divorce and legal marriage as a [[loophole]] in order to avoid committing a criminal act. In such cases the husband marries the first wife, she takes his last name, he divorces her and then marries the next wife, who takes his name. This is repeated until he has married and divorced all his wives, except possibly the last one. This way the wives feel justified in calling themselves Mrs [husband's last name] and, while legally they are divorced from the husband, they still act as if married to him and expect those around them to acknowledge and respect this.\n\nSince only one wife is officially married to the husband at any one time, no law is being broken and so this type of polygamous family unit can be overt about their relationship. The conviction of [[Thomas Arthur Green]] in 2001 may have made the legal status of such relationships more precarious in Utah, although Green's bigamy convictions were made possible only by his own public statements.\n\nMormon fundamentalist sects tend to aggregate in individual communities of their own specific sect and basis for polygamy. These small groups range from a few hundred up to 10,000, and are located across Western North America, including:\n\nThe practice of informal polygamy among fundamentalist groups presents interesting legal issues. It has been considered difficult to prosecute polygamists for [[bigamy]], in large part because they are rarely formally married under state laws. Without evidence that suspected offenders have multiple formal or [[common-law marriage]]s, these groups are merely subject to the laws against [[adultery]] or unlawful [[cohabitation]] — laws which are not commonly enforced because they also criminalize other behavior that is otherwise socially sanctioned. However, some \"Fundamentalist\" polygamists marry women prior to the [[age of consent]], or commit fraud to obtain [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and other public assistance.\n\nIn 1953, the state of [[Short Creek raid|Arizona investigated and raided]] a group of 385 people in the polygamist-practicing colony of Hildale and Colorado City, straddling the Utah-Arizona border. All the men were arrested and the children were placed with foster families. A judge eventually ruled this action illegal, and everyone returned to the community, which now contains about 10,000 people.\n\nIn 2001, in the state of [[Utah]] in the [[United States]], Juab County Attorney [[David O. Leavitt]] successfully prosecuted [[Thomas Arthur Green|Thomas Green]], who was convicted of [[Child support in the United States|criminal non-support]] and four counts of bigamy for having five serially monogamous marriages, while living with previous legally divorced wives. His cohabitation was considered evidence of a common-law marriage to the wives he had divorced while still living with them. That premise was subsequently affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in State v. Green, as applicable only in the \"State of Utah. Green\" was also convicted of [[child rape]] and criminal non-support.\n\nIn 2005, the state attorneys-general of [[Utah]] and [[Arizona]] issued a primer on helping victims of domestic violence and child abuse in polygamous communities. It was subsequently updated four times, the latest in 2011. Enforcement of crimes such as [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]], and [[fraud]] were emphasized over the enforcement of anti-polygamy and bigamy laws. The priorities of local prosecutors are not covered by this statement.\n\nIn 2008, starting on April 4, Texas State officials took 436 women and children into temporary legal custody after Rozita Swinton, a 33-year-old woman living in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called both Texas Social Services and a local shelter claiming to be a 16-year-old girl. She made a series of phone calls to authorities in late March, claiming she had been beaten and forced to become a \"spiritual\" wife to an adult man. Acting on her calls, authorities raided the ranch in Eldorado, about 40 miles south of San Angelo. The [[YFZ Ranch]] is owned by the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (FLDS), a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy. Two men were arrested for obstructing the raid but were later released. Several men were found guilty and convicted of sexual assault, rape, and bigamy involving underage girls.\n\nThe stars of the TLC show \"[[Sister Wives]]\" challenged the state of Utah's bigamy laws, though also acknowledging that the state's constitutional ban of plural marriage licenses would remain regardless of the lawsuit's outcome. On December 13, 2013, [[United States federal judge|US Federal Judge]] [[Clark Waddoups]] ruled in \"[[Brown v. Buhman]]\" that the portions of Utah's anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple [[cohabitation]] were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been a major tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 [[Edmunds Act]]. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] reversed sister wives decision in April 11, 2016 On January 23, 2017, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to hear arguments from the husband and four wives who star in the television show \"Sister Wives,\" letting stand a lower court ruling that kept polygamy a crime in Utah.\n\nIn Canada, polygamy is a criminal offence under section 293 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], which provides for a penalty of up to five years imprisonment, but prosecutions are rare. As of January 2009, no person had been prosecuted for polygamy in Canada in over sixty years. This changed in 2014, when polygamy charges were brought against [[Winston Blackmore]] and [[James Oler]].\n\nEdith Barlow, a mother of five in the polygamous community of [[Bountiful, British Columbia|Bountiful]], B.C., was denied permanent residence and was asked to leave the country after ten years in Canada.\n\nA 2005 report by the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre recommended that Canada decriminalize polygamy, stating: \"Criminalization is not the most effective way of dealing with gender inequality in polygamous and plural union relationships. Furthermore, it may violate the constitutional rights of the parties involved.\"\n\nIn 2007, the Attorney General of [[British Columbia]] expressed concerns over whether this prohibition is constitutional, and an independent prosecutor in British Columbia recommended that Canadian courts be asked to rule on the constitutionality of laws against polygamy. The [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] upheld Canada's anti-polygamy section 293 of the Criminal Code and other ancillary legislation in a 2011 [[reference question|reference case]]. On March 9, 2018, the Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld the constitutionality of Canada's anti-polygamy laws again.\n\nIn the United States, 19% of people believe that polygamy is morally acceptable, according to a 2018 Gallup poll.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in Canada]]\n[[Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in the United States]]\n[[Category:Mormonism and polygamy]]\n[[Category:North American culture]]\n[[Category:Polygamy|North America]]"}

After the British left Balochistan on 13 August 1947. It's alleged that the Khan was forced to join Pakistan. \n\nOn the night of May 16, 1948 Prince Abdul Karim Khan, in defiance of his brother, decided to lead a separatist movement against the Pakistan government, so as to preserve his life of privilege as the Khan's governor in Makran.\n\nThe Prince invited the leading members of Baloch nationalist political parties—the Kalat State National Party, the Baloch League, and the Baloch National Workers Party — to join him in the struggle for the creation of an independent \"Greater Balochistan\". Apart from his political motives, the Prince was a member of the royal family and the former governor of the Makran province; he was upset by Pakistan's recognition of Sardar Bay Khan Gichki as Makran's ruler.\n\nPrince Karim decided to migrate to Afghanistan in order to get help and to organise his movement. He wrote to the Khan on June 28, 1948 explaining the causes of his migration.\n\nSome of the prominent political leaders who joined him were Mohammed Hussein Anka (the secretary of the Baloch League and the editor of Weekly Bolan Mastung), Malik Saeed Dehwar (the secretary of the Kalat State National Party), Qadir Bakhsh Nizamami (a member of the Baloch League), Maulwi Mohd Afzal (a member of Jamiat-Ulm-e-Balochistan), and prominent members of the Sind-Balochistan branch of the Communist Party.\n\nThe Baloch Mujahedeen (Baloch Holy Warriors), as they called themselves, entered Afghanistan and encamped at \"Sarlath\" in the province of Kandahar. During their stay, the Baloch freedom fighters adopted the following measures to achieve their goal:\n\n\nMessages were sent to Mir Ghulam Faruq of the Rudini tribe, Sardar Mehrab Khan, Sardar Mir Jumma and Mir Wazir Khan Sanjrani of Chagai, and several other chiefs. The propaganda campaign was to be carried out on two fronts:\n\n(A) The national cultural front\n\n(B) The religious front\n\nThe Prince issued an appeal to individuals to help with the recruitment. A person recruiting 100 men was offered the rank of major, and a person recruiting 50 men was entitled to the rank of captain. The Baloch liberation army had a secret agency called Jannisar (devotee), whose duty was to provide information, destroy the communication system, and watch the activities of traitors. There was also a secret unit called Janbaz (darer), whose job was to kill all traitors. The Janbaz were subordinate to the Jannisar. The headquarters of the agency was known as Bab-i-Aali (secret war office) and was headed by Prince Karim. The total strength of the Jannisar was recorded as 30; nothing is known about the strength of the Janbaz.\n\nThe Prince did not start a war because of Afghanistan's refusal and the Soviet Union's unwillingness to offer assistance. During his stay in Sarlath, Prince Karim appointed Malik Saeed and Qadir Bakhsh Nizamani as his emissaries to contact the Afghan government and approach other embassies in order to get moral and material support. According to Nizamani, the Afghan authorities refused to provide any sort of help and told them either to remain in Kandahar as political refugees or to return to Balochistan. The Afghan authorities also refused to permit the rebel group to operate on Afghan soil. Nizamani informed the Iranian Embassy of the Baloch demands as well. Iranian diplomats showed their concern but did not offer any assistance, though they were willing to provide asylum to the rebel group in Iran. The last hope of the Prince's representative was the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet diplomats listened to Nizamami carefully. Though they did not give any assurances, they did promise to inform Moscow.\n\nIn the 19th century, Afghan rulers like Shuja Shah and Abdur Rahman Khan wanted to occupy Balochistan. In 1947, the Afghan government demanded the creation of Pashtunistan, a region stretching from Chitral and Gilgit to the Baloch coast in the Arabian Sea. The Afghan government called Balochistan \"South Pashtunistan\" in statements and publications. The Afghan expansionist policy reflected the economic considerations of a landlocked state. At the same time, it was impossible for the Afghan government to neglect its own national interests and to support the movement of an independent Greater Balochistan, which claimed the Baloch region in Afghanistan.\n\nJoseph Stalin did not pursue Vladimir Lenin's policy in the East. Moreover, the Soviet government was unwilling to annoy the Afghans or the British, both of whom opposed the creation of an independent Balochistan.\n\nMeanwhile, a \"Farman Royal Order\" issued by the Khan on May 24, 1948 stated that the Prince and his party were to be regarded as a rebel group; no connection of any sort with the Prince and his party should be maintained, nor should they be given rations; further, if any member of the rebel group committed an offence, he would be punished. The Government of Pakistan moved the army to the military posts of Punjab, Chaman Chashme, and Rastri near the Afghan border, attempting to control the rebels' rations which were being sent by pro-separatist elements, and to control their activities or stop any attempt at invasion. The Pakistani authorities confirmed two clashes between the army and the rebels.\n\nTo avoid popular unrest in Balochistan, the Khan sent his maternal uncles Hajji Ibrahim Khan and Hajji Taj Mohammed from Sarlath to bring Prince Karim back to Kalat. Khan made his return conditional.\n\nThe Prince and the separatist movement failed to achieve internal and external support. Moreover, the Baloch nationalists were divided into two groups. Anqa and Malik Saeed favoured armed struggle in the form of guerilla war, while Mir Ghous Bux Bizenjo and other prominent leaders wished to resolve all issues by negotiation.\n\nThe Prince was forced to return to the Khanate and negotiate for his demands peacefully. On July 8, 1948, when the news of the Prince's arrival reached Kalat, the Prime Minister and a Kalat State Force went to meet the Prince at Earboi to deliver the Khan's message.\n\nWith Afghan aid, Abdul Karim entered Balochistan and organised a rebellion against Pakistan in the Jhalawan area. He received assistance from Mir Gohar Khan Zehri, an influential tribal leader of the Zarkzai clan. Major General Akbar Khan, who was in charge of the Pakistani army's Seventh Regiment, was ordered to attack the insurgents and force them to surrender. Prince Karim and his 142 followers were arrested and imprisoned in the Machh and Quetta jails.\n\nA detailed and interesting statement comes from General Akbar Khan, in his article published in the daily Dawn, dated August 14, 1960, under the title \"Early reminiscences of a soldier.\" In this article, General Akbar confirms that there was a plan to invade the Khanate and describes the clash between the Pakistani army and the separatist force headed by Prince Karim. Akbar claims that Jinnah had issued instructions that this news should not be published in the Pakistani press.Jinnah was dead by then.\n\nAfter the arrest of the Prince and his party, the Attorney Governor General gave an order for an inquiry, to be conducted by Khan Sahib Abdullah Khan, the Additional District Magistrate of Quetta. He submitted his report on September 12, 1948. His report was based on the Prince's activities and upon the letters and documents published by the separatist force. After the inquiry, R. K. Saker, the District Magistrate of Quetta, appointed a special Jirga (official council of elders) consisting of the following persons:\n\n1. Khan Bahador Malik Sahibzada, M.Ayub Khan Isakhel, Pashtoon from Pishin;\n2. K.B. Baz Mohd Khan. Jogezai, Pashtoon from Loralai;\n3. Abdul Ghaffar Khan Achakzai, Pashtoon from Pishin;\n4. S.B. Wadera Noor Muhammad Khan, a Baloch Chief from Kalat;\n5. Syed Aurang Shah from Kalat;\n6. Sheikh Baz Gul Khan Mandokhail. Pashtoon from Zhob;\n7. Wahab Khan Panezai, Pashtoon from Sibi;\n8. Sardar Doda Khan Marri, Baloch from Sibi.\n\nThis Jirga was instructed to study the circumstances and events which led to the revolt and was asked to give its recommendations to the District Magistrate. On November 10, 1948, the Jirga heard the testimony of the accused and gave its recommendations to the D.M. on November 17, 1948, suggesting the delivery of the Prince to Loralai at the pleasure of the Government of Pakistan and various other penalties. The D.M., in his order dated November 27, 1948, differed with the opinion of the Jirga and sentenced the Prince to ten years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 5000 rupees. Other members of his party were given various sentences and fines.\n\n\n"}

They were Kshatriyas of the Pericchedi ruling clan of Andhra.\n\nThe Pericchedi kings were ancestors of the Pusapati royal family who built Bezawada (Modern Vijayawada) off the river Krishna by 626 AD and another capital in Kollipaka establishing themselves for nine centuries there. They were staunch patrons of Hindu Dharma in contrast to the Chalukyas, who initially were patrons of Jainism.\nThe family name was changed to Pusapati after moving to the coastal region. They founded the city of Vizianagaram, and named it after Pusapati Vijay Rama Raju, spelled with a Z to differentiate it from the Vijayanagar Dynasty in Hampi. They obtained the title of Gajapathi in the 16th century, after vanquishing the Gajapatis (of Orissa) in the battle of Nandapur (modern Jeypore), in the Northern Circars, and have used since then. In 1484 Pusapati Rachi Raju wrote Vasistha Gotra Kshatriya Sisa Malika.\n\nThe Rajas allied themselves with the Gajapathi Emperor of Orissa against the Vijayanagar Empire initially but after being conquered by Krishnadevaraya they became their feudal allies. They, along with the other allies of Vijayanagar were conquered by Sultan Quli, the founder of the Qutub Shahi dynasty of Golkonda but by 1652 the 5th king of the subsequent Pusapati line was made Subahdar of the Northern Circars and they re-established themselves in the Vizagapatnam country. Emperor Aurangzeb has given them a two-edged sword 'pattaa kaththi' (Telugu:పట్టాకత్తి) (Zulfiqar), which is still used in the coat-of-arms of the family. By 1713 they erected the fort at Vizianagaram where they have since resided. In 1827 Maharajah Vijay Rama Gajapati Raju III. had several honors conferred on him by the British Government. Lord Northbrook obtained for him the title of His Highness, and had his name enrolled among those of chiefs entitled to return visits from the Viceroy with a 13 gun salute.\n\n\n"}

As of 2016, there are 114,911 registered Syrian refugees living in Egypt. \n\nThe country is also under the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP), a coordination effort between countries neighboring Syria (Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq), Egypt, and UN agencies with NGOs including UNHCR and 240 partners.\n\nEgypt has a large black market and most Syrian work in it. There are cafés on this black market where a majority of unregistered Syrians work. The majority of Syrian registered with UNHCR have a higher chance of receiving a job because they are in Egypt legally. It is not a simple task to gain employment because of Egypt's reservation on refugee access to the labor market in the 1951 refugee convention.\n\nIn Egypt, refugees are allowed to live in the cities unlike some of their neighboring countries. The majority of Syrians that registered with UNHCR have housing in Egypt because of their resettlement program. However, there are more barriers to entry in Egypt. There has been more detention as a means of housing and a holding ground before deportation.\n\nIn 2012, the president of Egypt granted Syrians access to the public school system and aid in registration. Education is free to Syrian Refugees but it does exclude post-graduate education. Students are required to have their passports and a copy of their transcript from Syria. If a student does not have their transcript they can take a placement exam to determine their level of education. Upon application for school Syrian students receive a document that gives them access to a one-year residency permit.\n\nThere are Syrian learning centers in Egypt that differ from the public school system because they are accredited. These educational institutions are a source of jobs or Syrian teachers because they are not allowed to legally teach in the Egyptian public school system. These schools offer assistance with the Egyptian curriculum.\n\nEgypt with the help UNHCR and other NGOs mainstreamed healthcare for Syrian refugees and made their healthcare free. Mainstreaming effect refugees in urban areas like Cairo. There was standardization of the healthcare system and more transparency of the costs.\n\n\nIn order to gain refugee status in Egypt it must be proved that the applicant has a well founded fear of persecution. After gaining refugee status you are given a UNHCR yellow card which gives you three year temporary residency permit. However, Egypt is having refugees renew their permits every six months.\n\nIn July 2013, the Egyptian government required Syrian refugees to have entry visas, residency documents, and work permit before they could enter the country. Since the implementation of this law, 3,058 refugees have been detained for attempting to depart illegally by sea. 75 female refugees from multiple countries, including Syria, are being detained in prison for allegedly having fake passports, being undocumented, and attempting to depart. There is a high unemployment rate among refugees, due to the 1982 Article 11 of the Ministry of Labor's Ministerial Resolution that required employers to prove that no Egyptian national was available for a job before a work permit was issued to a refugee.\n\n"}

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British occupied the whole Indian subcontinent. They introduced a new policy of divide and rule to sustain their occupation in this region. According to this policy, society was divided into two parts, i.e. agricultural and non-agricultural castes. The skilled and educated persons of the community were designated as small castes, or non-agricultural castes. Their real castes were removed from the records and the profession was avowed as their caste.\n\nThis was a feudal system made to keep the youth of society away from learning such skills. According to this system the skilled persons became slaves to the feudal landlords and the agricultural castes, who were rewarded with lands and territories as they were loyal to Britain rather than their own people. The assets of these skilled persons were seized or awarded to feudal Chiefs and their relatives. The people belonging to these castes were deprived of some rights like government jobs, sale and purchase of property (exceeding a particular limit), education, etc. Due to this act the respectable became the most reviled in the society. Their profession became their caste for more than two centuries. So the title of small caste was given by the British to the skilled persons of the society belonging to the major castes of the society.\n\nAlthough the British left after 1947, this plant is rooted so deep that it has had bitter effects till now. It is supposed to be the major cause of division in Pakistani society. But after Independence from the British and Dogra Rules the AJK Government has changed this policy by announcing equal rights.

{"id": "7351032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7351032", "title": "Swiss people", "text": "Swiss people\n\nThe Swiss (, , , ) are the citizens of Switzerland, or people of Swiss ancestry.\n\nThe number of Swiss nationals has grown from 1.7 million in 1815 to 7 million in 2016. More than 1.5 million Swiss citizens hold multiple citizenship. \nAbout 11% of citizens live abroad (0.8 million, of whom 0.6 million hold multiple citizenship).\nAbout 60% of those living abroad reside in the European Union (0.46 million). \nThe largest groups of Swiss descendants and nationals outside Europe are found in the United States and Canada.\n\nAlthough the modern state of Switzerland originated in 1848, the period of romantic nationalism, it is not a nation-state, and the Swiss are not usually considered to form a single ethnic group, but a confederacy (') or ' (\"nation of will\", \"nation by choice\", that is, a consociational state), a term coined in conscious contrast to \"nation\" in the conventionally linguistic or ethnic sense of the term.\n\nThe demonym \"Swiss\" (formerly in English also \"Switzer\") and the name of Switzerland, ultimately derive from the toponym \"Schwyz\", have been in widespread use to refer to the Old Swiss Confederacy since the 16th century.\n\nThe ethno-linguistic composition of the territories of modern Switzerland includes the following components:\n\nThe core Eight Cantons of the Swiss Confederacy were entirely Alemannic-speaking, and German speakers remain the majority. However, from as early as the 15th century, parts of French-speaking Vaud and Italian-speaking Ticino were acquired as subject territories by Berne and Uri, respectively. The Swiss \"Romandie\" was formed by the accession of French-speaking Geneva and Neuchâtel and the partly francophone Valais and Bernese Jura (formerly part of the Prince-Bishopric of Basel) to the Restored Swiss Confederacy in 1815.\nRomansh was formerly considered a group of Italian dialects, but Switzerland declared Romansh a national language in 1938 in reaction to the fascist Italian irredentism at the time. \n\nAs elsewhere in Western Europe, immigration to Switzerland has increased dramatically since the 1960s, \nso that a large proportion of the resident population of Switzerland are now not descended or only partially descended from the core ethno-linguistic groups listed above. \nAs of 2011, 37% of total resident population of Switzerland had immigrant background.\nAs of 2016, the most widely used foreign languages were English, Portuguese, Albanian, Serbo-Croat and Spanish, all named as a \"main language\" by more than 2% of total population (respondents could name more than one \"main language\").\n\nThe Swiss populace historically derives from an amalgamation of Gallic or Gallo-Roman, Alamannic and Rhaetic stock. Their cultural history is dominated by the Alps, and the alpine environment is often cited as an important factor in the formation of the Swiss national character. For example, the \"Swiss illness\", the condition of Swiss mercenaries pining for their mountainous native home, became prototypical of the medical condition of \"nostalgia\" (\"homesickness\") described in the 17th century.\n\nIn early modern Switzerland, the Swiss Confederacy was a pact between independent states within the Holy Roman Empire. The populations of the states of Central Switzerland considered themselves ethnically or even racially separate: Martin Zeiller in \"Topographia Germaniae\" (1642) reports a racial division even within the canton of Unterwalden, the population of Obwalden being identified as \"Romans\", and that of Nidwalden as \"Cimbri\" (viz. Germanic), while the people of Schwyz were identified as of Swedish ancestry, and the people of Uri were identified as \"Huns or Goths\".\n\nModern Switzerland is atypical in its successful political integration of a multiethnic and multilingual populace, and is often cited as a model for new efforts at creating unification, as in the European Union's frequent invocation of the Swiss Confederate model.\nBecause the various populations of Switzerland share language, ethnicity, and religion not with each other but with the major European powers between whom Switzerland during the modern history of Europe found itself positioned, a policy of domestic plurality in conjunction with international neutrality became a matter of self-preservation.\nConsequently, the Swiss elites during the period of the formation of nation states throughout Europe did not attempt to impose a national language or a nationalism based on ethnicity, instead pushing for the creation of a civic nation grounded in democratic ideology, common political institutions, and shared political ritual. Political allegiance and patriotism was directed towards the cantons, not the federal level, where a spirit of rivalry and competition rather than unity prevailed. C. G. Jung advanced the view that this system of social order was one of a \"chronic state of mitigated civil war\" which put Switzerland ahead of the world in a civilizatory process of \"introverting\" warlike aggression.\nA similar view is attributed to Gottfried Keller, who is cited to the effect that the Swiss Confederacy could not exist without the endemic rivalry between cantons.\n\nFrom the 19th century there were conscious attempts to foster a federal \"Pan-Swiss\" national identity that would replace or alleviate the cantonal patriotisms. Among the traditions enlisted to this end were federal sharpshooting competitions or \"tirs\", because they were one of the few recognized symbols of pan-Swiss identity prior to the creation of the 1815 Confederation and because they traditionally involved men from all levels of society, including the peasants, who in Romantic nationalism had become ideologically synonymous with liberty and nationhood. An additional symbol of federal national identity at the federal level was introduced with the Swiss national holiday in 1889. The bonfires associated with the national holiday have become so customary since then that they have displaced the \"Funken\" traditions of greater antiquity. \n\nIdentification with the national symbolism relating to the Old Swiss Confederacy was especially difficult for the cantons which had been joined to the Helvetic Republic in 1798 without any prior membership in the Swiss Confederacy, and which were given the status of Swiss cantons only after the end of the Napoleonic era. \nThese specifically include Grisons, Valais, Ticino, Vaud and Geneva. \nSt. Gallen is a special case in a different sense, being a conglomerate of various historical regions created in 1803; in this case, patriotism may attach itself even to sub-cantonal entities, such as the Toggenburg. Similarly, due to the historical imperialism of the canton of Berne, there is considerable irredentism within the Bernese lands, most visibly in the Bernese Jura but to a lesser extent also in parts of the Bernese Oberland such as Hasli.\n\nSwiss citizenship is still primarily citizenship in one of the Swiss cantons, and the naturalization of foreign citizens is the privilege of the cantons.\nNo Swiss passports were issued prior to 1915, more than 60 years after the establishment of the modern Swiss Confederation. Prior to 1915, citizens held passports issued by their cantons, the Confederation being considered as a federation of the cantons, not a state composed of natural persons as its citizens.\n\nThe Swiss Constitution of 1848 regulated certain rights that the cantons were required to grant to citizens of other cantons, such as the right of residence (in the case of naturalized citizens after a period of five years).\nThe Swiss Constitution of 1874, which remained in force (with revisions) until 1999, \ndefined Swiss citizenship as inherited from cantonal citizenship: \" Jeder Kantonsbürger ist Schweizer Bürger\" (\"every citizen of a canton is a Swiss citizen\").\nIn the preamble to the current Swiss Constitution of 1999, a \"Swiss People\" (\"Schweizervolk\") is invoked alongsides \"the Cantons\" as sovereign entity, and article 1 reads \"The People and the Cantons [...] form the Swiss Confederation.\"\nArticle 37 still defines Swiss citizenship as inherited from communal and cantonal citizenship: \"Any person who is a citizen of a commune and of the Canton to which that commune belongs is a Swiss citizen.\"\n\nAs Swiss citizenship is entirely based on \"jus sanguinis\", the place of origin rather than the place of birth is recorded in identity documents. As Swiss citizenship is tied to the cantonal citizenship associated with the \"place of origin\" (\"Heimatort\" or \"Bürgerort\" \"home commune, commune of citizenship\"), a citizen's place of origin is inherited from his or her father (from the mother if born out of wedlock or if the father holds no citizenship). \nThe significance of the place of origin outside of the naturalization procedure has been gradually abolished in the early 21st century. Since 2012, the municipality or canton of a citizen's place of origin is no longer responsible for providing social welfare to that citizen. Since 2013, a woman no longer acquires the place of origin of her husband upon marriage. \n\nWhile the cantons are responsible for naturalization, federal Swiss nationality law regulates minimal requirements necessary for naturalization. \nThese requirements were significantly reduced in a 2018 revision of the law, allowing naturalization after a minimal period of residence of ten years, and in certain cases as little as five years (naturalization of spouses and children of Swiss citizens; years of residence at ages 8 to 18 count double).\nA further requirement is that the applicant be \"well integrated\" and \"familiar with life in Switzerland\", and must have \nboth oral and written competence in one of the national languages of Switzerland.\nThe federal law just specifies minimal requirements for naturalization, and cantons are free to introduce more stringent requirements. In practice, the cantons delegate the actual procedure of naturalization to the communes.\n\nWith 25% of the population resident aliens, Switzerland has one of the highest ratios of non-naturalized inhabitants in Europe (comparable to the Netherlands; roughly twice the ratio of Germany). In 2003, 35,424 residents were naturalized, a number exceeding net population growth. Over the 25-year period of 1983 to 2007, 479,264 resident foreigners were naturalized, yearly numbers rising gradually from below 10,000 (0.1%) in the 1980s to above 40,000 (0.6%) in the 2000s. Compare the figure of 0.2% (140,795) in the United Kingdom (2004).\n\nThe genetic composition of the Swiss population is similar to that of Central Europe in general.

It was founded by Jesse Cardinal, in collaboration with the indigenous women of Keepers of the Athabasca. Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a Dene women, is the main organizer. One of Eriel’s co-organizers for the Healing Walk is Melina Laboucan-Massimo, a Lubicon Cree environmental activist. Over four consecutive years the Tar Sands Healing Walk brings together hundreds of people to walk in a spiritual gathering to protect culture, environment and climate from the expansion of the tar sands. This women's initiative aims to unite the peoples of the Athabasca River and Lake Watershed to secure and protect water and watershed lands for ecological, social, cultural and community health and well being.\n\nThe walk is a demonstration to bring awareness to the impact of the tar sands development. \"Protests, rallies, marches are all good and necessary, but we felt like people needed something more spiritual, something to strengthen a connection to the land\", said organizer Jesse Cardinal (Keepers of the Athabasca). It is called the healing walk to pray for the land and the people that have been exploited by tar sands' development. It is a reaction to the alleged legislative abuses of indigenous treaty rights.\n\nOver 500 people travelled from all over North America to participate in this healing ceremony. The walk takes place on the territories of the Cree, Dene and Métis peoples of northern Alberta, where the impacts of the tar sands on the land and its inhabitants is devastating.\nMany people gather and camp at the Indian Beach Campsite in Anzac, just outside Fort McMurray near the Athabasca Oil Sands, to participate in the walk. Native elders from all over North America lead people past lakes of tailings wastewater and infrastructure of the tar sands industry along the Athabasca River covering a walking route ranging from 14 to 16 kilometers. The 2014 walk was the last official walk. \"This is the last healing walk in the Athabasca region because it's time to shed light on other communities impacted by tar sands,\" said Jesse Cardinal, coordinator of Keepers of the Athabasca. \"In order to stop the destruction, the healing has to start everywhere.\"\n\nThe walk brings awareness to Canadian human rights violations and the devastating impacts of the Athabasca Oil Sands on First Nations people. The right to clean air and clean water were outlined in Treaty 6 protected by the Canadian Constitution. Under Treaty 6, the Beaver Lake Cree are guaranteed the right to hunt, trap and fish on their traditional lands in perpetuity. The oil sands developments threaten the indigenous peoples' traditional way of life by destroying the very habitat upon which the animals and fish depend. The Canadian oil sands, also known as the tar sands, is the largest industrial project on earth, yet few Canadians are aware of the rapid pace of growth and its impacts on the environment, economy, and society. Alberta tar sands produced approximately 1.9 million barrels of oil per day in 2012. If industry and government’s expansion plans are approved this number could reach 5 million barrels per day by the end of 2030. In 2013, First Nations people witnessed the oil spill in Cold Lake, which still continues to pose problems for people in the area. Eight experts in environmental science, policy and risk from Simon Fraser University called for a moratorium on all new tar sands development until there is a comprehensive policy-making process for more sustainable energy development for North America.\n\nSince 2007 higher than normal incidences of rare and deadly cancers and brain tumours have been documented by the Alberta Health Department in First Nations communities that live downstream of the oil sands. Arsenic, cancer causing carcinogens, are created by bitumen production. Arsenic deposits are detected in water, soil, and even in the remnants of fallen snow that have been tested in the area.\n\nToxins are inescapable and cancer rates are skyrocketing, especially among women and children, due to the industrial chemical exposure in the water and the air. These chemicals are now inextricable from the landscape. This health issue for indigenous people is considered a form of industrial genocide.\n\nCancers and asthma rates for people of Northern Alberta are higher than most places in Canada and higher than non-indigenous people. Life expectancy for indigenous people is on average five years less than non-indigenous people.\n\nUnder the current oil sands development, woodland caribou populations are expected to disappear. This poses a problem for the hunting traditions of Canada's indigenous peoples. This threatens their food security and adds to overall health issues for the people and the environment.\n\n\"In Solidarity with the Healing Walk: Women's voices on the oil sands, pipelines, and climate change\", discusses issues on climate change and health for indigenous women and children. Very few sources discuss these issues from the perspective of women. Women's voices are silenced in politics especially in indigenous politics. Their families are more impacted by rare cancers and their children are suffering higher rates of asthma than non-indigenous children who live outside the path of environmental impact.\n\nOrganizer Eriel Tchekwie Deranger is explicit that what is happening in her community is industrial genocide, and that her community and its traditional way of life are dying along with her people. indigenous women are very impacted, not just by tar sands, but through this representation of continued colonization.\n\nIn a human rights report on Canada, Amnesty International suggested that the government should have respect for indigenous rights when issuing licences for mining, logging, petroleum and other resource extraction. The tar sands boom is an attack on First Nations rights, by displacing indigenous populations and dismantling crucial environmental protections. The Beaver Lake Cree nation has documented 20,000 treaty rights violations linked to tar sands expansion. 80% of the traditional territories of the Athabasca Chipewyan, First Nation and the Cree First Nation are rendered inaccessible for periods of the year due to oil sands development. The land that is accessible is devastated by development.\n\nClimate activist Bill McKibben notes that if development in Canada's oil sands continue, it will cause irreversible damage to the planet. Despite the economic advantages that developing oil could have on Canada, McKibben suggested that it's time to develop green energy jobs.\n\nOil sands underlie approximately 140,000 square kilometers of Alberta – an area about the size of Florida. Oil sands leases cover about 20% of the province’s land area. In 46 years of development, only 0.15% of the environment disturbed is certified as \"reclaimed.\" There is no way to return the boreal forest to its natural state. Over 30 million birds will be lost over the next 20 years due to tar sands development.\n\nDangerous greenhouse gas emissions are produced by Canada's tar sand that impact the Global climate. The exploitation of the oil sands is the primary reason Canada will fail to meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets. Canada’s climate performance is the worst in the entire Western world. More than 600 million cubic feet of natural gas are used every day to extract oil from the tar sands. That amount of gas is enough to heat more than 3 million Canadian homes every day. The International Energy Agency reports that increasing oil production from 1.9 million barrels to 5 million a day will lead to a catastrophic increase in the global temperature. Carbon emissions from the production and processing of the oil sands have more than doubled in the last decade and are on track to double again. The Canadian government has mounted an intensive lobbying campaign to weaken clean fuel standards that the European Commission has proposed to achieve its climate change targets.\n\nIn northern Alberta, local Aboriginal communities are forced to endure highly degraded air and water quality. Oil sands industry used approximately 170 million cubic metres of water in 2011 to extract bitumen. That is the equivalent to the residential water use of 1.7 million Canadians. 95% of the water used in tar sands surface mining is so polluted it has to be stored in toxic sludge pits. That is 206,000 litres of toxic waste discharged every day.\n\nCanada is home to two of the three largest dams in the world. They are used to hold back toxic sludge from the oil sands. 11 million litres of toxic wastewater seep out of the tailing pits into the boreal forest and Athabasca river every day. That is 4 billion litres a year. Air pollutant guidelines in Alberta are less stringent than international standards. Despite that, air quality objectives were exceeded 1,556 times in 2009, up from 47 times in 2004.\n\nDavid Schindler, environmental scientist, conducted research to assess the way water pollution was investigated in the oil sands. His research indicated that water monitoring was only regulated by the industry, not outside environmental consultants. This led to inaccurate levels of carcinogens reported over time. Chief Allan Adams of the Athabasca area is consulting with Schindler to provide evidence of water pollution linked to the seepage from the tailings ponds.\n\nEighty per cent of the traditional territory of the Mikisew Cree and Athabasca Chipewyan First Nations has been rendered inaccessible for most of the year by tar sands development, which is a direct treaty rights violations. This directly impacts fishing and hunting access.\n\nHunting is a traditional way of life for Canada's indigenous people. The loss of habitat has prevented hunting on their own land. The pollutants from the production of the oil sands iskilling animals and fish that First Nations communities relied on at one time for food. In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of arsenic in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption).\n\n\n\"It was unlike anything Lori Nicotine had ever seen. On the Poundmaker First Nation, words like mining, tailings and steam-assisted gravity drilling are non-existent. But on Saturday, Nicotine left the North Battleford reserve for the fifth and final Healing Walk, a 16-kilometre spiritual walk around a former tailings pond. Aboriginal chiefs and elders lead [sic] the procession, stopping intermittently to pray for the land's healing with song and tobacco offerings. As a crowd of 700 walked up Highway 63 and approached Syncrude's main plant, Nicotine looked out towards the upgraders and work trucks, and wept.\" (2014) \n\n\n"}

The term \"American Old West\" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the portion of the modern United States west of the Mississippi River, and mostly in the period between the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the admission of the last states into the Union in 1912. A small section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.\n\nWestern North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of Native Americans, and later served as a frontier to European powers, beginning with Spanish colonization in the 16th century. British, French, and Russian claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the American Revolution, the newly independent United States began securing its own frontier from the Appalachian Mountains westward for settlement and economic investment by American citizens. The long history of American expansion into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.\n\nEvents listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they \"tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures.\"\n\nFor almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by European colonists, despite various territorial claims made by imperialist nations. Europeans interest in the vast territory was motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West. The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n"}

It is mainly spoken by the Venda people in the northern part of South Africa's Limpopo Province, as well as by some Lemba people in Zimbabwe. The Venda language is related to Kalanga (Western Shona, different from Shona, official language of Zimbabwe) which is spoken in Botswana and Zimbabwe. During the Apartheid era of South Africa, the bantustan of Venda was set up to cover the Venda speakers of South Africa.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Venda speakers are concentrated in the following areas: Makhado Local Municipality, with 350,000 people; Thulamela Local Municipality, with 370,000 people; Musina Local Municipality, with 35,000 people; and Mutale Local Municipality, with 89,000 people. The total number of speakers in Vhembe district currently stands at 844,000. In Gauteng province, there are 275,000 Venda speakers. Fewer or less than 10,000 people are spread across South Africa and that makes total number of Venda speakers in South Africa at 1.2 million people or just 2.2% of South Africa's population, making Venda speakers the second smallest minority language in South Africa, after the Ndebele language, which number 1.1 million speakers.\n\nThe Venda language uses the Latin alphabet with five additional accented letters. There are four dental consonants with a circumflex accent below the letter (\"ḓ, ḽ, ṋ, ṱ\") and an overdot for velar \"ṅ\". Five vowel letters are used to write seven vowels. The letters C, J and Q are used only for foreign words and names. \nThe extra letters have the following Unicode names: \n\nThe \"sintu\" writing system \"Isibheqe Sohlamvu/Ditema tsa Dinoko\", known technically in Venda as \"Luṱhofunḓeraru lwa Mibvumo\", is also used for the Venda language.\nVenda distinguishes dental \"ṱ, ṱh, ḓ, ṋ, ḽ\" from alveolar \"t, th, d, n, l\" as well as (like in Ewe) labiodental \"f, v\" from bilabial \"fh, vh\" (the last two are slightly rounded). There are five vowel sounds: . There are no clicks; \"x\" has the sound of \"ch\" in \"loch\" or \"Bach\". As in other South African languages like the Zulu, \"ph, ṱh, th, kh\" are aspirated and ejective: \"p, ṱ, t, k\".\n\nA labiodental nasal sound appears in prenasalised consonant sounds, and is often used from loanwords. Labiovelar sounds occur as alternatives to labiopalatal sounds and may also be pronounced . Fortition of occurs after nasal prefixes, likely to .\n\nVenda has a specified tone, , with unmarked syllables having a low tone. Phonetic falling tone occurs only in sequences of more than one vowel or on the penultimate syllable if the vowel is long. Tone patterns exist independently of the consonants and vowels of a word and so they are word tones. Venda tone also follows Meeussen's rule: when a word beginning with a high tone is preceded by that high tone, the initial high tone is lost. (That is, there cannot be two adjacent marked high tones in a word, but high tone spreads allophonically to a following non-tonic (\"low\"-tone) syllable.) There are only a few tone patterns in Venda words (no tone, a single high tone on some syllable, two non-adjacent high tones), which behave as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

The cartel is based in Chihuahua, one of the primary transportation routes for billions of dollars' worth of illegal drug shipments entering the United States from Mexico annually. He was one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords.\n\nVicente Carrillo Fuentes was born in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico on 16 October 1962 to Vicente Carrillo and Aurora Fuentes. He had seven siblings: Angélica, Amado, Cipriano, Guadalupe, Alberto, Rodolfo and José Cruz Carrillo Fuentes (Vicente being the fourth one). All are nephews of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, a former drug lord.\n\nThe Juárez Cartel was founded by his brother Amado Carrillo Fuentes following the death of Pablo Acosta Villarreal.\n\nCipriano Carrillo Fuentes died in the mid-1980s by gunshot under mysterious circumstances. Amado began in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle and eventually formed the Juárez Cartel by 1993. Amado brought in his brothers and eventually his son Vicente Carrillo Leyva, who was arrested on April 1, 2009.\n\nWhen Amado died on July 3, 1997 following complications from plastic surgery, a brief turf war began in Juarez over the leadership of the cartel. Vicente would emerge as the victor after defeating the Muňoz Talavera brothers for control of the cartel. Vicente formed a partnership with Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, his brother Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, Ricardo Garcia Urquiza and the Beltrán Leyva brothers. He kept in service several lieutenants formally under his brother, such as \"El Chacky\" Hernandez.\n\nThe organization was in flux by the time Vicente took control of the cartel and the death of Amado created a large power vacuum in the Mexican underworld. The Arellano Félix brothers became the most powerful organization during the 1990s while Vicente was able to avoid direct conflict and increase the strength of the Juárez Cartel. The relationship between the Carrillo Fuentes clan and the other members of the organization grew unstable towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 2001 after the escape from prison by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, many of the Juárez Cartel members defected to Guzmán's Sinaloa cartel.\n\nIn 2004 Rodolfo Carrillo was killed outside of a movie theatre allegedly at the behest of Guzmán Loera. Vicente Carrillo responded by having Guzmán Loera's brother \"El Pollo\" assassinated in prison. This sparked off a turf war; however, it seemed that the war between the two was on hold during 2005 and 2006 because the Sinaloa Cartel was engaged in a vicious war with their rival, the Gulf Cartel. During this time, the leadership of the cartel was between Vicente Carrillo and Ricardo García Urquiza, who was arrested in November 2005. The cartel had become factionalized between the groups loyal to the Carrillo family and the groups loyal to Juan José Esparragoza Moreno and Guzmán Loera's Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nThe Juárez Cartel, under the control of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, was placed under a large degree of pressure following the \"House of Death\" case, in which the organization was penetrated by law enforcement, but was corrupted by the fact that the informant participated in murders. In 2008, 200 murders occurred in the first three months and it appeared that the war between the Sinaloa Federation and the remnants of the Juárez Cartel was back on. President Calderón sent thousands of troops to Ciudad Juárez. The Juárez Cartel, at one time the most powerful in Mexico, is a shadow of its former self.\n\nCarrillo Fuentes was charged in a forty-six count indictment in the Western District of Texas with continuing criminal enterprise, importation and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, conspiracy to import and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, as well as with money laundering, tampering with a witness, ordering the intentional killing of individuals to prevent communication of information by them to U.S. law enforcement, and murder in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise. The U.S. Departments of State offered a reward of up to $5 million USD for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.\n\nOn 1 June 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Carrillo Fuentes under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \"Kingpin Act\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with eleven other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.\n\nCarrillo Fuentes was arrested in a joint operation by the Mexican Army and Federal Police in Torreón, Coahuila on 9 October 2014. He was then sent to Mexico City and transferred to the federal installations of SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave a formal declaration. Two days later, he was formally charged with drug trafficking and organized crime offenses. On 14 October 2014, Carrillo Fuentes was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2, a federal maximum-security prison (commonly referred to as \"Puente Grande\"), in Jalisco state. That same day, he was formally charged by a federal court in Jalisco for violating Mexico's Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives.\n\n\n"}

These people most commonly dwelt in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula. They had ancestral ties to various Korean kingdoms including Gojoseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, and tribes including Okjeo, Dongye, and Yangmaek (양맥; 梁貊) and Sosumaek (소수맥; 小水貊).\n\nYemaek is believed to be a combination of Ye (濊·穢·薉) and Maek (貊·貉) people of two neighboring cultures. The main culture is the Xitunshan culture (西团山文化). He Qiutao (何秋涛) said Ye is the short name of Buyeo. Dongye first appears in history as a vassal state of Gojoseon until its fall to China in 108 BCE. It was known as the Huiyetou (穢邪頭) state in Shuowen Jiezi. It later became a vassal of the increasingly powerful Goguryeo. According to the Chinese Records of Three Kingdoms, Ye worshiped tigers, whereas according to \"Erya\", Maek means bears. Gomnaru, the capital of Baekje, also means the \"bear port\". Historians suggest tigers and bears may have been totems worshiped by Ye and Maek tribes.\n\nSeveral history books suggest Gojoseon, the first Korean kingdom in history, was established by Yemaek.\n\nThere have been some academic attempts to recover Yemaek words based on the fragments of toponyms recorded in the Samguk Sagi for the areas once possessed by Goguryeo and Buyeo-Baekje.\n\nAccording to Samguk Sagi, Silla was established as a confederacy of six clans composed of Joseon refugees, and the Royal Seal of Ye (예왕지인; 濊王之印), previously used by Buyeo's kings, was found in Silla in 19 AD and presented for King Namhae of Silla.\n\n"}
{"id": "165719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165719", "title": "Yukaghir people", "text": "Yukaghir people\n\nThe Yukaghir, or Yukagir (; self-designation: одул (\"odul\"), деткиль (\"detkil\")) are a people in Russian Far East, living in the basin of the Kolyma River.\n\nThe Tundra Yukaghirs live in the Lower Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic; the Taiga Yukaghirs in the Upper Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic and in Srednekansky District of Magadan Oblast. By the time of Russian colonization in the 17th century, the Yukaghir tribal groups occupied territories from the Lena River to the mouth of the Anadyr River. The number of the Yukaghirs decreased between the 17th and 19th centuries due to epidemics, internecine wars and Tsarist colonial policy which may have included genocide against the sedentary hunter-fisher Anaouls. Some of the Yukaghirs have assimilated with the Yakuts, Evens, and Russians.\n\nCurrently, Yukaghirs live in the Sakha Republic and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation. According to the 2002 Census, their total number was 1,509 people, up from 1,112 recorded in the 1989 Census.\n\nAccording to the latest 2001 all Ukrainian census, 12 Yukaghirs are living in Ukraine. Only 2 of them indicated Yukaghir as their native language. For the remaining others (6) it is Russian and for 1 it is some other tongue.\n\nThe 13 tribes that once constituted the Yukaghir group are: Vadul-Alais, Odul, Chuvan, Anaoul, Lavren, Olyuben, Omok, Penjin, Khodynts, Khoromoy, Shoromboy, Yandin, and Yandyr. Genetically, Yukaghirs exhibit roughly equal frequencies of the Y-DNA haplogroups N1c, Q1, and C2 (formerly C3).\n\nThe surviving three tribes are the Odul of Nelemnoe, the Vadul of Andryushkino and the Chuvan of the Anadyr river area. Of the extinct groups, the most important were the Khodynts, the Anaoul (both of the Anadyr River area), and the Omok (north of the Chuvan). Sometimes the Chuvan are considered a separate tribe. The Chuvantsy language has been extinct since the early 20th century. In 2002, 1,087 identified themselves as Chuvan compared to more than 1,300 in 1989. The Vadul are mainly involved in reindeer herding while the Odul (Kogime) are mostly hunter-gatherers. The Vadul are also known as Tundra Yukaghir. The Odul are also known as Taiga Yukaghir or Kolyma Yukaghir. The Vadul and Odul languages are as different as German is from Dutch. Both are nearing extinction, and Odul is in a much weaker state compared to Vadul. In the 1989 census, more than 700 of the Yukaghirs identified as Vadul while fewer than 400 were Odul.\n\nThe Yukaghir are one of the oldest peoples in North-Eastern Asia. Originally they lived over a huge territory from Lake Baikal to the Arctic Ocean. By the time of the first encounter with Russians, Yukaghir were divided into twelve tribes with around 9,000 people. The Yukagir ethnonym is \"Odul\" or \"Vadul\", which means “mighty”.\n\nTribal divisions among the Yukaghir are fading now, although in every census from 1926, significant number of tribesmen identified themselves with tribal divisions like Anaoul, Odul and Vadul rather than describing themselves as Yukaghir. The Soviet government actively discouraged this tendency and now only the most elderly identify this way. In the 2002 census, out of the 1,509 Yukaghirs, 51 identified themselves as Omok, 40 as Alais, 21 as Odul, 17 as Vadul, 6 as Khangait and 4 as Detkil.\n\nThe head of every clan was an elder called a \"Ligey Shomorokh\". His was the final word in all aspects of life. Hunting leaders were \"Khangitche\", and war leaders were \"Tonbaia Shomorokh\" (\"the mighty man\"). Women and teenagers had equal voices with men. The internal life of the community was under the control of the older women. Their decisions in those matters were indisputable.\n\nIn the beginning of every summer all clans gathered for the \"Sakhadzibe\" festival, where mutual Yukaghir questions were discussed.\n\nIn the Yakut-Sakha Republic there are three nomadic extended family communities. These are Tchaila in Nizhnekolymsky District, Teki Odulok in Verkhnekolymsky District and Ianugail in Ust-Yansky District. The head of Ianugail is I. I. Tomsky. The community’s main activities are deer hunting and fishing.Tchaila is the biggest of the three. Its head is S. I. Kurilov. They have 4000 domesticated reindeer, 200 horses, and 20 cows. The community also hunts deer and polar foxes. There is also a shop where traditional skin and fur garments are made. The head of Teki Odulok is N. I. Shalugin. Their base is the village of Nelemnoe. This community is in the most difficult situation. Due to the “creative interpretation” of various Perestroika and privatization laws by the local and district administration and so-called businessmen, the community has lost all their reindeer, cows and even part of its land. All they have left are about 50 horses. They have no money for supplies for hunting and fishing. 80% of all adult population is \"de facto\" unemployed.\n\nThe highest forum for Yukagir is the all-people gathering \"Suktuul\".\n\nThe main traditional activity is nomadic and semi-nomadic hunting of deer, moose, wild sheep, and sable, as well as fishing. Reindeer are bred mostly for transportation. Horses are known among the Yukaghir as \"domestic reindeer of Yakuts\" (\"Yoqod ile\" in Tundra Yukaghir or \"Yaqad āçə\" in Kolyma Yukaghir). A Yukaghir house is called a \"chum\".\n\nThe decline of traditional economic activities, the unfavorable environmental situation of the Yukaghir’s traditional lands and waters, and the absence of local and federal laws and executive mechanisms protecting indigenous peoples in Russia, have not aided the welfare and continuation of traditional Yukaghir communities. The average life span for men is 45 years, and 54 years for women. Child mortality is the highest in the Yakut-Sakha Republic. In addition, one expedition made to the Yukaghir found that most had no knowledge of traditional Yukaghir culture.\n\nThe Yukaghir languages are a small language family of two closely related languages, Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir, although there used to be more. They are unclassified languages: their origin and relation to other languages are unknown; some scholars consider them distantly related to the Uralic languages, but this classification is not accepted by the majority of specialists in Uralic linguistics. The languages are regarded as moribund, since less than 370 people can speak either Yukaghir language. Most Yukaghirs today speak Yakut and Russian.\n\nAlongside Russian Orthodox beliefs, Yukaghirs still practice shamanism. The dominant cults are ancestral spirits, the spirits of Fire, Sun (Pugu), Hunting, Earth, and Water, which can act as protectors or as enemies of people. The most important is the cult of \"Pugu\", the Sun, who is the highest judge in all disputes. The spirits of the dead go to a place called \"Aibidzi\". Every clan had a shaman called an \"alma\". After death every \"alma\" was treated as a deity, and the body of the dead \"alma\" was dismembered and kept by the clan as relics. The Yukaghir still continue traditions stemming from their origins as nomadic reindeer-hunters: they practice dog sacrifice and have an epic poem based around crows.\n\n\n\n\nModern culture:\n\n"}
