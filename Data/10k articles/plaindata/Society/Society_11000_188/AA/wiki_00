The term has been documented as early as February 1939, when Bishop Daniel Mageean, in his Lenten pastoral, stated that prime minister, Lord Craigavon had adopted the words as his slogan.\n\nThe implication was that Irish Catholics had no political status in the country. Many of them supported the Nationalist Party that chose a policy of abstentionism between 1921 and 1965, resulting in a large majority of Protestant members. They also alleged that local gerrymandering had increased since 1921.\n\nThe original similar phrase had been published in the 1934 Northern Irish parliamentary debates (volume 16).\n\nA bitter debate arose in the Parliament of Northern Ireland on 24 April 1934 on the rights of the minority (the minority in Northern Ireland being Nationalist supporters, who were mostly Catholic), itemising how these had generally deteriorated since 1921. Craigavon denied the assertions at length, ending with: \"\"Since we took up office we have tried to be absolutely fair towards all the citizens of Northern Ireland. Actually, on an Orange platform, I, myself, laid down the principle, to which I still adhere, that I was Prime Minister not of one section of the community but of all, and that as far as I possibly could I was going to see that fair play was meted out to all classes and creeds without any favour whatever on my part.\"\n\nGeorge Leeke then retorted: \"What about your Protestant Parliament?\", to which Craigavon replied: \"The hon. Member must remember that in the South they boasted of a Catholic State. They still boast of Southern Ireland being a Catholic State. All I boast of is that we are a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State. It would be rather interesting for historians of the future to compare a Catholic State launched in the South with a Protestant State launched in the North and to see which gets on the better and prospers the more. It is most interesting for me at the moment to watch how they are progressing. I am doing my best always to top the bill and to be ahead of the South.\"\"\n\nSimilar phrases he used were \"That is my whole object in carrying on a Protestant Government for a Protestant people\". The correct phrase was quoted by Jonathan Bardon, and Professor Ronan Fanning, but the common misquotation has been relayed by eminent historians such as Diarmaid Ferriter, Seán Cronin, Patrick Buckland and Mark Tierney, to the extent that \"A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People\" has now become very widely accepted as the actual quotation.\n\nIn 1967, the then prime minister, Terence O'Neill also attributed the phrase itself to his predecessor, but strongly argued that it was no longer representative of the present spirit of Ulster Unionism. Newspapers continued to use the term in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in relation to the former Stormont Parliament.\n\n"}

To be granted and to preserve certification, companies must receive a minimum score on an online assessment for \"social and environmental performance\", satisfy the requirement that the company integrate B Lab commitments to stakeholders into company governing documents, and pay an annual fee ranging from $500 to $50,000.\n\nAs of August 2018, there are over 2,600 certified B Corporations across 150 industries in 60 countries.\n\nThe B Lab certification is a third party standard requiring companies to meet social sustainability and environmental performance standards, meet accountability standards, and to be transparent to the public according to the score they receive on the assessment. B Lab certification applies to the whole company across all product lines and issue areas. For-profits of all legal business structures are eligible for certification.\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain a B Corporation certification, a company first completes an online assessment. Companies that earn a minimum score of 80 out of 200 points undergo an assessment review process, essentially a conference call verifying the claims made in their assessment. Companies are required to provide supporting documentation before they are certified.\n\nThe assessment covers the company’s entire operation and measures the positive impact of the company in areas of governance, workers, community, the environment, as well as the product or service the company provides. Socially and environmentally-focused business model points ultimately are accrued in their relevant impact area (governance, workers, community or environment). Depending on a company's industry, geographic location, and number of employees, the online assessment adjusts the weightings of the question categories to increase its relevancy. For instance, companies with more employees will have a heavier weighting in the workers category, and companies in manufacturing will have a heavier weighting in the environment category.\n\nTo maintain credibility, the B Corporation certification standard operates under principles that are independent, comprehensive, comparable, dynamic, and transparent. B Lab has an established standards advisory council that can independently make decisions with or without the support of B Lab. As of May 2014, 28 of 30 members were listed by their business affiliation. The council recommends improvements to the B Corp assessment on a biennial basis. There is a 30-day public consultation period before releasing a new version of the B Corporation assessment.\n\nCurrently the B Corp assessment is its fifth version, with the sixth version scheduled to be released in January 2018.\n\nCertification also requires companies to integrate their stakeholder commitments into the company governing documents. In the United States, the avenue for corporations making the legal amendment to certify will depend on the state they are incorporated in. Some states known as \"constituency\" states will allow for this change in the articles of incorporation, other states, known as \"non-constituency states\", will not; and many states now have the option of adopting the benefit corporation legal structure, which also meets B Lab's requirements for B Corp certification. Beyond the corporate model, other for-profit business entities make an amendment of the company by-laws or governing documents. These include:\n\nHowever, B Lab certification allows the company bylaws to remain secret.\n\nIn September 2018, there were over 2,000 certified B Corporations across 130 industries in 50 countries, including Canada (78 companies), Australia, South Africa, and Afghanistan. The most active community outside of the United States is Sistema B. Since 2012, Sistema B has been the adaptation of the B Corps movement in Latin America, including in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Colombia. This non-profit adapts proprietary certifications and evaluation metrics and modifies both to the context of each country. B Lab also assists Sistema B in incorporating a benefit corporation distinction into local legal systems.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4510684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4510684", "title": "Bill Browder", "text": "Bill Browder\n\nWilliam Felix Browder (born 23 April 1964) is an American-born British financier and economist. He is the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, an investment fund that at one time was the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia. He gave up his U.S. citizenship in 1998 to avoid paying taxes related to foreign investment. After having business in Russia for ten years, Browder was refused entry to Russia in 2005 as a threat to national security; he has said it was because he exposed corruption.\n\nAfter the death in prison in 2009 of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer and auditor who had represented his company and conducted an investigation into massive tax fraud related to it, Browder lobbied for Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights violators, which was signed into law in 2012 by President Barack Obama. In 2013, Browder was tried in absentia in Russia for tax fraud, jointly in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison. Interpol rejected Russian requests to arrest Browder, saying the case was political. In 2014, the European Parliament voted for sanctions against 30 Russians believed complicit in the Magnitsky case; this was the first time it had taken such action.\n\nIn July 2017, Browder testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through use of persons in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn October 19, 2017, Canada enacted its own Magnitsky Act, which allows for the freezing of assets and visa bans on officials from Russia and other nations considered to be guilty of human rights violations, and prohibits Canadian firms from dealing with foreign nationals who have grossly violated human rights. Other countries including Estonia, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, have also enacted their own version of the Magnitsky Act.\n\nOn October 21, 2017, as part of a criminal conviction for tax evasion, the Russian government attempted to place Browder on Interpol's arrest list. After a protest by U.S. Congressional leaders, his visa was restored the following day. Russia's arrest-warrant request was rejected by Interpol on October 26, 2017. While visiting Spain in May 2018, Browder was arrested on 30 May 2018 by Spanish authorities on a new Russian Interpol warrant and transferred to an undisclosed Spanish police station, yet he was released two hours later, after Interpol confirmed that this was a political case.\n\nWilliam Felix Browder was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of mathematician Felix Browder, and the grandson of Earl Browder. He attended the University of Colorado, Boulder before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which he graduated with a degree in economics. He earned an MBA from Stanford Business School in 1989 and entered the financial sector.\n\nBrowder's paternal grandfather was Earl Browder, who was born in Kansas in 1891. He was a radical and had lived in the Soviet Union for several years from 1927 and married Raisa Berkman, a Jewish Russian woman, while living there. After his return to the United States in 1931, Earl Browder became the leader of the Communist Party USA, and ran for U.S. president in 1936 and 1940. After World War II, Browder lost favor with Moscow and was expelled from the U.S. Communist Party.\n\nEarl and his wife Raisa had three children, all sons, and all three became mathematicians who headed the mathematics departments of top American universities including Bill Browder's father Felix Browder who married Eva (Tislowitz). Felix was a mathematics prodigy who had entered MIT at 16, acquired his bachelor's degree in two years, and by the age of 20 received a Ph.D. from Princeton. But during the McCarthy era, he could not find work because he was the son of the onetime head of the Communist Party USA. After a series of job rejections in the 1950s, he was championed by Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady who was then chairman of the board of Brandeis University; she overrode the rest of the board who were afraid to hire him, and he gained a position at Brandeis. Felix went on to chair the mathematics department at the University of Chicago, and in 1999 became the president of the American Mathematical Society.\n\nFelix Browder was renowned in the field of nonlinear functional analysis — a branch of mathematics with wide applications to such fields as physics, engineering, and finance. He was instrumental in establishing a science and technology center in conjunction with Princeton University and Bell Labs. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Bill Clinton, for his \"key role in the explosive growth of nonlinear functional analysis and its applications to partial differential equations in recent years\".\n\nBill Browder has one sibling, Tom Browder, who entered the University of Chicago at 15, and became a leading particle physicist.\n\nIn 1998, Bill Browder gave up his U.S. citizenship and became a British citizen, partly to avoid paying U.S. taxes on foreign investments. At the time, he was working in the Eastern European practice of the Boston Consulting Group in London, and managed the Russian proprietary investments desk at Salomon Brothers. In October 2017, when answering a question about the decision to renounce his U.S. citizenship, he cited \"a legacy of bad feeling about the rule of law\" as a result of his family having been \"viciously persecuted\" by U.S. authorities in the 1950s.\n\nBrowder and Edmond Safra (1932–1999) founded Hermitage Capital Management in 1996 for the purpose of investing initial seed capital of $25 million in Russia during the period of the mass privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union. Beny Steinmetz was another of the original investors in Hermitage.\n\nFollowing the Russian financial crisis of 1998, Browder remained committed to Hermitage's original mission of investing in Russia, despite significant outflows from the fund. Hermitage became a prominent activist shareholder in the Russian gas giant Gazprom, the large oil company Surgutneftegaz, RAO UES, Sberbank, Sidanco, Avisma, and Volzhanka. Browder exposed management corruption and corporate malfeasance in these partly state-owned companies. He has been quoted as saying: \"You had to become a shareholder activist if you didn't want everything stolen from you\".\n\nIn 1999, Avisma filed a RICO lawsuit against Browder and other Avisma investors including Kenneth Dart, alleging they illegally siphoned company assets into offshore accounts and then transferred the funds to U.S. accounts at Barclays. Browder and his co-defendants settled with Avisma in 2000; they sold their Avisma shares as part of the confidential settlement agreement.\n\nIn 1995–2006 Hermitage Capital Management was one of the largest foreign investors in Russia, and Browder amassed millions through his management of the fund. In both 2006 and 2007, he earned an estimated £125–150 million.\n\nIn March 2013, HSBC, a bank that serves as the trustee and manager of Hermitage Capital Management, announced that it would end the fund's operations in Russia. The decision was taken amid two legal cases against Browder: a libel court case in London and a trial \"in absentia\" for tax evasion in Moscow.\n\nIn June 2018, HSBC reached a settlement with the Russian government to pay a £17 million fine to Russian authorities for its part in alleged tax avoidance.\n\nIn 2005, after ten years of business deals in Russia, Browder was blacklisted by the Russian government as a \"threat to national security\" and denied entry to the country. \"The Economist\" wrote that the Russian government blacklisted Browder because he interfered with the flow of money to \"corrupt bureaucrats and their businessmen accomplices\". Other experts on the activities of Western \"investors\" in Russia in the 1990s were more sympathetic to the Russian government's assessment, citing Browder's earlier settlement agreement with Avisma, which seemed to indicate a long-standing habit of siphoning off funds to offshore accounts. Browder had earlier supported Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs reported in 2008 by \"The New York Times\", \"over the next two years several of his associates and lawyers, as well as their relatives, became victims of crimes, including severe beatings and robberies during which documents were taken\". In June 2007, dozens of police officers \"swooped down on the Moscow offices of Hermitage and its law firm, confiscating documents and computers. When a member of the firm protested that the search was illegal, he was beaten by officers and hospitalized for two weeks, said the firm's head, Jamison R. Firestone.\" Hermitage became \"victim of what is known in Russia as 'corporate raiding': seizing companies and other assets with the aid of corrupt law enforcement officials and judges\". Three Hermitage holding companies were seized on what the company's lawyers insist were bogus charges.\n\nThe raids in June 2007 allegedly enabled corrupt law enforcement officers to steal the corporate registration documents of three Hermitage holding companies. They allegedly perpetrated a fraud, claiming (and receiving) a rebate of $230 million in taxes paid by those companies to the Russian state in 2006. In November 2008 one of Hermitage's auditors, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested. He was charged with the very tax evasion that he was investigating. Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009 in prison, after eleven months in pretrial detention, nearly the limit allowed under the law. A report linked to by the Wall Street Journal said he died of disease made worse by poor medical treatment. A report by the Physicians for Human Rights in Cambridge, Mass., said the same\n\nAs a result of the controversy related to his arrest and evidence of mistreatment and claimed abuse, his death aroused international coverage and outrage. Magnitsky's death was the catalyst for passage by the U.S. Congress, of the Magnitsky Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. The act directly targeted individuals involved in the Magnitsky affair by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system. The Russian government retaliated by prohibiting adoption of Russian children by American citizens, and prohibiting certain individuals from entering Russia.\n\nIn February 2013, Russian officials announced that Browder and Magnitsky would both be tried for evading $16.8 million in taxes. In March 2013, Russian authorities announced that they would be investigating Hermitage's acquisition of Gazprom shares worth $70 million. The investigation was to focus on whether Browder violated any Russian laws when Hermitage used Russian companies registered in the region of Kalmykia to buy shares. An investigation by the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights cleared Browder of the accusations of improprieties that surfaced at this time. At the time, according to the Russian law, foreigners were barred from directly owning Gazprom shares. Browder was also charged with trying to gain access to Gazprom's financial reports.\n\nBrowder admitted having sought influence in Gazprom, but denied any wrongdoing. He said that purchasing Gazprom shares was an investment in the Russian economy, and the desire to influence the Gazprom management was driven by the need to expose a \"huge fraud going on at the company\". He also said that the scheme of using Russian-registered subsidiaries entitled to tax advantages was practised by other foreign investors at the time and was not illegal. He also said that he believed the trial was a response to the United States passing the Magnitsky Act, which had blacklisted Russian officials involved in Magnitsky's death, preventing them from entering the U.S. The \"Financial Times\" reported that this trial was the first in Russian history that included a dead defendant.\n\nAmnesty International described the trial as \"a whole new chapter in Russia's worsening human rights record\" and a \"sinister attempt to deflect attention from those who committed the crimes Magnitsky exposed\". The American weekly magazine \"The Nation\" had said in December 2012 that the Magnitsky Act \"recklessly and needlessly jeopardized U.S.-Russian cooperation in vital areas from Afghanistan and the Middle East to international terrorism and nuclear proliferation\".\n\nOn 11 July 2013, Browder was convicted \"in absentia\" by a district criminal court in Moscow on charges under article 199 of the RF Criminal Code (tax-evasion by organisations), and sentenced to nine years. Magnitsky was posthumously convicted of fraud. In May 2013 and again in July 2013, Interpol rejected requests by Russia's Interior Ministry to put Browder on its search list and locate and arrest him, saying that Russia's case against him was \"predominantly political\".\n\nIn April 2014, the European Parliament unanimously passed a resolution to impose sanctions on more than 30 Russians complicit in the Magnitsky case; the first time in the parliament's history that a vote was held to establish a public sanctions list. However, the vote was only advisory to the European Commission, which did not act on it.\n\nIn December 2017, Browder was tried in absentia and convicted of tax evasion and deliberate bankruptcy by a Russian court, receiving a sentence of nine years of imprisonment.\n\nOn 30 May 2018, Browder was arrested by Spanish police in Madrid on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. He was freed soon after, when the General Secretary of Interpol warned the Spanish police not to follow the Russian arrest warrant. Browder had come to Spain to brief anti-mafia prosecutor José Grinda. After briefing him, Browder returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, Browder testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in regards to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and Fusion GPS. The latter is the opposition research firm based in Washington D.C. that commissioned former MI6 staffer Christopher Steele to collect information on Donald Trump's ties with Russia. The hearing was set up to examine the firm's separate work on a legal case involving the Magnitsky Act. He directly discussed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Browder testified that President Putin is \"the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world\", building a fortune by threatening Russian oligarchs and getting a 50% cut of their profits:\n\nI estimate that he has accumulated $200 billion of ill-gotten gains from these types of operations over his 17 years in power. He keeps his money in the West and all of his money in the West is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation. Therefore, he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the Magnitsky sanctions.\n\nBrowder concluded his statement by reviewing the circumstances that led to U.S. passage of the Magnitsky Act:\nI hope that my story will help you understand the methods of Russian operatives in Washington and how they use U.S. enablers to achieve major foreign policy goals without disclosing those interests. I also hope that this story and others like it may lead to a change in the FARA enforcement regime in the future.\n\nIn February 2015, Browder published a book about his career, \"Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice\", focusing on his years spent in Russia and the Russian government's attacks on Hermitage Capital Management. Browder's responses to Russian corruption and his support of the investigation into the death of his attorney Sergei Magnitsky are at the heart of the book. A film adaptation written by William Nicholson was reportedly in the works in 2015.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New York's Southern District filed a civil asset forfeiture case against Prevezon Holdings Limited, a real estate holding company belonging to Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, based on information from Browder. Prevezon and the Department of Justice settled the case in May 2017 for $5.9 million.\n\nBrowder attempted to resist subpoenas that would force him to reveal his sources for information he gave to federal prosecutors. The court ruled that Browder was not required to comply with a subpoena served in Aspen, Colorado, because he \"does not live or conduct business transactions regularly in Aspen\", but he was required to comply with a subpoena served in New York, where he had been discussing his new book on a television show. He was deposed in April 2015.\n\nIn July 2018 Browder warned that Danske Bank’s Estonian operations were used to launder as much as $8.3 billion.\n\nA 2016 documentary by Andrei Nekrasov, \"The Magnitsky Act – Behind the Scenes\", \"absolves the Russian government of any responsibility for Magnitsky's death\" and claims that Browder was behind the $230-million tax-rebate fraud. The film was promoted in Europe and the U.S. by a group that included Natalia Veselnitskaya. Some European theater screenings and a television broadcast of the film were canceled after threats of libel suits from Browder. Over Browder's objections, the Newseum in Washington, D.C. held a screening in June 2016 that was hosted by Seymour Hersh. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA)'s office actively promoted the screening, sending out invitations from the office of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats, which Rohrabacher chairs.\n\nOn July 16, 2018, during a joint press conference with President Donald Trump in Helsinki, Finland, Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that Browder had funneled $400 million dollars to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, an effort that involved members of the U.S. intelligence community who, Putin said, \"accompanied and guided these transactions.\" The statement was made after Putin said he would allow special counsel Robert Mueller's team to come to Russia for their investigation – as long as there was a reciprocal arrangement for Russian intelligence to investigate in the U.S.\n\nPutin: For instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder, in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia and never paid any taxes neither in Russia or the United States and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent [a] huge amount of money, $400,000,000, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. (Later, the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office spokesman Alexander Kurennoy clarified that it was not $400 million, but rather $400,000.) Well that’s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself but the way the money was earned was illegal. So we have solid reason to believe that some [US] intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions. So we have an interest in questioning them.\"Politifact\", \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" rated Putin's claim about the funding false, noting that there is no evidence to substantiate it. Bill Browder, in his own article for \"Time\", called the accusation \"so ludicrous and untrue that it falls into delusion.\" He maintains that Putin continues to accuse him of false allegations in response to Browder's involvement with the Magnitsky Act. Browder also points out that he is a British citizen and no longer American, therefore Trump would be unable to respond to Putin's request.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35861970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35861970", "title": "Brazilians in Nigeria", "text": "Brazilians in Nigeria\n\nBrazilians in Nigeria consist mostly of descendants of freed Afro-Brazilian slaves who left Brazil and settled in Nigeria as well as expatriates from Brazil.\n\nStarting from the 1830s, many emancipated Africans who had been through forced labour and discrimination in Brazil began moving back to Lagos bringing along with them some cultural and social sensibilities adapted from their sojourn in Latin America. These emancipated Africans were often called 'Aguda' or 'Maro' and also included returnees from Cuba.\n\nAt the height of the Transatlantic slave trade in West Africa, many prisoners of war or those kidnapped for sale in slave markets were sold to Europeans and transported across the Atlantic. Estimates of the number of slaves from the Gulf of Guinea to Brazil totaled about 300,000 in the nineteenth century. The captives disembarked in Bahia before moving further south to work on plantations, assist tradesmen or hawk goods for white Brazilians. But as some gained manumission, earned savings or got deported as a result of racism, waves of African migration back to the West African coast developed. By the middle nineteenth, an Afro-Brazilian community began to emerge along the West African coast, developed by descendants of slaves who had twice crossed the Atlantic, these Africans brought back Afro-Brazilian sensibilities in food, agriculture, architecture and religion.\n\nThe first recorded repatriation of African people from Brazil to what is now Nigeria was a government-lead deportation in 1835 in the aftermath of a Yoruba and Hausa led rebellion in the city of Salvador known as the Malê Revolt. After the rebellion, the Brazilian government fearful of further insurrection allowed freed or manumitted Africans the option to return home or keep paying an exorbitant tax to the government. A few Africans who were free and had saved some money were able to return to Africa as a result of the tough conditions, taxation, racism and homesickness. In 1851, 60 Mina Africans to put together $4,000 to charter a vehicle for Badagry.\n\nAfter slavery was abolished in Cuba and Brazil in 1886 and 1888 respectively, further migration to Lagos continued. Many of the returnees chose to return to Nigeria for cultural, missionary and economic reasons. Many of them descended from the Yoruba. In Lagos, they were given the watery terrains of Popo Aguda as their settlement. By the 1880s, they comprised about 9% of the population of Lagos. Towards the end of 1920, the migration stopped.\n\nThough, coastal Lagos was the preferred destination, most of the returnees were descendants of groups such as Ijeshas, Oyos, Ijebu and Egba based in the interior. The Agudas were aware of their home cities but preferred to set up shop in Lagos because it was conducive for trade, they were warmly received in Badagry and also because of on-going wars in the interior. A ship with Agudas docking in Badagry can be welcomed by crowds of children hailing them as they disembark from the ship. In some cases, the Oba gave them land to build a house and provided men to assist them in their transition to local life. But Lagos was different from Bahia, the elder returnees were comfortable but many of the children were foreign to Lagos. They held on to elements of Bahia culture such as Catholicism and formed a close knit community within Lagos Island. Because of the retention of Catholicism and Western dressing, indigenous Africans called them \"black whites\" or Agudas. Keen on acquiring wealth in Africa, some of the earliest Aguda's were morally ambivalent on issues such as slavery and became slave traders themselves,such as Francisco Felix de Sousa and Domingo Martinez.\n\nWhen Agudas arrived from Bahia and Pernambuco they took up residence on the Eastern parts of Lagos, in land provided by Oba Ojulari. In 1852, this region was demarcated as the Brazilian quarter to be known later known as Popo Aguda. During this time, metropolitan Lagos followed the racial and cultural characteristics evident in the city. The Saros lived in Olowogbowo, a tract of land on the Western corner of Lagos Island, Europeans lived and traded along the long stretch of the Marina and Lagos indigenous Lagosians lived on the Northwestern areas of the island. The westernmost corner of Brazilian quarter reached the easternmost parts of Olowogbowo at Tinubu Square while the center of the Brazilian area was Campos Square named after Cuban returnee, Hilario Campos. Other major streets include Bamgbose and Tokunboh. Within the quarters diasporic sensibilities was evident, the community lacked signs of ethnic grouping and fluidity was present in the religious practices of the residents.\n\nPopo Aguda was also the commercial center of trade serving as a distribution center of imported goods.\n\nReturnees from Brazil and their present-day descendants were and are more commonly called \"Agudas\" (from , a non-standard Portuguese word for cotton properly rendered as ) or \"Maro\". Most were Catholics but some worshiped African Orishas which they brought from Brazil. Some of the Agudas are also Muslims. Most of them still have Portuguese names. Some common Portuguese family names in Nigeria include Da Silveira, De Silva, De Souza, and Moreira. In the 1800s, the major distinguishing set of classification was by birth, Aguda's taken captive from West Africa who emigrated back to Lagos were called Papae or Mamae and those who were born in Brazil and then returned were called Yaya or Yayo.\n\nThe British annexation of Lagos in 1861 and the promotion of trade benefited the Brazilian community. Along with the Saros they became a rising bourgeois. They harbored western style of dressing, owned race horses and organized waltzes, square dances and musical soirees where Molière was performed. However, with time many began to embrace their heritage and when the children of the returnees were grown they came to embrace Lagos as their home. The annexation of Lagos that sprung up these wealthy class also came with the realisation that the colonists where not leaving soon and any hope of forming a political class was dim. The Brazilians began to cultivate relationships with the traditional authorities in Lagos while some renewed relationships with Africans in the hinterland by supplying them with weapons. Aguda's supplied weapons to the Ijeshas against Ibadan. Beginning in the 1880s, many began to change their names to African ones while the Aurora relief Society was formed to research\n\nAguda's cuisine in the early 1920s included food considered African in Bahia but considered different from those eaten by indigenes on the Island. They ate pirão de caranguejo during holidays and prepared , (porridge) and (coconut milk beans) as food staples. In agriculture, the returnees also popularized the use of Cassava as a food crop.\n\nAguda's celebrated Easter with the coming out of Caretas or masked figures, burrinha at Epiphany and Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Our Lord of the Good End) associated with Obatala was celebrated during yuletide.\n\nPopo Aguda was a close-knit community and residents were known for their thriftiness and a strong work ethic.\n\nMajority of the Agudas were Catholics but the community had a significant number of Muslim families and those who still adhered to the traditional religion. Religious differences were not as important nor divisive as it was to indigenous Africans and they were comfortable marrying from either religions. Prior to the construction of a pro-cathedral, mass was performed in a bamboo building on Broad St, the plot of land where St Mary Convent was later built on. The first priest was Padre Anthonio, he was in charge of the Catholic church before the coming of French missionaries. The practice of baptism was important to the local community and it was also a way to enter the Aguda community.\n\nA cathedral, the Holy Cross Pro-Cathedral was completed in 1881, financed by funds from the lay congregation, it was designed to be most significant structure in Lagos colony when completed. Originally built with one tower, a few years later another tower was added with the structure forming a cruciform structure with two towers. The Church was built by Agudas but supervised by French missionaries. Among the builders were the quartet of Francisco Nobre (built of one the towers), Balthazar dos Reis, João, da Costa and Lázaro Borges da Silva (master bricklayer) along with their apprentices, these group also built the old Central Mosque, called Jamiu Central Mosque.\n\nTrade between Lagos and Brazil rose in the 1860s and in 1869, Brazil was the third largest exporter to Lagos, very much behind Britain but ahead of France. Returnees in Lagos dominated the trade with Brazil and sold cotton, traditional artifacts and kola-nuts to Africans in Bahia. However, this Transatlantic trade gradually declined and by the beginning of the Twentieth century it was virtually non existent. They had pioneered trade with Brazil in the mid nineteenth century but by the 1880s, ruinous competitors and an economic downturn had forced many to abandon the export trade. Agriculture soon became an avenue to supplement shortfalls in economic activity. But before the downturn many traders had acquired wealth and became prominent families within the community in Lagos, patriarchs such as Angelo Campos, Esan da Rocha and Joaquim Branco (originally settled in Dahomey) were able to sponsor their children for further education in Bahia, Havana or Europe. In Bahia, Afro-Brazilians formed the bulk of skilled labor, Aguda returnees brought along trade skills mastered in Bahia and preferred to teach their children a trade or handicraft such as masonry, seamstress, tailoring. But some worked as clerks for the European trading companies. In 1897, of the 96 qualified Aguda artisans listed in a directory, 11 were bricklayers and builders, 6 were cabinet makers, 9 tailors, 21 carpenters, 17 clerks and 24 traders. The leading dressmaker in Victorian Lagos was Yaya Clemencia Guinaries.\n\nThe Brazilians who engaged in trading of goods also had the benefit of using their connection to their home cities to bypass traditional channels of trade by opening direct routes from Lagos to the interior and ignoring the traditional market cities and middlemen. Apart from trading of goods, investment in properties was also common among the wealthier families.\n\nBrazilian architecture in Nigeria is a legacy of the thousands of freed slaves who returned to Nigeria in the 19th century. Trained as carpenters, cabinetmakers, masons and bricklayers in Brazil, the ex-slaves were notably technically skilled artisans and were known for their exuberant and individualistic style on doorways, brightly painted facades and chunky concrete columns which are rooted in the baroque styles popular in Brazil in the 18th century.\n\nIn early 1800s Lagos, the dominant architectural style was mud houses and houses with stilt using thatched leaves as roofing; these houses were usually divided into compartments to hold the extended family. The residence of the Oba and chiefs were much bigger, they had large courtyards, pillars and arches, a mixture of European and indigenous styles. The European influence took root during the reign of Oba Akinsemoyin who invited Portuguese slavers to Lagos,and the slavers in return renovated his palace using imported bricks for the structure and roofing slates from Portugal. In the 1830s, the migration of emancipated returnees began to change the architectural style. Influenced by the symmetrical plans of the Brazilian colonial house, they introduced a new architectural style to Lagos that was soon embraced by wealthy traders. The Brazilian style of architecture became dominant in Lagos Island by the end of the 19th century. The structure are one storey houses built for middle class residents and others were two or three storeys stuccoed buildings(sobrados) built for wealthier clients. The detached storey buildings conferred prestige on the owner. They were built with shuttered windows, had spaces between the top of the wall and the roof and with a compound. A ground floor usually opens to the street and was sometimes used as a storage, store or housing the helps. The houses were built for a nuclear family in contrast to the extended family structure of early Yoruba architecture.\n\nThese style was prominent in old Lagos during the late nineteenth and twentieth century but as the city grew, many of the houses have been remodeled or demolished for bigger houses.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7518888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7518888", "title": "Brown (racial classification)", "text": "Brown (racial classification)\n\nBrown or brown people is a racial and ethnic term. Like black people and white people, it is a metaphor for race based solely on human skin color. In racialist ideas, the color brown and the term \"brown people\" were used to describe a series of hypothesized racial groups that included North Africans, The Horn Of Africans, South Asians, Central Asians, Southeast Asians, Eskimos, Native Americans & Latin Americans. In Brazil, brown people is a term for \"pardo\".\n\nIn the 18th and 19th century, racialist written works proposed geographically based \"scientific\" differences among \"the races.\" Many of these racial models assigned colors to the groups described, and some included a \"brown race\" as in the following:\n\n\nThese and other racialist theories have been dismissed scientifically. As a 2012 human biology textbook observes, \"These claims of race-based taxonomy, including Coon's claims for homo-sapienation, have been discredited by paleontological and genomic research showing the antiquity of modern human origins, as well as the essential genomic African nature of all living human beings.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the notion of a single \"brown people\" was sometimes superseded by multiple \"brown peoples.\" Cust mentions Grammar in 1852 denying that there was one single \"brown race\", but in fact several races speaking distinct languages. The 1858 \"Cyclopaedia of India and of eastern and southern Asia\" notes that Keane was dividing the \"brown people\" into quaternion: a western branch that he termed the Malay, a north-western group that he termed the Micronesian, and the peoples of the eastern archipelagos that he termed the Maori and the Polynesian.\n\nThe appellation \"brown people\" has been applied in the 20th and 21st centuries to several groups. Edward Telles, a sociologist of race and ethnicity, and Jack Forbes both argue that this classification is biologically invalid. However, as Telles notes, it is still of sociological significance. Irrespective of the actual biological differences amongst humans, and of the actual complexities of human skin coloration, people nonetheless self-identify as \"brown\" and identify other groups of people as \"brown\", using characteristics that include skin color, hair strength, language, and culture, in order to classify them.\n\nForbes remarks upon a process of \"lumping\", whereby characteristics other than skin color, such as hair color or curliness, act as \"triggers\" for color categories \"even when it may not be appropriate.\"\n\nIn 1950s (and later) South Africa the \"brown people\" were the Coloureds, referring to those born of multiracial sexual unions out of wedlock. They were distinct from the Reheboth Basters inhabiting Namibia, who were primarily of Khoisan and European parentage. The Afrikaans terms, which incorporate many subtleties of heritage, political agenda, and identity, are \"bruin\" (\"brown\"), \"bruines\" (\"browns\"), and \"bruinmense\" (\"brown people\"). Some South Africans prefer the appellation \"bruinmense\" to \"Colored\".\n\nThe South African pencil test was one example of a characteristic other than skin color being used as a determiner. The pencil test, which distinguished either \"black\" from \"Colored\" or \"Colored\" from \"white\", relied upon curliness and strength of hair (i.e. whether it was capable of retaining a pencil under its own strength) rather than upon any color factor at all. The pencil test could \"trump skin color\".\n\nSteve Biko, in his trial in 1976, rejected the appellation \"brown people\" when it was put to him incorrectly by Judge Boshoff:\n\nPenelope Oakes characterizes Biko's argument as picking \"black\" over \"brown\" because for Biko it is \"the most valid, meaningful and appropriate representation, \"even though\" in an individualistic decontextualized sense it might appear wrong\" (Oakes' emphasis).\n\nThis contrasts with Piet Uithalder, fictional protagonist of the satirical column \"Straatpraatjes\" (whose actual author was never revealed but who is believed to have been Abdullah Abdurahman) that appeared in the Dutch-Afrikaans section of the newspaper \"APO\" between May 1909 and February 1922. Uithalder would self-identify as a Colored person, with the column targeted at a Colored readership, introducing himself as \"een van de ras\" (\"a member of the race\") and characterizing himself as a \"bruine mens\".\n\nIn popular use, Brazilians also use a category of \"moreno\" m. , \"morena\" f. , lit. 'swarthy', from \"mouro\", Portuguese for 'Moor', which were perceived as people with darker phenotypes than Indigenous Europeans, so a \"moreno\" or \"morena\" is a person with a \"Moorish\" phenotype), which is extremely ambiguous, as it can mean \"dark-haired people\", but is also used as a euphemism for \"pardo\", and even \"Black\". In a 1995 survey, 32% of the population self-identified as \"moreno\", with a further 6% self-identifying as \"moreno claro\" (\"light moreno\"). 7% self-identified as \"pardo\".\n\nA comprehensive study presented by the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research found that on average, 'white' Brazilians have >70% European genomic ancestry, whereas 'black' Brazilians have 37.1% European genomic ancestry. It concluded that \"The high ancestral variability observed in Whites and Blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes. Thus, the only possible basis to deal with genetic variation in Brazilians is not by considering them as members of color groups, but on a person-by-person basis, as 190 million human beings,with singular genome and life histories\".\n\nJudith Ortiz Cofer notes that appellation varies according to geographical location, observing that in Puerto Rico she is considered to be a white person, but in the United States she is considered to be a \"brown person.\"\n\n"}

In ancient and medieval times Charans were treated as Gods where as the Rajputs were the kings. Many deities were born into Charans such as Avad, Karni and the famous Khodiyar. For centuries they are well known for their excellence in bravery and for deep literary sense. The Charans are also known as Deviputras ( sons of Godesses).Members of the caste are considered to be divine by a large section of society. Women of the caste are adored as mother goddesses by other major communities of this region, including Rajputs. For centuries, the Charans were known for their reputation of preferring to die rather than break a promise.\n\nA Charan will consider all the other Charans as equal even if they do not know each other and have radically different economic or geographic status.\n\nAnil Chandra Banerjee, a professor of history, has said that Banerjee's opinion is shared by another historian, G. N. Sharma, who said that \n\nTheir eating and drinking habits resemble those of the Rajputs. Charans used to enjoy consumption of opium and drinking of liquor, practices which are also popular among the Rajputs of this region. Charans do not eat the flesh of cows, and hold those who do in utter disregard. Cows are respected like mothers. A husband and wife will not drink milk from the same cow, as drinking milk from one mother (cow) symbolises that those who do so should be considered as siblings. Before Indian independence in 1947, a sacrifice of a male buffalo constituted a major part of the celebration of Navratri.

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 177th place out of 180 countries.\n\n\"In opinion surveys of Afghans,\" noted the Asia Foundation in a 2012 report, \"corruption is consistently singled out as a problem.\"\n\nOne of the recent major corruption cases was the 2010–13 Kabul Bank financial scandal involving Mahmood Karzai and others close to President Hamid Karzai. The Kabul Bank scandal, crisis, investigation and trial involved Sherkhan Farnood, Khalilullah Fruzi, Mohammed Fahim, and other insiders who were allegedly spending the bank's US$1 billion for their personal lavish living style as well as lending money under the table to family, friends, and those close to President Hamid Karzai and Mahmood Karzai. As of October 2012, the government only recovered $180 million of the $980 million fraudulent loans.\n\nA U.N. survey listed corruption and insecurity as the two issues of greatest concern to Afghans as of 2012. The \"New York Times\" has written that in Afghanistan, \"corruption can no longer be described as a cancer on the system: It is the system.\" The U.S. Agency for International Development stated in 2009 that corruption in Afghanistan had \"become pervasive, entrenched, systemic, and by all accounts now unprecedented in scale and reach.\"\n\nIn a 2011 survey by the Asia Foundation, Afghans said corruption was their \"third biggest problem (21%) after insecurity (35%) and unemployment (23%).\" In 2010 and 2011, they said corruption was their second most important reason for feeling pessimistic about Afghanistan (16% in 2011 and 27% in 2010). In 2011, they identified administrative corruption as the government's second most important failure (25%). This marked an improvement over 2010, when the figure was 30%.\n\nIn Afghanistan today, corruption most often takes the form of demanding and offering bribes, both in the private and public sectors and on large and small scales. There are also many other major forms of corruption, including nepotism, graft, and illegal land transfers. The US Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has estimated that over half of the nation's annual customs revenue is lost to graft.\n\nIn a 2015 article, Parag R. Dharmavarapu noted that while Afghanistan’s GDP had quintupled since 2002, the society remained riddled with corruption. \"What is extremely disconcerting about corruption in Afghanistan,\" wrote Dharmavarapu, \"is not simply the number or value of bribes that take place; instead, it is the endemic nature of corruption within the Afghan government\". Routinely, noted Dharmavarapu, \"police officers extort goods from shopkeepers, levy taxes on vehicles at highway checkpoints, and impose fines on individuals unable to produce proper identification documents.\" Some police officers \"turn a blind eye to or even collude with criminals and insurgents,\" while mid- to high-level police officials \"collaborate with criminals in smuggling, kidnapping for ransom and other illegal activities, collecting thousands of dollars in the process.\" Top police officials \"have siphoned millions of dollars from international donors to their own pockets.\" The most common types of corruption in Afghanistan, according to Dharmavarapu, are:\n\nAccording to the High Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOOAC), corruption is rampant in the north of the country, particularly, Balkh Province which borders neighboring Uzbekistan, a country with similar corruption problems. One of the worst manifestations of graft is illegal land grabbing. Shamsullah Javed, HOOAC head for the northern zone, in an exclusive interview with Pajhwok Afghan News, explained that \"in Balkh, there are three kinds of encroachment on land: One government department seizing the property of another, security forces occupying government land and individuals taking unlawful possession of people's land.\" He revealed that 52 out of 60 housing schemes in Balkh were executed illegally. \"Government servants, from top to bottom, are involved in the scourge ... Some people, whose interests are hurt by investigations into corruption cases, are creating problems for us,\" Javed said.\n\nInvestigative journalist Sibel Edmonds has undertaken efforts as a journalist and whistleblower to raise awareness about corruption in Afghanistan and waste, fraud and abuse involving billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers' money lost to corruption and corrupt officials in Afghanistan following the U.S. intervention.\n\n\"The great challenge to Afghanistan's future isn't the Taliban, or the Pakistani safe havens or even an incipiently hostile Pakistan,\" Gen. John R. Allen told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee in 2014. \"The existential threat to the long-term viability of modern Afghanistan is corruption.\" He stated that the insurgency, criminal patronage networks, and drug traffickers had formed \"an unholy alliance\".\n\nThe Center for American Progress has attributed corruption in Afghanistan to decades of conflict that have prevented the formation of effective state institutions and civil society groups, to laws and regulations that are poorly enforced, to anti-corruption agencies that often contradict one another and lack resources, and to the fact that soldiers and police are often illiterate and public employees often underpaid and undertrained. Decades of constant warfare, moreover, allow public officials to fill their private accounts with government funds. Also, tribal and ethnic traditions encourage people to use their positions to benefit relatives. Afghanistan's official institutions are riddled with incompetence, compelling rural folk to \"rely on networks of regional and local power-holders to maintain order and provide basic services.\"\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Afghan traditions of patronage have resulted in a constant tampering of merit-based appointments to public positions, presidential staff, member in Parliament, military commanders, and any position relating to political influence—all of which has resulted in massive corruption, which has been exacerbated by massive foreign assistance and a narcotics trade so large that it has warped the Afghan economy.\n\nAfter the U.S. overthrew the Taliban in 2001, corruption, which had been common in pre-Taliban Afghanistan, once again became a major feature of Afghan life, spreading to virtually every branch of the government and even to regional localities. A broad network of political elites tied to President Hamid Karzai positioned themselves as middlemen between Western officials and donors, on the one hand, and ordinary Afghans, on the other, using these positions to divert billions of dollars in foreign aid and investment to their private accounts and those of their allies. This resulted in several high-profile scandals, notably the Kabul Bank crisis in which revelations were made that the largest financial institution in the country had been operating as a Ponzi scheme at the benefit of the elite few tied to Karzai.\n\nA February 2014 Pentagon report charged the U.S. government with upholding a government that is enveloped in corruption in Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion through its support for warlords, its reliance on private trucking contracts, and its provision of billions of aid dollars. Initially, the U.S. supported existing patronage networks and gave some warlords government positions. This legitimization of warlords allowed them to begin using their official power to embezzle public resources. Also, because large amounts of official resources were diverted to the post-war rebuilding effort, many government workers found themselves severely underpaid and felt obliged to take bribes in order to survive.\n\n\"Corruption directly threatens the viability and legitimacy of the Afghan state,\" said the Pentagon report, which stated that American forces found themselves engulfed in regional warlord corruption and protection rackets. According to report, the nation lacked any pre-existing resources to combat corruption, owing in part to late intelligence of Afghan corruption, a lack of physical security, and a lack of the international community's will to address the issues at hand. The report stated that after the 2001 invasion the U.S. had \"empowered\" warlords by putting them into government posts, which they were able to exploit to appropriate government resources and form corruption networks. Karzai was dependent on these warlords, who were essential to both business and politics in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Asia Foundation stated in 2012 that the widespread corruption in Afghanistan is not culturally ingrained in the Afghan people, noting that the average Afghan consider current levels of corruption as much greater than in decades past, and believe that corruption was worse under Hamid Karzai, who was acting president and then president between 2001 and 2010, than under the five previous regimes. One reason why some Afghans liked, and still like, the Taliban, despite its violence and brutality, was that it promised a relief from the graft and injustice practiced by mujahideen warlords. The Asia Foundation added that the perceived root of corruption in the nation had changed during the previous five years. Earlier, most Afghans believed that corruption was due to low salaries of civil servants, whereas currently it is attributed to a lack of sanctions and a lack of competent law enforcement.\n\nOn the one hand, Afghans criticize corruption; on the other hand, they increasingly accept patronage and bribery as inevitable and even legitimate parts of daily life. A UN study found that in 2012, 68% of Afghans found it acceptable for civil servants to bolster their salary by charging bribes to service users. This represented an increase from 42% in 2009. Also, 67% found it acceptable for at least some civil servants to be hired because of family ties and friendship networks. (This rose from 42% in 2009.)\n\nThe Asia Foundation's 2011 survey \"shows that while Afghans associate democracy with general freedom, they do not associate it with less corruption, more rights, laws, and more inclusive government.\" On the contrary, they feel that democracy and the free market result in chaos and higher risk for ordinary Afghans while the already-powerful are provided with additional opportunities. The feeling of injustice that results from widespread corruption reportedly strengthens support for terrorists.\n\nAfghans have identified over 70 types of corruption that affect them personally, \"ranging from public administration and elected bodies to private sector, international aid, and the Taliban.\" Afghans identify corruption mostly with government institutions but have experienced it in many sectors.\n\nBribes must be paid in Afghanistan to secure most public services. A UN study shows that the completion of public services is reliant almost solely on bribes paid and has resulted in a severe hampering of economic growth. Petty bribery has been the leading cause of distress among the average citizens of Afghanistan, although it is generally only the high-level corruption cases that are reported in major media.\n\nProsecutors, teachers, judges, and customs officials are the most likely public employees to receive bribes. The average bribe to prosecutors and judges is over US$300. Bribes to other officials are somewhat lower. In 85% of cases, bribes are directly or indirectly requested by public officials; in 13% of cases, they are offered spontaneously by citizens. Some officials request bribes through intermediaries. According to the U.N., 50 percent of Afghans paid bribes in 2012; in some parts of the country, the figure was as high as 70 percent. Half of Afghans had bribed teachers, with similar numbers paying bribes to customs officials, judges, and prosecutors. A somewhat smaller number had bribed land registry officials and provincial officers. The bribing of judges declined significantly between 2009 and 2012. The percentage of persons paying bribes to teachers climbed from 16% in 2009 to 51% in 2012. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics account for 15 to 20% of bribes.\n\nIn 2013, 43% of Afghans viewed civil servants and bureaucrats as corrupt, while 58% said they paid a bribe to Registry and Permit Services, 44% to Tax Revenue and 40% to Land Services. In 2012, half of Afghans bribed customs officials. The bribing of customs and tax and revenue officers rose between 2009 and 2012. In 52% of Afghan households, at least one member has applied for a public sector job, and 45% paid bribes to help secure the jobs.\n\nWhile almost 30% of Afghans paid bribes to secure private-sector services in 2012, 50% did so to secure public-sector services. Public-sector bribery is more prevalent in western and northeastern Afghanistan and less in the southern and central regions.\n\nBy far the most common motive for bribery is the desire to facilitate or hasten the delivery of a public service (59.4%). Other motives include the desire to reduce the cost of a procedure (10.6%), to avoid paying a fine (13.3%), and to receive improved treatment (6.7%). Most cases, states a 2012 UN report, involve bribes for better or faster services, while other bribes are made to influence court cases and legal decisions, thus undermining the rule of law. It was reported that 24% of bribes offered to the police were for the express purpose of releasing imprisoned suspects or to avoid imprisonment altogether.\n\nAccording to a UN report, administrative bribery places the greatest economic hardship on regular Afghan citizens and their families.\n\nThe chief form of corruption in the education sector involves so-called \"ghost teachers\" and double-registered teachers. Anything involving paperwork in the educational system requires small bribes.\n\nA \"SIGAR\" report stated that senior officials at the Ministry of Education had intentionally falsified data on the number of schools and teachers in the nation in order to over-bill international aid providers. As a result, millions of US taxpayer dollars have been used to pay for nonexistent schools and teachers, and enriching the dishonest education officials in Afghanistan.\n\nA February 2012 article in \"Gulf Today\" explored the fact that in many Afghan schools there are many no-show teachers, teachers who know nothing about their subjects, and teachers who cannot even read or write. Only 20% of funds budgeted for teachers' salaries in one province went to actual teachers; the rest went to local security or education officials who receive the \"ghost teacher's\" salary in their place.\n\nA December 2014 report focused on graft within the customs system. Although many experts identified such graft as a primary cause of the government's shortfall of revenue goals the previous year, it was noted that little had been done thus far to address the problem. Customs agents were identified as the most glaring offenders, with the report noting that they in most circumstances appointed by ministers with the express understanding that financial kickbacks are to be given for the position.\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" reported in December 2012 that the US had provided the Afghan government with bulk currency counters at airports to help prevent cash smuggling. In response, the Afghan government provided a way for VIPs to bypass the machines.\n\nOutside observers have noted that the Afghan people view what Westerners consider \"favoritism\" or \"nepotism\" as the right thing to do, since they believe themselves to be taking care of their extended family. \"You take care of your own. Period. It just happens that when you do that with public funds and positions, people tend to get a little persnickety about it. While admitting that they would do the exact same thing.\"\n\nThe Asia Foundation describes the central route of growing corruption in Afghanistan as the strength of patronage politics in the country. While patronage is a centuries-long Afghan tradition, it is now an integral part of the society, and its entanglement with criminal activities is a growing concern. Because of patronage, people without connections have great difficulty rising within the Afghan government. While corrupt officials enjoy impunity, honest officials are often denied access to powerful positions.\n\nAccording to surveys by both Transparency International and the U.N., Afghans consider the judiciary their society's most corrupt segment.\n\nJudicial corruption is said to be an endemic problem in the country that affects every level of the legal system. \"From granting judicial access and selecting the deposition of cases to extorting money from defendants for favorable decisions, corrupt justices are able to line their pockets with hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.\" Judges are subject to the influence of warlords, terrorists, and others; most judges are appointed as the result of \"under-the-table deals,\" and are largely unqualified by all legal standards. Interviews carried out in 2013 with people who had lost lawsuits indicated that the winning party had bribed the court. Judges and prosecutors are believed to accept bribes to bar a case from going to court, making evidence and witnesses vanish from court evidence. There is no oversight of courts by other government branches and no transparency in Supreme Court decisions.\n\nIn December 2012, a senior judge named Zahoruddin was convicted of seeking to extort bribes from Dewa, a 22-year-old freelance journalist, who had filed for divorce. After she had refused to bribe him, he offered to marry her in exchange for granting the divorce. Dewa secretly recorded the entire conversation, and sent the tape to the Supreme Court. After a case was brought against Zahoruddin, she received a death threat from him. His conviction was described by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a rare victory in the struggle against corruption in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2014, a leading opium trafficker, Haji Lal Jan Ishaqzai, was arrested in Afghanistan by the Counter Narcotics Police, but he soon was freed in exchange for bribes. It was almost a week until the Afghan counternarcotics authorities in Kabulwas informed that Ishaqzai was freed, reported the \"New York Times\". He fled to Pakistan where he was beyond the scope of Afghan or American law enforcement. Several judicial officials were arrested, and some sources said that the Supreme Court was directly involved in letting Ishaqzai go, but it was unclear who exactly was responsible for his release.\n\nCorruption in Afghanistan's traffic department, according to a February 2013 article in the \"Washington Post\", is among the worst of the nation's fledging bureaucracies. Vehicle registration requires 27 separate signatures. A new driver's license calls for \"about a dozen stamps from ministries, agencies and banks.\" These requirements have led to the formation of a black market that involves the bribing of public officials in order to expedite traffic documents. \"It's corruption in $30 or $40 bites—far from the millions allegedly stolen here every year,\" stated the \"Post\". However, these bribes have warped the perception Afghans hold on their nation's institutions. The \"Post\" quoted an official who earns $10,000 annually on such corruption, who stated that the corrupt system is disadvantageous for everyone, including many of those involved in the scheme. The department's red tape has earned it the reputation as the most exploitive one in the government, stated the Post.\n\nA May 2014 article about corruption at traffic stops, told the story of U.S. Army Col. John Graham, deputy leader of NATO's Regional Command-Capital, who was asked by Lt. Col. Farhad Safi, an \"idealistic, young police commander in charge of a 'ring of steel' of traffic checkpoints cordoning central Kabul against car bombers and suicide attacks,\" to help arrange for security cameras and thus prevent bribery at those checkpoints.\n\nOne form of corruption that has come to the fore since 2001 is the confiscation of land. In 2003, slum dwellings in the Sherpoor neighborhood of Kabul were destroyed and replaced by residences for cabinet members. Similar actions have followed. Land has been illegally distributed by the executive to political elites in order to win their allegiance. More than 80% of new land in Kabul was distributed under the auspices of Afghan elites and high officials. Ex-warlords have made money illicitly in a range of fields and then laundered it by purchasing real estate.\n\nCorruption is common in the physical infrastructure sector, and involves criminal patronage networks. The construction business involves hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bribes that benefit a massive network.\n\nThe Afghan National Police (ANP) are considered notoriously corrupt. The Ministry of the Interior has been criticized for \"failing to properly account for billions of dollars allocated for police salaries via a U.N.-administered trust fund.\" Corruption robs police officers of up to half of their salaries, which makes them more likely to solicit bribes. A 2012 Asia Foundation survey found that over half of Afghans who had dealt with an ANP officer during the previous year had been forced to pay a bribe.\n\nBeginning in 2009, policemen in parts of Afghanistan began to be paid through their cell phones, which prevented their superiors from skimming off part of their wages. According to \"MIT Technology Review\", the bribes had been so immense that on their first pay period on the phone system, the police officers believed they had received a pay raise, when in fact they were simply receiving their full pay without any administrative bribes or extortion taking place.\n\nReuters reported in August 2011 that \"an expanding dossier of unresolved police violence and corruption cases ... have alienated Afghans,\" and that this called into question the feasibility of rebuilding the civic institutions of the war-torn nation.\n\nFox News reported in October 2014 that Afghan officials may have systematically stolen $300 million from a UNDP trust fund used to pay police officers in Afghanistan and that European Union donors had withheld about $100 million in contributions to the fund owing to concerns about the fund's management. The UNDP itself stated that it was not the agency's responsibility to address this corruption.\n\nSome police officers, according to a 2015 report, have informed the Taliban of impending operations, presumably in exchange for bribes.\n\nThe Afghan National Army is considered more professional than the ANP but also experiences a significant misallocation of resources and immense levels of bribery solicitation. In a 2013 Transparency International survey, one-fifth of Afghans said they considered the military corrupt.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in March 2012 that Afghan defense officials were impeding a probe into whether Afghan Air Force members were trafficking in opium and weapons and that an Afghan officer who had killed eight members of the US military in 2011 may have been involved in trafficking. For example, investigators were only given limited access to military personnel with any evidence to report, and were denied access to areas of the airport where smuggling was still suspected to be underway.\n\nAs a result of corruption, according to a 2014 report, the Department of Defense had lost account of over 200,000 weapons allotted to the ANSF and ANP. Those weapons, as well as ammunition, had reportedly been sold by police and security officers to the Taliban.\n\nIn early 2015, the oversight committee for Ministry of Defence contracts uncovered a kickback scheme involving payment by the ministry of over $200 million to fuel contractors. After an investigation, the contracts were cancelled and senior ministry officials fired.\n\nIn May 2015, \"Newsweek\" reported that Taliban insurgents were buying U.S.-supplied weapons from Afghan forces. The Pentagon \"lost track of many of the 465,000 light weapons the U.S. supplied to Afghan security forces.\"\n\nHaroun Mir of Afghanistan's Center for Research and Policy Studies (ACRPS) and Business Integrity Network Afghanistan (BINA) noted in June 2015 that Hamid Karzai, Acting President of Afghanistan from 2001 to 2004 and President from 2004 to 2014, had been widely accused of perpetuating and initiating the corrupt economic system of the country through a patronage system that resembled a mafia. As a result, corruption is now considered an ingrained and accepted facet of Afghan culture, and is no longer seen as a taboo.\n\nIn a December 2012 speech, Karzai blamed corruption in Afghanistan on the countries that fund his government. \"Corruption in Afghanistan is a reality, a bitter reality,\" Karzai said. \"The part of this corruption that is in our offices is a small part: that is bribes. The other part of corruption, the large part, is hundreds of millions dollars that are not ours. We shouldn't blame ourselves for that. That part is from others and imposed on us.\" The \"Army Times\", reporting on the speech, noted that Karzai had aligned himself with populist stances against his own foreign allies, placing blame of the nation's problems on outsiders rather than his own government.\n\nOn February 10, 2013, Frank Vogl, author of \"Waging War on Corruption\", called the Karzai government \"a cesspool of corruption\" in which tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer money had been looted.\n\nBloomberg reported on April 30, 2013, that the CIA had funneled tens of millions of dollars in discreet payments to Karzai \"in suitcases, backpacks and shopping bags.\" Former CIA official Reuel Gerecht said that Karzai likely has a patronage system bolstered by a cash scheme, since it would not be maintainable without support from the Pashtuns. Vincent Cannistraro, a former CIA counterterrorism chief, said that given Karzai's poor relations with the US, the money is not being used in an efficient manner.\n\nIn July 2013, Joel Brinkley wrote in the \"Baltimore Sun\" that Karzai's government was attempting to levy a 1,000 USD customs fee on every U.S. vehicle operating in a non-combat role in and out of the country, and that Afghan troops had been blocking roads in expectation of payment. Brinkley, as well as other experts, have criticized Karzai's methods of extorting American personnel and investors while accepting their patronage and protection, since most of the military equipment in the nation serves to protect his government.\n\nIn July 2015, \"Philanthropy Daily\" noted that American journalist Sarah Chayes, who in 2002 founded a charity called Afghans for Civil Society in collaboration with Karzai's brother Qayum, had been so disturbed by how much of her charity went to payoffs and bribes to shadowy figures that she left the charity in 2005, thereafter becoming an advisor on Afghan corruption to Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Mike Mullen. Chayes was especially critical of corruption at the top levels of the Afghan government and Karzai family, which was known to US officials but ignored by them due to their focus of finalizing military campaigns rather than cleaning up the corrupt ring ruling the government. She went on to write a 2015 book, \"Thieves of State\", about official corruption.\n\nSIGAR has called corruption a major impediment to the process of stabilizing and reconstructing Afghanistan. \"Corruption is now widely acknowledged as having a significant impact on state building, development, and private sector growth in policy documents,\" stated the Asia Foundation in 2012. In 2013, Gen. John R. Allen, who at the time was in charge of international forces in Afghanistan, told President Obama that corruption is the greatest strategic and existential threat to the fledgling Afghan nation. Widespread corruption aids the insurgency because widens the gap between citizens and the ruling elite, an Integrity Watch official said in 2013, adding that the international community has not \"lived up to its international commitment ... to address corruption.\" A January 2014 report by Reuters stated that thousands of homeless Afghans were suffering because of corruption. \"The task-force meant to respond to emergencies has failed to distribute supplies and, in some provinces, money to transport it has gone missing,\" said the report. \"Elsewhere, warehouses have been emptied without Kabul's knowledge.\" One U.N. Official described the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation as a \"black hole.\"\n\nA 2014 Pentagon study said that \"corruption directly threatens the viability and legitimacy of the Afghan state,\" because it \"alienates key elements of the population, discredits the government and security forces, undermines international support, subverts state functions and rule of law, robs the state of revenue and creates barriers to economic growth.\" In February 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote, \"corruption alienates key elements of the population, discredits the government and security forces, undermines international support, subverts state functions and rule of law, robs the state of revenue, and creates barriers to economic growth.\" Corruption impacts the Afghan economy, national security, police ineffectiveness, and public faith in government institutions.\n\nIn a March 2015 article, Mary Beth Goodman and Trevor Sutton described corruption as the second most important threat to Afghanistan’s \"long-term security and economic development,\" the foremost threat being \"the Taliban insurgency in the country’s South and East.\" These two threats, they explained, are connected, government graft having caused \"deep frustration with the Western-backed regime in Kabul and undermined the integrity of the Afghan administration.\" Also, corruption has severely debilitated the nation's military and police and interrupted the supply of government services, foreign aid, and investment to those who need it, thus fueling the insurgency.\n\n\"Throughout the past 13 years,\" wrote Haroun Mir on June 24, 2015, \"high levels of corruption and bad governance have seriously thwarted the international community's efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Millions of dollars that were allocated for the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan were misused or wasted.\" Mir cited in particular \"the disappearance of $1 billion in the 2010 Kabul Bank scandal, in which a cohort of unscrupulous businessmen and politicians carried out a Ponzi scheme in the largest private Afghan bank.\"\n\nThe Afghan government formed the High Office for Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOOAC). One source notes, however, that \"in reality, the Afghans that currently run the country do not want to see the pipeline of money that flows from the donor nations to their Swiss or Dubai bank accounts interrupted. So this 'high office' really is not doing much to fix the corrupt situation in Kabul.\"\n\nAlthough the HOOAC purportedly has three basic functions, namely \"prevention, investigation and enforcement,\" it has no legal authority to perform investigations. Individual governmental departments are supposed to refer corruption cases to the Attorney General's Office (AGO) for investigation, whereupon the HOOAC is supposed to engage in follow-up work. One challenge to its work is that \"only 9% of Afghan homes own a computer and only one third of citizens understand basic governmental administrative procedures, making reporting bribes exceptionally difficult.\" The HOOAC \"lacks the requisite infrastructure to properly process the current levels of complaints. A study found that it \"was greatly understaffed, lacked experienced employees, suffered from in inadequate operational capacity and failed to meet international standards of independence from the rest of government as an oversight institution.\" Because of the corruption of the judiciary itself, many corruption cases are not properly adjudicated.\n\nOther local initiatives are Management Systems International (MSI) and Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA), a civil society organization. Former president Karzai appointed a childhood friend, Izzatullah Wassifif, as head of the Afghan anti-corruption agency. In 2007 it was revealed that he had spent 3½ years in a U.S. prison for drug trafficking. \"Almost no one is more corrupt than President Karzai,\" states one source. \"Although he will make passionate speeches about how corruption needs to be eliminated he continues to be the most corrupt official in Afghanistan. In addition, he condemns U.S. efforts to reduce corruption as an attempt to meddle in Afghan sovereign affairs. On the rare occasion that an Afghan official does try to fight corruption he will find himself quickly dismissed.\"\n\nThere have been many anti-corruption initiatives in Afghanistan, but the level of success has been uneven and unremarkable. Efforts have been made, for instance, to improve budget transparency. Formerly, the Ministry of Finance drafted the budget on its own; that is no longer the case, but more local involvement is necessary.\n\nIn 2008, Afghanistan ratified the U.N. Convention against Corruption, and Karzai established the High Office for Oversight and Anti-Corruption, or HOO.\n\nAccording to a UN report, Afghanistan \"made some tangible progress in reducing the level of corruption in the public sector\" between 2009 and 2012. In 2009, 59% had to pay at least one bribe to a public official; in 2012, that figure had dropped to 50%. Bribes to police officers dropped from 52% to 42% during the same period. At the same time, however, the frequency of bribery climbed from 4.7 to 5.6 bribes per bribe-payer and the average bribe rose from US$158 to US$214.\n\nAugust 2011 reports stated that the U.S. military, after spending a year investigating trucking contracts, had \"moved to stem the flow of contract money to Afghan insurgents, awarding at least 20 companies new contracts worth about $1 billion for military supply transport and suspending seven current contractors it found lacking in 'integrity and business ethics.'\" A senior military officer said, \"I think we’ve finally got our arms around this thing.\" Rep. John F. Tierney of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee expressed concern that the contracts lacked transparency and accountability ensuring any U.S. dollars are not being syphoned to corrupt officials, insurgents, the Taliban, drug traffickers, or anyone else considered the enemy. This alleged progress was purportedly the work of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force Shafafiyat, created by Gen. David Petraeus and headed by Brig. Gen. H. R. McMaster.\n\nA 2013 \"SIGAR\" report accused Afghanistan's Attorney General's Office of lacking \"the political will to prosecute high-level, corrupt officials\" and said that an \"atmosphere of paranoia prevails\" in the country. The report cited prosecutors' slowness to deal with the Kabul Bank scandal.\n\nIn a 2010 article in the \"New York Times\", in which he referred to Afghanistan as \"Corrupt-istan,\" Dexter Filkins cited the case of Fazel Ahmad Faqiryar, who had been fired as deputy attorney general for attempting to prosecute senior members of Karzai’s cabinet. Faqiryar criticized the Afghan legal system by stating that the laws of the country are meant only for the lower classes. Filkins described Faqiryar's ouster as exemplary of the lawlessness and lack of any rule of law that permeates Karzai's government, and the rest of Afghanistan's regional governments. Filkins quoted Afghan criticism of the US for working with Afghan officials known to be corrupt, and said that US commanders fear \"that taking down the biggest Afghan politicians could open a vacuum of authority ... that the Taliban could take advantage of.\" Filkins also noted that the firing of Faqiryar had made him a respected national icon.\n\nIn December 2011, Karzai demanded that the occupying coalition provide evidence against the Afghan Army’s former surgeon general, Gen. Ahmad Zia Yaftali, whom it wanted to prosecute. NATO had in fact provided evidence a year earlier that Yaftali had stolen medical drugs from Afghanistan's largest military hospital, which he was in charge of, totaling in the millions of dollars. It was noted that Afghan soldiers regularly died from minor infections at the hospital due to a lack of medicine, and their inability to pay bribes to the hospital's medical staff. Brig. Gen. McMaster, who ran the US inquiry, was outraged at Karzai's move, the Yaftali investigation having been a major part of the anti-corruption effort. \"Now it appeared as if an officer who was accused of letting his own soldiers die so he could enrich himself would never be tried.\"\n\nBoth President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, who took office in 2014, \"made anticorruption efforts a key component of their presidential campaigns.\"\n\nIn December 2014, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani dismissed the heads of the attorney's office, the oil, power, and customs departments and the director of education in Herat province. Ghani said that all of the officials except the chief attorney would be charged with corruption. These were the first major changes Ghani had made in a local administration since assuming power.\n\nWhen a scheme by local contractors to overcharge the Afghan government and U.S. taxpayers was revealed in January 2015, President Ghani fired the contractors without hesitation, voided the contract and launched an investigation. This was described as \"a total 180-degree turn from the way it was under Karzai.\"\n\nIn December 2014, Transparency International offered six recommendations to combat Afghan corruption. They included: Promote clean leadership in key institutions; Make the judiciary independent; Establish a best practice right to information regime; Establish an independent anti-corruption agency; Make asset declaration mandatory for all those who hold power; and Procurement transparency.\n\n\"Until now,\" wrote Haroun Mir in 2015, \"the Afghan government and the donor community have tried hard to curb corruption in the public sector. However, while politicians and public sector officials often benefit from corruption, the main perpetrator is the private sector that bribes them.\" In Afghanistan, \"corruption at its highest level takes place because of collusion between political appointees and contractors from the business sector.\"\n\nTask Force Shafafiyat (or Task Force Transparency), more officially known as Combined Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – Shafafiyat, was established by General Petreaus to combat corruption.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Coordination Group was set up by the U.S. Embassy to develop strategies for reducing corruption.\n\nIn 2010, Petreaus founded Task Force 2010 \"to try to follow the money trail in an effort to ensure that money is spent properly. \" It later relocated from Afghanistan to a Qatar air base.\n\nThe Special Investigator General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) \"is supposed to conduct audits of reconstruction projects and attempt to recover any US taxpayer funds.\" Originally ineffective, owing to \"shoddy record keeping and poorly maintained databases,\" it has since improved in efficiency, becoming \"a true 'watchdog'\" that provides excellent reports.\n\nThe International Contract Corruption Task Force (ICCTF) is an interagency organization formed in 2006 with the help of the FBI to help battle the \"immense\" level of crime among U.S. contracting officials. Its members include the FBI, DCIS, SIGAR, MPFU, NCIS, and the IG offices of State and USAID.\n\nThe Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC), founded in 2009, combats illicit financial networks and provides other US agencies with financial expertise and intelligence.\n\nA July 2012 report on \"NPR\" stated that while \"U.S. officials consider widespread corruption one of the main barriers to a stable Afghanistan,\" Seth Jones, a former advisor to the U.S. command in Afghanistan, stated that \"when it came to specific, concrete, sustained efforts to target and reduce corruption within the Afghan government,\" U.S. officials did not have the necessary resolve.\n\nIn March 2015, Mary Beth Goodman and Trevor Sutton called on the U.S. to help Afghanistan increase accountability and transparency and lower corruption and graft. While eliminating corruption in Afghanistan is no simple task, Goodman and Sutton stated in March 2015 \"it could be significantly reduced, and even modest improvements in public accountability will substantially enhance the legitimacy of the new government.\"\n\nJohn Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said in 2013 that US government bureaucrats had ordered him to cease from publishing damning audits that noted a myriad of corruption cases in Afghanistan, preferring instead to keep them guarded from the public.\n\n\"The Washington Times\" reported in September 2013 that a U.S. government public-health program in Afghanistan might have wasted $190 million owing to a \"high risk of waste, fraud and abuse,\" and that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was still providing \"millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in direct assistance with little assurance\" that those funds were being spent properly. The Times cited a SIGAR report stating that \"USAID has ignored repeated warnings about waste\" at the Afghan Ministry of Public Health.\n\nIn May 2014, John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR), told a meeting at the Middle East Institute that corruption was the \"big issue\" in Afghanistan and that the US wasn't doing enough to combat it. He said commanders in the field had told him \"corruption is more serious in Afghanistan than the insurgency\" and explained that \"the patronage system and the failure to prosecute people guilty of gross fraud and abuse is undermining the Afghan economy and putting future development efforts at risk.\"\n\nAn October 2014 report by SIGAR noted that the US Army was ignoring \"multiple calls for it to stop doing business with Afghans who are known to support the country’s insurgency.\" SIGAR noted that U.S. reconstruction projects had \"helped Afghans grow large quantities of opium-poppy plants. SIGAR head John F. Sopko said he was \"troubled by the fact that our government can and does use classified information to arrest, detain, and even kill individuals linked to the insurgency in Afghanistan, but apparently refuses to use the same classified information to deny those same individuals their right to obtain contracts with the U.S. government.\" The report stated that \"U.S. government contractors tied to the insurgency have even gained access to coalition facilities and bases, despite being made aware of these vulnerabilities by SIGAR.\" For example, in 2013 \"one contractor clearly identified as providing explosives to the Afghan insurgency was permitted access to a Coalition-controlled facility.\"\n\nThe Kabul Bank, established in 2004 by Khalilullah Ferozi and Sherkhan Farnood, was Afghanistan's first private bank. From the beginning, it was criticized as resembling a Ponzi scheme. It lent money to the nation's elite, who did not repay the loans. In an editorial \"The Guardian\" accused Ferozi of causing the most damage to Afghanistan besides the Taliban.\n\nFerozi and Farnood curried favor with President Karzai's family, whereupon the Afghan government put Kabul Bank in charge of the payroll accounts for all of the nation's civil servants, soldiers, and police officers. One of Karzai's brothers, Mahmoud Karzai, became the bank's third-biggest shareholder. The bank put $4 million into Karzai's 2009 re-election campaign, and in return got 430,000 government accounts.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", Ferozi and Farnood drained \"the savings of thousands of depositors totalling $579m (£359m) in a binge of insider lending by the bank's politically powerful shareholders. Because there was never any obligation to pay any interest on these 'loans', the total unaccounted sum is $910m. In a country where GDP is just $12bn, that is an extraordinary figure.\" The scandal destroyed confidence in the public banking system, and dried up many foreign-aid payments.\n\nThe amount spent by the government to bail out the bank totaled between 5% and 6% of Afghanistan’s entire GDP.\n\nIn November 2015, it was reported that Ferozi, who was supposed to be serving a term in Pul-i-Charkhi prison for his role in defrauding the Kabul Bank of nearly $1 billion, had signed a new contract with the Afghan government for a massive real-estate development in Kabul called Smart City. He was now serving his sentence at night, reflecting an apparent unwillingness on the part of the Afghan government to address corruption at the highest level. International donors and the International Monetary Fund had made Ferozi's prosecution a mandatory condition for further aid to Afghanistan.\n\nOne Western official stated that the prison arrangement with Ferozi and the government's new business involvement with him sent a message that embezzlement on a grand enough scale will result in no incarceration. Yama Torabi, a member of Afghanistan's anti-corruption committee, said that these developments perpetuated a culture of kleptocracy and signaled that any official can loot the Afghan budget, while anyone can invest with no questions asked.\n\nA 2013 report by the \"Daily Beast\" stated that Mahkdoom Raheen, formerly a democracy-supporting professor who became Minister of Information and Culture under Karzai, a close friend, had engaged in massive corruption. After Indian philanthropist Madanjeet Singh donated $1 million to rehabilitate Kabul’s Cultural Heritage Center and train art preservationists, Raheen embezzled nearly all of Singh’s donation, depositing it in a personal account that was not discovered until after Raheen's 2006 resignation from the ministry after allegations of \"corruption, nepotism, mismanagement, and promoting Iranian cultural interests in Afghanistan.\" Despite the allegations, Karzai named Raheen ambassador to India. Observers criticized the comfort leaders hold for corruption culture within the government. After Karzai's 2009 re-election, Raheen was once again named Minister of Information and Culture. A former senior culture ministry official, Zia Bumia, questioned how grand corruption is by ministers connected to warlords and drug lords when an academic is embezzling funds. In 2013, he was charged with involvement in illegally appropriating at least 59 cultural and historical artifacts but told the \"Daily Beast\" that he had been cleared of the charge. He was also accused of helping Ahmad Shah Sultani, a reputed art trafficker, found a Kabul museum that is suspected of being a front for illegally acquired cultural artifacts to traffic on the black market, at the benefit of Sultani and Raheen.\n\nIt was reported in August 2012 that Finance Minister Hazarat Omar Zakhilwal, who had been lauded for his integrity, had embezzled over $1 million and deposited it in Canadian bank accounts. Afghanistan's High Office of Oversight and Anti-corruption chief, Dr. Azizullah Ludin, said he would investigate.\n\nIn May 2013, the \"Daily Beast\" reported on a session of the Afghan Parliament at which Zakhilwal, who was being impeached for corruption, charged several M.P.s with corruption. Haji Zaher Qadeer was accused of smuggling $269 million worth of flour from Pakistan; Haji Hamid Lalai had sought official processing for almost 2000 illegal vehicles; other M.P.s were charged with smuggling oil tankers and alcohol, with pressuring Zakhilwal to hire their relatives as customs officials, and with exercising undue influence on supply contracts. In the end, Zakhilwal kept his position. The story noted that international aid and military organizations encourage corruption by giving contracts to businesses illegally owned by MPs.\n\nIn October 2015, Drago Kos, Afghanistan's chief international corruption watchdog, resigned, complaining that the government's corruption efforts were not serious. \"With the exception of some sporadic activities, in one year since the new president and the C.E.O. took positions, I could not see any systemic action against endemic corruption in the country,\" said Kos, a member of the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. Kos stated that there was never any political support at any point in his efforts and cited a lack of will to combat corruption.\n\nOn January 30, 2013, the \"New York Times\" reported that a move by the US military to blacklist an Afghan airline, Kam Air, because of accusations of drug smuggling had caused diplomatic pressure with a Karzai spokesman, Aimal Faizi, demanding evidence of guilt.\n\n"}
{"id": "1966714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966714", "title": "Defaka language", "text": "Defaka language\n\nDefaka is an endangered and divergent Nigerian language of uncertain classification. It is spoken in the Bonny LGA of Rivers State. The low number of Defaka speakers, coupled with the fact that other languages dominate the region where Defaka is spoken, edges the language near extinction on a year-to-year basis. It is generally classified in an Ijoid branch of the Niger–Congo family. However, the Ijoid proposal is problematic. Blench (2012) notes that \"Defaka has numerous external cognates and might be an isolate or independent branch of Niger–Congo which has come under Ịjọ influence.\"\n\nEthnically, the Defaka people are distinct from the Nkoroo, but they have assimilated to Nkoroo culture to such a degree that their language seems to be the only sign of a distinct Defaka identity. Use of the Defaka language however is quickly receding in favour of the language of the Nkoroo. Nowadays, most Defaka speakers are elderly people, and even among these, Defaka is rarely spoken — the total number of Defaka speakers is at most 200 nowadays (SIL/Ethnologue 15th ed.). The decrease in use of Defaka is stronger in Nkoroo town than in the Iwoma area. Since the language communities between Defaka and Nkoroo are so intertwined, it is hard to determine which language influences the other. All children grow up speaking Nkoroo (an Ijo language) as a first language. The next most used language among the Defaka is Igbo, owing to the political influence of the Opobo since the days of the Oil Rivers Trade. Igbo has been a language of instruction in many schools in the region and still functions as a regional trade language.\n\nThe Defaka language shows many lexical similarities with Ijọ, some shared regular sound correspondences and some typological similarities with proto-Ịjọ. For example, both languages have a subject–object–verb basic word order, which is otherwise extremely rare in the Niger–Congo language family, being found only in the Mande and Dogon branches.\nAlso, Defaka has a sex-gender system distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and neuter 3rd-person singular pronouns; this is once again a rarity among south-central Niger–Congo languages other than Ịjoid and Defaka.\nWhile some of the lexical and maybe typological similarities can be attributed to borrowing (as Defaka has been in close contact with Ijọ for more than 300 years), the sound correspondences point to a (somewhat distant) genealogical relationship.\n\nNearly all Defaka are bilingual in Nkọrọọ, and the phonology appears to be the same as that language.\n\nDefaka has two tones, and . On long vowels and diphthongs, as well as disyllabic words, and contours occur. In addition, there is a downstep that may appear between high tones, and which is the remnant of an elided low tone. However, Shryock et al. were not able to measure significant differences in the pitch traces of , , and –downstep–, all of which have a falling pitch, suggesting that there may be fewer distinctive word tones than the combinations of syllable tones would suggest. However, these all clearly contrast with level-pitched and rising-pitched .\n\nThe Ijoid vowel harmony has collapsed in Defaka, as it has in Nkọrọọ. There are seven oral vowels, , though and are uncommon. There are five nasal vowels, . All may occur long. Long vowels are at least twice as long as short vowels.\n\nMost voiceless obstruents are tenuis. However, has a slightly negative voice onset time. That is, voicing commences somewhat before the consonant is released, as in English \"voiced\" stops such as \"b.\" This is typical of labial-velar stops. , on the other hand, is fully voiced, as are the other voiced obstruents. Shryock et al. analyse the prenasalised stops as consonant clusters with . varies with , with some speakers using one, some the other, and some either, depending on the word.\n\nThe velar plosives & may be lenited to or between vowels.\n\nThe tap is pronounced as an approximant, , by some speakers. It only occurs between vowels and at the ends of words.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1271411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1271411", "title": "Federal Bureau of Prisons", "text": "Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is a United States federal law enforcement agency. A subdivision of the U.S. Department of Justice, the BOP is responsible for the administration of the federal prison system. The system handles inmates who have violated, or are accused of violating, federal law. The BOP also holds inmates who have committed felonies in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe BOP is also responsible for carrying out all judicially ordered federal executions (other than those carried out under military law) in the United States.\n\nCurrently, the Bureau of Prisons is headed by Hugh Hurwitz, who is the current acting director. Mark S. Inch held the post from September 2017 until May 2018.\n\nThe Federal Prison System existed for more than 30 years before the BOP was established. Although its wardens functioned almost autonomously, the Superintendent of Prisons, a Department of Justice official in Washington, was nominally in charge of federal prisons, starting with the passage of the \"Three Prisons Act' in 1891, which authorized the federal government's first three penitentiaries: USP Leavenworth, USP Atlanta, and USP McNeil Island with limited supervision by the United States Department of Justice afterwards.\n\nUntil 1907, prison matters were handled by the Justice Department's General Agent. The General Agent was responsible for Justice Department accounts, oversight of internal operations, and certain criminal investigations, as well as prison operations. In 1907, the General Agent's office was abolished, and its functions were distributed among three new offices: the Division of Accounts (which evolved into the Justice Management Division); the Office of the Chief Examiner (which later evolved by 1908, into the Bureau of Investigation, and later by the early 1920s into the Federal Bureau of Investigation); and the Office of the Superintendent of Prisons and Prisoners, later called the Superintendent of Prisons (which then evolved by 1930 into the Bureau of Prisons).\nPursuant to , the Bureau of Prisons was established by the U.S. Congress within the U.S. Department of Justice (which itself was created in 1870, to be headed by the Attorney General, whose office was first established in the first Presidential Cabinet under President Washington and created in 1789, along with the Secretaries of State, Treasury and War). The new Prison Bureau was now under the Administration of the 31st President Herbert Hoover, (1874–1964), and was charged with the \"management and regulation of all Federal penal and correctional institutions.\" This responsibility covered the administration of the 11 federal prisons in operation at the time. By the end of the year 1930, the system had already expanded to 14 institutions with 13,000 inmates. By a decade later in 1940, the federal prison system had 24 institutions with 24,360 incarcerated.\n\nThe state of Alaska assumed jurisdiction over its corrections on January 3, 1959, using the Alaska Department of Corrections. Prior to statehood, the BOP had correctional jurisdiction over Alaska.\n\nAs a result of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and subsequent legislation which pushed for longer sentences, less judicial discretion, and more harsh sentences for drug-related offenses, the federal inmate population doubled in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. The population increase has decelerated since the early 2000s but the federal inmate population continues to grow.\n\nNational Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 transferred responsibility for adult felons convicted of violating District of Columbia laws to the BOP.\n\nIn August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions named retired Maj. Gen. Mark S. Inch as the BOP's new director. \n\nAs of 2015, 63% of BOP employees are white, 22% are black, 12% are Hispanic, 2% are Asian and 1% identify as another race. 73% are male.\n\nAll BOP employees undergo 200 hours of formal training in their first year of employment. Employees must also complete additional 120 hours of training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.\n\nThere is roughly one corrections officer for every 10 prisoners.\n\nThe BOP has five security levels. Federal Prison Camps (FPCs), the BOP minimum-security facilities, feature a lack of or a limited amount of perimeter fencing, and a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio. Low-security Federal Correctional Institutions (FCIs) have double-fenced perimeters, and inmates live in mostly cubicle or dormitory housing. Medium-security FCIs and some United States Penitentiaries (USPs) are classified to hold medium-security inmates. The medium facilities have strengthened perimeters, which often consist of double fences with electronic detection systems. Medium-security facilities mostly have cell housing. Most U.S. Penitentiaries are classified as high-security facilities. The perimeters, highly secured, often have reinforced fences or walls. Federal Correctional Complexes (FCCs) are co-locations of BOP facilities with different security levels and/or genders. Some units have small, minimum-security camps, known as \"satellite camps,\" adjacent to the main facilities. Twenty-eight BOP institutions hold female inmates.\n\n, US federal prisons currently hold approximately 183,000 inmates in 122 facilities. This is a substantial decrease from 2013.\n\nAs of 2018, 25% of federal inmates were white, 27% were Hispanic and 38% are black; 93% are male.\n\nAlso as of 2018, 75% of federal inmates were between the ages of 26 and 50.\n\nAs of October 2016, 46% of the inmates were incarcerated for committing drug crimes.\n\nAs of August 2013, of the male inmates, 15% were housed in the Northeast, 19% were housed in the Southeast, 16% were housed in the Mid-Atlantic region, 12% were housed in the North Central region, 24% were housed in the South Central region, and 13% were housed in the Western region. Of the female inmates, 9% were housed in the Northeast, 22% were housed in the Southeast, 17% were housed in the Mid-Atlantic region, 11% were housed in the North Central region, 23% were housed in the South Central region, and 18% were housed in the Western region.\n\nAs of August 2013, of the male inmates, 13% received sentences while being in the Northeast, 10% of men received them in the Southeast, 11% received them in the Mid-Atlantic region, 12% received them in the North Central region, 28% received them in the South Central region, and 26% were sentenced in the Western region. Of the female inmates, 13% received sentences while being in the Northeast, 13% of women received them in the Southeast, 13% received them in the Mid-Atlantic region, 14% received them in the North Central region, 26% received them in the South Central region, and 22% were sentenced in the Western region.\n\nThe BOP receives all prisoner transfer treaty inmates sent from foreign countries, even if their crimes would have been, if committed in the United States, tried in state, DC, or territorial courts.\n\nAs of 2015, 27 BOP facilities house women. The BOP has a Mothers and Infants Nurturing Together (MINT) program for women who enter the BOP as inmates while pregnant. The BOP pays for abortion only if it is life-threatening for the woman, but it may allow for abortions in non-life-threatening cases if non-BOP funds are used.\n\nWith the 2014 repurposing of FCI Danbury for men, female inmates in the Northeast no longer had a prison in their region, and the imbalance of female inmates in regards to their locations in the BOP increased.\n\nIn 2017, four senators of the Democratic Party, including Kamala Harris, introduced a bill explicitly requiring tampons and pads to be free of cost for female prisoners. In August of that year, the BOP introduced a memorandum requiring free tampons and pads. The previous 1996 memorandum stated \"products for female hygiene needs shall be available\" without requiring them to be free of charge.\n\nA 2018 review conducted by the Evaluation and Inspections Division, Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice, found the Bureau's programming\nand policy decisions did not fully consider the needs of female inmates in the areas of trauma treatment programming, pregnancy programming, and feminine hygiene.\n\n typically juveniles sent into BOP custody are between 17 and 20, must have been under 18 at the time of the offense and had been convicted of sex-related offenses. This is because the most severe crimes committed on Indian Reservations are usually taken to federal court. According to the BOP, most of the juveniles it receives had committed violent crimes and had \"an unfavorable history of responding to interventions and preventive measures in the community.\" As of that year most federal juvenile inmates were from Arizona, Montana, South Dakota, and the District of Columbia (in no particular order).\n\nThe BOP contracts with facilities that house juvenile offenders. Title 18 U.S.C. 5039 specifies that \"No juvenile committed, whether pursuant to an adjudication of delinquency or conviction for an offense, to the custody of the Attorney General may be placed or retained in an adult jail or correctional institution in which he has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges.\" The definition includes secure facilities and community-based correctional facilities. Federally sentenced juveniles may be moved into federal adult facilities at certain points; juveniles sentenced as adults are moved into adult facilities when they turn 18. Juveniles sentenced as juveniles are moved into adult facilities when they turn 21.\n\nThe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 reinstituted the federal death penalty. On July 19, 1993, the federal government designated the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute in Indiana as the site where male federal inmates sentenced to death would be held and where federal inmates of both genders would be executed. The Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Texas holds the female inmates who have been sentenced to death.\n\nSome male death row inmates are instead held at ADX Florence.\n\nAs of 2018, 57 inmates are slated for death row.\n\nParole was abolished for federal inmates in 1987 and inmates must serve at least 85% of their original sentence before being considered for good-behavior release. In addition, the extremely strict sentencing guidelines present today were adopted in response to rising crime rates in the 1980s and early 1990s, especially for drug-related offenses. US violent crime has dropped since then, but some analysts and activists believe that other factors played a much more significant part in falling crime rates. In addition, they hold that strict federal sentencing guidelines have led to overcrowding and needlessly incarcerated thousands of non-violent drug offenders who would be better served by drug treatment programs.\n\nThe yearly increases in the federal inmate population have raised concerns from criminal justice experts and even among DOJ officials themselves. Michael Horowitz, the DOJ Inspector General, wrote a memorandum concerning this issue:\n\nFirst, despite a slight decrease in the total number of federal inmates in fiscal year (FY) 2014, the Department projects that the costs of the federal prison system will continue to increase in the years ahead, consuming a large share of the Department’s budget.\n\nSecond, federal prisons remain significantly overcrowded and therefore face a number of important safety and security issues.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "68997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68997", "title": "Fernando Collor de Mello", "text": "Fernando Collor de Mello\n\nFernando Affonso Collor de Mello (; born August 12, 1949) is a Brazilian politician who served as the 32nd President of Brazil from 1990 to 1992, when he resigned in a failed attempt to stop his impeachment trial by the Brazilian Senate. Collor was the first President directly elected by the people after the end of the Brazilian military government. He became the youngest president in Brazilian history, taking office at the age of 40. After he resigned from the presidency, the impeachment trial on charges of corruption continued. Collor was found guilty by the Senate and disqualified from holding elected office for eight years (1992–2000). He was later acquitted of ordinary criminal charges in his judicial trial before Brazil's Supreme Federal Court, for lack of valid evidence.\n\nFernando Collor was born into a political family. He is the son of the former Senator and Leda Collor (daughter of former Labour Minister Lindolfo Collor, led by his father, former governor of Alagoas and proprietor of the Arnon de Mello Organization, the branch of Rede Globo in the state.\n\"Collor\" is a Portuguese adaptation of the German surname Koehler, from his maternal grandfather Lindolfo Leopoldo Boeckel Collor.\n\nCollor has served as Senator for Alagoas since February 2007. He first won election in 2006 and was reelected in 2014.\n\nCollor became president of Brazilian football club Centro Sportivo Alagoano (CSA) in 1976. After entering politics, he was successively named mayor of Alagoas' capital Maceió in 1979 (National Renewal Alliance Party), elected a federal deputy (Democratic Social Party) in 1982, and eventually elected governor of the small Northeastern state of Alagoas (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party) in 1986.\n\nDuring his term as governor, he attracted publicity by allegedly fighting high salaries for public servants, whom he labeled \"marajás\" (\"maharajas\") (likening them to the former princes of India who received a stipend from the government as compensation for relinquishing their lands). How well his policies reduced public expense is disputed, but the political position certainly made him popular in the country. This helped boost his political career, with the help of television appearances in nationwide broadcasts (quite unusual for a governor from such a small state).\n\nIn 1989 Collor defeated Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in a controversial two-round presidential race with 35 million votes. \nIn December 1989, days prior to the second round, businessman Abílio Diniz was the victim of a sensational political kidnapping. The act is recognized as an attempt to sabotage Lula's chances of victory by associating the kidnapping with the left wing. At the time, Brazilian law barred any party from addressing the media on the days prior to election day. Lula's party thus had no opportunity to clarify the accusations that the party (PT) was involved in the kidnapping. Collor won in the state of São Paulo against many prominent political figures. The first popularly elected President of Brazil in 29 years, Collor spent the early years of his government allegedly battling inflation, which at times reached rates of 25% per month.\n\nThe very day he took office, Collor launched the \"Plano Collor\" (\"Collor Plan\"), implemented by his finance minister Zélia Cardoso de Mello (not related to Collor). The plan attempted to reduce the money supply by forcibly converting large portions of consumer bank accounts into non-cashable government bonds, while at the same time increasing the printing of money bills, a counterbalancing measure to combat hyper-inflation.\n\nUnder Zélia's tenure, Brazil had a period of major changes, featuring what ISTOÉ magazine called an \"unprecedented\" \"revolution\" in many levels of public administration: \"privatization, opening its market to free trade, encouraging industrial modernization, temporary control of the hyper-inflation and public debt reduction.\"\n\nIn the month before Collor took power, hyperinflation was 90 percent per month and climbng. All accounts over 50,000 Cruzeiros (about US$500 at that time), were frozen for several weeks. He also proposed freezes in wages and prices, as well as major cuts in government spending. The measures were received unenthusiastically by the people, though many felt that radical measures were necessary to kill the hyperinflation. Within a few months, however, inflation resumed, eventually reaching rates of 10 percent a month.\n\nDuring the course of his government, Collor was accused of condoning an influence peddling scheme. The accusations weighed on the government and led Collor and his team to an institutional crisis leading to a loss of credibility that reached the finance minister, Zélia.\n\nThis political crisis had negative consequences on his ability to carry out his policies and reforms. The \"Plano Collor I\", under Zélia would be renewed with the implementation of the \"Plano Collor II\"; the government's loss of prestige would make that follow-up plan short-lived and largely ineffective. The failure of Zélia and Plano Collor I led to their substitution by Marcílio Marques Moreira and his Plano Collor II. Moreira's plan tried to correct some aspects of the first plan, but it was too late. Collor's administration was paralyzed by the fast deterioration of his image, through a succession of corruption accusations.\n\nDuring the Plano Collor, yearly inflation was at first reduced from 30,000 percent in 1990 (Collor's first year in government) to 400 percent in 1991, but then climbed back up to 1,020 percent in 1992 (when he left office). Inflation continued to rise to 2,294 percent in 1994 (two years after he left office).\nAlthough Zélia acknowledged later that the Plano Collor didn't end inflation, she also stated: \"It is also possible to see with clarity that, under very difficult conditions, we promoted the balancing of the national debt – and that, together with the commercial opening, it created the basis for the implementation of the Plano Real.\"\n\nPart of Collor's more conservative program was followed by his successors: Itamar Franco, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Lula da Silva. Collor's administration privatized 15 different companies (including Acesita), and began the process of privatization for others, such as Embraer, Telebrás and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. Some members of Collor's government were also part of the later Cardoso administration in different or similar functions: \nLuiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, a minister in the previous Sarney and the following Fernando Henrique Cardoso administrations, stated that \"Collor changed the political agenda in the country, because he implemented brave and very necessary reforms, and he pursued fiscal adjustments. Although other attempts had been made since 1987, it was during Collor's administration that old statist ideas were confronted and combated (...) by a brave agenda of economic reforms geared towards free trade and privatization.\"\nAccording to Philippe Faucher, professor of political science at McGill University, the combination of the political crisis and the hyperinflation continued to reduce Collor's credibility and in that political vacuum an impeachment process took place, precipitated by Pedro Collor's (Fernando Collor's brother) accusations and other social and political sectors which thought they would be harmed by his policies.\n\nIn 1991, UNICEF chose three health programs: community agents, lay midwives and eradication of measles as the best in the world. These programs were promoted during Collor's administration. Until 1989, the Brazilian vaccination record, was considered the worst in South America. During Collor's administration, Brazil's vaccination program won a United Nations prize, as the best in South America. Collor's project \"Minha Gente\" (\"My People\") won the UN award \"Project Model for the Humanity\" in 1993.\n\nIn May 1992, Fernando Collor's brother Pedro Collor accused him of condoning an influence peddling scheme run by his campaign treasurer, Paulo César Farias. The Federal Police and the Federal Prosecution Service opened an investigation. On July 1, 1992, a Joint Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, composed of Senators and members of the Chamber of Deputies, formed in Congress to investigate the accusation and review the evidence uncovered by police and federal prosecutors. Senator was chosen as the rapporteur of the Commission of Inquiry, chaired by Congressman . Farias, Pedro Collor, government officials and others were subpoenaed and gave depositions before it. Some weeks later, with the investigation progressing and under fire, Collor asked on national television for the people's support in going out in the street and protesting against \"coup\" forces. On August 11, 1992, thousands of students organized by the National Student Union (União Nacional dos Estudantes – UNE), protested on the street against Collor. Their faces, often painted in a mixture of the colors of the flag and protest-black, lead to them being called \"\"Caras-pintadas\" (\"Painted Faces\"\").\n\nOn August 26, 1992, the final congressional inquiry was approved 16-5. The report concluded that there was proof that Fernando Collor had had personal expenses paid for by money raised by Paulo César Farias through his influence peddling scheme.\n\nAs a result, a petition to the Chamber of Deputies by citizens Barbosa Lima Sobrinho and Marcelo Lavenère Machado, respectively the then President of the Brazilian Press Association and the then-president of the Brazilian Bar Association formally accused Collor of \"crimes of responsibility\" (the Brazilian equivalent of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\", such as abuse of power) warranting removal from office per the constitutional and legal norms for impeachment. In Brazil, a formal petition for impeachment of the President must be submitted by one or more private citizens, not by corporations or public institutions.\n\nThe formal petition, submitted on September 1, 1992, began impeachment proceedings. The Chamber of Deputies set up a special committee on September 3, 1992 to study the impeachment petition. On September 24, 1992, the committee voted (32 votes in favour, one vote against, one abstention) to approve the impeachment petition and recommend that the full Chamber of Deputies accept the charges of impeachment. Under the Constitution of Brazil, the impeachment process required two thirds of the Chamber of Deputies to vote to allow the charges of impeachment to be escalated to the Senate. On September 29, 1992, Collor was impeached by the Chamber of Deputies, with more than two thirds of its members concurring. In the decisive roll call vote, 441 deputies voted for and 38 deputies voted against the admission of the charges of impeachment.\nSeptember 30, 1992, the accusation was formally sent from the Chamber of Deputies to the Senate, and proceedings for impeachment began in the upper house. The Senate formed a committee to examine the case file and determine whether all legal formalities had been followed. The Committee issued its report, recognizing that the charges of impeachment had been presented in accordance with the Constitution and the laws, and proposed that the Senate organize itself into a court of impeachment to conduct the trial of the president. October 1, 1992, this report was presented on the floor of the Senate, and the full Senate voted to accept it and to proceed. That day the then-president of the Federal Supreme Court, Justice , was notified of the opening of the trial process in the Senate, and began to preside over the process. On October 2, 1992, Collor received a formal summons from the Brazilian Senate notifying him that the Senate had accepted the report, and that he was now a defendant in an impeachment trial. Per the Constitution of Brazil, upon receipt of that writ of summons, Collor's presidential powers were suspended for 180 days, and vice president Itamar Franco became acting president. The Senate also sent an official communication to the office of the vice-president to formally acquaint him of the suspension of the President, and to give him notice that he was now the acting president.\n\nBy the end of December, it was obvious that Collor would be convicted and removed from office by the Senate. In hopes of staving this off, Collor resigned on December 29, 1992 on the last day of the proceedings. Collor's resignation letter was read by his attorney in the floor of the Senate, and the impeachment trial was adjourned so that the Congress could meet in joint session, first to take formal notice of the resignation and proclaim the office of President vacant, and then to swear in Franco as president.\n\nHowever, the Senate resumed sitting as a court of impeachment with the president of the Supreme Court presiding. Collor's attorneys argued that with Collor's resignation, the impeachment trial could not proceed and should close without ruling on the merits. The attorneys arguing for Collor's removal, however, argued that the trial should continue, to determining whether or not the defendant should face the constitutional penalty of suspension of political rights for eight years. The Senate voted to continue the trial. It ruled that, although the possible penalty of removal from office had been rendered moot, the determination of the former President's guilt or innocence was still relevant because a conviction on charges of impeachment would carry with it a disqualification from holding public office for eight years. The Senate found that, since the trial had already begun, the defendant could not use his right to resign the presidency as a means to avoid a ruling.\nLater, in the early hours of December 30, 1992, by the required two-thirds majority, the Senate found the former president guilty of the charges of impeachment. Of the 81 members of the Senate, 79 took part in the final vote: 76 Senators voted to convict the former president, and 3 voted to acquit. The penalty of removal from office was not imposed as Collor had already resigned, but as a result of his conviction the Senate barred Collor from holding public office for eight years. After the vote, the Senate issued a formal written opinion summarizing the conclusions and orders resulting from the judgement, as required by Brazilian law. The Senate's formal written sentence on the impeachment trial, containing its conviction of the former president and disqualification from public office for eight years, signed by the president of the Supreme Court and by the Senators on December 30, 1992, was published in the \"Diário Oficial da União\" (the Brazilian Federal Government's official journal) on December 31, 1992.\n\nIn 1993, Collor challenged before the Brazilian Supreme Court the Senate's decision to continue the trial after his resignation but the Supreme Court ruled the Senate's action valid.\n\nIn 1994, the Supreme Court tried the ordinary criminal charges stemming from the Farias corruption affair; the ordinary criminal accusation was presented by the Brazilian federal prosecution service (\"Ministério Público Federal\"). The Supreme Court had original jurisdiction under the Brazilian Constitution because Collor was one of the defendants and the charges mentioned crimes committed by a President while in office. If found guilty of the charges, the former President would face a jail sentence. However, Collor was found not guilty. The Federal Supreme Court threw out the corruption charges against him on a technicality, citing a lack of evidence linking Collor to Farias' influence-peddling scheme. A key piece of evidence, Paulo César Farias' personal computer, was ruled inadmissible as it had been obtained during an illegal police search conducted without a search warrant. Other pieces of evidence that were only gathered because of the information first extracted from files stored in Farias' computer were also voided, as the Collor defense successfully invoked the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine before the Brazilian Supreme Court. Evidence that was only obtained because of the illegally obtained information was also struck from the record.\n\nAfter his acquittal in the criminal trial, Collor again attempted to void the suspension of his political rights imposed by the Senate, without success, as the Supreme Court ruled that the judicial trial of the ordinary criminal charges and the political trial of the charges of impeachment were independent spheres. Collor thus only regained his political rights in 2000, after the expiration of the eight year disqualification imposed by the Brazilian Senate.\n\nFor several years after his removal from office, Collor maintained a website which has since been taken offline. In discussing the events surrounding the corruption charges, the former website stated: \"After two and half years of the most intense investigation in Brazilian history, the Supreme Court of Brazil declared him innocent of all charges. Today he is the only politician in Brazil to have an officially clear record validated by an investigation by all interests and sectors of the opposition government. Furthermore, President Fernando Collor signed the initial document authorizing the investigation.\"\n\nIn 2000, Collor joined the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB) and ran for mayor of São Paulo. His candidacy was declared invalid by the electoral authorities, as his political rights were still suspended by the filing deadline. In 2002, with political rights restored, he ran for Governor of Alagoas, but lost to incumbent Governor , who was seeking reelection.\n\nIn 2006, Collor was elected to the Federal Senate representing his state of Alagoas, with 44.03% of the vote, running again against Lessa. The following year he abandoned PRTB and switched to the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). Collor has been, since March 2009, Chairman of the Senate Infrastructure Commission. Collor ran again for Governor of Alagoas in 2010. However, he lost the race, finishing a narrow third after Lessa and incumbent Teotonio Vilela Filho, thus eliminated from the runoff. This was Collor's second electoral loss.\n\nIn 2014, Collor was re-elected to the Senate with 55% of the vote.\n\nOn August 20, 2015, Collor was charged by the Prosecutor General of Brazil with corruption, as a development of Operation Car Wash (). Details of the charge were kept under wraps so as not to jeopardize the investigation. \n\nIn 2016 Collor abandoned PTB and joined the Christian Labour Party (PTC), a small christian democratic party which had no representatives in the Congress at the time. Collor also voted to impeach Rousseff as Senator.\n\nIn August 2017, Collor was accused by the Brazil's Supreme Federal Court of receiving around US$9 million in bribes between 2010 and 2014 from Petrobras subsidiary BR Distributor.\n\n\n"}

During the course of the Cold War, the ECHELON surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, although it is now used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the European Parliament and, to a lesser extent, the United States Congress. As part of efforts in the ongoing War on Terror since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the World Wide Web. The former NSA contractor Edward Snowden described the Five Eyes as a \"supra-national intelligence organisation that does not answer to the known laws of its own countries\". Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY have been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on surveillance of citizens.\n\nIn spite of continued controversy over its methods, the Five Eyes relationship remains one of the most comprehensive known espionage alliances in history.\n\nSince processed intelligence is gathered from multiple sources, the intelligence shared is not restricted to signals intelligence (SIGINT) and often involves defence intelligence as well as human intelligence (HUMINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT). The following table provides an overview of most of the FVEY agencies involved in such forms of data sharing.\n\nThe origins of the Five Eyes alliance can be traced back to the Atlantic Charter, which was issued in August 1941 to lay out the Allied goals for the post-war world. On 17 May 1943, the British–U.S. Communication Intelligence Agreement, also known as the BRUSA Agreement, was signed by the UK and U.S. governments to facilitate co-operation between the U.S. War Department and the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS). On 5 March 1946, the secret treaty was formalized as the UKUSA Agreement, which forms the basis for all signal intelligence cooperation between the NSA and the GCHQ to this day.\n\nIn 1948, the treaty was extended to include Canada, followed by Norway (1952), Denmark (1954), West Germany (1955), Australia (1956), and New Zealand (1956). These countries participated in the alliance as \"third parties\". By 1955, the formal status of the remaining Five Eyes countries was officially acknowledged in a newer version of the UKUSA Agreement that contained the following statement:\n\nThe \"Five Eyes\" term has its origins as a shorthand for a \"AUS/CAN/NZ/UK/US EYES ONLY\" (AUSCANNZUKUS) classification level.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the GCHQ and the NSA shared intelligence on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several eastern European countries (known as Exotics). Over the course of several decades, the ECHELON surveillance network was developed to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Australian and New Zealand operators in the Asia-Pacific region worked directly to support the United States, while GCHQ operators stationed in the (then) British colony of Hong Kong were tasked with monitoring North Vietnamese air defence networks. During the Falklands War, the British received intelligence data from its FVEY allies such as Australia, as well as from third parties such as Norway and France. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, a technician of the ASIS was used by SIS to bug Kuwaiti government offices.\n\nIn the 1950s, SIS and the CIA jointly orchestrated the overthrow of Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. In the 1960s, SIS and the CIA jointly orchestrated the assassination of the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba. In the 1970s, the ASIS and the CIA jointly orchestrated the overthrow of Chile's President Salvador Allende. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, SIS and the CIA took part in Operation Yellowbird to rescue dissidents from the Chinese regime.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the ECHELON surveillance network had evolved into a global system capable of sweeping up massive amounts of private and commercial communications, including telephone calls, fax, e-mail and other data traffic. This was done through the interception of communication bearers such as satellite transmission and public switched telephone networks.\n\nThe Five Eyes has two types of information collection methods: the PRISM program and the Upstream collection system. The PRISM program gathers user information from technology firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, while the Upstream system gathers information directly from the communications of civilians via fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past. In 1988, Duncan Campbell revealed in the \"New Statesman\" the existence of ECHELON, an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence [Sigint]. The story, 'Somebody's listening,' detailed how the eavesdropping operations were not only being employed in the interests of 'national security,' but were regularly abused for corporate espionage in the service of US business interests. The piece passed largely unnoticed outside of journalism circles.\nIn 1996, a detailed description of ECHELON was provided by New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager in a book titled \"Secret Power – New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network\", which was cited by the European Parliament in a 1998 report titled \"An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control\" (PE 168.184). On 16 March 2000, the Parliament called for a resolution on the Five Eyes and their ECHELON surveillance network, which, if passed, would have called for the \"complete dismantling of ECHELON\".\n\nThree months later, the Temporary Committee on ECHELON was set up by the European Parliament to investigate the ECHELON surveillance network. However, according to a number of European politicians such as Esko Seppänen of Finland, these investigations were hindered by the European Commission.\n\nIn the United States, congressional legislators warned that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor U.S. citizens. On 14 May 2001, the U.S. government cancelled all meetings with the Temporary Committee on ECHELON.\n\nAccording to a BBC report in May 2001, \"the US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the surveillance capabilities of the Five Eyes were greatly increased as part of the global War on Terror.\n\nDuring the run-up to the Iraq War, the communications of UN weapons inspector Hans Blix were monitored by the Five Eyes. The office of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was bugged by British agents. An NSA memo detailed plans of the Five Eyes to boost eavesdropping on UN delegations of six countries as part of a \"dirty tricks\" campaign to apply pressure on these six countries to vote in favour of using force against Iraq.\n\nSIS and the CIA forged a surveillance partnership with Libya's ruler Muammar Gaddafi to spy on Libyan dissidents in the West, in exchange for permission to use Libya as a base for extraordinary renditions.\n\n, the Five Eyes also have access to SIPRNet, the U.S. government's classified version of the Internet.\n\nIn 2013, documents leaked by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the existence of numerous surveillance programs jointly operated by the Five Eyes. The following list includes several notable examples reported in the media:\n\nIn March 2014, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Australia to stop spying on East Timor. This marks the first time that such restrictions are imposed on a member of the FVEY.\n\nIn recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on spying.\n\nAs a result of Snowden's disclosures, the FVEY alliance has become the subject of a growing amount of controversy in parts of the world:\n\nSince the addition of two members in 1956, the specific Five Eyes consist of Australia (accepted 1956), Canada (accepted 1948), New Zealand (accepted 1956), the United Kingdom (co-creator 1946), and the United States (co-creator 1946). Further, there is a group of nations termed '3rd Party Partners', which share their intelligence with the 5 Eyes.\n\nWhile the Five Eyes is a very specific agreement with specific operations amongst the five nations, other non-FVEY sharing agreements have been set up independently and for specific purposes. For example, according to Edward Snowden, the NSA has a \"massive body\" called the Foreign Affairs Directorate that is responsible for partnering with foreign countries.\n\nAccording to the news magazine \"L'Obs\", in 2009, the United States proposed to France to join the Five Eyes, that would then have become the \"Six Eyes\". Nicolas Sarkozy however made the requirement to be granted the same status as other allies, including the signing of a \"no-spy agreement\". This requirement was approved by the director of the NSA, but not by the director of the CIA, and furthermore not by President Barack Obama, resulting in a refusal from France.\n\nIn 2013 it was reported that Germany was interested in joining the Five Eyes alliance. At that time, several members of the United States Congress, including Tim Ryan and Charles Dent, were pushing for Germany's entrance to the Five Eyes alliance.\n\nIsrael is, reportedly, an observer in Five Eyes.\n\nSingapore is reported to have partnered with the Five Eyes.\n\n\nThe Nine Eyes is a different arrangement that consists of the same members of Five Eyes working with Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway.\n\n\nAccording to a document leaked by Edward Snowden, there is another working agreement amongst 14 nations officially known as SIGINT Seniors Europe, or \"SSEUR\". These \"14 Eyes\" consist of the same members of 9 Eyes plus Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden.\n\nAs spelled out by Privacy International, there are a number of issue-specific intelligence agreements that include some or all the above nations and numerous others, such as:\n\n\nAs the surveillance capabilities of the FVEY continue to increase to keep up to pace with technological advancements, a global surveillance system has been gradually developed to capture the communications of entire populations across national borders. The following list contains a handful of targets of the FVEY who are public figures in various fields. In order for a person to be included in the list, there must be well-documented evidence based on reliable sources, such as leaked or declassified documents or whistleblower accounts, which demonstrate that the person involved is, or was, intentionally targeted for FVEY surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2370357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2370357", "title": "Greek Muslims", "text": "Greek Muslims\n\nGreek Muslims, also known as Greek-speaking Muslims, are Muslims of Greek ethnic origin whose adoption of Islam (and often the Turkish language and identity) dates to the period of Ottoman rule in the southern Balkans. They consist primarily of the descendants of the elite Ottoman Janissary corps and Ottoman-era converts to Islam from Greek Macedonia (e.g., Vallahades), Crete (Cretan Muslims), northeastern Anatolia and the Pontic Alps (Pontic Greeks). They are currently found mainly in western Turkey (particularly the regions of Izmir, Bursa, and Edirne) and northeastern Turkey (particularly in the regions of Trabzon, Gümüşhane, Sivas, Erzincan, Erzurum, and Kars (see also Caucasus Greeks of Georgia and Kars Oblast and Islam in Georgia).\n\nDespite their ethnic Greek origin, the contemporary Grecophone Muslims of Turkey regarding their identity have been steadily assimilated into the Turkish-speaking (and in the northeast Laz-speaking) Muslim population. Apart from their elders, sizable numbers, even the young within these Grecophone Muslim communities have retained a knowledge of Greek and or its dialects such as Cretan Greek and Pontic Greek, though very few are likely to call themselves \"Greek Muslims\". This is due to gradual assimilation into Turkish society, as well as the close association of Greece and Greeks with Orthodox Christianity and their perceived status as a historic, military threat to the Turkish Republic. In Greece, Greek-speaking Muslims are not usually considered as forming part of the Greek nation. In the late Ottoman period (particularly following the Greco-Turkish war of 1897–98) several communities of Grecophone Muslims from Crete and southern Greece were also relocated to Libya, Lebanon and Syria, where in towns like al-Hamidiyah some of the older generation continue to speak Greek. Historically, Greek Orthodoxy has been associated with being Romios, i.e. Greek, and Islam with being Turkish, despite ethnic or linguistic references.\n\nMost Greek speaking Muslims in Greece left for Turkey during the 1920s population exchanges under the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations (sometimes in return for Turkish-speaking Christians such as the Karamanlides). Due to the historical role of the \"millet\" system, religion and not ethnicity or language was the main factor used during the exchange of populations. All Muslims who departed Greece were seen as \"Turks\", whereas all Orthodox people leaving Turkey were considered \"Greeks\", regardless of ethnicity or language. An exception was made for Muslims (Pomaks and Western Thrace Turks) in East Macedonia and Thrace, Northern Greece, who are officially recognized as a religious, but \"controversially\" not as an ethnic minority by the Greek Government.\n\nIn Turkey, where most Greek-speaking Muslims live, there are various groups of Grecophone Muslims, some autochthonous, some from parts of present-day Greece and Cyprus who migrated to Turkey under the population exchanges or immigration.\nAs a rule the Ottomans did not require the Greeks or any non-Islamic group to become Muslims and in fact discouraged it because the dhimmi paid more in tax through the jizya and could be exploited through acts like the devşirme (blood tax) which was one of the organized practices by which the Ottomans took boys from their Christian families, who were later converted to Islam with the aim of selecting and training the ablest of them for leading positions in the Ottoman society. However a large number of Greeks and Slavs became fake Muslims or fake Turks in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule. Conversion to Islam is quick and in the Ottoman Empire there were few documents showing who was or was not Muslim, the only requirements were knowing Turkish, saying you were Muslim and possibly getting circumcised. Greek has a specific word for becoming Muslim called \"τουρκεύω\" and the Slavic languages have turčiti, these practices of fake conversion were common and are a reason so many people in the Balkans have Turkish last names with endings like -oglu. As stated one of the main reason to convert were to avoid paying the jizya a (~ 20%) tax compared to the zakat which was a (~ 3%) tax. Another benefit converts received was that they could no longer be discriminated against in court as the Ottoman Empire had 2 separate court systems in which the Islamic court superseded the non-Islamic court and because non-Muslims were not allowed to be present in the Islamic court that basically resulted in an non-Islamic minority losing in court every time. Conversion allowed those to take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the millet system, which was closely linked to Islamic religious rules. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their confessional communities), rather than to their ethnic origins. Muslim communities prospered under the Ottoman Empire, and the Ottoman law did not recognize such notions as ethnicity and the Muslims of any ethnic background enjoyed precisely the same rights and privileges. Another major reason for converting to Islam was the well-organized taxation system based on religion. Major taxes were the Defter and İspençe and the more severe haraç whereby a document was issued which stated that \"the holder of this certificate is able to keep his head on the shoulders since he paid the Χαράτσι tax for this year...\" All these of course were waived if the person would convert and become Muslim. During the Greek War of Independence, Ottoman Egyptian troops under the leadership of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt ravaged the island of Crete and the Greek countryside of the Morea where the Muslim Egyptian soldiers enslaved vast numbers of Christian Greek children and women. Ibrahim arranged for the enslaved Greek children to be forcefully converted to Islam \"en masse\". The enslaved Greeks were subsequently transferred to Egypt where they were sold as slaves. Several decades later in 1843, the English traveler and writer Sir John Gardner Wilkinson described the state of enslaved Greeks who had converted to Islam in Egypt:\n\nMuslims of Pontic Greek origins, speakers of Pontic Greek (named Ρωμαίικα \"Roméika\", not Ποντιακά \"Pontiaká\" as it is in Greece), is spoken by sizable numbers along communities spread out near the southern Black Sea coast. Grecophone Pontian Muslims are found within Trabzon province and inhabit the following areas: Pontic is spoken in the town of Tonya and in 6 villages of Tonya district. It is spoken in 6 villages of the municipal entity of Beşköy in the central and Köprübaşı districts of Sürmene. Grecophone Muslims are also located in 9 villages of the Galyana valley in Maçka district. They were resettled there in former abandoned Greek Orthodox Pontian dwellings from the area of Beşköy after a devastating flood in 1929. The largest cluster of Pontian speakers is found in the Of valley. There are 23 Grecophone Muslim villages in Çaykara district, though due to migration these numbers have fluctuated and according to native speakers of the area there were around 70 Grecophone Muslim villages in Çaykara district. 12 Grecophone Muslim villages are also located in the Dernekpazarı district. Over the years, heavy emigration from the Trabzon region to other parts of Turkey to places such as Istanbul, Sakarya, Zonguldak, Bursa and Adapazarı has occurred. While emigration to places outside Turkey has also transpired when people left for Germany as invited workers during the 1960s. Sizable numbers of Grecophone Muslims in Pontus have retained knowledge and or are fluent in Greek and it is a mother tongue for many and even the young. Males are usually bilingual in both Turkish and Pontic Greek, while there are many women who are monolingual only in Pontic Greek. Grecophone Muslim Pontians can also be found in other settlements such as Rize (with a large concentration in İkizdere district), Erzincan, Gümüşhane, parts of Erzerum province, and the former Russian Empire's province of Kars Oblast (see Caucasus Greeks) and Georgia (see Islam in Georgia). Today these Greek speaking Muslims regard themselves and identify as Turks. In Turkey, their communities are sometimes referred to as \"Rum\", although as with the word \"Yunan\" meaning Greek in Turkish or \"Greek\" in the English language, the term \"Rum\" is perceived within Turkey to be associated with Greece and or Christianity and they refuse to be identified as such. Grecophone Muslim Pontians when speaking their language refer to it as \"Romeyka\", whereas when conversing in Turkish they call it \"Rumca\" or \"Rumcika\". \"Rumca\" is the name used in Turkish to call all Greek dialects spoken in Turkey, a term akin to \"Romeyka\" derived from the word \"ρωμαίικα\" or Roman with Byzantine origins. Current day Greeks refer to their language as \"ελληνικά\" or Greek, an appellation that replaced the previous term \"Romeiika\" during the early nineteenth century. In Turkey standard modern Greek is referred to as \"Yunanca\", whereas the ancient Greek language is called \"Eski Yunanca\" or \"Grekçe\". According to Heath W. Lowry's great work about Ottoman tax books (\"Tahrir Defteri\") with Halil İnalcık, it is claimed that most \"Turks\" of Trebizond and the Pontic Alps region in northeastern Anatolia are of Pontic Greek origin. Grecophone Pontian Muslims are known in Turkey for their conservative adherence of Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school and are renowned for producing many Koranic teachers. Sufi orders such as Qadiri and Naqshbandi have a great impact.\n\nThe term Cretan Turks (, ) or \"Cretan Muslims\" () covers Greek speaking Muslims who arrived in Turkey after or slightly before the start of the Greek rule in Crete in 1908 and especially in the framework of the 1923 agreement for the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations and have settled on the coastline stretching from the Çanakkale to İskenderun. Prior to their resettlement to Turkey, deteriorating communal relations between Cretan Greek Christians and Grecophone Cretan Muslims had made the latter identify with Ottoman and later Turkish identity. Some Grecophone Muslims of Crete also composed literature for their community in the Greek language such as songs and wrote it in the Arabic alphabet, although little of it has been studied. Today in various settlements along the Aegean coast elderly Grecophone Cretan Muslims are still conversant in Cretan Greek. Amongst younger generations of Cretan Grecophone Muslims, many are fluent in the Greek language. Often members from the Muslim Cretan community are unaware that the language they speak is Greek. They often name the language as Cretan (\"Kritika\" () or \"Giritçe\") instead of Greek. The Grecophone Cretan Muslims are Sunnis of the (Hanafi) rite with a highly influential Bektashi minority that helped shape the folk Islam and religious tolerance of the entire community. Significant numbers of Cretan Muslims were re-settled in other Ottoman controlled areas around the eastern Mediterranean by the Ottomans following the establishment of the autonomous Cretan State in 1898. Most ended up in coastal Syria and Lebanon, particularly the town of Al-Hamidiyah, in Syria, (named after the Ottoman sultan who settled them there), and Tripoli in Lebanon where many continue to speak Greek as their mother tongue. Others were resettled in Ottoman Tripolitania especially in the east side cities like Susa and Benghazi, where they are distinguishable by their Greek surnames. Many of the older members of this community still speak Cretan Greek in their homes. A small community of Grecophone Cretan Muslims still resides in Greece in the Dodecanese Islands of Rhodes and Kos. These communities were formed prior to the area becoming part of Greece in 1948 when their ancestors migrated there from Crete and are integrated into the local Muslim population as Turks today.\n\nMuslims from the region of Epirus, known collectively as \"Yanyalılar\" (\"Yanyalı\" in singular, meaning \"person from Ioannina\") in Turkish and Τουρκογιαννιώτες \"Turkoyanyótes\" in Greek (Τουρκογιαννιώτης \"Turkoyanyótis\" in singular, meaning \"\"Turk\" from Ioannina\"), who had arrived in Turkey in two waves of migration in 1912 and after 1923. After the exchange of populations, Grecophone Epirote Muslims resettled themselves in the Anatolian section of Istanbul, especially the districts from Erenköy to Kartal which were previously populated by wealthy Orthodox Greeks. Although the majority of the Epirote Muslim population was of Albanian origin, Grecophone Muslim communities existed in the towns of Souli, Margariti (both majority-Muslim), Ioannina, Preveza, Louros, Paramythia, Konitsa, and elsewhere in the Pindus mountain region. Regarding their identity, the Greek speaking Muslim populations who were a majority in Ioannina and Paramythia and with sizable numbers residing in Parga and possibly Preveza, \"shared the same route of identity construction, with no evident differentiation between them and their Albanian speaking cohabitants\". Hoca Es'ad Efendi, a Greek-speaking Muslim from Ioannina who lived in the eighteenth century, was the first translator of Aristotle into Turkish. Some Grecophone Muslims of Ioannina also composed literature for their community in the Greek language such as poems and wrote it in the Arabic alphabet. The community now is fully integrated into Turkish culture. Those Muslims from Epirus of mainly Albanian rather than Greek convert origin are usually described as Cham Albanians.\n\nGreek speaking Muslims lived in the Haliacmon of western Macedonia. They were known collectively as \"Vallahades\" and had probably converted to Islam en masse in the late 1700s. Although the Vallahades had retained much of their Greek culture and language, unlike most Muslim converts from Greek Macedonia and elsewhere in the southern Balkans who generally adopted the Turkish language and identity. In contrast, most Grecophone Muslims from Epirus, Thrace, and other parts of Macedonia who converted to Islam in the earlier Ottoman period, generally also adopted Turkish and more speedily and thoroughly assimilated into the Ottoman ruling elite. According to Todor Simovski's assessment (1972), in 1912 in the region of Macedonia in Greece there were 13,753 Muslim Greeks.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the Vallahades were considered by other Greeks to have become \"Turkish\" and were not exempt from the 1922-1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which was based on religious affiliation (Christian Orthodox and Muslim) rather than language and ethnicity. The Vallahades were resettled in western Asia Minor, in such towns as Kumburgaz, Büyükçekmece, and Çatalca or in villages like Honaz near Denizli. Many Vallahades still continue to speak the Greek language, which they call \"Romeïka\" and have become completely assimilated into the Turkish Muslim mainstream as Turks.\n\nIn 1878 the Muslim inhabitants of Cyprus (constituting about 1/3 of the island's population, which then numbered 40,000 inhabitants) were classified as being either Turkish or \"neo-Muslim.\" The latter were of Greek origin, Islamised but speaking Greek, and similar in character to the local Christians. The last of such groups was reported to arrive at Antalya in 1936. These communities are thought to have abandoned Greek in the course of integration. During the 1950s, there were still four Greek speaking Muslim settlements in Cyprus: Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni that identified themselves as Turks.\n\nIn the Middle Ages the Greek population of Crimea traditionally adhered to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, even despite undergoing linguistic assimilation by the local Crimean Tatars. In 1777–1778, when Catherine the Great of Russia conquered the peninsula from the Ottoman Empire, the local Orthodox population was forcibly deported and settled north of the Azov Sea. In order to avoid deportation, some Greeks chose to convert to Islam. Crimean Tatar-speaking Muslims of the village of Kermenchik (renamed to Vysokoe in 1945) kept their Greek identity and were practising Christianity in secret for a while. In the nineteenth century the lower half of Kermenchik was populated with Christian Greeks from Turkey, whereas the upper remained Muslim. By the time of the Stalinist deportation of 1944, the Muslims of Kermenchik had already been identified as Crimean Tatars, and were forcibly expelled to Central Asia together with the rest of Crimea's ethnic minorities.\n\nThere are about 7,000 Greek speaking Muslims living in Tripoli, Lebanon and about 8,000 in Al Hamidiyah, Syria. The majority of them are Muslims of Cretan origin. Records suggest that the community left Crete between 1866 and 1897, on the outbreak of the last Cretan uprising against the Ottoman Empire, which ended the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Sultan Abdul Hamid II provided Cretan Muslim families who fled the island with refuge on the Levantine coast. The new settlement was named Hamidiye after the sultan.\n\nMany Grecophone Muslims of Lebanon somewhat managed to preserve their Cretan Muslim identity and Greek language Unlike neighbouring communities, they are monogamous and consider divorce a disgrace. Until the Lebanese Civil War, their community was close-knit and entirely endogamous. However many of them left Lebanon during the 15 years of the war.\n\nGreek speaking Muslims constitute 60% of Al Hamidiyah's population. The percentage may be higher but is not conclusive because of hybrid relationship in families. The community is very much concerned with maintaining its culture. The knowledge of the spoken Greek language is remarkably good and their contact with their historical homeland has been possible by means of satellite television and relatives. They are also known to be monogamous. Today, Grecophone Hamidiyah residents identify themselves as Cretan Muslims, while some others as Cretan Turks.\n\nBy 1988, many Grecophone Muslims from both Lebanon and Syria had reported being subject to discrimination by the Greek embassy because of their religious affiliation. The community members would be regarded with indifference and even hostility, and would be denied visas and opportunities to improve their Greek through trips to Greece.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, after the Seljuq victory over the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV, many Byzantine Greeks were taken as slaves to Central Asia. The most famous among them was Al-Khazini, a Byzantine Greek slave taken to Merv, then in the Khorasan province of Persia but now in Turkmenistan, who was later freed and became a famous Muslim scientist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a DC-based group that brings unions and environmentalists together to push for anti-poverty measures and a clean-energy economy. Green For All was co-founded by Van Jones, former head of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and Majora Carter former head of Sustainable South Bronx, and was officially launched in September 2007 at the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nThe United Steelworkers (USW), the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Green For All and the Blue Green Alliance, a partnership of the USW and Sierra Club, have launched the national Green Jobs for America campaign.\n\nGreen For All was co-founded by Van Jones and Majora Carter after the two had become increasingly concerned with issues of poverty and crime, as well as the lack of a solid infrastructure for \"green\" jobs. Rather than approach each issue separately, Jones decided to combine the two in a more unified vision and business model. The organization launched in September 2007 at the Clinton Global Initiative, when Jones appeared to announce Green for All's commitment to securing one billion dollars by 2012 to create \"green pathways out of poverty\" for 250,000 people in the United States. Jones also added that the Ella Baker Center would continue to run a \"Green-Collar Jobs Campaign\" regionally and statewide in California.\n\nA major component of the Green For All movement is job security: \n\nYou can't take a building you want to weatherize, put it on a ship to China and then have them do it and send it back. So we are going to have to put people to work in this country — weatherizing millions of buildings, putting up solar panels, constructing wind farms. Those green-collar jobs can provide a pathway out of poverty for someone who has not gone to college.\n\nAccording to a March 26, 2008 press release from United Press International (UPI), the green-collar job sector is growing in the United States, and could include more than 14 million workers by 2017. Although it is difficult to pin down what constitutes a green-collar job, the American Solar Energy Society said there are around 8.5 million U.S. jobs that involve Earth-friendly enterprises and renewable energy sources. This figure could grow by 5 million in the next 10 years according to Jerome Ringo of the Apollo Alliance.\n\nGreen For All and other green-energy businesses have been receiving increased press by major publications such as the New York Times, USA Today, Business Week and The Nation, indicating that the growth potential cited by UPI is picking up steam in the public sector as well.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on 21 April 2016, hours after the musician Prince's death, Van Jones revealed on CNN that Prince had secretly contributed to the funding of Green for All.\n\nGreen for All was a major proponent of the Green Jobs Act of 2007. The Green Jobs Act, which was inserted into the general 2007 Energy Bill (it is listed as Title X), was passed by both the House and the United States Senate. The Green Jobs Act directs $125 million annually for greening the nation's workforce, including job training for 35,000 people every year. It also authorizes $25 million each year to fund programs like the Oakland Green Jobs Corps.\n\n\n"}

Witness reports differed as to what Brown was doing with his hands when he was shot to death, with some claiming he had his hands in the air. A United States Department of Justice investigation found this claim was not consistent with the physical and forensic evidence.\n\nOn Saturday, August 9, 2014, Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson were walking together in Ferguson, Missouri, after Brown robbed a convenience store. They were stopped by Officer Darren Wilson. There is still no clear report of exactly what conspired between this point of the incident and when Brown was shot because of slight inconsistencies in the witnesses stories. Wilson claimed that Brown reached into his police SUV for the officer’s gun, but prosecutors were neither able to confirm nor disprove this. After the altercation near the vehicle, the official incident report says that Brown ran away from the vehicle. Then, Brown turned back around and started moving back toward the officer. Officer Wilson claimed he feared for the safety of his life, and that is when he shot and killed Michael Brown.\n\nOne recurring feature in Dorian Johnson's eyewitness account of the incident is that Michael Brown put his hands in the air during the encounter with Officer Wilson. A typical recollection by Dorian Johnson was phrased as \"[Michael Brown] turned around, and he put his hands in the air, and he started to get down.\" Three days after the killing of Michael Brown, Johnson told MSNBC that Brown said, \"I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!\"\n\nIn addition to Johnson, several witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown described him as having his hands up during the encounter. However, no one else recalled Brown asking Wilson not to shoot his firearm. \n\nImpromptu protests erupted immediately after the shooting. Tension between the community and the police escalated quickly. Shortly after the shooting, Brown's stepfather held a placard that read \"Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!\" By 8:30 that same evening, demonstrators were chanting \"We are Michael Brown!\" They also marched to the headquarters of the Ferguson Police Department, where they chanted \"No justice! No peace!\" Residents also held their hands in the air and said to police officers \"Don't shoot me!\" The \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" photographed protesters with their hands in the air shouting \"Don't shoot us!\" at the police.\n\nThe community reaction to Michael Brown's death continued through Sunday, August 10 with a variety of actions, including more protests and a vigil, as well as looting. On Monday, August 11, as the FBI promised to investigate the shooting, and the NAACP organized a meeting in the community, the hands up gesture was continuing to be employed by protesters who were emulating what they understood to be the final posture of Michael Brown. After the looting on Sunday, police officers were equipped with rubber bullets and tear gas on Monday night. During a standoff with police, several men approached officers with their hands raised saying, \"Don't shoot me.\"\n\nThe hands-up pose had been widely adopted by protesters throughout the weekend. The gesture was often paired with the phrase \"Don't shoot me\" or \"Don't shoot us.\" During the demonstrations on Monday, the media first documented the posture and the phrase being combined into the slogan \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot.\" \n\nBrown’s death took place after the deaths of Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, and Trayvon Martin. In the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death, the BlackLivesMatter movement exploded in mainstream media. According to the movement's website, it “began as a call to action in response to state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism.” From that moment forward, it was an ongoing protest that was only amplified by the deaths of Michael Brown and the others. Many Black Lives Matter activists traveled to Ferguson in Protest of Brown’s death. These activists claim that social media has exploded the conversation about these movements, and police brutality in general. The “Hands up, don’t shoot!” slogan/gesture was adopted and is still used by BlackLivesMatter activists because of the synonymous origins and causes of both movements.\n\nBy Tuesday, August 13, \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" had become a defining slogan of the protests in Ferguson. The hands up gesture used widely by black males when dealing with Ferguson police was transformed into a weapon of protest. Al Sharpton encouraged demonstrators to use the gesture by saying, \"If you're angry, throw your arms up. If you want justice, throw your arms up. Because that's the sign Michael was using. He had a surrender sign. That's the sign you have to deal with. Use the sign he last showed. We want answers why that last sign was not respected.\"\n\nThe phrase took off more than a year ago, becoming a rallying cry for protesters and others trying to draw attention to the killing of Brown and other African Americans by police officers. In November 2014, some members of the St. Louis Rams ran out on the field during pregame introductions with their hands raised above their heads, an action repeated by four members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the House floor in December 2014. Gass, Nick, et al. “'Hands up, Don't Shoot' Ranked One of Biggest 'Pinocchios' of 2015.” POLITICO, POLITICO, 14 Dec. 2015, www.politico.com/story/2015/12/hands-up-dont-shoot-false-216736.\nThe hybrid slogan \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" quickly spread beyond the Ferguson protests. It was often said in solidarity with the protesters in Ferguson.\n\"Those words, which rose to the public consciousness following the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, rang hollow with federal investigators.\" (Politico, Glass) The growing of a movement and it's ability to encompass the attention of the masses is one that has to be consistently and accurately reported on. The growing of the \"Hands up, Don't Shoot\" movement occurred during a pivotal time in our nation's history of police brutality and the oppression of specifically African American men. \nThough the Black Lives Matter activist movement began in response to the death of Trayvon Martin two years earlier, it staged its first in-person national protest in the form of a \"Black Lives Matter Freedom Ride\" to Ferguson, Missouri three weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown. One of the rallying cries at those protests was \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\". This became a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests, along with the dying words of Eric Garner (\"I can't breathe\"), and \"No justice, no peace\".\n\nOn November 30, 2014, several players on the Los Angeles Rams, (Then St. Louis Rams), (Tavon Austin, Stedman Bailey, Kenny Britt, Jared Cook and Chris Givens) entered the field during a NFL game making the gesture.\n\nThe St. Louis Police Officers Association said the act was \"way out-of-bounds\" and the organization \"is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory\".\n\nRams Coach Jeff Fisher and a team spokesman said that they were unaware of the players' plans before the game and the players \"were exercising their right to free speech\". Against the St. Louis Police Officers Association's request, the NFL did not punish the players, because the gesture was political and unlike other major professional sports leagues NFL does not punish players for political gestures. The NFL's vice president of communications said, \"We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation.\"\n\nJared Cook, one of the Rams players, received threats after making the gesture.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, several lawmakers in the United States House of Representatives made the gesture to protest the shooting and police brutality. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) said on the floor: Other members of the Congressional Black Caucus joining Jeffries were Reps. Yvette Clarke (D-New York), Al Green (D-Texas) and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), who praised the football players who made the gesture the night before.\n\nOn December 11, more than 150 black congressional staffers staged a walkout and silent protest in a display of unity with demonstrations against the Eric Garner and Brown grand jury decisions. Senate Chaplain Dr. Barry Black led the crowd in prayer. They were gathered there, Black said, to be a \"voice for the voiceless\". After prayer, the crowd of staff and lawmakers posed while making the gesture.\n\nOn December 13, 2014 after a story about the ongoing protest, three members of the \"CNN Newsroom\" panel held up their hands while a fourth held up a sheet of paper reading \"I can't breathe\", a reference to the death of Eric Garner. \"Our hearts are with [the protesters]\" was stated, but \"hands up, don't shoot\" was not said during the broadcast. The gesture attracted criticism because it appeared on a non-opinion-based program.\n\nDuring Pharrell Williams' performance of the song \"Happy\" at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, the singer and backup performers made the hands up gesture.\n\nMacklemore and Ryan Lewis reference the chanting of \"hands up, don't shoot\" in their song \"White Privilege II\".\n\nOn December 9, 2015, Daye Jack released the song \"Hands up\" about police brutality, where he in the chorus sings: \"Living with my head down – Hands up – no no don’t shoot, don’t shoot\" as a direct reference to the killing of Michael Brown. Daye Jack also confirmed this theory and said he wrote this song after the Ferguson killing, being extremely angry and confused.\n\nKanye West references this gesture in his song \"Feedback\" from his 2016 release \"The Life of Pablo\" with the lines \"Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us. Hands up, hands up then the cops shot us.\"\n\nFrom September to December 2014, protesters in Hong Kong rallied against the Chinese government's reversal of its promise to grant them full democratic rights. During what became known as the Umbrella Revolution, protesters reacted to the heavy-handed tactics of the police by invoking the \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" chant.\n\nIn response to the death of Michael Brown, the Criminal Section of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation into whether or not Officer Wilson violated federal laws.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the Department of Justice released their report of the investigation. This report found that physical and forensic evidence contradicted witnesses who claimed that Brown had his hands up when Wilson shot him. It also stated that witnesses whose testimony aligned with the physical and forensic evidence never \"perceived Brown to be attempting to surrender at any point when Wilson fired upon him.\" The report concluded there was no justification for a federal prosecution of Officer Wilson.\n\nIn the wake of the report, many pundits began to refer to the \"Hands up, Don't Shoot\" slogan as \"a lie\" or \"based on a lie\". \"The Washington Post\"s Fact Checker feature gave \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" four Pinocchios denoting it as an outright lie.\n\nDespite this criticism, the slogan has an enduring symbolic meaning for activists. As one protester remarked, \"Even if you don't find that it's true, it's a valid rallying cry... it's just a metaphor.\" Speaking to the \"Daily Mail\", Elizabeth Brondolo, a psychology professor at St. John's University in New York, said \"The truth always really matters, but it's important to recognize that past experience to stereotypes also influences the perception of hands being raised.\"\n\nThe Grand Jury found Officer Darren Wilson not guilty in the shooting of Michael Brown after the long awaited investigation. This investigation came to an end in March, authenticated that Wilson involvement in this incident had been cleared of any legal or civil rights violations. This initiated an outrage amongst many citizens in the Ferguson community, which is what sparked this Hands Up Don't Shoot movement to begin. After this investigation came to a close, Darren Wilson was no longer a police officer for the Ferguson Police Department, and has moved away to a closely guarded residence which remains unknown. Given that this shooting has brought on a lot of animosity towards Wilson from people around the world, he did have supporters that saved up $500,000 to help pay for his protection and his legal defense team. \nSince the Ferguson shooting where a police officer struck the young man, Michael Brown, there have been changes made in the Ferguson Police Department. Many officers have resigned following the shooting, including the Ferguson Chief of Police, Thomas Jackson, and also the officer who shot Michael Brown, Darren Wilson . This shooting has directed a great amount of attention to this community and the Ferguson Police Department, and in retrospect many officers have fell off the radar. Other changes have been put into affect as well, which include an increase in minority officers, and the use of body camera's when conducting a search . What led these changes was an investigation performed by the Justice Department. In the investigation, which was published March 2015, they found \"a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct\" and this conduct includes an immoderate amount of tickets and fine that were disproportionally given to the black residents of Ferguson . In effect, a reform was put out that enforced changes to the conduct of searches, arrests, and general police interactions with citizens \n. Now officers are to wear body cameras while on duty, and minorities from the Ferguson Community are stepping up as police officers to strengthen the interactions between the police and the residents of Ferguson.\n\n"}
{"id": "51180950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51180950", "title": "Hated in the Nation", "text": "Hated in the Nation\n\n\"Hated in the Nation\" is the sixth and final episode of the third series of British science fiction anthology series \"Black Mirror\". Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by James Hawes, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three. It is the longest episode in the series at 89 minutes.\n\nThe episode is a murder mystery, and follows Detective Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) and her new partner Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) who, together with the help of National Crime Agency officer Shaun Li (Benedict Wong), try to solve the inexplicable deaths of people who were all the target of social media.\n\nThe episode was critically acclaimed.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) has been summoned to a hearing. She begins speaking about Jo Powers (Elizabeth Berrington), a journalist subjected to online death threats after publicly lambasting a disability activist's recent self-immolation. Powers returns home to the delivery of a cake reading \"Fucking bitch\", and sees death threats and hate messages directed at her on social media; she is later found dead, and her husband injured.\n\nParke investigates the death, with Trainee Detective Constable Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) as her shadow, and Nick Shelton (Joe Armstrong) also working on the case. The death is assumed to be murder by her husband, but he claims that Powers cut her own throat with a wine bottle, injuring him as he tried to stop her. Parke and Coulson visit the sender of the cake, Liza Bahar (Vinette Robinson), who had crowdfunded the money for it, and posted a message online reading \"#DeathTo Jo Powers\".\n\nThe following day, a rapper named Tusk (Charles Babalola), who had also become a target of online hate for insulting a young fan, has a seizure; he is hospitalised and sedated. When Tusk is put in an MRI machine, a metal object in his brain is pulled out of his head by magnetism, killing him instantly. The object is identified as an Autonomous Drone Insect, or \"ADI\" – artificial substitute bees developed by a company called Granular to counteract a sudden colony collapse disorder in the bee population. Parke and Coulson visit Granular's headquarters, where project leader Rasmus (Jonas Karlsson) finds that an ADI was locally hacked near Powers' house on the night she was killed.\n\nA National Crime Agency (NCA) officer, Shaun Li (Benedict Wong), is also assigned to the case. Coulson realises that Tusk and Powers were both targeted with a social media hashtag, \"#DeathTo\". The tweets originating the hashtag had a video called \"Game of Consequences\" attached which explains that each day, the person that is subject of the most \"#DeathTo\" tweets will be killed. Clara Meades (Holli Dempsey), who posted a photo where she pretended to urinate on a war memorial, is currently mentioned in the most tweets; the team take her to a safe house. Rasmus attempts to catch the hackers, but fails, and a swarm of ADIs invade the safe house through keyholes, windows and other small gaps. Though Parke and Blue attempt to hide from them with Meades, she is killed by ADIs entering through an air duct.\n\nNoticing that the ADIs attacked Meades but not herself or Parke, Coulson realises that they use a facial recognition system; Li admits that the ADIs are used for government surveillance. The news begins to report on the #DeathTo hashtag, which is rapidly growing in use. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Tom Pickering (Ben Miles) is the current target. Meanwhile, Parke interviews Tess Wallander (Georgina Rich), a former Granular employee who attempted suicide after receiving online hate, but was saved by her flatmate and work colleague Garrett Scholes (Duncan Pow).\n\nCoulson and Li's analysis of the compromised ADIs reveal a digital manifesto written by Scholes, which is about forcing people to face consequences without hiding behind online anonymity. Coulson traces the location where a selfie in the document was taken; the police raid this location, yielding a disk drive. As Rasmus is preparing to use this to deactivate the ADI system, Coulson discovers the drive contains a list of hundreds of thousands of International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which can be connected to the owners' details via the government's monitoring system. They realise the list is of those who used the #DeathTo hashtag, and Parke concludes that Scholes' true plan was to use the ADIs to kill these people. However, Li ignores this and activates Rasmus' code; the system appears to be deactivated for a moment, but then the ADIs come back online and are seen targeting Bahar and Shelton, who had used the hashtag. All 387,036 people on the list are killed by the ADIs.\n\nAt the hearing, Parke explains that Blue Coulson has gone missing, presumed to have committed suicide; however, Parke later receives a text from her reading \"Got him\". Scholes had fled abroad and changed his appearance, but Coulson has managed to locate him. The episode ends with Coulson following Scholes down an alley in an unnamed foreign country.\n\nAs of series 4, \"Hated in the Nation\" is the longest episode of \"Black Mirror\" at 89 minutes. In an interview in October 2016, Brooker revealed that there were characters in the episode who could recur in the series in the future.\n\nAccording to Brooker, the episode was inspired by \"Scandi-Noir thrillers like the TV series \"The Killing\" and \"Borgen\"\". The episode is also partly inspired by Jon Ronson's book \"So You've Been Publicly Shamed\" (2015), about online shaming and its historical antecedents, and by a public backlash after Brooker wrote \"Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley Jr – where are you now that we need you?\" in a satirical 2004 article about George W. Bush, in \"The Guardian\".\n\nWhen asked whether \"policing Twitter is the answer\" to the issues in the episode, Brooker answers \"I don’t know the answer!\", and comments that \"I think that social media is an amazing invention and really I suspect what needs to happen is that we just as a species get better at dealing with it\" and \"People should be more accountable for what they say. It’s just difficult to see how you do that without the law getting involved.\"\n\nIn the opening flashback sequence, Karin Parke sits down in her living room to watch the news. Scrolling below the feature about the chancellor, the news ticker clearly reads: \"US military announces MASS project\". This is in reference to the previous episode \"Men Against Fire\" where the MASS project was the featured technology for the episode. This may indicate that at the time of the flashback sequence, the events of Men Against Fire hadn't yet occurred. Later on, another news ticker displays \"ECHR rules 'cookies' have human rights\" which is a reference to the technology seen in the \"White Christmas\" episode.\n\nWhen DCI Parke asks Blue Coulson why she left forensics, she reveals that she was the one who cracked Iain Rannoch's \"souvenir folder\" containing all the pictures and videos that had been taken by his girlfriend Victoria Skillane of the torture and murder of six-year-old Jemima Sykes. Iain Rannoch committed suicide while in custody, but the series 2 episode \"White Bear\" covers Victoria's punishment.\n\nIn the ending scenes, when Garrett Scholes is watching the news, the headline ticker includes \"Shou Saito announces immersive new gaming system.\" This is a reference to the previous episode \"Playtest\" and indicates that the tests of Shou Saito have concluded and his new game is available to the world. Also included is \"Skillane appeal thrown out of court\", another reference to \"White Bear\".\n\nThe episode was acclaimed by critics, who praised its writing, use of Twitter, themes, acting, and final twist.\n\nSuchandrika Chakrabarti of the \"Daily Mirror\" acclaimed the episode, giving it a perfect 5 rating and calling it \"a huge achievement\", stating \"it's an illuminating, compelling watch, as \"Black Mirror\" does what it does best: telling us about human nature through the technology we wish for, but don't deserve\". \"Digital Spy\" also gave a very enthusiastic review, considering the episode \"a great example of how the show at its best can merge its heady high-concepts with more traditional storytelling to effectively hold that black mirror up to our own society\". They highly praised the \"once downbeat and low-key, and yet expansively devastating\" climax, and called the episode \"a feature length story that's captivating throughout\".\n\nAdam Chitwood of \"Collider\" noted that the episode was the \"most thematically relevant... of this new batch, with a direct connection to the ugly side of social media and its lack of consequences.\" \"The Telegraph\" called the episode \"an inspired, frost-fringed police procedural\" and gave it a rating of four out of five. Zack Handlen of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B+, stating \"\"Black Mirror\" ends its season with a solid but unremarkable thriller\". He criticized the length of the episode, despite recognizing that \"at least the story has enough complications that it never felt empty.\"\n\nThe research group of Eijiro Miyako at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan is currently working on Materially Engineered Artificial Pollinators using micro-drones. They published their findings in the academic journal \"Chem\" by Cell Press.\n\n"}
{"id": "908931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=908931", "title": "Hutsuls", "text": "Hutsuls\n\nHutsuls (, \"hutsuly\"; , plural \"Huculi, Hucułowie\"; , plural \"huțuli\") is an ethnic group spanning parts of western Ukraine and Romania (i.e. parts of Bukovina and Maramureş).\n\nWhile they often have been officially designated as a subgroup of Ukrainians, however Hutsuls mostly regard themselves as a part of a broader Rusyn ethnicity, alongside two other groups from the cross-border region of Transcarpathia: the Boykos and Lemkos.\n\nThere are different versions for the origins of the name \"Hutsul\". An explanation is that it comes from the Romanian word for \"outlaw\" (cf. Rom. \"hoț\"—\"thief\", \"hoțul\"—\"the thief\"). Other explanations place their origins in the Slavic \"kochul\"—\"wanderer\", \"migrant\"—in reference to their semi-nomadic lifestyle, to the name of the Turkic tribe of the Uzy, and even to the name of the Moravian Grand Duke Hetsyla. However these are obsolete and non-academic assertions. No valid theories have been proposed yet. The name is mostly an exonym, used by neighbouring groups and not Hutsuls themselves, although some have embraced it.\n\nHutsuls inhabit areas situated between the south-east of those inhabited by the Boykos, down to the northern part of the Romanian segment of the Carpathians.\n\nSeveral hypotheses account for the origin of the Hutsuls. According to Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga, \"huțuli\" or \"huțani\" are denationalized Romanians. Other opinions show that Hutsuls descend from the White Croats, a Slavic tribe that inhabited the area from the 4th until the 12th century, or from the Slavic tribe of the Ulichs, who had to leave their previous homes near the Southern Bug river under pressure from the Pechenegs.\n\nHutsul is usually considered to be a dialect of Western Ukrainian with some Polish influences. \nSince the joining of Transcarpathia by Soviet Union compulsory education has been conducted only in standardized literary Ukrainian. In recent years there have been grassroots efforts to keep the traditional Hutsul dialect alive.\n\nTraditional Hutsul culture is often represented by the colorful and intricate craftsmanship of their clothing, sculpture, architecture, woodworking, metalworking (especially in brass), rug weaving, pottery, and egg decorating (\"see pysanka\"). Along with other Hutsul traditions, as well as their songs and dances, this culture is often celebrated and highlighted by the different countries that Hutsuls inhabit.\n\nUkrainian Hutsul culture bears a resemblance to neighboring cultures of western and southwestern Ukraine, particularly Lemkos and Boykos. These groups also share similarities with other Slavic highlander peoples, such as the Gorals in Poland and Slovakia. Similarities have also been noted with some Vlach cultures such as the Moravian Wallachians in the Czech Republic, as well as some cultures in Romania. Most Hutsuls belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\n\nHutsul society was traditionally based on forestry and logging, as well as cattle and sheep breeding; the Hutsuls are credited with having created the breed of horse known as the Hucul pony. One of the main attributes of Hutsul males is their bartok, a small head axe on a long handle. They use unique musical instruments, including the \"trembita\" \"(trâmbiţa)\", a type of alpenhorn, as well multiple varieties of the fife, or \"sopilka\", that are used to create unique folk melodies and rhythms. Also frequently used are the bagpipe (\"duda\"), the Jew's harp (\"drymba\"), and the hammered dulcimer (\"tsymbaly\").\n\nThe Hutsuls served as an inspiration for many writers, such as Ivan Franko, Lesya Ukrainka, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Vasyl Stefanyk, Marko Cheremshyna, Mihail Sadoveanu and Stanisław Vincenz, and painters such as Kazimierz Sichulski and Teodor Axentowicz—famous for his portraits and subtle scenes of Hutsul life—and Halyna Zubchenko. Sergei Parajanov's 1965 film \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" (\"Тіні забутих предків\"), which is based on the book by Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, portrays scenes of traditional Hutsul life.\n\nEvery summer, the village of Sheshory in Ukraine hosts a three-day international festival of folk music and art. Two Hutsul-related museums are located in Kolomyia, Ukraine: the Pysanky museum and the Museum of Hutsul and Pokuttya Folk Art. Traditional Hutsul sounds and moves were effectively used by the Ukrainian winner of the 2004 Eurovision song contest, Ruslana Lyzhychko.\n\nThe Romanian Hutsuls have a Festival of Hutsuls at the Moldova-Sulița village\nin Suceava county.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2852008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2852008", "title": "Ilocano people", "text": "Ilocano people\n\nThe Ilocanos (), Ilokanos, or Iloko people are the third largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group that mostly reside within the Ilocos Region in the northwestern seaboard of Luzon, Philippines.\n\nThe word \"Ilokano\" originates from \"Iloko\" (archaic form, \"Yloco\"), the conjugation of \"i-\" (meaning \"of\") and \"look\" (meaning \"bay\"), which means \"from the bay\" in Ilocano. Aside from being referred to as Ilocano, they are also identified as Samtoy, a portmanteau of the Ilocano phrase \"sao mi ditoy\" meaning \"our language here\" (\"sao mi\" - \"our language\"; \"ditoy\" - \"here\").\n\nIlocandia is the term given to the traditional homeland of the Ilocano people. From the original western strip of Northern Luzon, Ilocandia has spread throughout the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley and some parts of Central Luzon.\n\nIlocanos number about 9,136,000. A few Ilocanos living in the Cordilleras have some Cordillerano blood.\n\nMost Ilocanos speak Ilocano, which is part of the Northern Philippine subgroup of the Austronesian family of languages. They also speak Tagalog, and English as second languages.\n\nMost Ilocanos are Roman Catholics, while a significant number belong to the Aglipayan Church, which originated in Ilocos Norte.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Spanish, Ilocanos were animists who believed in spirits called \"anito\" who were either bad or good, male or female. These anito ruled over all aspects of the universe. For example, Litao were anitos of water, Kaibáan, also called Kanibáan were anitos of the undergrowth in a forest, and Mangmangkik were anitos of trees. The Mangamangkik were often feared for causing sickness when a fellow tree was cut down. To appease the mangmangkik before cutting down a tree, the following chant was made: \n\nThis chant calls on the Mangmangkik and beseeches them not to curse the people cutting the tree down. Similar chants and phrases are uttered to appease the Kaibáan when hot cooking water is thrown out into the yard for disposal. The Kaibáan can be befriended, giving luck and blessing to the person. Likewise, if a Kaibáan is angered, illness and in some cases death would plague the person's health and family.\n\nOther ways anitos were respected and appeased were through offerings and sacrifices to idols on platforms called a \"simbaan\" or designated caves where the anito frequents. These offerings, called 'Atang', consisted of various foodstuffs and sweets, as well as cigars and paan. Atang is also offered to the deceased during prayers for the dead or on All Soul's Day.\n\nAnother practice which survived well into the 19th century was 'sibróng'. Associated with human sacrifice and headhunting, sibróng was a prevalent practice in the Ilocos region. The person who carried out the executions was called the 'mannibróng'; this term now means 'thief' in modern Ilocano. Before the death of a community leader or a member of the Principalía, the dying person would lift his hand raised with a certain number of fingers. The number of fingers raised would be the indicator of how many people would have to be killed in order to accompany the dying to the afterlife. In other cases, the people chosen by the mannibróng would have their fingers cut off instead of being executed. Síbrong can also refer to the practice of placing a human head in the foundations of the building to protect the structure from damage. \n\nIn Ilocano mythology, Angalo was a mythical creation giant who was also the first man. Through his actions, he shaped the Cordillera Central, Luzon mountain range, formed the oceans and its saltiness, and put up the sky, moon, sun and stars. The Banaoang Gap, in Santa, Ilocos Sur was said to be created by Angalo when he kicked the mountain range while sleeping.\n\nMany Filipino Americans are of Ilocano descent. They make up 85% of the Filipino population in Hawai'i.\n\nFrom 300–200 BC a migration of Austronesian speaking people from the island of Borneo arrived on the shores of northwest Luzon.\nThey were the most recent of the three waves of migration to the Philippines known as the Malay. Before the arrival of these people, the inhabitants of northwest Luzon were a different Austronesian speaking people called the proto-Malay group whom consist of the modern Tinguian, Isneg, Kalinga, Kankanaey, Bontoc and other tribes collectively known today as the Igorot. Prior to the arrival of the Igorot were the people known today as the Aeta or Negritos.\n\nOver time, the Malay people intermarried with the proto-Malay and or Aeta people, and it is their descendants who lived along the coasts of Northwestern Luzon that the Spanish first came in contact with and called Ilocanos. \n\nWhile Spain applied the term barangay to the settlements in the Ilocos region upon contact, the Ilocano people called their towns, \"íli\", and a smaller group of houses, \"purók\".\n\nThese residents of the íli were organized in a class society. At the top of the class system was a chief or \"agtúray\" or \"ári\" and his family. The ári earned his position due to strength, wealth and or wisdom. This position could also be inherited and usually reserved for a male, however, in the event that no male heir was available a strong female heir was accepted.\nIf the heir was found to be weak by the íli than another ári family would be put in place and the former ári family could fall down in class. Together with a community of elders called \"amáen\" or \"panglakáyen íli\", the ari administered justice and governed the daily lives of the ili and led his people to war if necessary.\n\nBelow the ári were the wealthy \"babaknáng\", or timawa in Tagalog, of who could easily move into the position of ári. Their wealth was maintained by their control of trade with primarily the Chinese, Japanese, Igorots, and the Tagalogs. Goods often traded were rice, cotton, gold, wax, iron, glass beads, honey, and stoneware jars called \"burnáy\". \n\nBelow the babaknáng were the \"kailianes\", a class that helped the ári in sailing, working his fields, and preparing for celebrations. In exchange, the kailianes were given gifts directly from the ári.\n\nThe \"katalonan\" were below the babaknang and the kailianes and they were tenant farmers who consisted of the majority of the population in an ili. They largely practiced wet-rice agriculture which included rice and taro as well as dry agriculture that included cotton. \n\nAt the bottom of the pre-colonial Ilocano society were the \"ubíng\" and below them the \"tagábu\", also called \"adípen\". The ubíng were servants while the tagábu were slaves. The tagábu acquired their status through unresolved debt, insulting a member of the babaknáng or ári, by being prisoners of war, or even inherting the debt of their ancestor.\n\nBoth Ilocano men and women grew their hair long, but tied it up in different ways. Some women twisted their hair to create a bun, while some men twisted their hair and hid it under a turban like wrapping called a \"bangal\" or \"potong\". The patterns and colors of the bangal had many meanings. For example, red potong indicated that the wearer had killed, while a striped pattern indicated that the wearer killed at least seven people. In addition to the bangal, farmers and fishermen also wore a gourd hat called a \"kattukong\" on sunny or rainy days. The kattukong was made from a hollowed and dried calabash gourd or \"tabúngaw\" in Ilocano with a woven interior made of anahaw, nipa, bamboo, and/or rattan. Also often worn during rainy days was a cape called a \"annangá\" which was often made of nipa palm leaves.\n\nThe Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo explored the northern regions of the Philippines in 1571, where he traveled to the Ilocos region (among other places), pacifying the North, and establishing several Spanish municipalities, including Villa Fernandina known as Vigan City in the present time and Tagudin.\n\nIn 1660, Andres Malong, a chief of San Carlos, Pangasinan or Binalatongan as it was called than, allied with the people of Zambales in an effort to throw out the Spanish and plunder those who opposed them. Malong was once employed by the Spanish to help pacify and conquer non-Christian towns and villages in Pangasinan, however, as Malong conquered others, he realized he could also overcome the outnumbered Spanish. \n\nWith his Zambales allies, Malong crowned himself the king of Pangasinan and sent out letters to all the chiefs of the Ilocos Region, Pampanga and Cagayan Valley and demanded that they too align and recognize Malong as their king and kill any Spaniards among them. If they did not, Malong warned that he would invade and punish them for not joining his cause. \n\nUnlike Pangasinan and the Zambales, The Ilocos at the time was a region that the Spanish invested its soldiers and missionaries in and routinely secured. Towns such as Vigan, Ilocos Sur and Tagudin, Ilocos Sur were quickly conquered with Spanish encomiendas, fortifications and Catholic churches quickly established to subdue the Ilocano people into the Spanish Empire. The Spanish were swift in this process to stake their claim on the region's gold trade with the Igorots. They sought to protect this trade from Chinese and Japanese pirates and different European powers such as the Dutch or English. Considering this relatively recent history with the Spanish and primarily under the influence of Catholic missionaries, many of the Ilocano chiefs rejected Andres Malong's offer. \nIn response to their rejection, Malong sent a Zambales chief named Don Pedro Gumapos, who had recently conquered the Pampanga region with 6,000 men, to invade the Ilocos as well as Cagayan regions. Gumapos and his men were met with only 1,500 loyalist Ilocanos under the command of the Spanish alcalde mayor of the region and even missionaries. As such, the Zambales and Pangasinese army quickly defeated them and marched as far north as Vigan, Ilocos Sur where they pillaged and burned the Spanish stronghold and nearby villages. With many of the Spanish missionaries and authorities in the Ilocos evacuated and in retreat, Malong than asked Gumapos to assist him in Pangasinan, where the Spanish were beginning to advance on him. As Gumapos and his troops traveled back down through Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, they continued to raid Ilocano towns and villages for supplies and spoils. Ultimately, the people of Narvacan responded in guerrilla tactics aided by their Tinguian allies. This retaliation by the Ilocano people was devastating and caused more fatalities on Gumapos' army than with the Ilocano forces led by the Spanish.\n\nAs the invading army headed south they sacked and burned the coastal towns of Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur, San Esteban, Ilocos Sur, Santiago, Ilocos Sur and Candon, Ilocos Sur. When they finally approached Santa Cruz, Ilocos Sur, Gumapos encountered a Spanish led army who had just finished reconquering Pangasinan and captured Andres Malong. Despite learning of Malong's defeat, Gumapos led his army to battle. Gumapos and his army were defeated after two large battles. After being captured, Gumapos was sent back to Vigan, Ilocos Sur where he was executed by hanging. The Ilocos Region would not see another revolt against the Spanish until 1762.\n\nThe mounting population pressure due to the substantial population density during the mid-19th century caused the migration of the Ilocanos out of their historic homeland. By 1903, more than 290,000 Ilocanos migrated to Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley, and Metro Manila. More than 180,000 moved to Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. Almost 50,000 moved to Cagayan Valley; half of them resided in Isabela. Around 47,000 lived in Zambales and the Sultan Kudarat more than 11,000.\n\nThe Ilocano diaspora continued in 1906 when Ilocanos started to migrate to Hawaii and California. Ilocanos composed the largest number of expatriates in the United States, though most are bilingual with Tagalog. There is a significant Ilocano community in Hawai'i, in which they make up more than 85% of the Filipino population there.\n\nLater migrations brought Ilocanos to the Cordilleras, Mindoro, Palawan, and Mindanao provinces of Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato, and South Cotabato.\n\nIlocanos boast of a somewhat healthy diet heavy in boiled or steamed vegetables and freshwater fish, but are particularly fond of dishes flavored with \"bagoong\", fermented fish that is often used instead of salt. Ilocanos often season boiled vegetables with \"bagoong monamon\" (fermented anchovy paste) to produce \"pinakbet\". Local specialties include the \"abuos,\" soft white larvae of ants, and \"jumping salad\" or tiny, live shrimp with \"kalamansi\" juice. Another food that is popular for many Ilocanos is the Moringa or \"Malunggay\". It is a good condiment for meat soup(e.g. tinola) or it can be mixed with the famous \"dinengdeng\", a soup made of mainly vegetables with prawns \"alamang\". Most households grow this tree in their backyards and usually offered free for all the neighbors who may want them. Many Ilocanos from Hawai'i are fond of eating them. The Ilocano people are also known to be the first ethnic group in the Philippines to eat the larvae and eggs of \"abuos\" (weaver ants). The practice has since been infused as well with other ethnic groups in northern Luzon.\n\nOne of the most well-known Ilocano literary works written in Iloco is the \"Biag ni Lam-ang\" (\"The Life of Lam-Ang\"), an epic poem about the fantastic life and escapades of an Ilocano hero named Lam-ang. \"Biag ni Lam-ang\" is a testament in the Ilocano literature. The Ilocano writer Elizabeth Medina is probably the most remarkable living Ilocano writer in the Spanish language.\n\n.*Benito Soliven, studied law at the University of the Philippines, graduated summa cum laude, placed third in the 1921 Bar Examinations, the first lawyer of Santo Domingo, Ilocos Sur, an intellectual, a linguist, a successful political leader, an Outstanding Congressman, a three-termer in the House of Representatives acclaimed as \"Valedictorian\" in congress having the greatest number of bills most of which were passed/approved by his Colleagues, a hero of World War II, and most of all a very saintly and charitable man, ready to help the needy and his clients free of charge to those who didn't have the money.

{"id": "40386983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40386983", "title": "Kuy people", "text": "Kuy people\n\nThe Kuy () are an indigenous ethnic group of mainland Southeast Asia. The native lands of the Kuy range from the southern Khorat Plateau in northeast Thailand east to the banks of the Mekong River in southern Laos and south to north central Cambodia. The Kuy are an ethnic minority in all three countries, where they live as \"hill tribes\" or Montagnards. Their language is classified as a Katuic language of the Mon-Khmer language family and, as such, is related to the Khmer language of Cambodia. The Thais, Lao, and Khmer traditionally recognize the Kuy as the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and refer to them as \"Khmer boran\" (Khmer), meaning \"ancient Khmer\" or \"Khamen pa dong\" (; , \"jungle Khmer people\"). The word \"kuy\" in the Kuy language means \"people\" or \"human being\"; alternate English spellings include Kui, Kuoy and Kuay, while forms similar to \"Suay\" or \"Suei\" are derived from the Thai/Lao exonyms meaning \"those who pay tribute\". The Kuy are known as skilled mahouts, or elephant trainers, and many Kuy villages are employed in finding, taming, and selling elephants.\n\nThe Kuy are found in a region of mainland Southeast Asia roughly between the Dangrek Mountains and the Mun River, straddling the borders where Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet. The majority, over 80 percent, live in Thailand in the provinces of Surin, Buriram, Sisaket, and Ubon Ratchathani. From Ubon Ratchathani, their range continues over the Lao border where another 43,000 live in Savannakhet, Salavan and Champasak provinces along both banks of the Mekong. Across the Cambodian border, approximately 38,000 Kuy live in mainly in Preah Vihear, Steung Treng and northern Kampong Thom with a small population in Kratie.\n\nIn Cambodia and Laos, Kuy are considered a \"hill tribe\" and, especially in Laos, many live in more isolated areas in separate villages and have not integrated into mainstream society. In Cambodia, where significant numbers of Kuy also live among the Khmer, they are considered a Khmer Loeu group while in Laos there are counted among the Lao Theung (\"midland Lao\"). In Thailand, most Kuy are more socially integrated and often live in mixed villages alongside the Northern Khmer.\n\nTraditional Kuy culture is similar to other Mon-Khmer minority groups of Southeast Asia. Historically, they were subsistence farmers and supplemented this by weaving, raising livestock, and fishing. During times of drought or when the soil lost its fertility, whole villages relocated to more favorable land. Veneration of spirits, known by the Lao term \"satsana phi\", was the primary religious or cosmological belief. In addition to ancestor spirits, Kuy believe in other nature spirits including that of the monitor lizard (\"takuat\") which they believe to be symbol of fertility. The Kuy perform ceremonies to propitiate the \"takuat\" spirit and ask for fertility from nature. They would also take the tail of the lizard to use in divination ceremonies. Those of ill health would perform a ceremony called \"kael mo\" for healing. Those Kuy who raise and train elephants venerate their own set of spirits related to their work.\n\nModern Kuy, however are influenced by the dominant culture of the country in which they live. Most Kuy in Thailand, for example, where 20th century Thaification policies outlawed spirit worship, have adopted the local form of Theravada Buddhism and use Isan Thai as an alternate first language. Seventy-four percent of the Kuy in Cambodia are no longer fluent in Kuy, having adopted Khmer for daily use, and many have all but integrated into Khmer society although a significant portion still participate in traditional Kuy spiritual activities alongside Khmer Buddhism.\n\nWomen have an esteemed position in Kui society ensuring community cohesion and spiritual beliefs, apart from their central role in subsistence food production.\n\nAs with other aspects of Kuy culture, language use varies based on country of residence. The Kuy in Thailand have been subject to Thaification policies in the past and, while maintaining positive views about their native language (Kuy), most often use the local Lao dialect. Thai Kuy are also fluent in Central Thai and 40 percent also use Northern Khmer. In Laos, which has the largest population of Kuy monolinguals, approximately 80 percent speak only Kuy. The remaining Kuy of Laos also use Lao. Only 26 percent of the Kuy in Cambodia reported being able to communicate in the Kuy language with the remainder speaking only Khmer. The Kuy language has no alphabet of its own. Kuy is written in Thai script in Thailand, Khmer script in Cambodia, and Lao script in Laos.\n\nThe Kuy language belongs to the Austroasiatic language family, within which several more closely related languages, including Brao/Bru, Ta-Oi, and Kuy, among others, make up the Katuic subgroup. Kuy accounts for the largest group of Katuic speakers with a recent estimates placing their numbers at 800,000, double the more conservative traditionally accepted estimates. Separated by distance, geographical features and political borders, Kuy speakers' speech has evolved into several marked, but mutually intelligible, dialects. In Thailand, two major dialects have been recognized, each of which can be further divided into sub-dialects. Cambodian Kuy has been described as having four distinct dialects, while the political situation in Laos has made study of Kuy dialects there difficult.\n\nResearch of the late-19th to early-20th century reported that the Kuy of the time were \"vaguely aware\" of different clans or tribes within Kuy society, but even by that time consciousness of these divisions was waning. A 1988 study found that modern Kuy were no longer conscious of any clan or tribal affiliation and, among themselves, only recognized differences in dialect and national origin. One exception were the approximately 200 \"Kuy Nheu\" (\"ɲə\"), found in the Sisaket, Phrai Bueng and Rasi Salai districts of Srisaket, who were \"very conscious of the fact that they were different from all other Kui\".\n\nThe Kuy people are actively engaged in efforts to preserve Prey Lang forest in Cambodia. Prey Lang's name originated from the Kuy language and means \"the forest (Prey) which belongs to all of us\".\nOrganisations including Amnesty International and Cultural Survival have documented how Kuy people have faced development aggression and been forcefully evicted from their homes due to economic land concessions.\n\nThe \"spirit forest\" is an integral part of Kuy culture, however spirit forests are increasingly impacted by mining interests as Cambodia develops.\nSome Kuy people are artisans with unique basket and textile weaving skills. Some Kuy are rice farmers or raise silk worms and weave silk.\n\nThe Cambodian Indigenous Youth Association has members who are Kuy people who study and work in Phnom Penh.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17730", "title": "Latin", "text": "Latin\n\nLatin (Latin: , ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets, and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet.\n\nLatin was originally spoken in the area surrounding Rome, known as Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language, initially in Italy and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire. Vulgar Latin developed into the Romance languages, such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Romanian. Latin, Greek, and French have contributed many words to the English language. In particular, Latin and Ancient Greek roots are used in theology, biology, science, medicine, and law.\n\nBy the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken during the same time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence. Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century, and Medieval Latin the language used from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin. Later, Early Modern Latin and Modern Latin evolved. Latin was used as the language of international communication, scholarship, and science until well into the 18th century, when it began to be supplanted by vernaculars. Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church.\n\nLatin is taught in primary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions around the world.\n\nLatin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders, seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, four verb principal parts, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two aspects and two numbers.\n\nA number of historical phases of the language have been recognized, each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary, usage, spelling, morphology, and syntax. There are no hard and fast rules of classification; different scholars emphasize different features. As a result, the list has variants, as well as alternative names.\n\nIn addition to the historical phases, Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church as well as by Protestant scholars from Late Antiquity onward.\n\nAfter the Western Roman Empire fell in 476, and Germanic kingdoms took its place, the Germanic people adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other, more formal uses.\n\nThe earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin, which was spoken from the Roman Kingdom to the later part of the Roman Republic period. It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of Plautus and Terence. The Latin alphabet was devised from the Etruscan alphabet. The writing later changed from what was initially either a right-to-left or a boustrophedon script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.\n\nDuring the late republic and into the first years of the empire, a new Classical Latin arose, a conscious creation of the orators, poets, historians and other literate men, who wrote the great works of classical literature, which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools. Today's instructional grammars trace their roots to such schools, which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech.\n\nPhilological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of Plautus, which contain snippets of everyday speech, indicates that a spoken language, Vulgar Latin (termed , \"the speech of the masses\", by Cicero), existed concurrently with literate Classical Latin. The informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti.\n\nAs it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically. On the contrary, romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of Romance languages. The decline of the Roman Empire meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about Late Latin, a postclassical stage of the language seen in Christian writings of the time. It was more in line with everyday speech, not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses.\n\nDespite dialectal variation, which is found in any widespread language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common Christian (Roman Catholic) culture. It was not until the Moorish conquest of Spain in 711 cut off communications between the major Romance regions that the languages began to diverge seriously. The Vulgar Latin dialect that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely cut off from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire.\n\nOne key marker of whether a given Romance feature was found in Vulgar Latin is to compare it with its parallel in Classical Latin. If it was not preferred in Classical Latin, then it most likely came from the undocumented contemporaneous Vulgar Latin. For example, the Romance for \"horse\" (Italian , French , Spanish , Portuguese and Romanian ) came from Latin . However, Classical Latin used . Therefore was most likely the spoken form.\n\nVulgar Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest, when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear. They were, throughout the period, confined to everyday speech, as Medieval Latin was used for writing.\n\nMedieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed. The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies.\n\nWithout the institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity, medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion: for example, in classical Latin \"sum\" and \"eram\" are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive, which are compound tenses. Medieval Latin might use \"fui\" and \"fueram\" instead. Furthermore, the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular. Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail.\n\nThe Renaissance briefly reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken language by its adoption by the Renaissance Humanists. Often led by members of the clergy, they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature. They strove to preserve what they could and restore Latin to what it had been and introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts. By no later than the 15th century they had replaced Medieval Latin with versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities, who attempted, by scholarship, to discover what the classical language had been.\n\nDuring the Early Modern Age, Latin still was the most important language of culture in Europe. Therefore, until the end of the 17th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin. Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in French and later just native or other languages.\n\nThe largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the Catholic Church. Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite; the Tridentine Mass is celebrated in Latin. Although the Mass of Paul VI is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or in whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the Holy See, the primary language of its public journal, the , and the working language of the Roman Rota. Vatican City is also home to the world's only automatic teller machine that gives instructions in Latin. In the pontifical universities postgraduate courses of Canon law are taught in Latin, and papers are written in the same language.\n\nIn the Anglican Church, after the publication of the \"Book of Common Prayer\" of 1559, a Latin edition was published in 1560 for use at universities such as Oxford and the leading \"public schools\" (English private academies), where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin and there have been several Latin translations since. Most recently, a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer has appeared.\n\nSwitzerland has adopted the country's Latin short name on coins and stamps, since there is no room to use all of the nation's four official languages. For a similar reason, it adopted the international vehicle and internet code \"CH\", which stands for , the country's full Latin name.\n\nCanada's motto (\"from sea to sea\") and most provincial mottos are also in Latin. The Canadian Victoria Cross is modelled after the British Victoria Cross which has the inscription \"For Valour\". Because Canada is officially bilingual, the Canadian medal has replaced the English inscription with the Latin .\n\nSeveral states of the United States have Latin mottos: such as Connecticut's motto (\"He who transplanted sustains\"); Kansas's (\"To the stars through hardships\"); Michigan's (\"If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you\"); Missouri's (\"The health of the people should be the highest law\"); North Carolina's (\"To be rather than to seem\"); Virginia's (\"Thus always to tyrants\"); and West Virginia's (\"Mountaineers are always free\").\n\nMany military organizations today have Latin mottos, such as (\"always ready\"), the motto of the United States Coast Guard; (\"always faithful\"), the motto of the United States Marine Corps; and (\"Through adversity/struggle to the stars\"), the motto of the Royal Air Force (RAF).\n\nSome colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos, for example Harvard University's motto is (\"truth\"). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue. Hampden-Sydney College has \"Huc venite iuvenes ut exeatis viri\" (\"Come here as boys so you may leave as men\") as its motto, as the continued instruction of Latin is seen as a highly valuable component of a liberal arts education. Latin is taught at many high schools, especially in Europe and the Americas. It is most common in British public schools and grammar schools, the Italian and , the German and the Dutch . In the United States, it is taught at Baltimore City College, Boston Latin Academy, Boston Latin School, Brooklyn Latin School, Pope John Paul II High School, Central High School of Philadelphia, English High School of Boston, Norwell High School (Massachusetts), Oak Hall School, and many other public and private schools.\n\nSome films of ancient settings, such as \"Sebastiane\" and \"The Passion of the Christ\", have been made with dialogue in Latin for the sake of realism. Occasionally, Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy, in such film/television series as \"The Exorcist\" and \"Lost\" (\"Jughead\"). Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin. There are also songs written with Latin lyrics. The libretto for the opera-oratorio by Igor Stravinsky is in Latin.\n\nOccasionally, some media outlets, targeting enthusiasts, broadcast in Latin. Notable examples include Radio Bremen in Germany, YLE radio in Finland, and Vatican Radio & Television, all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin.\n\nThere are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts. The Latin Wikipedia has more than 100,000 articles written in Latin.\n\nThe language has been passed down through various forms.\n\nSome inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed, monumental, multivolume series, the (CIL). Authors and publishers vary, but the format is about the same: volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information. The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy. About 270,000 inscriptions are known.\n\nThe works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part, in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology. They are in part the subject matter of the field of classics. Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions, such as the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, or the Oxford Classical Texts, published by Oxford University Press.\n\nLatin translations of modern literature such as \"The Hobbit\", \"Treasure Island\", \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Paddington Bear\", \"Winnie the Pooh\", \"The Adventures of Tintin\", \"Asterix\", \"Harry Potter\", \"Walter the Farting Dog\", , \"Max and Moritz\", \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\", \"The Cat in the Hat\", and a book of fairy tales, \"\", are intended to garner popular interest in the language. Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as Meissner's Latin Phrasebook.\n\nThe Latin influence in English has been significant at all stages of its insular development. In the Middle Ages, borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century or indirectly after the Norman Conquest, through the Anglo-Norman language. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words, dubbed \"inkhorn terms\", as if they had spilled from a pot of ink. Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten, but some useful ones survived, such as 'imbibe' and 'extrapolate'. Many of the most common polysyllabic English words are of Latin origin through the medium of Old French. Romance words make respectively 59%, 20% and 14% of English, German and Dutch vocabularies. Those figures can rise dramatically when only non-compound and non-derived words are included.\n\nThe influence of Roman governance and Roman technology on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by \"Historia Naturalis\", an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by Pliny the Elder. Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen, established that today's medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin. Roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms.\n\nA few international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin. Interlingua is sometimes considered a simplified, modern version of the language. Latino sine Flexione, popular in the early 20th century, is Latin with its inflections stripped away, among other grammatical changes.\n\nOne study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin (comparing phonology, inflection, discourse, syntax, vocabulary, and intonation) indicated the following percentages (the higher the percentage, the greater the distance from Latin): Sardinian 8%, Italian 12%, Spanish 20%, Romanian 23.5%, Occitan 25%, Portuguese 31%, and French 44%.\n\nThroughout European history, an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles. Instruction in Latin is an essential aspect. In today's world, a large number of Latin students in the US learn from \"Wheelock's Latin: The Classic Introductory Latin Course, Based on Ancient Authors\". This book, first published in 1956, was written by Frederic M. Wheelock, who received a PhD from Harvard University. \"Wheelock's Latin\" has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses.\n\nThe Living Latin movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication. It is available at the Vatican and at some institutions in the US, such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University. The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the Cambridge Latin Course series. It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell & Forte, which recounts the adventures of a mouse called Minimus.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Classical Association encourages the study of antiquity through various means, such as publications and grants. The University of Cambridge, the Open University, a number of prestigious independent schools, for example Eton, Harrow, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Merchant Taylor’s School, Via Facilis and Rugby, a London-based charity, run Latin courses. In the United States and in Canada, the American Classical League supports every effort to further the study of classics. Its subsidiaries include the National Junior Classical League (with more than 50,000 members), which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the National Senior Classical League, which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college. The league also sponsors the National Latin Exam. Classicist Mary Beard wrote in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it.\n\nLatin was or is the official language of European states:\n\nThe ancient pronunciation of Latin has been reconstructed; among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors, misspellings, puns, ancient etymologies, the spelling of Latin loanwords in other languages, and the historical development of Romance languages.\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Classical Latin are as follows:\n\nIn Old and Classical Latin, the Latin alphabet had no distinction between uppercase and lowercase, and the letters did not exist. In place of , were used, respectively; represented both vowels and consonants. Most of the letterforms were similar to modern uppercase, as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article.\n\nThe spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts, however, normally use in place of Classical-era . Some systems use for the consonant sounds except in the combinations for which is never used.\n\nSome notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below:\n\nIn Classical Latin, as in modern Italian, double consonant letters were pronounced as long consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants. Thus the \"nn\" in Classical Latin , year, (and in Italian ) is pronounced as a doubled as in English \"unnamed\". (In English, distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or morphemes, as in that example.)\n\nIn Classical Latin, did not exist as a letter distinct from V; the written form was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. was adopted to represent upsilon in loanwords from Greek, but it was pronounced like and by some speakers. It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning, such as sylva and ὕλη.\n\nClassical Latin distinguished between long and short vowels. Then, long vowels, except for , were frequently marked using the apex, which was sometimes similar to an acute accent . Long was written using a taller version of , called \"long I\": . In modern texts, long vowels are often indicated by a macron , and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words, when they are marked with a breve: .\n\nLong vowels in Classical Latin were pronounced with a different quality from short vowels and also were longer. The difference is described in table below:\n\nA vowel letter followed by at the end of a word, or a vowel letter followed by before or , represented a long nasal vowel, as in \"monstrum\" .\n\nClassical Latin had several diphthongs. The two most common were . was fairly rare, and were very rare, at least in native Latin words. There has also been debate over whether is truly a diphthong in Classical Latin, due to its rarity, absence in works of Roman grammarians, and the roots of Classical Latin words (i.e. to , to , etc.) not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if were to be considered a diphthong.\n\nThe sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs. and also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in \"of bronze\" and \"began\", and represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels , in \"beware!\", \"whose\", \"I warned\", \"I released\", \"I destroyed\", \"his\", and \"new\".\n\nOld Latin had more diphthongs, but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin. The Old Latin diphthong and the sequence became Classical . Old Latin and changed to Classical , except in a few words whose became Classical . These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root: for instance, Classical \"punishment\" and \"to punish\". Early Old Latin usually changed to Classical .\n\nIn Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, merged with . A similar pronunciation also existed during the Classical Latin period for less-educated speakers.\n\nLatin was written in the Latin alphabet, derived from the Old Italic script, which was in turn drawn from the Greek alphabet and ultimately the Phoenician alphabet. This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Finnic, and many Slavic languages (Polish, Slovak, Slovene, Croatian and Czech); and it has been adopted by many languages around the world, including Vietnamese, the Austronesian languages, many Turkic languages, and most languages in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, and Oceania, making it by far the world's single most widely used writing system.\n\nThe number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied. When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters. Later, \"G\" was added to represent , which had previously been spelled \"C\", and \"Z\" ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative. The letters \"Y\" and \"Z\" were later added to represent Greek letters, upsilon and zeta respectively, in Greek loanwords.\n\n\"W\" was created in the 11th century from \"VV\". It represented in Germanic languages, not Latin, which still uses \"V\" for the purpose. \"J\" was distinguished from the original \"I\" only during the late Middle Ages, as was the letter \"U\" from \"V\". Although some Latin dictionaries use \"J\", it is rarely used for Latin text, as it was not used in classical times, but many other languages use it.\n\nClassical Latin did not contain sentence punctuation, letter case, or interword spacing, but apices were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the interpunct was used at times to separate words. The first line of Catullus 3, originally written as\n\nor with interpunct as\n\nwould be rendered in a modern edition as\n\nor with macrons\n\nor with apices\n\nThe Roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts, an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Most notable is the fact that while most of the Vindolanda tablets show spaces between words, spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era.\n\nOccasionally, Latin has been written in other scripts:\n\nLatin is a synthetic, fusional language in the terminology of linguistic typology. In more traditional terminology, it is an inflected language, but typologists are apt to say \"inflecting\". Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word. The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements: \"amō\", \"I love,\" is produced from a semantic element, \"ama-\", \"love,\" to which \"-ō\", a first person singular marker, is suffixed.\n\nThe grammatical function can be changed by changing the markers: the word is \"inflected\" to express different grammatical functions, but the semantic element usually does not change. (Inflection uses affixing and infixing. Affixing is prefixing and suffixing. Latin inflections are never prefixed.)\n\nFor example, \"amābit\", \"he (or she or it) will love\", is formed from the same stem, \"amā-\", to which a future tense marker, \"-bi-\", is suffixed, and a third person singular marker, \"-t\", is suffixed. There is an inherent ambiguity: \"-t\" may denote more than one grammatical category: masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context. All natural languages contain ambiguities of one sort or another.\n\nThe inflections express gender, number, and case in adjectives, nouns, and pronouns, a process called \"declension\". Markers are also attached to fixed stems of verbs, to denote person, number, tense, voice, mood, and aspect, a process called \"conjugation\". Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and interjections.\n\nA regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions, a group of nouns with similar inflected forms. The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun. The first declension, with a predominant ending letter of \"a\", is signified by the genitive singular ending of \"-ae\". The second declension, with a predominant ending letter of \"o\", is signified by the genitive singular ending of \"-i\". The third declension, with a predominant ending letter of \"i\", is signified by the genitive singular ending of \"-is\". The fourth declension, with a predominant ending letter of \"u\", is signified by the genitive singular ending of \"-ūs\". The fifth declension, with a predominant ending letter of \"e\", is signified by the genitive singular ending of \"-ei\".\n\nThere are seven Latin noun cases, which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a noun's syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections. Thus, word order is not as important in Latin as it is in English, which is less inflected. The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary. The cases are as follows:\n\n\nLatin lacks both definite and indefinite articles so \"puer currit\" can mean either \"the boy is running\" or \"a boy is running\". Also, the sentence \"coquus in culina laborat\" could mean \"the cook works in the kitchen\" or \"the cook is working in the kitchen.\"\n\nThere are two types of regular Latin adjectives: first- and second- declension and third-declension. They are so-called because their forms are similar or identical to first- and second-declension and third-declension nouns, respectively. Latin adjectives also have comparative (more --, \"-er\") and superlative (most --, \"est\") forms. There are also a number of Latin participles.\n\nLatin numbers are sometimes declined. See \"Numbers\" below.\n\nFirst and second-declension adjectives are declined like first-declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second-declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms. For example, for \"mortuus, mortua, mortuum\" (dead), \"mortua\" is declined like a regular first-declension noun (such as \"puella\" (girl)), \"mortuus\" is declined like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as \"dominus\" (lord, master)), and \"mortuum\" is declined like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as \"auxilium\" (help)).\n\nSome first and second declension adjectives have an \"-er\" as the masculine nominative singular form and are declined like regular first- and second-declension adjectives. Some but not all adjectives keep the \"e\" for all of the forms.\n\nThird-declension adjectives are mostly declined like normal third-declension nouns, with a few exceptions. In the plural nominative neuter, for example, the ending is \"-ia\" (\"omnia\" (all, everything)), and for third-declension nouns, the plural nominative neuter ending is \"-a\" or \"-ia\" (\"capita\" (heads), \"animalia\" (animals)) They can have one, two or three forms for the masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular.\n\nLatin participles, like English participles, are formed from a verb. There are a few main types of participles: Present Active Participles, Perfect Passive Participles, Future Active Participles, and Future Passive Participles.\n\nLatin sometimes uses prepositions, depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used. Prepositions can take two cases for their object: the accusative (\"apud puerum\" (with the boy), with \"puerum\" being the accusative form of \"puer\", boy) and the ablative (\"sine puero\" (without the boy), \"puero\" being the ablative form of \"puer\", boy).\n\nA regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main conjugations. A conjugation is \"a class of verbs with similar inflected forms.\" The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verb's present stem. The present stem can be found by omitting the -\"re\" (-\"rī\" in deponent verbs) ending from the present infinitive form. The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in \"-ā-re\" or \"-ā-ri\" (active and passive respectively): \"amāre\", \"to love,\" \"hortārī\", \"to exhort\"; of the second conjugation by \"-ē-re\" or \"-ē-rī\": \"monēre\", \"to warn\", \"verērī\", \"to fear;\" of the third conjugation by \"-ere\", \"-ī\": \"dūcere\", \"to lead,\" \"ūtī\", \"to use\"; of the fourth by \"-ī-re\", \"-ī-rī\": \"audīre\", \"to hear,\" \"experīrī\", \"to attempt\".\n\nIrregular verbs may not follow the types or may be marked in a different way. The \"endings\" presented above are not the suffixed infinitive markers. The first letter in each case is the last of the stem so the conjugations are also called a-conjugation, e-conjugation and i-conjugation. The fused infinitive ending is -\"re\" or -\"rī\". Third-conjugation stems end in a consonant: the consonant conjugation. Further, there is a subset of the third conjugation, the i-stems, which behave somewhat like the fourth conjugation, as they are both i-stems, one short and the other long. The stem categories descend from Indo-European and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo-European languages.\n\nThere are six general tenses in Latin (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect), three moods (indicative, imperative and subjunctive, in addition to the infinitive, participle, gerund, gerundive and supine), three persons (first, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural), two voices (active and passive) and three aspects (perfective, imperfective, and stative). Verbs are described by four principal parts:\n\n\nThere are six tenses in the Latin language. These are divided into two tense systems: the present system, which is made up of the present, imperfect and future tenses, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses. Each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person and number referred to. Subject (nominative) pronouns are generally omitted for the first (\"I, we\") and second (\"you\") persons unless emphasis on the subject is desired.\n\nThe table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses. For the future tense, the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations, and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations:\nThe future perfect endings are identical to the future forms of \"sum\" (with the exception of \"erint\") and that the pluperfect endings are identical to the imperfect forms of \"sum\".\n\nSome Latin verbs are deponent, causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: \"hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum (to urge).\n\nAs Latin is an Italic language, most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic, ultimately from the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language. However, because of close cultural interaction, the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some Etruscan words into their language, including \"persona\" \"mask\" and \"histrio\" \"actor\". Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from Oscan, another Italic language.\n\nAfter the Fall of Tarentum (272 BC), the Romans began hellenizing, or adopting features of Greek culture, including the borrowing of Greek words, such as \"camera\" (vaulted roof), \"sumbolum\" (symbol), and \"balineum\" (bath). This hellenization led to the addition of \"Y\" and \"Z\" to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds. Subsequently the Romans transplanted Greek art, medicine, science and philosophy to Italy, paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece. Thus, many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words, as \"ars\" (craft) and τέχνη (art).\n\nBecause of the Roman Empire's expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes, the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words, such as \"beber\" (beaver), of Germanic origin, and \"bracae\" (breeches), of Celtic origin. The specific dialects of Latin across Latin-speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions. The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages.\n\nDuring and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society, Christian vocabulary became a part of the language, either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms. Continuing into the Middle Ages, Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages, including Old English and other Germanic languages.\n\nOver the ages, Latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives, nouns, and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments. For example, the compound adjective, \"omnipotens\", \"all-powerful,\" was produced from the adjectives \"omnis\", \"all\", and \"potens\", \"powerful\", by dropping the final \"s\" of \"omnis\" and concatenating. Often, the concatenation changed the part of speech, and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives.\n\nThe phrases are mentioned with accents to show where stress is placed. In Latin, most words are stressed at the second-last (penultimate) syllable, called in Latin \"paenultima\" or \"syllaba paenultima\". A few words are stressed at the third-last syllable, called in Latin \"antepaenultima\" or \"syllaba antepaenultima\".\n\nsálve / salvéte – hello\n\náve / avéte – greetings\n\nvále / valéte – goodbye\n\ncúra ut váleas – take care\n\nexoptátus / exoptáta , optátus / optáta , grátus / gráta , accéptus / accépta – welcome\n\nquómodo váles?, ut váles? – how are you?\n\nbonus – good\n\namabo te – please\n\nbéne váleo – I'm fine\n\nmále – bad\n\nmále váleo – I'm not good\n\nquáeso (['kwajso]/['kwe:so]) – please\n\níta, íta est, íta véro, sic, sic est, étiam – yes\n\nnon, minime – no\n\ngrátias tíbi, grátias tíbi ágo – thank you, I give thanks to you\n\nmágnas grátias, mágnas grátias ágo – many thanks\n\nmáximas grátias, máximas grátias ágo, ingéntes grátias ágo – thank you very much\n\naccípe sis / accípite sítis , libénter – you're welcome\n\nqua aetáte es? – how old are you?\n\n25 ánnos nátus / 25 ánnos náta – 25 years old\n\nloquerísne ... – do you speak ...\n\núbi latrína est? – where is the toilet?\n\námo te / te ámo – I love you\n\nIn ancient times, numbers in Latin were written only with letters. Today, the numbers can be written with the Arabic numbers as well as with Roman numerals. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 and every whole hundred from 200 to 900 are declined as nouns and adjectives, with some differences.\n\nThe numbers from 4 to 100 often do not change their endings.\n\n\"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", also called \"De Bello Gallico\" (\"The Gallic War\"), written by Gaius Julius Caesar, begins with the following passage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The sections below show two separate classifications:\n\nIn 2003 Aptivate was founded as a nonprofit company limited by guarantee in Cambridge, UK, to solve the problems aid workers experienced accessing the internet in low bandwidth environments. (Its name at the time of incorporation was AidWorld; this changed in 2005).\n\nOver subsequent years, Aptivate's technical work has expanded to include building web sites, integrating mobile data gathering systems, producing systems for data visualization, and developing the open-source monitoring and evaluation platform Kashana. Aptivate has also expanded its work to include training in various technical subjects, consultancy, and authoring of related works. Aptivate provided the lead authors on the World Bank Guide to Digital Citizen Engagement, to be published in Autumn 2015.\n\nIn 2001 the United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force was formed to address a variety of ICT4Dev topics. The Task Force held semi-annual meetings focusing on specific themes, including a \"Global Forum on Internet Governance\" (UN headquarters in New York, March 2004); a \"Global Forum on an Enabling Environment\" (Berlin, November 2004); and a Global Forum on Harnessing the Potential of ICTs in Education (Dublin, April 2005). The UN ICT Task Force's mandate ended on December 31, 2005. A new group, called the 'Global Alliance for ICT and Development', was created to continue much of the work of the UN ICTTF.\n\nIn November 2002, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a call for Silicon Valley to create the computers and communications systems that would enable villages to leapfrog several generations of technology and enter the Information Age directly. This would provide the technical basis for WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) discussions.\n\nThis United Nations initiative held summits in Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005. After Tunis a Plan of Action is being followed, with a ten-year deadline ending in 2015. This parallels the timeframe for the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nIn 2006, at the end of his tenure, outgoing UN Secretary General Kofi Annan launched the Global Alliance for ICT and Development (GAID).\n\nIt is described as a \"multi-stakeholder forum\" and a \"cross-sectoral platform and forum that will bring together all stakeholders representing relevant constituencies\". It includes a large number of persons from the fields of government, development cooperation, foreign policy, finance, the social sector (health, education), regulatory agencies, industry and workers' associations, producers and consumers of ICT, the media, non-governmental organisations, community social organisations, foundations, scientific, academic and ICT communities and \"individuals providing advocacy and oversight on Information Society issues and implementing programs addressing the United Nations' MDGs Millennium Development Goals.\"\n\nGAID is led by a steering committee, with Intel's Craig Barrett as its chairman.\n\nIt has a Strategy Council, a set of high-level advisors, and a \"champions' network\". The Global Alliance for ICT and Development held its first meeting on June 19 and June 20, 2006 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nGAID Global Forum 2010 was organized in partnership with the government of Abu Dhabi on December 5–6, 2010. The theme for 2010 forum was \"ICT for MDGs: Moving from Advocacy to Action.\" It was attended by members from governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations. Archived videos from the forum are available on the GAID website www.un-gaid.org or GAID Global Forum 2010.\n\nThe United Nations—through its various organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme's Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) – has brought out a number of publications. Many are published with shareable content licenses. Specifically in the field of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), the International Open Source Network (IOSN) has been an active player.\n\nUNDP-APDIP publishes two series of e-primers, namely the e-Primers for the Information Economy, Society and Polity and the e-Primers on Free/Open Source Software. The former series details the concepts, issues and trends surrounding the information economy, society and polity. It intends to raise awareness and help policy makers and planners understand the relevance of information and communications technology (ICT) for development, by explaining technical jargon in simple terms. The latter series serves as an introduction to various aspects and dimensions of FLOSS, with country case-studies. It aims to raise awareness on FLOSS issues and support capacity building efforts.\n\nThe IDRC is a Canadian governmental agency (crown corporation) that has a very broad programme which includes many small to mid-sized ICT4Dev projects. The IDRC is also one of the major sponsors of the telecentre.org movement.\n\nOLPC is a high-profile project initiated by Nicholas Negroponte. Several large companies are members of the organisation including MIT and chip manufacturer AMD. It had a wide open source community. The aim is to produce laptops cheaply enough to provide them to every school child in the world. Through its bold and controversial aim, the project has generated much exposure for ICT4Dev in general.\n\nThe 50x15-project is a similar worldwide project, offering low-cost computers from a variety of manufacturers.\n\nZidisha is an online peer-to-peer lending platform that allows individuals in developing countries to raise microfinance loans from individuals worldwide. Unlike earlier microfinancing websites such as Kiva, Zidisha does not work through local intermediary organizations. Instead, the individual borrowers themselves use the Zidisha website to create Facebook-style profiles and negotiate loans with individuals in the US and Europe. Zidisha lenders and borrowers dialogue with each other directly in the loan profile pages and Zidisha forum.\n\nFounded in 1998 Computer Aid International is a not-for-profit organisation that facilitates the practical application of ICT4Dev solutions to social development challenges. Computer Aid provides resources and project management inputs to projects in focal areas for ICT4Dev that include eLearning, eInclusion, eHealth and rural connectivity. Current initiatives include the promotion and training of the open learning platform Moodle in Africa universities; development of FLOSS software for blind and visually impaired users; telemedicine projects for rural hospitals; advocacy around eWaste and a wide variety of school initiatives. Computer Aid is perhaps most well known for having provided over 160,000 professionally refurbished PCs to educational institutions and not-for-profit development organisations in more than 100 different developing countries.\n\nFounded in 2002, Dimagi Inc. is a software social enterprise that develops scalable, open source ICT solutions for low-resource settings. Dimagi has performed technical strategy, systems design, software development, and research for 100+ projects worldwide, and its core product suite support thousands of Frontline Workers in over 40 countries. Dimagi rapidly iterates and adapts its technologies to the local environment, creating appropriate, scalable, and sustainable solutions. Dimagi has a history of executing ICT4D projects as a technical lead, partnered with an in-country implementation lead. This model has been implemented for pilot-phase projects through enterprise-wide deployments with over 75 partners, including WHO, World Bank, USAID, CDC, World Vision, UNICEF, PATH, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Dimagi also has experience conducting research on ICT4D, which has led to 18 peer-reviewed publications about its primary mobile health platform, CommCare.\n\nInveneo is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in San Francisco with focus on ICT4Dev mostly in Uganda. The organization developed thin client called Inveneo Computing Station, which is similarly to Linutop 2 based on a reference design ION A603 mini PC by First International Computer and runs AMD Geode CPU. Inveneo also helped to set up a communication system for relief workers after Hurricane Katrina. Jamais Cascio, a co-founder of WorldChanging, featured Inveneo in July 2005.\n\nThe International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD) is a non-profit foundation that specialises in ICT as a tool for development. It was founded in 1996 by the Dutch Ministry for Development Cooperation to help developing countries in their efforts to overcome the digital divide. IICD works in the sectors Education, Livelihoods, Health and Governance.\n\nIICD works closely with public, private and not-for-profit partners in Africa and Latin America. It brings a wide variety of local stakeholders together – teachers, farmers, health workers, local government officials and civil servants – to help formulate and implement their own ICT-supported development policies and programmes. This includes market price information systems for farmers; ICT centres for rural economic development; telemedicine to bring specialist medical knowledge to isolated areas; ICT-enabled learning materials to improve the quality of teaching.\n\nThe Swedish Program for ICT in Developing Regions SPIDER is a resource center for ICT for Development. Spider was established in 2004 and is primarily financed by the Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida), with complementary funding from Stockholm University. The center is administered by the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV) at Stockholm University.\n\nNetHope, Inc., founded in 2001, is a consortium of 35 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that specializes in improving IT connectivity among humanitarian organizations in developing countries and areas affected by disaster. The organization has partnerships with Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel, and Accenture. Its humanitarian development, emergency response, and conservation programs are in place in 180 countries worldwide.\n\nRugged Communications delivers holistic connectivity solutions to rural areas in developing countries. They simplify the rural telecommunications ecosystem, connecting operators, rural people, vendors, regulators, and financiers together to produce contextually-appropriate connectivity solutions. These systems are typically solar-powered, delivering free electricity to these communities as well. Rugged Communications holds several partnerships with multinational telecommunications operators and has won or been a finalist in many large competitions, like Verizon's $1,000,000 Powerful Answers Award.\n\nSarvodaya-Fusion is a social enterprise specialising in ICT4D in Sri Lanka. The organisation collaborates with government, corporate partners and civil society organisations with the aim of the e-empowerment of rural communities. As a specialized branch of the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, it has pioneered the use of rural telecentres to provide a sustainable education model in over one hundred locations across the island called Fusion Education. In 2007 Sarvodaya-Fusion introduced the first ever Mobile4Development application for agriculture through the SMS trading service FarmerNet. In 2011, it launched the SmartVillage project that integrated Android Smartphone technology and social networking as a tool for community development.\n\nSarvodaya-Fusion was featured in the UNCTAD 2012 Information Economy Report that detailed the organisation's partnership with mobile telecommunications provider Etisalat Lanka. The project introduced smart devices and locally relevant apps to rural communities in Sri Lanka.\n\nSOS Children's Villages\n\nSOS children's villages has several ICT4D initiatives in her different programs; in Kenya, SOS implements a literacy program dubbed OSL(Open space literacy), in this, children are given opportunity to interact with digital technologies and learn literacy through digital educational contents. http://www.sos-childrensvillageskenya.org/index.php/ict-for-development/58-ict-for-development, for more information, follow the following link www.sos-childrensvillages.org\n\nTechChange: The Institute of Technology and Social Change is a US-based social enterprise that delivers online certificate courses and workshops in topics related to ICT4D such as technology for emergency management, mobile phones for international development, mHealth, social media for social change, citizen journalism, participatory mapping social entrepreneurship, digital organizing, open government, intrapreneurship and more.\n\nBIID is a Bangladesh-based inclusive business initiative engaged in developing ICT enabled products and services to support private and public (Government and NGO) initiatives targeted for the BoP (Base of the Pyramid) segment in particular and citizens in general in providing them with access to ICTs and ICT enabled information and services. BIID envisions wide range of opportunities in the ICT4D sector in developing countries. .\n\nCurrently BIID is working in numerous sectors using ICTs to reach customers and partners more efficiently and to bring relevant services closer to communities in which citizens reside. With the help of ICTs, BIID is working in different sectors and services.\n\nHowever, there exists no impact assessment report that might claim its success in the areas it is involved, reflecting on the experiences of its target beneficiaries.\n\nMicrosoft started to offer special developing world Windows version dubbed \"Starter edition\" since Windows XP, which is cheaper than other editions, has limited application functions, network connectivity and is restricted to low-end hardware.\n\nMicrosoft sees sub-Saharan Africa as one of the last great computing frontiers and wants to make Windows a fixture there. The company has established a presence in 13 countries and has donated Windows for thousands of school computers and funded programs for entrepreneurs and the youth and has used aggressive business tactics aimed at Linux, which is its biggest threat in the region. The company also makes a kind of ICT4Dev service with its \"Unlimited Potential\" program.\n\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the IMARA organization (from Swahili word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, installed and donated computer setups in greater Boston, Massachusetts, Kenya, Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the Navajo Nation, the Middle East, and Fiji Islands. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.\n\nThe institute also runs the \"Entrepreneurial Programming and Research on Mobiles\" and \"Africa Information Technology Initiative\" which focus on ICT4Dev.\n\nThe Berkman Institute at MIT is also strongly engaged in communication towards bridging the digital divide.\n\n\n"}

Though she had limited schooling, she was the first American woman to rebel against discrimination towards women in industry, refusing to accept a woman's pay rate after doing a man's job. Greene was also an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. She died in 1900.\n\nLouisa Morton Willard was born in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, May 23, 1819. She is a descendant from sturdy New England ancestors. Her father, Henry Willard. blacksmith and farmer, removed from Vermont and settled in Ashburnham in the early years of the present century. Bereft of both parents in early childhood, she was deprived of schooling and thrown upon her own resources at the age of 13. \n\nShe obtained employment in a woolen factory in Dedham, Massachusetts, and worked for several years for the pittance of US$1.00 to $2.00 per week and board, working 14 hours a day. There, upon the heads of bobbins, she learned to write. Notwithstanding her long hours of labor, she found time for constant improvement by reading and study. Her habits of strict economy enabled her to save a portion of her wages, and at the age of 17 she had $150.00 in the bank. Then came her first revolt against the injustice shown to women in industrial pursuits. Gross discrimination in the matter of wages was made, simply on the ground of sex. Called upon at one time to take a man's place at a spindle, she performed her duties well and to the satisfaction of her employer. When pay-day came around and she demanded the same compensation that the man had been securing, her request was received with amazement. The plucky young girl stood her ground and refused to return to the spindle unless paid at the same rate as the man whose place she was filling. She was promptly dismissed from the factory, to be recalled a few weeks later at a higher rate of pay. \n\nIn 1840, she taught school near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There, she formed the acquaintance of Jonas Greene, of Maine, and they married in 1841. Mr. Greene subsequently became a prominent politician, representing his district in each branch of the State legislature for several successive terms. His success in life he ascribed largely to the cooperation and support of his wife. Removing with her husband to the then somewhat sparsely settled Oxford County, Maine, a new and active life opened for her. While performing faithfully her duties, she found time to enter into the philanthropic and reform work of the times. Early becoming a convert to the Water cure system of treating the sick, she familiarized herself with it and soon developed a remarkable ability for the care and treatment of the sick. Physicians and medicines were unknown in her household, and her skill was in demand in the community. \n\nIn 1850, Greene began to espouse the anti-slavery cause. She and others gathered women together and organized anti-slavery societies. Literature was distributed, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was read, and she wrote many articles for the local papers. During the American Civil War, Greene's patriotic labors were untiring. When hospital supplies were needed, she collected, prepared and forwarded them. Greene's newspaper contributions for years covered a wide range of subjects. She was an early champion of the temperance and suffrage causes in her writing and speaking engagements. In 1869, she removed with her family to Manassas, Virginia, where her husband died in 1873. With advancing years, Greene withdrew from active philanthropic work. She died March 5, 1900.\n\n\n"}

Some in Brazil also speak Portuguese, while some in Venezuela speak Spanish, and some in Guyana speak English. The Macushi language is written in the Latin script, and the New Testament was translated into the language in 1996.\n\nThey live in villages linked together by tracks and paths, with houses built round a central courtyard.

The word is derived from the Latin \"bacillum\" (\"little staff\"). \"Makila\" itself carries certain connotations, for instance in the verb form, \"makilatu\", meaning \"to bludgeon\", or the derived \"makila-ukaldi\", meaning \"club-strike\" or \"mace-strike\". The term outside of Basque country has come to be associated with the unique walking stick carried by Basques.\n\nThe makila walking stick consists of an engraved medlar wood shaft cut to a length to suit its owner, generally either hipbone or sternum-height, . The bottom is often shod with steel or other metal and ends in a ferrule (blunt spike for traction). The handle is also often covered with metal or woven leather to form a hand-grip, with a lanyard attached to the bottom of this grip. The stick is capped with a flattened knob or pommel, made of horn, steel, or bronze. The top portion consisting of the knob and hand-grip can be pulled off the top of the stick, revealing a hidden spike or blade, which effectively turns the stick into a short spear. The pommel's shape is said to resemble the beret worn by the basque shepherd.\n\nSome makila are created for ceremonial purposes, often presented as gifts or awards to individuals. They are decorated with elaborate engravings and their metal parts are made of silver or gold. These are often 1.2 m (4 ft) long rather than a custom length.\n\nThe design of the makila is centuries old, and remains largely unchanged. There is little information known on its exact origin, but it may possibly be related to medieval times, as a concealable derivative of a particular form of lance or hunting spear.\n\nThe manufacturing process is as rooted in tradition as the finished product, and can take years to complete. It begins in spring, with the craftsman selecting a suitable branch from a medlar tree and carving a design into the living wood while it is still attached. The branch is left alone until late fall, during which the wood heals and expands the design on its surface. The craftsman must then return to where he found the tree and cut the branch down. The bark is then stripped off and the shaft is straightened out using careful heating in a kiln. After this, the stick must be dried by being stored for several years. Once this has happened, the wood is stained using a secret method, and then fitted with the various metal bands and fittings. The craftsman will sign his work with his family symbol or name, and also will engrave the handle or pommel with the recipients name, family crest or other text as requested.\n\nThe makila is a practical walking stick and a weapon for self-defense. They were (and still are) carried by shepherds to help guide their flocks as well as defend against wolves and other wild predators. They are carried by hunters and hikers in the Basque country as walking aids, and they are used in traditional folk dances.\n\nThe makila can be swung by the handle for fast, light strikes or used the opposite way to strike with the pommel as an effective bludgeon. The concealed spike can be used to deadly effect either as a thrusting weapon, or thrown as a last resort.\n\n"}
{"id": "11692063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11692063", "title": "Malayan languages", "text": "Malayan languages\n\nThe Malay or Malayan languages are a group of closely related languages spoken by Malays and related peoples across Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Southern Thailand, and the far southern parts of the Philippines. They have traditionally been classified as Malay, Para-Malay, and Aboriginal Malay, but this reflects geography and ethnicity rather than a proper linguistic classification. The Malayan languages are mutually intelligible to varying extents, though the distinction between language and dialect is unclear in many cases.\n\nPara-Malay includes the Malayan languages of Sumatra. They are: Minangkabau, Central Malay (Bengkulu), Pekal, Musi (Palembang), Negeri Sembilan (Malaysia), and Duano’.\n\nAboriginal Malay are the Malayan languages spoken by the Orang Asli (Proto-Malay) in Malaya. They are Jakun, Orang Kanaq, Orang Seletar, and Temuan.\n\nThe other Malayan languages, included in neither of these groups, are associated with the expansion of the Malays across the archipelago. They include Malaccan Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Kedah Malay, Kedayan/Brunei Malay, Berau Malay, Bangka Malay, Jambi Malay, Kutai Malay, Loncong, Pattani Malay, and Banjarese.\n\nThere are also several Malay-based creole languages, such as Betawi, Cocos Malay, Manado Malay and Sabah Malay, which may be more or less distinct from standard (Malaccan) Malay.\n\nThe extent to which Malay and related Malayan languages are used in the countries where it is spoken varies depending on historical and cultural circumstances. Malay is the national language in Malaysia by Article 152 of the Constitution of Malaysia, and became the sole official language in West Malaysia in 1968, and in East Malaysia gradually from 1974. English continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts. Other minority languages are also commonly used by the country's large ethnic minorities. The situation in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia.\n\nIn Singapore, Malay was historically the \"lingua franca\" among people of different nationalities. Although this has largely given way to English, Malay still retains the status of national language and the national anthem, Majulah Singapura, is entirely in Malay. In addition, parade commands in the military, police and civil defence are given only in Malay.\n\nMost residents of the five southernmost provinces of Thailand — a region that, for the most part, used to be part of an ancient Malay kingdom called Pattani — speak a dialect of Malay called Yawi (not to be confused with Jawi), which is similar to Kelantanese Malay, but the language has no official status or recognition.\n\nOwing to earlier contact with the Philippines, Malay words — such as \"dalam hati\" (sympathy), \"luwalhati\" (glory), \"tengah hari\" (midday), \"sedap\" (delicious) — have evolved and been integrated into Tagalog and other Philippine languages.\n\nBy contrast, Indonesian has successfully become the \"lingua franca\" for its disparate islands and ethnic groups, in part because the colonial language, Dutch, is no longer commonly spoken. (In East Timor, which was governed as a province of Indonesia from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian is widely spoken and recognized under its Constitution as a 'working language'.)\n\nBesides Indonesian, which developed from the Malaccan dialect, there are many Malay dialects spoken in Indonesia, it is divided into western and eastern groups. Western Malay varieties is predominantly spoken in Sumatra and Borneo, which itself is divided into Bornean and Sumatran Malay, some of the most widely spoken Sumatran Malay varieties are Riau Malay, Langkat, Palembang Malay and Jambi Malay. Minangkabau, Kerinci and Bengkulu are believed to be Sumatran Malay descendants. Meanwhile, Jakarta dialect (known as Betawi) also belongs to the western Malay group.\n\nThe eastern dialects are spoken in the easternmost part of the Indonesian archipelago and include: Manado dialect Manado Malay (in north Sulawesi) and Maluku, North Maluku and Papua dialects.\nThe differences among both groups are quite observable. For example, the word 'kita' means \"we, us\" in western, but means \"I, me\" in Manado, whereas \"we, us\" in Manado is 'torang' and Ambon 'katong' (originally abbreviated from Malay 'kita orang' (means \"we people\"). Another difference is the lack of possessive pronouns (and suffixes) in eastern dialects. Manado uses the verb 'pe' and Ambon 'pu' (from Malay 'punya', meaning \"to have\") to mark possession. So \"my name\" and \"our house\" are translated in western Malay as 'namaku' and 'rumah kita' but 'kita pe nama' and 'torang pe rumah' in Manado and 'beta pu nama', 'katong pu rumah' in Ambon dialect.\n\nThe pronunciation may vary in western dialects, especially the pronunciation of words ending in the vowel 'a'. For example, Malaysian pronounce 'kita' (inclusive we, us, our) as /kitə/, Kelantan and Southern Thailand as /kitɔ/, Riau as /kita/, Palembang as /kito/, Betawi and Perak as /kitɛ/.\n\nBatavian and eastern dialects are sometimes regarded as Malay creole, because the speakers are not ethnically Malay.\n\nA comparison of various varieties of Malay, plus three Para-Malay languages and one Aboriginal Malay language:\n\nEnglish = Where are you going on this bicycle? May I go with you?\n\nIn ISO 639-1 there is 'ms', ISO 639-2 there are two codes: 'may'/'msa'. In ISO 639-3, 'msa' is defined as a \"macrolanguage\".\n\n"}

Etymologically \"blat\" means \"dough\" and a term for designing clandestine travelling in a city bus (has no plural form).\nSo a \"blătar\" fixes matches and a \"blatist\" travels without a bus ticket.\n\nBlats are more related to the period before the Romanian Revolution of 1989.\nThe Communist local and central administration had a decisive role in designating the teams who will play in the next season in the first division.\nHence presidents agreed to help each other to avoid relegation from the first division.\nThis informal and dirty association was called \"cooperativa\" (first used in 1992 by former international footballer and current football analyst Cornel Dinu from a term which designated the Communist system of agricultural common association) and was composed by 3 or maximum 5 influential presidents.\nIn 1995 Dumitru Dragomir, a former president of Victoria Bucarest football team and the current long-serving president of the domestic league LPF admitted during a televised debate to being formerly involved in such deals.\n\nBlat is also used by a term of \"reciprocity\" where two football chiefs accept that each of their team to win their home match in a direct confrontation of domestic champion round.\n\nAfter Communism collapsed the phenomenon of Blat was related to the development of informal economy. The media raised awareness about such apparent dealings though thus far never leading to serious investigations for corruption.\nMany football club owners, especially outside Bucharest, agreed to create an informal association between 3 or 5 owners with the aim of helping each other and involved other teams to join this \"gang\".\nThat method consist in letting each of the involved teams to win the home matches, accepting to lose the away matches.\nThe most prolific football club chief who was the creator of this cartel is Jean Padureanu (also known as \"The Lord\"), president of Gloria Bistriţa, also known in the Romanian media as the Father of Blaturi.\nThe list includes Gheorghe Ştefan (also known as \"Pinalti\"), president of Ceahlăul Piatra Neamţ, and Romeo Paşcu (also known as \"Breakdance\"), president of FC Braşov.\nCornel Dinu also named DIVIZIA A as \"championship of Jenel(Padureanu), Romel(Pascu)and Fanel(Stefan)\" because these three chiefs had more influence in the decision of results.\nDuring 1999 and 2001 the team of Rocar owned by former Securitate officer and Ceauşescu bodyguard Gheorghe (Gigi) Netoiu was named as \"champion of blaturi\" in local media..\n\nThe period between 1992 and 2002 has been described by some as the \"blat\" era of Romanian football. After this period the Liga 1 clubs saw some of the poorest results for Romanian teams in European Competitions.\n\nDuring these years there was no punitive measure taken by central football authority organisms like FRF (the Romanian Football Federation) or LPF (the Romanian Professional Football League) to stop it.\nAfter the Romanian football was ranked as the cheapest and one of the less spectacular championships in the world, new club owners took the decision to remove their clubs from such agreements with the potential of playing competitively again.\nIn 2003 after losing qualification for the second final football tournament, the president of the club FCM Bacău Dumitru Sechelariu admitted on a live football talk show equally that he was strongly involved in fixed matches and that there was an association of two or three presidents who did the same, proposing to stop these practice.\nThis was a turning and a decisive point in the eradication of the \"blat\" policy.\nAfter that, the number of fixed matches decreased and many domestic championship results were again the consequence of fair matches.\nThe press admitted that competitive run during the 2005-2006 European of Romanian teams was a normal consequence of eradication of \"blaturi\" due to a strong and long anti-\"blat\" campaign.\n\n"}

{"id": "2306470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2306470", "title": "Qiviut", "text": "Qiviut\n\nQiviuq [sg] or qiviut [pl] ( ; Inuktitut syllabics, ᕿᕕᐅᖅ; Inuinnaqtun, qiviuq; Inupiaq qiviu or qiviuq sometimes spelled qiveut) is the inner wool of the muskox. In Inuktitut the same word can be used to refer to the down feathers of birds. \n\nThe muskox has a two-layered coat, and \"qiviut\" refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The muskox sheds this layer of wool each spring. Qiviut is plucked from the coat of the muskox during the molt or gathered from objects the animals have brushed against; unlike sheep, the animals are not sheared. Much of the commercially available qiviut comes from Canada, and is obtained from the pelts of muskoxen after hunts. In Alaska, qiviut is obtained from farmed animals or gathered from the wild during the molt.\n\nQiviut is stronger and warmer than sheep's wool, and softer than cashmere wool. Wild muskoxen have qiviut fibers approximately 18 micrometres in diameter. Females and young animals have slightly finer wool. Unlike sheep's wool, it does not shrink in water at any temperature, but this means that it also is not useful for felting.\n\nIt is most commonly used for hats and scarves, and is among the softest wools. It is very expensive; a high quality knitted scarf can cost more than $300 U.S., but will last over 20 years with good care.\n\nAn adult muskox can produce of qiviut a year. Qiviut is produced by the muskox's secondary hair follicles, which are not associated with sebaceous glands, and therefore is a much drier fiber than wool, having only about 7 percent oils. The hair follicle density is very high (approximately ) and qiviut is shed in a tightly synchronized spring molting period. The qiviut will loosen from the animal's skin and pull away slightly, creating a \"spectacled\" look around the eyes and becoming visible all over the body at the surface of the pelt. At this stage of the molt, the undercoat is a short but relatively uniform distance from the skin. This lends itself to combing the qiviut from the animal in a single large sheet. If not combed, the qiviut will begin to fall out in clumps or be rubbed off by the animal, and may be plucked off the ground or bushes, but qiviut collected this way is of lower quality and requires more cleaning.\n\nAt the Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station (LARS), a modified bison crush is used to gently but firmly hold the muskoxen in place, and the pelt combed out using a long-toothed comb or hair pick. After the fleece is removed, it is cleaned by hand, removing vegetation and other foreign matter, and then dehaired. Dehairing is the removal of intermediate hairs (greater than in diameter). Dehairing is accomplished by carding as one would cashmere. Mechanical carding can cause breakage and weaken and roughen the qiviut. Because the pelt is combed rather than shaved, there are very few guard hairs using this method. Pelts from hunted animals are shaved, so the dehairing process in this case is more laborious. After dehairing, the qiviut may be cleaned again, if necessary.\n\nThe raw, cleaned qiviut is spun and then the yarn is washed. Natural qiviut is soft grayish brown in color, but it takes dye well and can be found for sale in myriad colors. Bleaching weakens the fiber, however, so many spinners and knitters recommend using only overdyed natural qiveut, which has darker, more subdued colors.\n\nDomestication of the muskox was begun with the Musk Ox Project, headed by John J. Teal, Jr with the first domestic muskox farm in Fairbanks, Alaska. The project continues at the muskox farm in Palmer, Alaska. Oomingmak, the Musk Ox Producers' Cooperative, was formed in the late 1960s by indigenous women on Nunivak Island, with the help of Dr. Teal and Mrs. L. Schell. It is a knitting cooperative that works with qiviut and is still in operation today. The cooperative has its headquarters in Anchorage, Alaska and is owned by approximately 200 native Alaskans from many remote villages in Alaska. The name of the cooperative comes from the Inuit language word for muskox, \"umiŋmak\", \"the animal with skin like a beard.\"\n\n"}

(Most exchanges though have several exchange codes.) Within Australia, the area code is only required to call from one area code to another.\n\nAustralia is divided geographically into a small number of large area codes, some of which cover more than one state and territory. Prior to the introduction of eight-digit numbers in the early-to-mid-1990's, telephone numbers were seven digits in the major capital cities, with a double - digit area code, and six digits in other areas with a three - digit area code. There were more than sixty such codes by 1990, with numbers running out, thus spurring the reorganization.\n\nFollowing reorganization of the numbering plan between 1994 and 1998, the following numbering ranges are now used:\n\nNational numbers have no geographic significance. Other numbers relate to a particular telephone service area.\n\nHowever, allowances are made for regional variations; sometimes the codes do not strictly follow state borders. For example, Broken Hill in New South Wales uses the 08 area code, due to its closer proximity to Adelaide than the state capital Sydney, and Broken Hill area's inclusion in the Australian Central Standard Time zone. The previous area code for Broken Hill was (080). Other examples include towns in Southern New South Wales close to the border with Victoria that use the 03 (Victoria and Tasmania) prefix, including: Balranald, Wentworth and Deniliquin). Some parts of the Tweed Coast of New South Wales have an area code of 07 followed by a subscriber number of 55xx xxxx (and new numbers 56xx xxxx). This means it is the cost of a local call to phone the Gold Coast in neighbouring Queensland, since the metropolis covers both sides of the NSW/Qld border.

The domestic long distance prefix is '0'.\n\nThe dialing plan used in NZ reflects the national structure implemented by the New Zealand Post Office prior to the privatisation of the telecommunications services (and the creation of the Telecom New Zealand corporation). Domestic phone numbers with a first digit in range 2-8 are generally managed by Telecom. Phone numbers beginning with 9 are usually those from other companies, for example TelstraClear. These allocations were firm until April 2007, whereupon full number portability was introduced; numbers can now be moved between carriers. . There are currently no regions issued numbers starting with 1 - except for the national emergency services access number, '111'.\n\nThere are five regional area codes in use for landline calls, For example, a domestic toll call destined for a South Island location requires the dial prefix '03', being domestic-long-distance + 3 for the South Island.\n\nMobile phone numbers are prefixed with 02, followed by one digit and the subscriber's number, which is either six, seven or eight digits, dialled in full, e.g. 021 xxx xxx or 027 xxx xxxx.

{"id": "6982030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6982030", "title": "Tom Murton", "text": "Tom Murton\n\nThomas O. \"Tom\" Murton (March 15, 1928 – October 10, 1990) was a penologist best known for his wardenship of the prison farms of Arkansas. In 1969, he published an account of the endemic corruption there which created a national scandal, and which was popularized in a fictional version by the film \"Brubaker\".\n\nTom Murton was born in 1928. His parents were E.T. Murton and Bessie Glass Stevens. He was married to Margaret E. Conway and had four children, Marquita (Marquita Schendal), Teresa (Teresa Kress), Melanie (Melanie Sandstrom) and Mark Murton.\n\nMurton died of cancer at the age of 62 on October 10, 1990, at a Veterans Affairs Hospital in Oklahoma City. Both of his parents and the four children survived him.\n\nBefore his career as a penologist, Murton attained a bachelor's degree in animal husbandry from Oklahoma State University in 1950. He earned a degree in mathematics at Fairbanks, Alaska between 1957 and 1958 with benefits under the GI bill. He enrolled in the University of California (Berkeley) in 1964 and completed a Master of Arts Degree in criminology and satisfied residency requirements for a doctorate in 1966. After he was dismissed from the Arkansas correctional system in 1968, he completed a doctoral degree in criminology at the University of California (Berkeley).\n\nAccording to his obituary in \"The New York Times\",\n\nMr. Murton's ideas on prison reform included treating prisoners with respect, abolishing corporal punishment, providing better food and rooting out extortion and other rackets among the inmates. Vehemently opposed to the death penalty, he dismantled the electric chair at Cummins. He also opposed life sentences. \"When you sentence a man to life in prison, with no chance of getting out, he's going to die one day at a time because he knows he's doomed to walk the halls of purgatory for as long as he's alive,\" he once told an interviewer.\nMurton had helped establish the correctional system of the new state of Alaska during the 1960s.\n\nHe was teaching at Southern Illinois University when he was hired to reform the Arkansas prison system in 1968. He wrote about his experiences there (with co-author Joe Hyams) in \"Accomplices to the Crime: The Arkansas Prison Scandal,\" published in 1969 by Grove Press. He was unable to find work in the correctional industry after that, and believed he had been blackballed for his work in Arkansas.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1979, he taught at the University of Minnesota. In 1980, he left teaching and returned to farming, raising wheat and ducks on his mother's farm in Deer Creek, Oklahoma, the community where he died, ten years later.\n\nIn 1976, he wrote his second book on penal reform, \"The Dilemma of Prison Reform,\" published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston.\n\nIn the 1960s, Arkansas maintained two large prison farms: the Tucker State Prison Farm and Cummins State Prison Farm. The farms used over a thousand inmates as forced labor to produce profits which annually \"averaged about $1,400,000 over the years...\".\n\nIn 1967, Arkansas inaugurated a new governor to follow Orval Faubus, who had held that office for twelve years (six terms). State Governor Winthrop Rockefeller released a report on the state prison system which had been ordered and then suppressed by Faubus. The 67-page report detailed horrific conditions at the two state penal farms, including endemic sexual assault, electrical torture, flogging, beatings with blackjacks and hoses, extortion of money from other inmates by the armed prisoners who were working as \"trusty\" guards (due to the absence of a salaried guard force), open marketing of illegal drugs and alcohol, and a host of other malicious and criminal practices. Particularly ironic, as well as harsh, was the poor quality and quantity of food given to the prisoners—on a farm which marketed enough produce and dairy products to produce profits that were averaging $1.4 million (US) in 1960s dollars (more than $ in current dollars).\n\nIn his own later writings about Tucker, Murton noted the cruelty of the \"trustees\":\n\nDiscipline was routinely enforced by flogging, beating with clubs, inserting of needles under fingernails, crushing of testicles with pliers, and the last word in torture devices: the \"Tucker telephone,\" an instrument used to send an electric current through genitals.\n\nIn 1967, along with releasing the Faubus report, Rockefeller sought to reform the system by bringing in Murton, who had made his reputation by helping establish the Alaskan correctional system after that territory achieved statehood in 1959. Murton, then 31 years old, was chosen to be the first professional penologist the state of Arkansas had ever hired as a warden.\n\nIn early February 1968, Murton ordered excavations on the grounds of the Cummins prison farm. Three bodies were uncovered before the excavation was halted, although 15 to 25 depressions were clearly visible. Murton's inmate informant told him that as many as 200 bodies had been buried there; also, the number of prisoners listed as \"escapees\" since 1915 was reported as \"more than 200\".\n\nAccording to the informant, Reuben Johnson, most of the men had been killed after refusing extortion demands from the \"trusty\" guards. Their deaths were either falsely recorded as successful escapes, or recorded as deaths, but under false pretenses. Johnson, a lifer, gave details of murders and burials on the prison grounds dating back for decades, including a mass murder of about 20 inmates around Labor Day of 1940. Johnson was backed up by at least one other inmate, James Wilson. Wilson also asserted that returning escapees were routinely murdered.\n\nThe Rockefeller administration, though not directly implicated in crimes which took place before 1967, was deeply embarrassed by the national attention drawn to the brutality Murton revealed. Claims were made that the bodies must have been from a nearby potters field, a cemetery for the poor. However, as \"Time\" noted in February 1968, the cemetery in question was over a mile away from where Murton found the bodies, at least one of which was positively identified as prisoner Joe Jackson, buried by Reuben Johnson on Christmas Eve, 1946.\n\nThe skeletons were turned over to another arm of state government, the University of Arkansas Medical Center. At the time, Governor Rockefeller stated his intention to withhold details of the investigation from the public until the Arkansas state police issued a report of their findings, incorporating the University's results. Rockefeller was quoted nationwide when he said that there could be no point in \"washing dirty linen for weeks on end as each body is dug up\".\n\nMurton's agitation eventually disrupted the Rockefeller administration to the extent that not only was he fired two months after the bodies were exhumed, he was told he had twenty-four hours to get out of the state, or be arrested for grave-robbing—a charge with a sentence of twenty-one years, under Arkansas law at that time. He left.\n\nMurton was dismissed in early spring 1968, less than a year after his 1967 hire. Governor Rockefeller claimed that Murton's excavations had become a \"sideshow\". The governor halted the excavations after the first three bodies were found. The official report by the Rockefeller administration, written by the Arkansas state police, took the position that the bodies must have been from the paupers' cemetery—although the cemetery was a mile away from where the bodies were located.\n\nMurton's book about the scandalous conditions was released the next year, 1969, and the Redford movie was released eleven years later, in 1980 (see \"Brubaker\").\n\nMurton's career as a correctional administrator was over. In 1982, Murton shared with students in a criminal justice graduate seminar course at the University of Central Oklahoma that he was \"blackballed\" by the \"correctional community\". To make a living, he started and maintained a duck farm north of Oklahoma City, where he lived until his death. Dr. William Parker, then department chair over the criminal justice program and subsequently the assistant dean, invited Murton to teach at the University of Central Oklahoma in the mid-1980s. He returned to academia for the next several years, including a short stint teaching criminology and corrections at Oklahoma State University in the mid-1980s. Murton continued to maintain his duck farm until his death in late 1990.\n\nThe book written by Murton and Hyams was published in 1969. In 1980, a fictionalized film treatment starring Robert Redford as \"Warden Henry Brubaker\" was released to wide acclaim, earning an Oscar nomination. Although the dramatic opening of the film, in which Brubaker impersonates an inmate in order to see the system literally \"from inside\" before taking up the warden's post, was a fabrication, much of the movie's drama was taken directly from the book.\n\nThe fabricated prisoner-impersonation device may have been inspired by Thomas Mott Osborne, a former warden at Sing Sing, who had had himself committed to Auburn Penitentiary in 1913 under an assumed name.\n\nIn 1968, the popular singer Bobby Darin wrote and recorded \"Long Line Rider\", a song which described the incident, on his album \"Bobby Darin Born Walden Robert Cassotto\". Some of its lyrics were: \"There's a farm in Arkansas, got some secrets in its floor, in decay, in decay. You can tell where they're at, nothing grows, the ground is flat, where they lay, where they lay.\" It also includes the line \"This kind of thing can't happen here, especially not in election year.\" Darin was due to perform the song on \"The Jackie Gleason Show\", but when they ordered him to cut that particular line, rather than censor himself, he walked off the set.\n\n\"Prisons, mental hospitals, and other institutions are a thermometer that measures the sickness of the larger society. The treatment society affords its outcasts reveals the way in which its members view one another—and themselves.\"—From the Preface of his book: \"Accomplices to the Crime\", 1969, Grove Press, Inc., New York.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "371457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371457", "title": "Tsonga language", "text": "Tsonga language\n\nTsonga () or Xitsonga ( \"Xitsonga\") is a southern African Bantu language spoken by the Tsonga people. It is mutually intelligible with Tswa and Ronga, and the name \"Tsonga\" is often used as a cover term for all three, also sometimes referred to as Tswa-Ronga. The Xitsonga language has been standardized for both academic and home use, making it the base language for the Tsonga people. Like with many other languages, there are various dialects within the Tsonga language group.\n\nThe Xitsonga language was studied in great detail by the Swiss missionary, Henri-Alexandre Junod between the year 1890 and 1920, who made the conclusion that the Xitsonga language (which he called the \"Thonga language\" at the time) began to develop in Mozambique even before the 1400s. In his own words, Junod states the following:\n\nFurther studies were carried out by Junod and other Swiss missionaries such as Henri Berthoud and Ernest Creux, who began to unify the language in order to have a standard way of writing and reading. \"Shigwamba\" was a term used by the missionaries in order to group the language under a unified identity, however the name was unfamiliar to many of the Tsonga people and had to be replaced with \"Thonga/Tsonga\". Harries makes reference to this:\n\nSwiss missionaries engaged with the Tsonga people and used their assistance to translate the Bible from English and Sesotho into the Tsonga language. Paul Berthoud published the first book in 1883 which came as a result of the help he received from the translations by Mpapele (Mbizana) or Mandlati (Zambiki). The two men were active in teaching and translating the language to the missionaries since none of the missionaries were familiar with it and had to dedicate a lot of their time to learn. The language of the Tsonga people and the dialects were put into print and the first books were published. The language was later on finally registered as “Xitsonga” within the Constitution of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) and it was declared an official language. The standardization of the Xitsonga language as a result made it possible for the Tsonga people to develop a common way of speaking and writing.\n\nThe name \"Tsonga\" is the root of Xitsonga (culture, language or ways of the Tsonga), Mutsonga (a Tsonga person), Vatsonga (Tsonga people), etc. In the language of the Vatsonga themselves, the root never appears by itself. It is Tsonga for the ease and accessibility of the wider international community.\n\nAs for the origins of the name, there are three theories. The first states that Tsonga is another pronunciation for Dzonga, which means \"South\" and also the name of one of the dialects of Xitsonga. The second theory is that it is an alternate spelling of the old ancestral name of the Chopi and Tembe groups, Tonga/Thonga. The other Zulu explanation for the alternative spelling of \"Thonga\" is that the Tembe and Rhonga people, who were the first to arrive at the Delagoa Bay and around the Natal Bay, transitioned the Rhonga \"Rh\" into the Zulu form of \"Th\". An example is rhuma (Tsonga word for \"send\") becomes thuma (Zulu word for the same action). The third and most accepted is that it is another pronunciation for \"Rhonga\", the root for the word \"vurhonga\" for east or the direction where the sun rises. Vurhonga also means dawn in Xitsonga. Rhonga (commonly and wrongly spelt as Ronga) is one of the Tsonga languages. The physical evidence of most Tsonga people residing along the eastern coast of Africa in the south, extending inland in a westward direction, makes this explanation especially inviting.\n\nMuch of the history about the Tsonga people had been overlooked and thus a lot of the history speaks about the aftermath of the mfecane where the Nguni people overran a lot of the pre-existing African tribes of South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. The 1800s was a period where a lot of the European writers were documenting a lot of the events that dominated in the Shaka Zulu era and the Tsonga history was largely overlooked in favor of Nguni conquests.\n\nTsonga people and languages are: Chopi, Gwamba, Ndau, Ronga, Tonga and Tswa.\n\nAmong these languages, three language groups can be identified. These are S50 (Tswa-Ronga group), S60 (Chope group), and Ndau language (S15), currently falling under the Shona group (S10). In total there are six recognised languages.\n\nChopi Group\n\nNdau Group\n\nTswa-Ronga Group\n\nSome dialects are subdialects but have been mentioned here for completeness. For example, Valoyi and Luleke comprise the N'walungu dialect. There is no Gwamba dialect as Gwamba is another name for Xitsonga itself. Formally Xitsonga has been called Gwamba. Tswa-Ronga dialects not considered part of the family include Pulana (Xipulana, Sepulane). What is commonly referred to as \"Shangana/Changana\" is not a recognized language in South Africa and is not a dialect that falls within the Xitsonga language group because its point of reference stems mainly from the use of the Nguni language and grammar. A dialect is when words all come from the same language group but are pronounced differently in speech and writing and therefore Nguni words cannot be used to impose an obscure view of dialects within the Xitsonga language group. Therefore, any reference to a Shangaan form of speech should be classified as a dialect belonging to the Lala, Zunda, and Ngoni language group.\n\nThere are only six (6) Thonga/Tsonga dialects which were identified by the dawn of the 1900s, which are named as xiRonga, xiHlanganu, xiBila, xiDjonga, xiN'walungu, xiHlengwe. All other variations within South Africa are sub-dialects of those identified. The dialects most spoken in the rural communities of Limpopo are the N'walungu, Bila, Hlengwe, and the Hlanganu dialects. The Xitsonga vocabulary and phonetic permutations are as well largely based on these dialects (compare with Junod 1912, p. 470-473)\n\nFor \"language of\", the various languages and dialects may use one or more of the prefixes: Bi-, Chi-, Ci-, Gi-, Ici-, Ki-, Ma-, Shee-, Shi-, Txi-, Va-, Wa-, and Xi-. For \"people of\", they use either \"Ba-\" or \"Va-\".\n\nTsonga is an official language in South Africa. It has been suggested to be made official in Zimbabwe according to the new constitution. All Tswa-Ronga languages are recognised in Mozambique. It is not official in Swaziland.\n\nTsonga has a distinction between modal and breathy voiced consonants: vs among the obstruents (the one exception being ), and vs among the sonorants (the one exception being ).\n\nMid vowels can vary from close-mid to open-mid. It also has a distinction between allophones of vowels ranging from oral to nasal (e.g. is an allophone of ).\n\nDifferent consonant sounds may alternate the place of articulation. The click consonant sounds may alternate from being dental to alveolar; to . A number of Tsonga speakers may alternate affricate sounds from alveolar to retroflex; to . Many consonants can be prenasalised as well. Labiodental and dental nasal consonants only occur in various consonant compounds.\n\nUnlike some of the Nguni languages, Tsonga has very few words with click consonants, and these vary in place between dental and postalveolar. Examples are: \nngqondo (mind), gqoka (wear/dress), guqa (kneel), riqingo (phone), qiqi (earring), qamba (compose), Mugqivela (Saturday).\n\nTsonga also has \"whistled\" sibilants similar to Shona \"sw/sv\", tsw/tsv\", \"dzw/dzv\".\n\nThe grammar is generally typical of Bantu languages with a subject–verb–object order. The structure changes to subject—object—verb when addressing another person:\n\nPresent tense\nThe present tense is formed by simply using the personal pronoun along with the verb.\nNdzi lava – I want money,\nHi tirha siku hinkwaro – We work all day,\nMi(u) lava mani? – Who are you looking for?\nU kota ku famba – S/He knows how to walk.\n\nPresent progressive\nGenerally, to indicate ongoing actions in the present one takes the personal pronoun, drops the 'i' and adds 'a'.\nNdzi nghena (e)ndlwini – I am entering the house,\nHa tirha sweswi – We are working right now,\nMa hemba – You(pl.) are lying,\nWa hemba – You(sing.) are lying,\nWa hemba – S/He is lying,\nWith the plural 'va'(they) there is no difference. Thus 'va hemba' = they lie AND they are lying.\n\nPast tense\nThis is for in one of three ways, depending on the word.\n(i) Generally, one drops the 'a' from the verb and adds the prefix '-ile' \nNdzi nghenile ndlwini – I entered the house,\nHi tirhile siku hinkwaro – We worked all day,\nU hembile – You lied,\nU hembile – S/He lied,\nVa hembile – They lied.\n\n(ii) With verbs that end with -ala, in the past change to -ele or -ale.\nku rivala – to forget,\nNdzi rivele – I Forgot, U rivele – you forgot, Va rivele – they forgot,\nKu nyamalala – To disappear,\nU nyamalarile – S/he – disappeared,\nWords used to describe a state of being also use the past tense.\nKu karhala – To be tired,\nNdzi karhele – I am tired, U karhele – S/He is tired, Va karhele – They are tired.\n\n(iii) In many cases merely changing the last 'a' in the verb to an 'e' indicates past action.\nKu fika – To arrive,\nU fike tolo – S/He arrived yesterday,\nNdzi fike tolo – I arrived yesterday,\nHi tirhe siku hinkwaro – We worked all day,\nNdzi nghene (e)ndlwini – I entered the house.\n\nFuture tense\nThis is formed by the adding 'ta' in between the personal pronoun and the verb.\nNdzi ta nghena (e)ndlwini – I will enter the house,\nHi ta tirha siku hinkwaro – We will work all day,\nVa ta tirha siku hinkwaro – They will work all day,\nMi ta tirha siku hinkwaro – You(pl.) will work all day.\n\nTsonga has several classes, much like other Bantu languages, which are learned through memorisation mostly. These are:\n\n\nPersonal pronouns in Tsonga are very similar to those of many other Bantu languages, with a few variations.\n\nThese may be classified as first person (the speaker), second person (the one spoken to), and third person (the one spoken about). They are also classified by grammatical number, i.e., singular and plural. There is no distinction between subject and object.\n\nEach pronoun has a corresponding concord or agreement morpheme.\n\nAll verbs have the prefix \"ku\" and end with an 'a' in the infinitive, with a couple of exceptions.\n\nThe main exception to this is the verb \"ku ri\" – \"to say\" It corresponds to \"ti\" in many other bantu languages. Examples of its usage include:\nu ri yini? – What do you say? (What are you saying?)\nndzi ri ka n'wina – I say to you all.\n\nIn many instances the \"ri\" is often omitted and thus \"ku\" on its own can also mean \"say\".\nVa ri ndza penga – They say I'm crazy.\nVa ri yini? – What do they say? (What are they saying?)\n\nLike many other languages, Xitsonga has many proverbs; these appear in different classes. They appear in a group of animals, trees and people.\n\nXitsonga, like many other African languages, have been influenced by various European colonial languages. Xitsonga includes words borrowed from English, Afrikaans, and Portuguese. Also, because of the influence of other more dominant neighbouring languages, Xitsonga has taken some words, especially click words, from isiZulu actually its (Nguni/ngoni).\n\nWords borrowed from English\n\nWords borrowed from Afrikaans\n\nWords borrowed from isiZulu:\n\nXitsonga uses the Latin alphabet. However, certain sounds are spelled using a combination of letters, which either do not exist in Indo-European languages, or may be meant to distinguish the language somewhat.\n\nAn example of this is the letter \"x\" taken from Portuguese orthography, which is pronounced . Therefore, the following words, [ʃuʃa], [ʃikolo], [ʃilo], are written in Tsonga as -xuxa, xikolo, and xilo.\n\nOther spelling differences include the letter \"c\", which is pronounced . However, where the emphasis of a word is on the following vowel the letter is hardened by adding \"h\" this the Tsonga word -chava(fear)\n\nA sound equivalent to the Welsh \"ll\" () is written \"hl\" in Tsonga, e.g. -hlangana(meet), -hlasela(attack), -hleka(laugh)\n\nA whistling sound common in the language is written \"sw\" or \"sv\" in Zimbabwean chishona. This sound actually belongs to the \"x-sw\" class within the language. E.g.:\n\nAnother whistling sound is spelled \"dy\" but has no English equivalent, the closest being the \"dr\" sound in the English word \"drive\"\n\nXitsonga has been standardised as a written language. However, there are many dialects within the language that may not pronounce words as written. For example, the Tsonga bible uses the word \"byela\"(tell), pronounced bwe-la, however a large group of speakers would say \"dzvela\" instead.\n\nThe Lord's Prayer as written in the Xitsonga Bible (Bibele)\n\n<poem>\nTata wa hina la nge matilweni,\nvito ra wena a ri hlawuriwe;\na ku te ku fuma ka wena;\nku rhandza ka wena a ku endliwe misaveni; \ntani hi loko ku endliwa matilweni;\nu hi nyika namuntlha vuswa bya hina\nbya siku rin'wana ni rin'wana;\nu hi rivalela swidyoho swa hina,\ntani hi loko na hina hi rivalela lava hi dyohelaka; \nu nga hi yisi emiringweni\nkambe u hi ponisa eka Lowo biha,\nhikuva ku fuma, ni matimba, ni ku twala i swa wena\nhi masiku ni masiku. \nAmen.\n</poem>\n\nThe \"sintu\" writing system, \"Isibheqe Sohlamvu/Ditema tsa Dinoko\", also known technically in Xitsonga as \"Xiyinhlanharhu xa Mipfawulo\", is used for all Xitsonga varieties. \nThe class 7/8 noun pairs above are represented as follows:\n\n"}
{"id": "258654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=258654", "title": "Turkmen language", "text": "Turkmen language\n\nTurkmen (; ) is an official language of Turkmenistan. It is a Turkic language spoken by 3.5 million people in Turkmenistan as well as by around 719,000 people in northeastern Iran. The group known as \"Iraqi Turkmen\" are actually speakers of South Azeri and not all tribes that are called \"Turkmen\" in northeastern Iran are speakers of Turkmen; many are speakers of Khorasani Turkic. and 1.5 million people in northwestern Afghanistan.\n\nTurkmen is a member of the East Oghuz branch of the Turkic family of languages; its closest relatives being Turkish and Azerbaijani, with which it shares a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility.\n\nTurkmen has vowel harmony, is agglutinative, and has no grammatical gender. Word order is subject–object–verb.\n\nWritten Turkmen today is based on the Teke (Tekke) dialect. The other dialects are Nohurly, Ýomud, Änewli, Hasarly, Nerezim, Gökleň, Salyr, Saryk, Ärsary and Çowdur. The Russian dialect is Trukhmen. The Teke dialect is sometimes (especially in Afghanistan) referred to as \"Chagatai\", but like all Turkmen dialects it reflects only a limited influence from classical Chagatai.\n\nOfficially, Turkmen is rendered in the “Täze Elipbiý”, or “New Alphabet”, which is based on the Latin alphabet. However, the old \"Soviet\" Cyrillic alphabet is still in wide use. Many political parties in opposition to the authoritarian rule of President Saparmurat Niyazov continued to use the Cyrillic alphabet on websites and publications, most likely to distance themselves from the alphabet that Niyazov created.\n\nBefore 1929, Turkmen was written in an Arabic alphabet. In 1929–1938 a Latin alphabet replaced it, and then the Cyrillic alphabet was used from 1938 to 1991. In 1991, the current Latin alphabet was introduced, although the transition to it has been rather slow. It used to use some unusual letters, such as the pound, dollar, yen, and cent signs, but these were replaced by more conventional letter symbols.\n\nThe following phonemes are present in the Turkmen language:\n\nTurkmen contains both short and long vowels. Doubling the duration of sound for a short vowel is generally how its long vowel counterpart is pronounced. Turkmen employs vowel harmony, a principle that is common in fellow Turkic languages. Vowels and their sounds are as follows:\n\nTurkmen consonant phonemes (shown with the letters of the Turkmen alphabet used to represent them):\nNote that s/с and z/з represent and , not and , a unique feature among the Turkic languages (cf. \"ceceo\" in some Spanish dialects).\n\nLike other Turkic languages, Turkmen is characterized by vowel harmony. In general, words of native origin consist either entirely of front vowels (inçe çekimli sesler) or entirely of back vowels (ýogyn çekimli sesler). Prefixes and suffixes reflect this harmony, taking different forms depending on the word to which they are attached.\n\nThe infinitive form of a verb determines whether it will follow a front vowel harmony or back vowel harmony. Words of foreign origin, mainly Russian, Persian, or Arabic, do not follow vowel harmony.\n\nVerbs are conjugated for singular and plural number and first, second, and third persons. There are 11 verb tenses: present comprehensive (long and short form), present perfect (regular and negative), future certain, future indefinite, conditional, past definite, obligatory, imperative, and intentional.\n\nThere are two types of verbs in Turkmen, distinguished by their infinitive forms: those ending in the suffix \"-mak\" and those ending in \"-mek\". -Mak verbs follow back vowel harmony, whereas -mek verbs follow front vowel harmony.\n\nEvidentiality of a reported event is determined by four markers, affixed to the finite verb, roughly:\n\n\nHere \"Y\" represents the close vowel conforming to vowel harmony.\nSome independent particles may be said to convey evidentiality: one such word is the particle \"eken\".\n\n\nOne way to express negation in Turkmen is with the predicative adjective ýok, which indicates absence.\n\nThe phonetically similar suffix -ok is another option: it attaches to the verb which it negates. It comes after the stem and before the tense suffix. -Ok does not modify its form due to vowel harmony. In addition to -ok there is another suffix -me or -ma. It appears -mV is used when dealing with one event, -ok for more habitual or lasting states:\n\nSpeakers of Eastern dialects of Turkmen, influenced by Uzbek, are less likely to utilize the -ok suffix.\n\nYet another way of expressing negation is by the negative particle däl.\n\nThere is not an equivalent in Turkmen to the English prefix 'un-'. That is, one can't simply attach an affix to a verb to indicate the opposite action, as in wrap the present → unwrap the present.\n\nIt appears that different tenses use different forms of negation, as in the following sentences:\n\nTurkmen has six cases: Accusative, Dative, Genitive, Instrumental, Locative, and Nominative.\nBack Vowels: The noun sygyr \"cow\" declined in the six Turkmen cases, with Jenneta's examples of how it would be used for each:\n\nFront Vowels: The proper noun Jeren (a woman's name) declined in the six Turkmen cases, with examples of how it would be used for each:\n\nSuffixes, or \"goşulmalar\", form a very important part of Turkmen. They can mark possession, or change a verb.\n\n\nSuffixes reflect vowel harmony.\n\nThe leading Turkmen poet is Magtymguly Pyragy, who wrote in the eighteenth century. His language represents a transitional stage between Chagatai and spoken Turkmen.\n\nNote: Numbers are formed identically to other Turkic languages, such as Turkish. So, eleven (11) is \"on bir\" (ten-one). Two thousand seventeen (2017) is \"iki müň on ýedi\" (two-thousand-ten-seven).\n\nMagtymguly's most famous poem among the 1.3 million Iranian Turkmen is \"Türkmeniň\" (of the Turkmen). The poem concerns the geography of the Turkmen people, and it sings praise for their culture. The poem became a rallying cry for Turkmen independence during the Iranian Revolution. The poem can be read aloud or sung in groups. The Iranian Turkmen dialect is closer to Turkish, so they refer to the poet as \"Mahtumkulu Firaki.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1078647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1078647", "title": "Utsul", "text": "Utsul\n\nThe Utsuls ([]; ) or Hainan Hui (), are a Chamic-speaking ethnic group which lives on the island of Hainan, and are considered one of the People's Republic of China's unrecognized ethnic groups. They are found on the southernmost tip of Hainan near the city of Sanya.\n\nThe Utsuls are thought to be descendants of Cham refugees who fled their homeland of Champa in what is now modern central Vietnam to escape the Vietnamese invasion. After the Vietnamese completed the conquest of Cham in 1471, sacking Vijaya, the last capital of the Cham kingdom, a Cham prince and some 1,000 followers moved to Hainan, where the Ming dynasty allowed them to set up a kingdom-in-exile. Several Chinese accounts record Cham arriving on Hainan even earlier, from 986, shortly after the Vietnamese captured the earlier Cham capital of Indrapura in 982, while other Cham refugees settled in Guangzhou.\n\nWhile most of the Chams who fled Champa went to neighbouring Cambodia, a small business class fled northwards. How they came to acquire the name Utsul is unknown.\n\nAlthough they are culturally distinct from other Hui people, the Chinese government places them as members of Hui nationality because of their Islam religion. From reports by Hans Stübel, the German ethnographer who made contact with them in the 1930s, however, their language is completely unrelated to any other language spoken in mainland China. About 3,500 of them are speakers of the Tsat language, which is one of the few Malayo-Polynesian languages that are tonal. Whereas other Hui people are Muslims who do not have a mother tongue or traditional ethnic language distinct from the Sinitic dialects, the Utsuls do have their own language, which is regarded as separate and distinct from Sinitic dialects. As a result, their classification as Hui people is controversial.\n\nDongna Li and Chuan-Chao Wang have typed paternal Y chromosome and maternal mitochondrial DNA markers in 102 Utsat people to gain a better understanding of the genetic history of this population. High frequencies of the Y chromosome haplogroup O1a*-M119 and mtDNA lineages D4, F2a, F1b, F1a1, B5a, M8a, M*, D5, and B4a exhibit a pattern similar to that seen in neighboring indigenous populations. Cluster analyses (principal component analyses and networks) of the Utsat, Cham, and other ethnic groups in East Asia indicate that the Utsat are much closer to the Hainan indigenous ethnic groups than to the Cham and other mainland southeast Asian populations. These findings suggest that the origins of the Utsat likely involved massive assimilation of indigenous ethnic groups. During the assimilation process, the language of Utsat has been structurally changed to a tonal language; their Islamic beliefs may have helped to keep their culture and self-identification.\n\nSome common Utsul family names include Chen, Ha, Hai, Jiang, Li, Liu and Pu.\n\n"}
